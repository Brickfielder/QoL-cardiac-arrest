AB  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a major global health 
      challenge with persistently low survival rates despite advances in resuscitation 
      science. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, management, and outcomes 
      of OHCA in Qatar using a national registry aligned with Utstein reporting 
      standards. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted across 
      Qatar, enrolling all adult patients (>/=18 years) with non-traumatic OHCA in whom 
      resuscitation was attempted by the national EMS provider. Data were collected 
      from EMS records, hospital EMRs, and mortuary databases. Survivors were followed 
      up at 30 days and 12 months for neurological and quality-of-life outcomes. The 
      primary outcome was 30-day survival with a favourable neurological status (CPC 
      1-2). RESULTS: Among 1238 OHCA cases, the median age was 52 years, and 80.5 % 
      were male. Arrests occurred predominantly at home (64.0 %), with 61.8 % witnessed 
      and 42.4 % receiving bystander CPR. Initial shockable rhythms were present in 
      29.7 %. ROSC was achieved in 44.8 %, survival to discharge was 17.8 %, and a 
      favourable neurological outcome at 30 days was 13.5 %. Multivariable analysis 
      identified witnessed arrest, prehospital defibrillation, and coronary reperfusion 
      within 24 h as independent predictors of survival. The Utstein comparator group 
      demonstrated a survival rate of 38.2 % and CPC 1-2 outcome in 32.8 % of cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: OHCA outcomes in Qatar have improved markedly, with survival and CPC 
      1-2 rates more than doubling compared with prior national estimates. Survival now 
      approaches levels seen in high-performing international systems, although within 
      a younger patient population. Consistent predictors of outcome-including 
      witnessed arrest, early defibrillation, and timely coronary reperfusion-emphasise 
      the critical targets for strengthening OHCA systems of care.

TI  - CARDIS (Cardiac ARrest DIgital Support): study protocol for a randomised 
      controlled trial of a web-based support intervention for cardiac arrest 
      survivors.
PG  - 101235
LID - 10.1016/j.resplu.2026.101235 [doi]
LID - 101235
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surviving sudden cardiac arrest often lead to long-term cognitive, 
      emotional, and physical consequences. Although clinical guidelines recommend 
      structured post-cardiac arrest follow-up, such follow-up is often lacking or 
      inconsistent. Tailored digital interventions are scarce but may help address gaps 
      in follow-up resources. The CARDIS trial evaluates the effects on 
      patient-reported outcome measures of a co-created, web-based support programme 
      designed to improve wellbeing, self management, and reintegration into everyday 
      life for cardiac arrest survivors. METHODS: CARDIS is a multicentre, 
      parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling cardiac arrest survivors 
      aged >18 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. 
      Both groups will receive standard post-cardiac arrest care, including a routine 
      followup visit with screening and management of cognitive, physical and emotional 
      health, as well as a printed booklet. The intervention group will additionally 
      receive access to a webbased selfguided support programme for 3 months. After 
      study completion, control participants will be offered the programme. OUTCOMES: 
      Primary outcome is overall wellbeing and health (QWB) at 3 months. Secondary 
      outcomes include self-reported cognitive problems, HRQoL, life satisfaction, 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, fatigue, and sleep 
      disturbances. A process evaluation will evaluate social selection bias, adherence 
      and participants experiences. DISCUSSION: The CARDIS trial will investigate the 
      use of more accessible and standardised follow-up pathways by complementing 
      existing care structures, thereby enhancing equity in long-term recovery and 
      quality-of-life without requiring additional healthcare resources. The process 
      evaluation will provide data on adherence, social selection, and engagement, 
      essential for future implementation.Trial registration: The trial is registered 
      at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07240714).

AB  - AIM: To explore the construct validity of the 'Experience in Close Relationships 
      - Relationship Structures'-questionnaire (ECR-RS) in a population of 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Objectives were to (i) describe 
      item- and scale-level response patterns, and (ii) evaluate the preliminary 
      construct validity of the ECR-RS, including its dimensional (structural), 
      known-groups, and convergent validity. METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional 
      validation study, with OHCA survivors completing the ECR-RS, Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale (HADS), and the mental health component from the Short Form-12 
      (SF-12 MCS) three months post- arrest. Descriptive statistics and floor/ceiling 
      analyses were performed. Dimensional validity was assessed using response 
      distribution patterns and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by 
      reliability using Cronbach's alphas. Known-group validity was tested using a priori 
      hypotheses, Spearman's correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Convergent 
      validity was evaluated by correlating ECR-RS total scores with HADS and SF-12 
      MCS. RESULTS: Among 123 survivors (median age 59.9 years, 84 % male), ECR-RS 
      total scores were low on both subscales and floor effects were observed at scale 
      level (31 % for avoidant and 72 % for anxious attachment). EFA supported the 
      expected two-factor structure, though item 4-6 showed poor 
      loadings/cross-loadings. Internal consistency was acceptable (total scale 
      Cronbach's alpha = 0.88) and improved when problematic items were excluded. 
      Known-group hypotheses were not supported. Anxious attachment correlated 
      moderately with symptoms of anxiety and depression and was inversely correlated 
      with mental health scores. CONCLUSION: The ECR-RS demonstrated partial construct 
      validity among OHCA survivors, but item-level inconsistencies and pronounced 
      floor effects limit its utility. Findings highlight the need for a revised 
      instrument better suited to post-cardiac arrest relational and psychological 
      dynamics.

LID - e2552832
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) follow-up can increase 
      knowledge of cardiac arrest outcomes from the patient's perspective. Whether 
      HRQOL affects long-term survival is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether 
      HRQOL 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is associated with long-term survival. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study linked 5 national registers 
      with nationwide coverage in Sweden across a 7-year period and included survivors 
      of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
      between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, with follow-up through June 30, 
      2021. Participants were adults surviving at least 90 days after IHCA or OHCA who 
      completed follow-up EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaires. 
      Analyses were performed December 2 to 20, 2024. EXPOSURES: EQ-5D-5L level sum 
      score (LSS; sum of EQ-5D-5L dimensions, ranging from 5 [no problems] to 25 
      [extreme problems in all dimensions]), and the visual analog scale EQ VAS, 3 to 6 
      months after cardiac arrest. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Long-term survival up to 
      a maximum of 7 years among patients surviving IHCA and OHCA. RESULTS: In total, 
      2000 survivors of IHCA (median [IQR] age, 73 [65-80] years, 66% male) and 1108 
      survivors of OHCA (median [IQR] age, 69 [59-75] years, 77% male) were included. 
      There were 475 deaths among patients with IHCA and 132 deaths among patients with 
      OHCA. For patients with IHCA, the LSS distribution was 394 (20%) for LSS 5, 1034 
      (52%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 572 (29%) for LSS 11 to 25. For patients with OHCA, 
      the LSS distribution was 299 (27%) for LSS 5, 637 (58%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 168 
      (15%) for LSS 11 to 25. In the IHCA population, LSS 11 to 25 had higher hazard of 
      death compared with LSS 5 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.50 [95% CI, 
      1.82-3.43]), whereas LSS 6 to 10 did not (AHR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.88-1.65]). In 
      OHCA, no associations were found between LSS categories and long-term survival 
      (LSS 11-25 vs LSS 5: AHR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.83-2.42]; LSS 6-10 vs LSS 5: AHR, 0.88 
      [95% CI, 0.56-1.39]). In both IHCA and OHCA, spline modeling using LSS and EQ VAS 
      as continuous variables showed significant increases in hazards of death with 
      poorer HRQOL, although the estimates in the OHCA population showed greater 
      uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients who 
      survived beyond 90 days after IHCA or OHCA, poorer HRQOL reported with EQ-5D-5L 
      scores 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest was associated with reduced long-term 
      survival in both groups, with greater uncertainty for OHCA estimates. HRQOL 
      assessment may help guide follow-up care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors and co-survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
      experience disruptions in returning to normality. There is limited understanding 
      of OHCA-related sequelae and their impact on co-survivors. This study describes 
      the 3-month post-discharge health outcomes among OHCA survivors and co-survivors 
      in the Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS). METHODS: We 
      conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study, enrolling subjects from 1 
      February 2023 to 30 November 2024. Physical, psychological, cognitive, and social 
      health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and caregiver burden were 
      described separately for survivors and co-survivors. HRQoL of survivors and 
      co-survivors was compared against age-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted Singapore 
      population norm for EQ-5D-5L. RESULTS: 62 survivors and 36 co-survivors completed 
      3-month assessments. 9.7 %, 6.5 %, 3.6 % of survivors screened positive for 
      anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. 
      Survivors experienced mild cognitive impairment (43.1 %), impaired mobility 
      (41.1 %), and weak muscle strength (39.7 %). Functional independence was high, 
      and 73.9 % of survivors returned to employment. Survivors' HRQoL was lower 
      compared to the general population (0.90 vs. 0.96). Co-survivors reported 
      experiencing caregiving burden (41.7 %), with 22.2 %, 11.1 % and 6.1 % screening 
      positive for anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. Co-survivors' HRQoL was 
      comparable to the general population (0.94 vs. 0.94). CONCLUSION: A significant 
      subset of OHCA survivors experienced limitations in physical and cognitive 
      functioning and return to work, and lower HRQoL. Psychological distress and 
      caregiving burden were high among co-survivors. Our findings underscore the 
      importance of systematic assessments of multi-dimensional aspects of health and 
      referral to multi-component rehabilitation for both survivors and co-survivors.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a low-volume whole nation cardiothoracic 
      centre: short- and long-term mortality, survivors; quality of life and symptoms 
      of post-traumatic stress disorder.
LID - 10.1186/s13019-025-03701-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For over three decades ECMO-treatment has been provided in our 
      low-volume nationwide cardiothoracic centre in Iceland. This research aims to 
      examine both the short- and long-term results of all adult ECMO-cases at our 
      centre, including health-related quality of life (HrQoL), return to work status 
      and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: A retrospective 
      study including all adult patients treated with ECMO in a single university 
      cardiothoracic centre in Iceland between 2002 and 2022. Five-year survival was 
      evaluated with Kaplan-Meier estimates, HrQoL with the EQ-5D-5 L instrument and 
      PTSD with the LEC and PLC-5 check lists assessing traumatic life events and PTSD 
      symptoms, respectively. Median follow-up time was 6.5 yrs. RESULTS: Ninety-three 
      patients received ECMO during the study period, an average of 5.2 patients per 
      year since 2006. Sixty-six patients received venoarterial (VA) ECMO, of whom 28 
      (42%) could be weaned and 21 (32%) survived to discharge. Twenty-seven patients 
      received venovenous (VV) ECMO, with 18 (67%) surviving to discharge. Twenty-four 
      out of 30 living patients completed follow-up questionnaires. No problems with an 
      EQ-5D-5L domain was reported 21 times in the VA ECMO group and 33 times in the VV 
      ECMO group. Three out of four patients reported problems with anxiety or 
      depression. Six patients (25%) met screening criteria for PTSD. At the end of 
      follow-up, 2/12 VA ECMO and 8/12 VV ECMO patients had returned to work . 
      CONCLUSIONS: ECMO treatment can be provided with acceptable short- and long-term 
      mortality in a low-volume centre. Nonetheless, opportunities for improvement 
      could be identified, particularly regarding VA ECMO in cardiac arrest. At 
      long-term follow-up, problems with anxiety and/or depression were most commonly 
      observed and 25% met screening criteria for PTSD. Most VA ECMO surviors did not 
      return to work.

TI  - Iranian Critical Care Nurses' Experiences With Slow Codes in the Absence of 
      Formal 'Do-Not-Resuscitate' Orders: A Qualitative Study.
PG  - e70224
LID - 10.1111/nicc.70224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death remains a critical global health issue, with 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation serving as a vital life-saving intervention. 
      However, ethical dilemmas emerge when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely 
      to benefit the patient, particularly in settings lacking formal 
      Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. This situation often leads to ambiguous practices such 
      as 'slow codes', raising complex challenges for critical care nurses involved in 
      end-of-life decision-making. AIM: This study aims to explore the experiences of 
      Iranian critical care nurses with slow code practices in the absence of formal 
      Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. STUDY DESIGN: This qualitative study employed 
      semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled nurses from diverse intensive 
      care units (medical, pulmonary, poisoning, surgical and cardiac) across three 
      teaching hospitals. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis 
      framework. RESULTS: Sixteen participants took part in the study. They had a mean 
      age of 36.8 years (SD = 5.9) and professional experience ranging from 6 to 
      23 years (M = 13 years), with 2-15 years in intensive care (M = 8.5 years). Most 
      were female (75%), married (75%) and held a bachelor's degree (68.8%). Six key 
      themes emerged influencing slow code practices: fear of litigation and criticism, 
      stretching and buying time, post-resuscitation care and quality of life, 
      opportunities for gaining resuscitation expertise, emotional struggles and moral 
      disengagement. These findings highlight the complex ethical and practical 
      dilemmas nurses face, where legal ambiguities and resource constraints 
      significantly affect end-of-life care decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses often 
      initiate slow codes due to fear of litigation and the desire to support families, 
      while confronting moral dilemmas and concerns about patient outcomes. These 
      findings highlight the urgent need for formal legal frameworks on 
      Do-Not-Resuscitate orders and enhanced nurse training to effectively address the 
      ethical complexities of end-of-life care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: 
      Resuscitation decisions must align with updated clinical guidelines, underscoring 
      the need for formal national and local frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders in 
      Iran. Legislation that reduces nurses' fear of litigation is essential to promote 
      confident, ethically grounded decision-making. Furthermore, enhancing healthcare 
      professionals' communication skills is critical to improving patients' and 
      families' understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - Association of Sepsis Survivor Subtypes With Long-Term Mortality and Disability 
      After Discharge: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 45-54
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006933 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determine if previously described sepsis survivor subtypes can be 
      applied outside of their derivation cohort using a parsimonious algorithm. Test 
      the association between subtype and the primary outcome of 3-month mortality, and 
      secondary outcomes of readmission, physical function, and health-related quality 
      of life through 1 year of follow-up. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 
      Participants enrolled in the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early 
      Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial, a multisite trial in the United States 
      that enrolled patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. PATIENTS: All 
      participants who were alive on day 28 after enrollment and had nonmissing data 
      for outcome and subtype-defining variables (Charlson Comorbidity Index, length of 
      stay, discharge destination). Participants were retrospectively assigned at time 
      of discharge to one of five previously derived survivor subtypes: low risk, 
      healthy with severe disease, multimorbidity, low functional status, and unhealthy 
      baseline with severe disease. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Of 1563 participants, 1368 were eligible and assigned a subtype. Three-month 
      mortality was 13.1% and varied significantly between subtypes (5.1-45.5%; p < 
      0.001). In age-adjusted logistic regression, odds ratios for 3-month mortality 
      were 11.1 in the low functional status and 9.7 in the unhealthy baseline with 
      severe illness subtypes, compared with the low-risk subtype ( p < 0.001). 
      Participant subtype was a significant predictor of 6- and 12-month EuroQol 5D 
      five level score and limitations in activities of daily living, but not 
      readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis survivor subtypes that are readily identifiable 
      at hospital discharge are significantly associated with mortality at 3 months, 
      and patient-important outcomes through 12 months. Using subtypes to predict a 
      patient's risk of adverse outcomes could aid the discharge planning and recovery 
      process.

TI  - Impact of frailty on mortality, functional outcome, and health status after 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: insights from the TTM2-trial.
PG  - 2367-2377
LID - 10.1007/s00134-025-08185-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the association of frailty with mortality, functional 
      outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: This is 
      a cohort-based secondary analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted 
      Normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial, an international, 
      prospective, multicentre study. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty 
      Scale (1-9): fit (1-3), prefrail (4), frail (5), and severely frail (6-9). Main 
      outcomes were mortality and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) 
      at 6 and 24 months. Additional outcomes included neuroprognostication, 
      withdrawal-of-life-sustaining-therapies (WLST), functional decline 
      (retrospectively reported pre-arrest versus 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale 
      Extended score), health status (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and life satisfaction at 6 and 
      24 months. RESULTS: Of 1861 participants, 240 (13%) were prefrail, and 188 (10%) 
      were frail or severely frail. Mortality and poor functional outcome increased 
      significantly with greater frailty. Compared to fit participants, adjusted ORs 
      (95% CI) for 6 month mortality were: prefrail 2.7 (1.8-3.8), frail 3.7 (1.9-7.1), 
      and severely frail 8.9 (4.2-18.7); and poor functional outcome: prefrail 2.9 
      (1.9-4.2), frail 3.9 (1.9-8.1), and severely frail 35.4 (8.4-148.8). Severely 
      frail participants underwent neuroprognostication less often (p < 0.001), while 
      WLST was more common in the prefrail, frail and severely frail (p < 0.001). 
      Prefrail and frail survivors tended to report more frequent functional decline 
      and lower health status, though with individual variation. CONCLUSION: Frailty 
      was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor 
      functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Findings suggest more 
      frequent functional decline and lower overall health status in frail survivors.

TI  - Neurologic Complications During Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation 
      and Their Implications for 6-Month Patient-Centered Outcomes.
PG  - 175-186
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006938 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is associated 
      with neurologic complications but their impact on long-term outcomes are poorly 
      understood. Our objective was to assess the association of neurologic 
      complications with death and new disability at 6 months. DESIGN: Prospective, 
      multicenter, observational study. SETTING: Thirty ECMO centers in Australia and 
      New Zealand between February 2019 and December 2022. SUBJECTS: seven hundred four 
      adult patients admitted to the ICU on venoarterial ECMO other than for 
      extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT 
      AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were divided according to whether they experienced 
      neurologic complications. Neurologic complications include diffuse cerebral 
      ischemia, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain death. The primary outcome was a 
      composite of death or new disability at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included 
      disability measured by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment 
      Schedule and quality of life measured with EuroQoL 5D five levels. The median age 
      of patients was 54.5 years (42-64 yr) and 259 (36.8%) were female. The primary 
      outcome was available for 613 of 706 patients (86.2%). Of these, 425 patients 
      (69.3%) had either died or had new disability at 6 months. Neurologic events 
      occurred in 85 patients (12%). Patients who experienced neurologic complications 
      were at increased risk of death or new disability (risk difference [RD], 17.28% 
      [6.44-25.92%]). This was primarily due to an increased risk of mortality RD, 
      23.75 (12.06-34.75) rather than new disability (RD, -11.90% [-30.58% to 13.56%]). 
      These findings were consistent across types of complications and after adjustment 
      for confounders. Patients with neurologic complications more commonly had ECMO 
      discontinued due to a perceived poor prognosis (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 
      1.35-24.7). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications during ECMO increased the risk 
      of death and disability at 6 months, primarily driven by increased death at 6 
      months. Prevention of these complications and development of better prognostic 
      tools for functional outcomes should be prioritized.

TI  - Management of Chronic Uncontrolled Diabetes With Ketoacidosis and Hyperosmolar 
      Hyperglycemic State.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to pose a significant global health burden. 
      Acute complications of diabetes are life-threatening conditions: diabetic 
      ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). DKA predominantly 
      affects young and type 1 diabetic patients. It is characterized by metabolic 
      acidosis and ketonemia. Older patients with type 2 diabetes are at a greater risk 
      of developing HHS, which is marked by profound hyperglycaemia and hyperosmolarity 
      without significant ketoacidosis. This review highlights the integrative approach 
      needed for effective management. Since both conditions share certain common 
      features, it is important to distinguish between them and initiate appropriate 
      treatment, including prompt fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte 
      correction. Identification and treatment of precipitating factors is vital. 
      Post-acute care strategies include medical stabilization as well as long-term 
      behavioral modifications, like structured diabetes education, psychosocial 
      support, and implementation of technology-driven interventions (continuous 
      glucose monitoring and telemedicine) to reduce recurrence. HHS has up to 20% 
      higher mortality due to delayed diagnosis and comorbidities, while DKA's acute 
      fatality remains comparatively lower at 1-5%. Therefore, early identification, 
      aggressive management, and coordinated long-term follow-up are essential. A shift 
      from episodic care to proactive, patient-centered disease management may 
      significantly improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals with chronic 
      diabetes.

TI  - Five Years After Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Prospective Cohort Study 
      of Health-Related Quality of Life and Patient Outcomes.
PG  - e2487-e2496
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006900 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report on 5-year survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 
      and occupational status of patients with respiratory or cardiac failure, who were 
      supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). DESIGN: A prospective 
      multicenter observational cohort follow-up study. SETTING: ICUs of ten ECMO 
      centers in the Netherlands, representing more than 90% of all patients supported 
      with ECMO in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Patients supported with ECMO between 
      August 2017 and July 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Survival was assessed by consulting the Dutch municipal records database. All 
      5-year survivors received a questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the 
      standardized EuroQol 5D Five Levels instrument, and occupational status was 
      assessed using the standardized Institute for Medical Technology Assessment 
      Productivity Cost Questionnaire. Of the initial 428 participants, 230 (54%) 
      survived the hospital admission, 213 (50%) survived the first year, and 155 (36%) 
      survived 5 years. Five-year survival rates were 42% for patients receiving ECMO 
      for respiratory support, 39% for cardiac support, and 25% for extracorporeal 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The response rate to the questionnaire was 72%. 
      HRQoL was rated satisfactory at 5 years, with a median EuroQol index of 0.82 
      (interquartile range, 0.73-0.98). Five-year survivors reported slight-to-moderate 
      impairment of mobility (39%), impairment of usual activities (44%), and pain or 
      discomfort (60%). After 5 years, the majority of patients were either employed 
      (41%), retired (31%), or permanently declared unfit for work (26%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Long-term outcome in patients supported with ECMO is good. Five-year survivors 
      reported that HRQoL was satisfactory despite some impairment in day-to-day 
      functioning.

TI  - Current Perspectives on Rehabilitation Following Return of Spontaneous 
      Circulation After Sudden Cardiac Arrest: A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13151865 [doi]
LID - 1865
AB  - Background/Objectives: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major global health 
      concern with high mortality despite advances in resuscitation techniques. 
      Achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) represents merely the initial 
      step in the extensive rehabilitation journey. This review highlights the critical 
      role of structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation following ROSC, emphasizing 
      the necessity of integrated physiotherapy, neurocognitive therapy, and 
      psychosocial support to enhance quality of life and societal reintegration in 
      survivors. Methods: This narrative review analyzed peer-reviewed literature from 
      2020-2025, sourced from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and 
      Google Scholar. Emphasis was on clinical trials, expert guidelines (e.g., 
      European Resuscitation Council 2021, American Heart Association 2020), and 
      high-impact journals, with systematic thematic analysis across rehabilitation 
      phases. Results: The review confirms rehabilitation as essential in addressing 
      Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness, cognitive impairment, and post-intensive 
      care syndrome. Early rehabilitation (0-7 days post-ROSC), focusing on 
      parameter-guided mobilization and cognitive stimulation, significantly improves 
      functional outcomes. Structured interdisciplinary interventions encompassing 
      cardiopulmonary, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains effectively mitigate 
      long-term disability, facilitating return to daily activities and employment. 
      However, access disparities and insufficient randomized controlled trials limit 
      evidence-based standardization. Discussion: Optimal recovery after SCA 
      necessitates early and continuous interdisciplinary engagement, tailored to 
      individual physiological and cognitive profiles. Persistent cognitive fatigue, 
      executive dysfunction, and emotional instability remain significant barriers, 
      underscoring the need for holistic and sustained rehabilitative approaches. 
      Conclusions: Comprehensive, individualized rehabilitation following cardiac 
      arrest is not supplementary but fundamental to meaningful recovery. Emphasizing 
      early mobilization, neurocognitive therapy, family involvement, and structured 
      social reintegration pathways is crucial. Addressing healthcare disparities and 
      investing in rigorous randomized trials are imperative to achieving standardized, 
      equitable, and outcome-oriented rehabilitation services globally.

TI  - Trauma resuscitation with Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood Or Products: study 
      protocol for a randomized clinical trial (the TROOP trial).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is the most common cause of potentially preventable death 
      after injury. Balanced transfusion with red blood cells, plasma, and platelets 
      (component therapy, CT) has been shown to reduce mortality, and is the standard 
      of care. Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) is an attractive alternative to 
      CT, but existing evidence comprises observational studies, and a small single 
      center pilot randomized controlled trial, which evaluated a type of whole blood 
      that is no longer in use. The aim of the "Trauma Resuscitation with Low-Titer 
      Group O Whole Blood Or Products" (TROOP) trial is to compare the effectiveness 
      and safety of LTOWB and CT in critically injured patients predicted to require a 
      large volume transfusion. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, multicenter, Bayesian, 
      sequential non-inferiority/superiority, randomized clinical trial, performed 
      within 15 level I trauma centers in the United States. We aim to randomize 1,100 
      injured patients to resuscitation with either CT or LTOWB. The primary outcome is 
      6-h mortality. Secondary outcomes include 24-h and 30-day or hospital mortality 
      (whichever is earlier); prespecified complications; adjudicated cause of death; 
      time to death; length of stay (ICU and hospital); and hospital-, ventilator- and 
      ICU-free days; the incidence of major surgical procedures; time to hemostasis in 
      those undergoing procedures with a hemostatic component; number and type of blood 
      products used until hemostasis is achieved (and randomized products are 
      discontinued), as well as after hemostasis has been achieved, to 24 h 
      post-admission; discharge destination and functional status and quality of life 
      at hospital discharge or 30 days, as measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and 
      EuroQol (EQ-5D) quality of life measurement. DISCUSSION: This large multicenter 
      clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of 
      Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients 
      predicted to require a large volume transfusion. Trial registration National

AB  - In septic shock, administration of large fluid volumes is associated with poor 
      outcomes. Recent evidence shows that non-resuscitation fluids are the major 
      modifiable source of fluids for patients with septic shock in intensive care 
      units (ICUs). This clinical trial is designed to test the hypothesis that 
      restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids improves outcomes compared 
      to usual care. Adult patients admitted to ICUs with septic shock will be randomly 
      assigned within 12 h of admission to receive protocolized restrictive 
      administration of non-resuscitation fluids or usual care. The primary outcome is 
      all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes are complications during ICU 
      stay up to 90 days (defined as any acute kidney injury or cerebral, coronary, 
      intestinal, or limb ischemia), mechanical ventilation free days within 90 days, 
      and for survivors cognitive function (by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      [MOCA-BLIND]) and Health-Related Quality of Life (by the EQ Visual Analogue Scale 
      [EQ-VAS]), both at 6 months. In addition, the climate impact of the interventions 
      will be assessed. To detect an absolute reduction in mortality of 7.5%, with an 
      alpha of 5% and a power of 90%, we aim to include 1850 patients. The trial is 
      approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Results of primary and 
      secondary clinical outcomes and the environmental outcome will be submitted for 
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial Registration: NCT06140147.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest survivors are at risk of long-term disturbances in 
      cognition, emotional distress, and health-related quality of life (QoL). Early 
      prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical 
      measures predict long-term outcomes. METHODS: In a longitudinal multicenter 
      cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after 
      cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. 
      These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and 
      health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects 
      models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for 
      cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26). RESULTS: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed 
      cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety 
      and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive 
      relation with twelve-month MoCA (beta = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for 
      early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 
      (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94). Early HADS was associated 
      with twelve-month HADS (beta = 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.60, p < 0.001), with age 
      negatively associated (beta = -0.10, 95 % CI: -0.18 to -0.02, p = 0.019). No other 
      significant relations were found. CONCLUSION: MoCA and HADS scores during 
      hospitalization relate to long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes after 
      cardiac arrest. These measures may help identify patients who could benefit from 
      cognitive rehabilitation or psychosocial support.

AB  - AIMS: Sex differences in survival and short-term outcomes after out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) are well documented, but its impact on long-term 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: This 
      cross-sectional survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), the 
      12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS) to assess HRQoL among adult OHCA survivors in Denmark between 2001 
      and 2019 who were alive as of 1 October 2020. Survivors were grouped by time 
      since cardiac arrest: 0-4, >4-8, >8-12, and >12 years post-arrest. Among 2552 
      respondents (56.1% response rate), 2075 were men (81.3%) and 477 were women 
      (18.7%). The mean survey age was 60.2 years (SD 14.7) for women and 66.0 years 
      (SD 11.8) for men. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and EuroQol Health Questionnaire 
      index scores were both lower for women than for men [69 vs. 75 and 0.76 (SD 0.21) 
      vs. 0.84 (SD 0.17), respectively; P < 0.001]. The SF-12 physical and mental 
      health scores were also lower for women [40.3 (SD 12.9) and 50.9 (SD 8.8)] 
      compared with men [44.0 (SD 12.1) and 53.3 (SD 8.1); P < 0.001]. Hospital Anxiety 
      and Depression Scale scores for anxiety (5.4 vs. 3.5; P < 0.001) and for 
      depression (4.0 vs. 3.2; P < 0.001) were higher among women. In multivariable 
      logistic regression, female sex remained significantly associated with poorer 
      long-term HRQoL outcomes. Trends remained consistent regardless of time since 
      cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION: Female OHCA survivors reported less favourable

PG  - 511-519
LID - 10.1093/ehjacc/zuaf093 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The TOMAHAWK trial compared immediate coronary angiography with a 
      delayed/selective strategy in 554 resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevations. Mortality did not differ 
      significantly between the two groups. In addition to survival, health-related 
      quality of life (HRQoL) is a key outcome parameter for OHCA patients. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: The analysis included 169 survivors from the TOMAHAWK trial who 
      completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up (6M-FU/12M-FU). HRQoL was 
      assessed using a questionnaire based on the EuroQoL-5D-3L. This tool includes a 
      visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best imaginable 
      subjective health) and a descriptive system with five dimensions: mobility, 
      self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No relevant 
      differences were found between patients in the immediate angiography group and 
      those in the delayed/selective angiography group regarding EQ-VAS scores at 6M-FU 
      (70 +/- 21 vs. 74 +/- 18) and 12M-FU (72 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 17). Patients reported the 
      most problems with usual activities (33% and 38%, respectively), and the fewest 
      limitations in self-care (18% and 17%, respectively) at 6M-FU. Women reported 
      more problems than men in all five dimensions. Elderly patients (>/=65 years) were 
      more likely than younger OHCA survivors to indicate limitations in mobility, 
      self-care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort. CONCLUSION: OHCA survivors of 
      the TOMAHAWK trial rated their HRQoL 6 and 12 months after the event as 
      relatively good, but there were notable differences between women and men and 
      between younger and elderly patients. The angiography strategy did not affect 
      HRQoL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02750462.

AB  - AIMS: Our aim was to investigate the psychometric properties of the health 
      assessment instrument EQ-5D-5L in OHCA survivors. METHODS: We included survivors 
      from the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) 
      trial, who completed EQ-5D-5L at 6 months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used 
      to evaluate the hypothesised unidimensional latent structure of EQ level sum 
      score (EQ LSS), summarizing scores across Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, 
      Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/depression. Differential item functioning was 
      evaluated for age. We examined internal consistency and precision for the EQ LSS. 
      We evaluated construct validity of EQ LSS, EQ value and EQ VAS, using the 
      modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, representing functional 
      outcome and cognitive function-two common health challenges experienced by OHCA 
      survivors. RESULTS: 783 of 939 (84%) eligible survivors were included. 
      Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit and strong factor loadings for 
      all dimensions (0.61-0.90). We observed a significant but negligible effect of 
      age on Mobility (beta = 0.29, p < 0.001, DeltaR(2) = 0.019). Internal consistency was 
      0.88. The floor effect was 35%. Survivors with more functional dependency and/or 
      cognitive problems reported significantly worse health by EQ LSS, EQ value, and 
      EQ VAS (all, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The psychometric properties of EQ LSS 
      support its use to measure health status in OHCA research. The strong association 
      between health and functional dependency indicate robust and comparable construct 
      validity for EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS in this sample.

TI  - The REVIVE Project: From Survival to Holistic Recovery-A Prospective Multicentric 
      Evaluation of Cognitive, Emotional, and Quality-of-Life Outcomes in 
      Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Most survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
      may suffer from cognitive, mental difficulties, and fatigue, which negatively 
      impact their quality of life, despite a good physical recovery. However, no 
      definitive data are available on this topic, so this study aims to assess the 
      feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional screening system for 
      OHCA survivors in Italy and the prevalence of these disorders. Methods: OHCA 
      survivors discharged with good neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance 
      Category (CPC) </= 2 and modified Ranking Scale (mRS) </= 3) from hospitals in the 
      "Lombardia CARe" registry will be evaluated by a clinical psychologist using the 
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      (HADS), EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised 
      (IES-R) at pre-discharge or within 15 days and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. 
      Patients with clinical issues will be referred for psychological support or to a 
      community rehabilitation program. Feasibility will be defined as a recruitment 
      rate >/= 80% and acceptability as a retention rate >/= 50% over 12 months. Results: 
      Based on historical data from the Lombardia CARe, an estimated 350 eligible 
      survivors are expected, which will allow estimation of a prevalence ranging 
      between 20% and 30% with 5% precision and 95% confidence. Conclusions: This study 
      will be the first in Italy to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 
      centralized, sub-regional system for pre-/post-discharge evaluation of cognitive 
      impairment, mental health, and quality of life in a large cohort of OHCA 
      survivors, documenting the prevalence of these disorders.

AB  - HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) presents a global health crisis, causing 
      significant AIDS-related deaths and over one million new infections annually. The 
      curbing of HIV is an intricate and continuously evolving domain, marked by 
      numerous challenges, including drug resistance and the absence of a significant 
      cure or vaccine because of its mutating ability and diverse antigens in its 
      envelope, prompting research for functional cures and long-term remission 
      strategies. The endeavor to devise an HIV vaccine capable of eliciting robust and 
      broadly cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses is a formidable 
      undertaking, primarily due to the pronounced genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1, the 
      variances observed in virus subtypes (clades) across distinct geographic regions, 
      and the polymorphic nature of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The viral envelope 
      protein (gp120) selectively interacts with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the 
      surface of target cells. It serves as the key initiator in the intricate viral 
      entry into host cells, rendering it a compelling candidate for vaccine 
      development. This study used bioinformatic tools to design a safe, 
      hypoallergenic, and non-toxic mRNA HIV-1 vaccine by assembling immunogenic B- and 
      T-cell epitopes from the gp120 protein. We identified antigenic, non-toxic, and 
      non-allergic B-cell epitopes (IEPLGIAPTRAKRRVVER) and T-cell epitopes (QQKVHALFY, 
      ITIGPGQVF, WQGVGQAMY, APTRAKRRV, KQQKVHALFYRLDIV, QQKVHALFYRLDIVQ, 
      QKVHALFYRLDIVQI, SLAEEEIIIRSENLT, and IRSENLTNNVKTIIV). For designing the mRNA 
      vaccine against HIV-1 gp120, we assembled the epitopes with 5' m7G cap, 5' UTR 
      (untranslated region), Kozak sequence, signal peptide (tPA), RpfE 
      (resuscitation-promoting factor E) adjuvant at N-terminal and MITD (MHC class I 
      trafficking domain) adjuvant, stop codon, 3' UTR, and 120-nucleotide long poly(A) 
      tail at the C-terminal with immunogenic robustness linkers. The mRNA vaccine is 
      translated into a protein-based vaccine by the host body's ribosomes. Their 
      comprehensive computational findings, including physicochemical, structural, and 
      3D refinement analyses, substantiated the stability and quality of the translated 
      vaccine. Molecular docking and simulation revealed a strong and stable binding 
      affinity of vaccine immunization with immune cells' pattern recognition receptors 
      (TLR4). Immune simulations demonstrated a potent primary immune response 
      characterized by a gradual increase in immunoglobulins and a corresponding 
      decline in antigen concentration. This bioinformatics-driven study presents a 
      promising HIV-1 mRNA vaccine candidate, underscoring the need for further 
      experimental validation through preclinical and clinical trials. At the same 
      time, its methodologies hold the potential for addressing other challenging 
      infectious diseases, thereby impacting vaccinology broadly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impact of V-A ECMO to treat cardiac arrest on quality of life is 
      unclear. a METHODS: In 2021, all patients treated in the intensive care unit 
      (ICU) of our tertiary university hospital for cardiac arrest requiring V-A ECMO 
      from 2006 to 2018, were contacted by mail and by phone in order to complete an 
      SF-36 form. Quality of life was then compared with reference values (patients 
      with cardiovascular diseases, patients with ischemic heart disease, ICU-survivor 
      patients at 36 months after discharge, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated 
      with V-A ECMO). RESULTS: Among 45 survivors, 25 patients completed the SF-36 form 
      with a mean time for assessing quality of life of 6.9 +/- 2.3 years. Sub-scores 
      were globally comparable with those observed in referent cohorts. DISCUSSION: 
      Cardiac arrest marks the beginning of a medical journey that includes intensive 
      care management and the onset of cardiac disease, often of ischemic origin. Our 
      data suggest that quality of life of patients treated with V-A ECMO for cardiac 
      arrest is comparable to those reported in referent cohorts (ICU-survivors, 
      patients with cardiovascular diseases of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac 
      arrest survivors not treated with mechanical circulatory support). CONCLUSION: 
      Survivor patients who experienced cardiac arrest and treated with V-A ECMO 
      presented a good long-term quality of life. Decision regarding V-A ECMO 
      implantation should not be limited by concerns about patients' future quality of 
      life.

      historically low survival rates. Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation 
      care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA 
      patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality 
      population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact 
      of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to 
      determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social 
      outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in 
      Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association 
      with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being. METHODS: The Quality Cardiac 
      Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based 
      cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants 
      aged >/=18 years and caregivers aged >/=21 years will be recruited from all public 
      hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, 
      and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist 
      for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, 
      Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental 
      Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, 
      and Zarit Burden Interview. DISCUSSION: This study allows us to understand the 
      natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and 
      their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk 
      patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA 
      sequelae.

TI  - Sedation, temperature and pressure after cardiac arrest and resuscitation-The 
      STEPCARE trial: A statistical analysis plan.
PG  - e70033

LID - e70033
AB  - BACKGROUND: Basic management for patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest and 
      are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after resuscitation includes setting 
      targets for blood pressure and managing sedation and temperature. However, 
      optimal targets and management are unknown. METHODS: The STEPCARE (Sedation, 
      Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation) trial is a 
      multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, factorial, superiority trial in which 
      sedation, temperature, and blood pressure strategies will be studied in three 
      separate comparisons (SED-CARE, TEMP-CARE, and MAP-CARE). The trial population 
      will be adults admitted to intensive care who are comatose after resuscitation 
      from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary outcome will be all-cause 
      mortality, and the secondary outcomes will be poor functional outcome (modified 
      Rankin Scale 4-6), Health-Related Quality of Life using EQ-VAS, and specific 
      serious adverse events in the intensive care unit predefined for each trial. All 
      outcomes will be assessed at 6 months after randomization. The prognosticators, 
      outcome assessors, statisticians, data managers, steering group, and manuscript 
      writers will be blinded to treatment allocation. This statistical analysis plan 
      includes a comprehensive description of the statistical analyses, handling of 
      missing data, and assessments of underlying statistical assumptions. Analyses 
      will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, that is, all 
      randomized participants with available data will be included. The analyses will 
      be performed independently by two statisticians following the present plan. 
      CONCLUSION: This statistical analysis plan describes the statistical analyses for 
      the STEPCARE trial in detail. The aim of this predefined statistical analysis 
      plan is to minimize the risk of analysis bias.

AB  - AIM: To compare the long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between 
      patients receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) and 
      conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest (OHCA). METHODS AND SETTINGS: A retrospective cohort study using the 
      Australian and New Zealand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EXCEL) registry 
      for ECPR cases and the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) for 
      CCPR cases. All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 
      12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for 
      inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12-month EuroQol five-dimension 
      (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS). RESULTS: 
      There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 
      12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data. 
      The ECPR cohort was younger [mean(SD) 50.4(13.46) vs 60.5(14.01) yrs, p < 0.01] 
      and more likely to have received bystander CPR [19(79%) ECPR vs 397(52%) CCPR, 
      p < 0.001]. Both cohorts had similar proportions of males, witnessed arrests and 
      initial shockable rhythms. Median (IQR) arrest to ROSC/ECMO time was longer in 
      ECPR than CCPR [61(41.5-97) vs 6(2-14) minutes, p < 0.001]. The median (IQR) 
      EQ-5D-5L utility score [0.95 (0.72-1) ECPR vs 0.96 (0.86-1) CCPR, p = 0.64] and 
      median (IQR) EQ-VAS at 12 months [80 (64.5-90) ECPR vs 75 (60-85) CCPR, p = 0.39] 
      were similar. There were no significant differences in the EQ-5D-5L utility 
      scores and EQ-VAS even after adjustment for baseline imbalances. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite significant baseline differences between ECPR and CCPR, there were no 
      differences in HRQoL at 12 months.

AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) poses a significant global health challenge and often results 
      in poor prognosis. We developed an interpretable and applicable machine learning 
      (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who survived more 
      than 72 h. A total of 721 patients were extracted from the Medical Information 
      Mart for Intensive Care IV database, divided into the training set (n = 576) and 
      the internal validation set (n = 145). The external validation set containing 856 
      cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang Province. The 
      primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms were utilized to 
      establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after return of spontaneous 
      circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost model exhibited the 
      best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately selected as key 
      features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a compact model. The 
      final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in the internal 
      validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation. SHAP summary plots 
      and force plots visually explained the predicted outcomes. In conclusion, 72-h 
      CatBoost showed promising performance in predicting in-hospital mortality of CA 
      patients who survived more than 72 h. The model still requires further 
      optimization and improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health issue, for 
      which rapid public access defibrillation (PAD) increases survival. OBJECTIVES: 
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate international legislation relating to 
      PAD and develop legal recommendations to improve PAD in OHCA. METHODS: Searches 
      covering 5 domains (automated external defibrillator [AED] provision, funding, 
      identification, maintenance, lay responder training) were conducted in 99 
      jurisdictions worldwide: United States (50) and Canada (13) analyzed at 
      state/province level; 36 other countries analyzed at national level. Forty-nine 
      legislation sources were searched from September 27, 2021, to May 5, 2022. 
      Legislative data were classified: Enabling Legislation (facilitating PAD) or 
      Disabling Legislation (hindering PAD). Based on retrieved data, recommendations 
      for international AED laws were developed. RESULTS: Searches identified 419,248 
      legal records. Enabling Legislation regarding AED provision in public areas was 
      present in 60% U.S. states, 8% Canadian provinces, and 22% of nations studied 
      from the rest of world. Disabling Legislation regarding registration of AEDs, 
      that could potentially discourage AED ownership, was found in 37 North American 
      jurisdictions. Enabling Legislation regarding AED signage was found in 66% U.S. 
      states and 39% of all jurisdictions worldwide. Overall, 48% of worldwide 
      jurisdictions studied had legislative requirements for AED maintenance, including 
      80% of all U.S. states. Internationally, 49.5% of jurisdictions studied had 
      Enabling Legislation mandating AED training, and 66% United States had this for 
      schools. Only 4 jurisdictions worldwide gave implicit authorization to laypersons 
      for AED use in emergencies. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variability in 
      international legislation relating to PAD. All countries should consider Enabling 
      Legislation that could decrease delays to PAD. Similarly, Disabling Legislation 
      potentially hindering prompt PAD during OHCA should be withdrawn.

TI  - Cardiac arrest survivors' self-reported cognitive function, and its association 
      with self-reported health status, psychological distress, and life satisfaction-a 
      Swedish nationwide registry study.

AB  - AIM: Self-reported cognitive function has been described as an important 
      complement to performance-based measurements but has seldom been investigated in 
      cardiac arrest (CA) survivors. Therefore, the aim was to describe self-reported 
      cognitive function and its association with health status, psychological 
      distress, and life satisfaction. METHODS: This study utilised data from the 
      Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (2018-2021), registered 
      3-6 months post-CA. Cognitive function was assessed by a single question: "How do 
      you experience your memory, concentration, and/or planning abilities today 
      compared to before the cardiac arrest?". Health status was measured using the EQ 
      VAS, psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 
      overall life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction checklist. Data were 
      analysed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 4026 identified 
      survivors, 1254 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.9 years 
      (SD = 13.4) and 31.7% were female. Self-reported cognitive function among 
      survivors was reported as: 'Much worse' by 3.1%, 'Worse' by 23.8%, 'Unchanged' by 
      68.3%, 'Better' by 3.3%, and 'Much better' by 1.5%. Declined cognitive function 
      was associated with lower health status (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 2.09-3.64), symptoms 
      of anxiety (OR = 3.84, 95% CI = 2.80-5.24) and depression (OR = 4.52, 95% 
      CI = 3.22-6.32), and being dissatisfied with overall life (OR = 2.74, 95% 
      CI = 2.11-3.54). These associations remained significant after age, sex, place of 
      CA, aetiology, initial rhythm, initial witnessed status, and cerebral performance 
      were controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors experiencing declined cognitive function 
      post-CA are at a higher risk of poorer health status, increased psychological 
      distress, and reduced life satisfaction, and these risks should be acknowledged 
      by healthcare professionals.

TI  - Evaluation of interventions in prehospital and in-hospital settings and outcomes 
      for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients meeting the termination of 
      resuscitation rule in Japan: A nationwide database study (The JAAM-OHCA 
      Registry).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health burden with 
      low survival rates. The termination of resuscitation (TOR) rule, widely adopted 
      internationally, aims to preserve dignity, optimize resources, and protect 
      healthcare providers. However, prehospital TOR is not implemented in Japan, 
      presenting legal and practical challenges. This study analyzes temporal trends in 
      prehospital and in-hospital interventions for OHCA patients with poor predicted 
      outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from the Japanese 
      Association for Acute Medicine Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (JAAM-OHCA) 
      registry (June 2014-December 2021). Adult OHCA patients with medical causes were 
      included if they fulfilled all the advanced life support (ALS) TOR rule criteria: 
      unwitnessed arrest, no return of spontaneous circulation, no bystander-initiated 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and no automated external defibrillator use or 
      defibrillation. Prehospital and in-hospital interventions were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Among 11,334 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 2,447 received all 
      three ALS interventions (advanced airway management, intravenous access, and 
      epinephrine administration). Over time, in-hospital interventions, including 
      endotracheal intubation (56%) and epinephrine administration (82%), decreased, 
      while advanced therapies, including coronary angiography, extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation, and targeted temperature management, remained rare (<1%). The median 
      time to TOR after hospital arrival shortened to 18 min. In contrast, prehospital 
      epinephrine administration increased, while advanced airway management and 
      intravenous access decreased. CONCLUSIONS: OHCA patients who met TOR rule showed 
      a decrease in in-hospital interventions. Further efforts are warranted to avoid 
      futile medical treatments and promote patient-centered care.

      registry data.
PG  - 279-285
LID - 10.1016/j.ccrj.2024.08.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the six-month functional outcomes of patients who received 
      extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) following in-hospital cardiac 
      arrest (IHCA) in Australia. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of EXCEL registry data. 
      SETTING: EXCEL is a high-quality, prospective, binational registry including 
      adult patients who receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 
      Australia and New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Patients reported to the EXCEL registry 
      who received ECPR following IHCA and had the six-month outcome data available 
      were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was functional outcome 
      at six months measured using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The secondary 
      outcomes included mortality, disability, health status, and complications. 
      RESULTS: Between 15th February 2019 and 31st August 2022, 113/1251 (9.0%) 
      patients in the registry received ECPR following IHCA (mean age 50.7 +/- 13.7 
      years; 79/113 (69.9%) male; 74/113 (65.5%) non-shockable rhythm). At 6 months, 
      37/113 (32.7%) patients were alive, most (27/34 [79.4%]) with a good functional 
      outcome (mRS 0-3). Patients had increased disability [WHODAS % Score 
      25.58 +/- 23.39% vs 6.45 +/- 12.32%; mean difference (MD) [95% (confidence interval) 
      CI] -19.13 (-28.49 to -9.77); p < 0.001] and worse health status [EuroQol 
      five-dimension, five-level (EQ-5D-5L) index value 0.73 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.14; MD 
      (95% CI) 0.17 (0.07 to 0.26); p = 0.003] at six months compared with the 
      baseline. The patients reported a median of 4.5 (2-6) complications at six-month 
      follow-up. CONCLUSION: One in three patients who received ECPR following IHCA 
      were alive at six months and most had a good functional outcome. However, 
      survivors reported higher levels of disability and a worse health status at six 
      months compared with the baseline and ongoing complications were common.

AB  - AIMS: To describe the level of physical activity 6 months after an 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and to explore potential risk factors of a 
      low level of physical activity. METHODS: Post-hoc analyses of the international 
      multicentre Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after 
      Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial. At 6 months, survivors at 61 sites 
      in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland were invited to a follow-up. The 
      participants answered two questions on self-reported physical activity. Answers 
      were categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of physical activity and 
      further dichotomized into a low versus moderate/high level of physical activity. 
      Potential risk factors for a low level of physical activity were collected and 
      investigated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: At 
      6 months, 807 of 939 (86%) OHCA survivors answered the two questions of physical 
      activity; 34% reported a low, 44% moderate and 22% high level of physical 
      activity. Obesity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.77, p = 0.018), mobility problems by 
      EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.06-2.84, p = 0.029), and 
      cognitive impairment by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 
      1.13-2.82, p = 0.013) were significantly associated with a low level of physical 
      activity in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: One third of the OHCA 
      survivors reported a low level of physical activity. Obesity, mobility problems, 
      and cognitive impairment were associated with a low level of physical activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prospective, trial-based data comparing health-related quality of 
      life (HRQoL) in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) through 
      extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) or conventional CPR (CCPR) 
      are scarce. We aimed to determine HRQoL during 1-year after refractory OHCA in 
      patients treated with ECPR and CCPR. METHODS: We present a secondary analysis of 
      the multicenter INCEPTION-trial, which studied the effectiveness of ECPR versus 
      CCPR in patients with refractory OHCA. HRQoL was prospectively assessed using the 
      EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Poor HRQoL was pragmatically defined as an EQ-5D-5L 
      health utility index (HUI) > 1 SD below the age-adjusted norm. We used mixed 
      linear models to assess the difference in HRQoL over time and univariable 
      analyses to assess factors potentially associated with poor HRQoL. RESULTS: A 
      total of 134 patients were enrolled, and hospital survival was 20% (27 patients). 
      EQ-5D-5L data were available for 25 patients (5 ECPR and 20 CCPR). One year after 
      OHCA, the estimated mean HUI was 0.73 (0.05) in all patients, 0.84 (0.12) in ECPR 
      survivors, and 0.71 (0.05) in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.31). Eight (32%) 
      survivors had a poor HRQoL. HRQoL was good in 17 (68%) patients, with 100% in 
      ECPR survivors versus 60% in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.14). CONCLUSION: One year 
      after refractory OHCA, 68% of the survivors had a good HRQoL. We found no 
      statistically significant difference in HRQoL one year after OHCA in patients 
      treated with ECPR compared to CCPR. However, numerical differences may be 
      clinically relevant in favor of ECPR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-shockable initial rhythm is a known risk factor for high 
      mortality at cardiac arrest (CA). However, knowledge on its association with 
      self-reported health in CA survivors is still incomplete. AIM: To examine the 
      associations between initial rhythm and self-reported health in CA survivors. 
      METHODS: This nationwide study used data from the Swedish Register for 
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 3-6 months post CA. Health status was measured 
      using EQ-5D-5L and psychological distress by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences in 
      self-reported health between groups of different initial rhythms. To control for 
      potential confounders, age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, witnessed status, time 
      to CPR, time to defibrillation, and neurological function were included as 
      covariates in multiple regression analyses for continuous and categorical 
      outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 1783 adult CA survivors. Overall, the CA 
      survivors reported good health status and symptoms of anxiety or depression were 
      uncommon (13.7% and 13.9% respectively). Survivors with PEA and asystole reported 
      significantly more problems in all dimensions of health status (p = 0.037 to 
      p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.034), and depression (p = 0.017) compared to VT/VF. 
      Overall, these differences did not remain in the adjusted regression analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Initial rhythm is not associated with self-reported health when 
      potential confounders are controlled. Initial rhythm seems to be an indicator of 
      unfavourable factors causing the arrest, or factors related to characteristics 
      and treatment. Therefore, initial rhythm may be used as a proxy for identifying 
      patients at risk for poor outcomes such as worse health status and psychological 
      distress.

      university center].
PG  - 454-461

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent 
      medical care and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given that 
      in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still poorly investigated, data on 
      health-associated quality of life thereafter remains scarce. The available 
      evidence is mostly transferred from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies, but 
      the epidemiology and determinants of success might be different. The aim of the 
      study was to investigate the change in the quality of life after in-hospital 
      cardiac arrest and to identify potential risk factors for a poor outcome. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis of data and prospective 
      evaluation of quality of life included all patients surviving an IHCA and being 
      treated by the emergency medical team between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint 
      of the study was the quality of life after IHCA at the reference date. Secondary 
      endpoints covered determination of risk factors and predictors of poor outcome 
      after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. RESULTS: In total 604 patients 
      were resuscitated within the period of 11 years and 61 (10%) patients survived 
      until the interview took place. Finally, 48 (79%) patients fulfilled the 
      inclusion criteria and 31 (65%) were included in the study. There was no 
      significant difference in the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest 
      (EQ-5D-5L utility 0.79 vs. 0.78, p = 0.567) and in the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue 
      scale (VAS) score. CONCLUSION: The quality of life before and after IHCA in 
      survivors was good and comparable. The quality of life was mostly affected by 
      reduced mobility and anxiety/depression. Future studies with larger patient 
      samples should focus on potentially modifiable factors that could prevent, warn, 
      and limit the consequences of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Moreover, research on 
      outcomes of IHCA should include available tools for the quality of life 
      assessment.

AB  - Patients discharged from intensive care are at risk for post-intensive care 
      syndrome (PICS), which consists of physical, psychological, and/or neurological 
      impairments. This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify 
      potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in 
      a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort 
      study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit 
      of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the 
      prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical 
      (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument 
      [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or 
      Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 
      cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) 
      had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the 
      physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients 
      (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate 
      analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), 
      duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 
      1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need 
      for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or 
      psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual 
      analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93). More than one-third of 
      cardiac arrest survivors experience symptoms of PICS 2 years after resuscitation, 
      with the highest impairment observed in the physical and psychological domains. 
      However, long-term survivors of cardiac arrest report intact health-related 
      quality of life when compared to the general population. Future research should 
      focus on appropriate prevention, screening, and treatment strategies for PICS in 
      cardiac arrest patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiac arrest (CA) is associated with high 
      morbidity and mortality. Many studies focus on survival, but few explore the 
      outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyze the survival curve, independence, 
      quality of life, and performance status after CA. METHODS: This retrospective 
      study included adults admitted to the intensive care unit of Cova da Beira 
      University Hospital Center after CA between 2015 and 2019. We analyzed patient 
      records and applied a questionnaire including EuroQoL's EQ-5D-3L and ECOG 
      performance status. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included (mean age 75.74 
      years). Thirty-one patients (32.0%) survived to hospital discharge. There was a 
      significant loss of independence for activities of daily living, with 50.0% of 
      those previously independent becoming dependent and 47.5% of those previously at 
      home being institutionalized. Diabetes, female gender, and length of hospital 
      stay were especially impactful on these findings. One year after CA, only 20.6% 
      were alive and only 13.4% (65% of the one-year survivors) were independent. Nine 
      patients answered our questionnaire. Mean EQ-5D quality of life index 
      (0.528+/-0.297) and the most affected domains ('Pain/discomfort' and 
      'Anxiety/depression') were similar to the Portuguese population aged >30 years. 
      However, 66.6% reported a decline in their quality of life. Lastly, seven 
      respondents had a good performance status (ECOG 0-1). CONCLUSIONS: There was a 
      significant loss of independence after CA. Moreover, despite the acceptable 
      performance status and the quality of life results being similar to the general 
      population, there was a perceived deterioration post-CA. Ultimately, we emphasize 
      the need to improve care for these patients.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs. 
      conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a 
      pre-planned, trial-based economic evaluation.
PG  - 484-492
LID - 10.1093/ehjacc/zuae050 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: When out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) becomes refractory, 
      extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a potential option to 
      restore circulation and improve the patient's outcome. However, ECPR requires 
      specific materials and highly skilled personnel, and it is unclear whether 
      increased survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) justify these 
      costs. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness study was part of the 
      INCEPTION study, a multi-centre, pragmatic randomized trial comparing 
      hospital-based ECPR to conventional CPR (CCPR) in patients with refractory OHCA 
      in 10 cardiosurgical centres in the Netherlands. We analysed healthcare costs in 
      the first year and measured HRQOL using the EQ-5D-5L at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. 
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-effectiveness planes, and 
      acceptability curves were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for 
      per-protocol and as-treated subgroups as well as imputed productivity loss in 
      deceased patients. In total, 132 patients were enrolled: 62 in the CCPR and 70 in 
      the ECPR group. The difference in mean costs after 1 year was euro5109 (95% 
      confidence interval -7264 to 15 764). Mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
      after 1 year was 0.15 in the ECPR group and 0.11 in the CCPR group, resulting in 
      an ICER of euro121 643 per additional QALY gained. The acceptability curve shows 
      that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80.000, the probability of ECPR being 
      cost-effective compared with CCPR is 36%. Sensitivity analysis showed increasing 
      ICER in the per-protocol and as-treated groups and lower probabilities of 
      acceptance. CONCLUSION: Hospital-based ECPR in refractory OHCA has a low 
      probability of being cost-effective in a trial-based economic evaluation.

AB  - AIM: To inform screening, referral and treatment initiatives, we tested the 
      hypothesis that emotional distress, social support, functional dependence, and 
      cognitive impairment within 72 hours prior to discharge predict readiness for 
      discharge in awake and alert cardiac arrest (CA) survivors. METHODS: This was a 
      secondary analysis of a prospective single-center cohort of CA survivors enrolled 
      between 4/2021 and 9/2022. We quantified emotional distress using the 
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety 
      and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social 
      Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and 
      cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our 
      primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for 
      Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the 
      independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge. 
      RESULTS: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard 
      deviation +/- 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social 
      support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted beta's 
      [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems should 
      consider implementing routine in-hospital screening for emotional distress, 
      social support, and functional dependence for CA survivors who are awake, alert 
      and approaching hospital discharge, and prioritize brief in hospital treatment or 
      post-discharge referrals.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest; a comparison of prehospital return-of-spontaneous circulation and 
      refractory arrest managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for selected 
      refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is increasingly used. Detailed 
      knowledge of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term cognitive 
      function is limited. HRQoL and cognitive function were assessed in ECPR-survivors 
      and OHCA-survivors with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation after 
      standard advanced cardiac life support (sACLS). METHODS: Fifteen ECPR-survivors 
      and 22 age-matched sACLS-survivors agreed to participate in this follow-up study. 
      Participants were examined with echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and 
      neuropsychological testing, and answered HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and Short Form 36 
      (SF-36)), and mental health questionnaires. RESULTS: Most patients were male 
      (73 % and 82 %) and median age at follow-up was similar between groups (55 years 
      and 60 years). Low flow time was significantly longer for ECPR-survivors (86 min 
      vs. 15 min) and lactate levels were significantly higher (14.1 mmol/l vs. 
      3.9 mmol/l). No between-group difference was found in physical function nor in 
      cognitive function with scores corresponding to the 23rd worst percentile of the 
      general population. SACLS-survivors had HRQoL on level with the Danish general 
      population while ECPR-survivors scored lower in both EQ-5D-5L (index score 0.73 
      vs. 0.86, p = 0.03, visual analog scale: 70 vs. 84, p = 0.04) and in multiple 
      SF-36 health domains (role physical, bodily pain, general health, and mental 
      health). CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantially longer low flow times with thrice as 
      high lactate levels, ECPR-survivors were similar in cognitive and physical 
      function compared to sACLS-survivors. Nonetheless, ECPR-survivors reported lower 
      HRQoL overall and related to mental health, pain management, and the perception 
      of limitations in physical role.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Self-perceived health status data is usually collected using 
      patient-reported outcome measures. Information from the patients' perspective is 
      one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed 
      to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with 
      data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing 
      characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population. 
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an 
      electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D-5L assesses 
      for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
      pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and 
      overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). 
      Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 
      (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from 
      controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared 
      with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 
      714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates 
      of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than 
      the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls 
      as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 +/- 0.24 vs 0.82 +/- 0.18), 
      and EQ VAS (69 +/- 21 vs 79 +/- 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian OHCA survivors reported poorer health than the general 
      population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L. PROMs use in this population can be used 
      to inform follow-up and health care delivery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Traumatic chest wall injuries are common however the incidence of 
      non-union rib fractures is unknown. Previous studies have suggested that surgical 
      management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures could be beneficial in selected 
      patients, although many experience persisting pain despite surgery. The aim of 
      this study is to investigate the long-term outcome after surgical management of 
      symptomatic non-union rib fractures. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study 
      including adults (>/=18 years) managed surgically for symptomatic non-union rib 
      fractures with plate fixation during the period 2010-2020 at Sahlgrenska 
      University Hospital. Patients operated for acute chest wall injury or injury due 
      to cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded. Patients answered standardized 
      questionnaires concerning remaining symptoms and satisfaction with surgery, 
      quality of life (QoL, EQ-5D-5 L) and disability (Disability Rating Index, DRI). 
      Lung function, movement of chest wall and thoracic spine, and shoulder function 
      (Bostrom index) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, 12 men and four women, 
      with mean age 61.6+/- 11.1 were included in the study. The mechanism of injury was 
      trauma in 10 patients and cough-induced injuries in five patients. Lung disease 
      was significantly more prevalent in cough-induced injuries compared to traumatic 
      injuries, 5 vs 1 (p = 0.008). The mean follow-up time was 3.5 years. Ninety-four 
      percent were satisfied with the surgery and reported that their symptoms had 
      decreased, although 69 % had remaining symptoms, especially pain, from the chest 
      wall. Quality of Life was decreased with EQ-5D-5 L index 0.819 (0.477-0.976) and 
      EQ-VAS 69 (10-100). Disability Rating Index was 31.5 (1.3-76.7) with problems 
      running, lifting heavy objects, and performing heavy work. Predicted lung 
      function was decreased with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) 86.2 +/- 14.2 %, Forced 
      Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) 79.1 +/- 10.7 % and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) 
      89.7 +/- 14.5 %. Patients with cough-induced injuries had full shoulder mobility. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Chest wall surgery for symptomatic non-union rib fractures results 
      in decreased symptoms and patient satisfaction in most cases despite remaining 
      symptoms, reduced lung function, chest wall movement, and QoL and persistent

AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury constitutes a significant contributor to 
      morbidity and mortality, leading to cognitive impairment and subsequent 
      disability. Individuals within this patient cohort grapple with uncertainty 
      regarding the potential advantages of extracorporeal life support (ECMO) 
      cannulation. This study elucidates the neurological outcomes and quality of life 
      of post-cardiac arrest patients who attained spontaneous circulation and 
      underwent ECMO cannulation. This is a retrospective case study within a local 
      context, the research involved 32 patients who received ECMO support following an 
      intrahospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An 
      additional 32 patients experienced cardiac arrest with ROSC before undergoing 
      cannulation. The average age was 41 years, with the primary causes of cardiac 
      arrest identified as acute coronary syndrome (46.8%), pulmonary thromboembolism 
      (21.88%), and hypoxemia (18.7%). The most prevalent arrest rhythm was asystole 
      (37.5%), followed by ventricular fibrillation (34.4%). The mean SOFA score was 7 
      points (IQR 6.5-9), APACHE II score was 12 (IQR 9-16), RESP score was -1 (IQR -1 
      to -4) in cases of respiratory ECMO, and SAVE score was -3 (IQR -5 to 2) in cases 
      of cardiac ECMO. Overall survival was 71%, and at 6 months, the Barthel score was 
      75 points, modified Rankin score was 2, cerebral performance categories score was 
      1, and the SF-12 had an average score of 30. Notably, there were no significant 
      associations between the time, cause, or rhythm of cardiac arrest and 
      neurological outcomes. Importantly, cardiac arrest is not a contraindication for 
      ECMO cannulation. A meticulous assessment of candidates who have achieved 
      spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, considering the absence of early 
      signs of poor neurological prognosis, is crucial in patient selection. Larger 
      prospective studies are warranted to validate and extend these findings.

TI  - Evaluation of Telephone Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Performance in Current 
      Practice in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 244-253
LID - 10.37616/2212-5043.1353 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health problem with 
      a low survival rate. Telephone cardiopulmonary resuscitation (T-CPR) guidance by 
      emergency medical services (EMS) dispatchers can improve CPR performance and, 
      consequently, survival rates. Accordingly, the American Heart Association (AHA) 
      has released performance standards for T-CPR in current practice to improve its 
      quality. However, no study has examined T-CPR performance in Saudi Arabia. 
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate T-CPR performance in the Saudi Arabian EMS 
      system. METHODS: A retrospective observation of OHCA calls in current practice 
      was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OHCA calls were reviewed to identify those 
      that met the selection criteria. Variables collected included return of 
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC), OHCA recognition rate, time from EMS call receipt 
      to location acquisition, to OHCA recognition and to commencement of CPR. RESULTS: 
      A total of 308 OHCA cases were reviewed, and 100 calls were included. ROSC was 
      identified in 10% of the included calls. OHCA was correctly recognized in 62% of 
      the calls. The time to OHCA identification and CPR performance from EMS call 
      receipt were found to be 303 s and 367 s, respectively. CONCLUSION: T-CPR 
      performance in Saudi Arabia is below AHA standards. However, this is similar to 
      what has been reported in the literature. Avoiding any unnecessary call transfer 
      during OHCA calls and prompt identification of callers' locations could improve 
      T-CPR performance.

AB  - AIM: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in young survivors of 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Norway with an age and sex-matched 
      reference population and to assess the associations between exercise volume prior 
      to OHCA and HRQoL after. METHODS: We present data from survivors aged 18-50 years 
      registered with OHCA in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry between January 1st 
      2015 and December 31st 2017. Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; 
      (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise 
      habits prior to OHCA. Respondents were randomly matched 1:1 for age and sex with 
      a reference population (data were available from the Norwegian Centre for 
      Research Data). RESULTS: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median 
      age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were 
      available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior 
      to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised 
      >/=5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly 
      (p < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical- and mental 
      health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise 
      regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting >/=5 hours of 
      exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less. CONCLUSION: 
      Poorer HRQoL in survivors compared to the reference population should prompt us 
      to explore how treatment and rehabilitation could be improved and adapted. More 
      exercise before OHCA favoured better HRQoL after, which aligns well with the 
      recognised positive association between HRQoL and physical activity in general.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Allocating resources to increase survival after cardiac arrest 
      requires survivors to have a good quality of life, but long-term data are 
      lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life of survivors of 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 12-Item 
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      (HADS) to assess the health-related quality of life of all adult survivors of 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry 
      between June 1, 2001, and August 31, 2019, who were alive in October 2020 
      (follow-up periods, 0-1, >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, >10-15, and >15-20 years 
      since arrest). The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 
      2021. EXPOSURE: All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
      MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol 
      Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical 
      and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were 
      measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. 
      RESULTS: Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median 
      follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable 
      between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 
      [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 
      1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest 
      follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ 
      index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all 
      responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 
      mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish 
      reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported 
      by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater 
      than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 
      79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life 
      was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of 
      survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related 
      quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and 
      comparable to that of the general population. These findings support resource 
      allocation and efforts targeted to increasing survival after out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest.

TI  - Is insomnia associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac 
      arrest survivors? A cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 100455
LID - 10.1016/j.resplu.2023.100455 [doi]
LID - 100455
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia symptoms seem to be common in cardiac arrest survivors but 
      their associations with important outcomes such as self-reported health and life 
      satisfaction have not previously been reported during the early post-event 
      period. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether symptoms of 
      insomnia are associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in 
      cardiac arrest survivors six months after the event. METHODS: This multicentre 
      cross-sectional survey included cardiac arrest survivors >/=18 years. Participants 
      were recruited six months after the event from five hospitals in southern Sweden, 
      and completed a questionnaire including the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale, 
      EQ-5D-5L, Health Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Satisfaction 
      With Life Scale. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, linear 
      regression, and ordinal logistic regression. The regression analyses were 
      adjusted for demographic and medical factors. RESULTS: In total, 212 survivors, 
      76.4% males, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD = 11.9) were included, and of 
      those, 20% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia was significantly associated with 
      all aspects of self-reported health (p < 0.01) and life satisfaction (p < 0.001), 
      except mobility (p = 0.093), self-care (p = 0.676), and usual activities 
      (p = 0.073). CONCLUSION: Insomnia plays a potentially important role for both 
      health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening for sleep 
      problems should be part of post cardiac arrest care and follow-up to identify 
      those in need of further medical examination and treatment.

TI  - Smartphone-Based Video Antenatal Preterm Birth Education: The Preemie Prep for 
      Parents Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 921-9
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.1586 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and child 
      morbidity. Preterm birth is not always unexpected, yet standard prenatal care 
      does not offer anticipatory education to parents at risk of delivering preterm, 
      which leaves parents unprepared to make health care choices during the pregnancy 
      that can improve survival and decrease morbidity in case of preterm birth. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) program on 
      maternal knowledge of preterm birth, preparation for decision-making, and 
      anxiety. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Recruitment for this randomized 
      clinical trial conducted at a US academic medical center took place from February 
      3, 2020, to April 12, 2021. A total of 120 pregnant persons with a risk factor 
      for preterm birth were enrolled between 16 and 21 weeks' gestational age and 
      followed up through pregnancy completion. INTERVENTION: Starting at 18 weeks' 
      gestational age, P3 program participants received links delivered via text 
      message to 51 gestational age-specific short animated videos. Control 
      participants received links to patient education webpages from the American 
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At 25 
      weeks' gestation, scores on the Parent Prematurity Knowledge Questionnaire 
      (scored as percent correct), Preparation for Decision Making Scale (scored 
      0-100), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      Anxiety computerized adaptive test. Analysis was based on an intention to treat. 
      RESULTS: A total of 120 pregnant participants (mean [SD] age, 32.5 [4.9] years) 
      were included in the study; 60 participants were randomized to each group. 
      Participants in the P3 group scored higher than those in the control group on 
      knowledge of long-term outcomes at 25 weeks (88.5% vs 73.2%; estimated 
      difference, 15.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.3-22.5 percentage points; 
      P < .001). Participants in the P3 group reported being significantly more 
      prepared than did participants in the control group for neonatal resuscitation 
      decision-making at 25 weeks (Preparation for Decision Making Scale score, 76.0 vs 
      52.3; difference, 23.7; 95% CI, 14.1-33.2). There was no difference between the 
      P3 group and the control group in anxiety at 25 weeks (mean [SE] PROMIS Anxiety 
      scores, 53.8 [1.1] vs 54.0 [1.1]; difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -3.2 to 2.9). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, pregnant persons 
      randomly assigned to the P3 program had more knowledge of core competencies and 
      were more prepared to make decisions that affect maternal and infant health, 
      without experiencing worse anxiety. Mobile antenatal preterm birth education may 
      provide a unique benefit to parents with preterm birth risk factors. TRIAL

TI  - Preliminary Exploration of Long-Term Patient Outcomes After Tracheostomy in 
      Burns: A Burn Model System Study.
PG  - 221-230

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Upper airway management is crucial to burn care. Endotracheal 
      intubation is often performed in the setting of inhalation injury, burns of the 
      face and neck, or large burns requiring significant resuscitation. Tracheostomy 
      may be necessary in patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support. This study 
      compares long-term, patient-reported outcomes in burn patients with and without 
      tracheostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Burn Model System Database, 
      collected from 2013 to 2020, were analyzed. Demographic and clinical data were 
      compared between those with and without tracheostomy. The following 
      patient-reported outcomes, collected at 6-, 12-, and 24-mo follow-up, were 
      analyzed: Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Satisfaction with Life, 
      Community Integration Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System 29-Item Profile Measure, employment status, and days to return 
      to work. Regression models and propensity-matched analyses were used to assess 
      the associations between tracheostomy and each outcome. RESULTS: Of 714 patients 
      included in this study, 5.5% received a tracheostomy. Mixed model regression 
      analyses demonstrated that only VR-12 Physical Component Summary scores at 24-mo 
      follow-up were significantly worse among those requiring tracheostomy. 
      Tracheostomy was not associated with VR-12 Mental Component Summary, Satisfaction 
      with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, or Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure scores. Likewise, 
      tracheostomy was not found to be independently associated with employment status 
      or days to return to work. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary exploration suggests 
      that physical and psychosocial recovery, as well as the ability to regain 
      employment, are no worse in burn patients requiring tracheostomy. Future 
      investigations of larger scale are still needed to assess center- and 
      provider-level influences, as well as the influences of various hallmarks of 
      injury severity. Nonetheless, this work should better inform goals of care 
      discussions with patients and families regarding the use of tracheostomy in burn 
      injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a critical need to identify factors that can prevent 
      emotional distress post-cardiac arrest (CA). CA survivors have previously 
      described benefitting from utilizing positive psychology constructs (mindfulness, 
      existential well-being, resilient coping, social support) to cope with distress. 
      Here, we explored associations between positive psychology factors and emotional 
      distress post-CA. METHODS: We recruited CA survivors treated from 4/2021-9/2022 
      at a single academic medical center. We assessed positive psychology factors 
      (mindfulness [Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised], existential 
      well-being [Meaning in Life Questionnaire Presence of Meaning subscale], 
      resilient coping [Brief Resilient Coping Scale], perceived social support 
      [ENRICHD Social Support Inventory]) and emotional distress (posttraumatic stress 
      [Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-5], anxiety and depression symptoms [PROMIS 
      Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a]) just before 
      discharge from the index hospitalization. We selected covariates for inclusion in 
      our multivariable models based on an association with any emotional distress 
      factor (p < 0.10). For our final, multivariable regression models, we 
      individually tested the independent association of each positive psychology 
      factor and emotional distress factor. RESULTS: We included 110 survivors (mean 
      age 59 years, 64% male, 88% non-Hispanic White, 48% low income); 36.4% of 
      survivors scored above the cut-off for at least one measure of emotional 
      distress. In separate adjusted models, each positive psychology factor was 
      independently associated with emotional distress (beta: -0.20 to -0.42, all 
      p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of mindfulness, existential well-being, 
      resilient coping, and perceived social support were each associated with less 
      emotional distress. Future intervention development studies should consider these 
      factors as potential treatment targets.

AB  - AIM: Rhythmic and periodic patterns (RPPs) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 
      comatose patients after cardiac arrest have been associated with high case 
      fatality rates. A good neurological outcome according to the Cerebral Performance 
      Categories (CPC) has been reported in up to 10% of cases. Data on cognitive, 
      emotional, and quality of life outcomes are lacking. We aimed to provide insight 
      into these outcomes at one-year follow-up. METHODS: We assessed outcome of 
      surviving comatose patients after cardiac arrest with RPPs included in the 
      'treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus after cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation' (TELSTAR) trial at one-year follow-up, including the CPC for 
      functional neurological outcome, a cognitive assessment, the hospital anxiety and 
      depression scale (HADS) for emotional outcomes, and the 36-item short-form health 
      survey (SF-36) for quality of life. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score 
      of more than 1.5 SD below the mean on >/= 2 (sub)tests within a cognitive domain. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included (median age 58 years, 21% female), of 
      whom 13 had a cognitive impairment. Eleven of 14 were impaired in memory, 9/14 in 
      executive functioning, and 7/14 in attention. The median scores on the HADS and 
      SF-36 were all worse than expected. Based on the CPC alone, 8/14 had a good 
      outcome (CPC 1-2). CONCLUSION: Nearly all cardiac arrest survivors with RPPs 
      during the comatose state have cognitive impairments at one-year follow-up. The 
      incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms seem relatively high and quality of 
      life relatively poor, despite 'good' outcomes according to the CPC.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to explore associations between comorbidities and 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) 
      survivors. METHODS: This registry study is based on data from the Swedish 
      Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (SRCR) collected during 2014-2017. 
      HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and 
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors 
      were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were 
      analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed 
      in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial 
      infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure. 
      RESULTS: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was 
      great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1-q3) = 70 (50-80). 
      Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 
      outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse 
      HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous 
      stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every 
      outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 
      4-8% of the total variance in HRQoL (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Since IHCA survivors 
      with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it 
      is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing 
      post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous 
      stroke.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
      survivors globally, the focus of OHCA management has now broadened to 
      survivorship. An outcome central to survivorship is health-related quality of 
      life (HRQoL). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to the 
      determinants of HRQoL of OHCA survivors. METHODS: We systematically searched 
      MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 15 August 2022 to identify studies 
      investigating the association of at least one determinant and HRQoL in adult OHCA 
      survivors. All articles were independently reviewed by two investigators. We 
      abstracted data pertaining to determinants and classified them using a 
      well-established HRQoL theoretical framework - the Wilson and Cleary (revised) 
      model. RESULTS: 31 articles assessing a total of 35 determinants were included. 
      Determinants were classified into the five domains in the HRQoL model. 26 studies 
      assessed determinants related to individual characteristics (n = 3), 12 studied 
      biological function (n = 7), nine studied symptoms (n = 3), 16 studied 
      functioning (n = 5), and 35 studied characteristics of the environment (n = 17). 
      In studies that included multivariable analyses, most reported that individual 
      characteristics (older age, female sex), symptoms (anxiety, depression), and 
      functioning (impaired neurocognitive function) were significantly associated with 
      poorer HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Individual characteristics, symptoms, and functioning 
      played significant roles in explaining the variability in HRQoL. Significant 
      non-modifiable determinants such as age and sex could be used to identify 
      populations at risk of poorer HRQoL, while significant modifiable determinants 
      such as psychological health and neurocognitive functioning could serve as 
      targets for post-discharge screening and rehabilitation plans. PROSPERO

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies on long-term outcomes after refractory out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) are 
      limited. This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, 
      functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. 
      METHODS: This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated 
      with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic 
      echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and 
      cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 
      and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was 
      defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2. Health-related quality of life was measured by 
      questionnaires (Short Form-36 (SF-36)). RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with 
      refractory OHCA were treated with MCS at Aarhus University Hospital between 2015 
      and 2019. The total low-flow time was median 105 min [IQR, 94-123] minutes. The 
      hospital discharge rate was 27%. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 years +/- 1.6 
      (range 2.8-6.1 years), 21 patients remained alive of whom 15 consented to 
      participate in the present study. Good neurological outcome with CPC 1-2 was 
      found in 93% (14/15) patients. No severe cognitive function was discovered; mean 
      MoCA score of 26.4 +/- 3.1. Functional capacity examined by CPX showed acceptable 
      VO2 max values (23.9 +/- 6.3 mL/kg/min). Mean SF-36 scores revealed an overall high 
      level of quality of life in long-term survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival 
      with a good neurological outcome with functional recovery was high in patients 
      with refractory OHCA treated with MCS. These patients may expect a reasonable 
      quality of life after discharge despite prolonged resuscitation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term functional and health-related quality-of-life 
      (HRQoL) outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors stratified 
      by initial defibrillation provider. METHODS: This retrospective study included 
      adult non-traumatic OHCA with initial shockable rhythms between 2010 and 2019. 
      Survivors at 12 months after arrest were invited to participate in structured 
      telephone interviews. Outcomes were identified using the Glasgow Outcome 
      Scale-Extended (GOS-E), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), 12-Item Short Form Health 
      Survey and living and work status-related questions. RESULTS: 6050 patients had 
      initial shockable rhythms, 3211 (53.1%) had a pulse on hospital arrival, while 
      1879 (31.1%) were discharged alive. Bystander defibrillation using the closest 
      automated external defibrillator had the highest survival rate (52.8%), followed 
      by dispatched first responders (36.7%) and paramedics (27.9%). 1802 (29.8%) 
      patients survived to 12-month postarrest; of these 1520 (84.4%) were interviewed. 
      1088 (71.6%) were initially shocked by paramedics, 271 (17.8%) by first 
      responders and 161 (10.6%) by bystanders. Bystander-shocked survivors reported 
      higher rates of living at home without care (87.5%, 75.2%, 77.0%, p<0.001), upper 
      good recovery (GOS-E=8) (41.7%, 30.4%, 30.6%, p=0.002) and EQ-5D visual analogue 
      scale (VAS) >/=80 (64.9%, 55.9%, 52.9%, p=0.003) compared with first responder and 
      paramedics, respectively. After adjustment, initial bystander defibrillation was 
      associated with higher odds of EQ-5D VAS >/=80 (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.56, 95% CI 
      1.15-2.10; p=0.004), good functional recovery (GOS-E >/=7) (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 
      1.12-2.11; p=0.009), living at home without care (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.16-2.71; 
      p=0.009) and returning to work (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.81; p=0.031) compared 
      with paramedic defibrillation. CONCLUSION: Survivors receiving initial bystander 
      defibrillation reported better functional and HRQoL outcomes at 12 months after 
      arrest compared with those initially defibrillated by paramedics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: So far, the few prospective studies on near-death experience (NDE) 
      were carried out only in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with homogeneous 
      aetiologies, such as cardiac arrest or trauma survivors. The aims of this 1-year 
      prospective and monocentric study were to investigate the incidence of NDE in ICU 
      survivors (all aetiologies) as well as factors that may affect its frequency, and 
      to assess quality of life up to 1 year after enrolment. METHODS: We enrolled 
      adults with a prolonged ICU stay (> 7 days). During the first 7 days after 
      discharge, all eligible patients were assessed in a face-to-face interview for 
      NDE using the Greyson NDE scale, dissociative experiences using the Dissociative 
      Experience Scale, and spirituality beliefs using the WHOQOL-SRPB. Medical 
      parameters were prospectively collected. At 1-year after inclusion, patients were 
      contacted by phone to measure quality of life using the EuroQol five-dimensional 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Out of the 126 included patients, 19 patients (15%) 
      reported having experienced a NDE as identified by the Greyson NDE scale (i.e. 
      cut-off score >/= 7/32). In univariate analyses, mechanical ventilation, sedation, 
      analgesia, reason for admission, primary organ dysfunction, dissociative and 
      spiritual propensities were associated with the emergence of NDE. In multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis, only the dissociative and spiritual propensity 
      strongly predicted the emergence of NDE. One year later (n = 61), the NDE was not 
      significantly associated with quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The recall of NDE is 
      not so rare in the ICU. In our cohort, cognitive and spiritual factors outweighed 
      medical parameters as predictors of the emergence of NDE. Trial registration This 
      trial was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov in February 2020 ( NCT04279171 ).

TI  - Outcomes after fixation of rib fractures sustained during cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation: A retrospective single center analysis.
PG  - 1120399
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2023.1120399 [doi]
LID - 1120399
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically rib fractures have been typically treated 
      non-operatively. Recent studies showed promising results after osteosynthesis of 
      rib fractures in trauma patients with flail segments or multiple rib fractures. 
      However, there is a paucity of data on rib fixation after cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR). This study evaluated the outcomes of patients who received 
      rib fixation after CPR. METHODS: Adult patients who received surgical fixation of 
      rib fractures sustained during CPR between 2010 and 2020 were eligible for 
      inclusion in this retrospective study. Outcome measures included complications, 
      quality of life (EQ 5D 5L) and level of dyspnea. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were 
      included with a mean age of 66.8 years. The mean number of fractured ribs was 
      ten, seven patients additionally had a sternum fracture. Pneumonia occurred in 15 
      patients (74%), of which 13 were diagnosed preoperatively and 2 post-operatively. 
      Six patients developed a postoperative pneumothorax, none of which required 
      revision surgery. One patient showed persistent flail chest after rib fixation 
      and required additional fixation of a concomitant sternum fracture. One infection 
      of the surgical site of sternal plate occurred, while no further surgery related 
      complications were reported. Mean EQ-5D-5L was 0.908 and the average EQ VAS was 
      80. One patient reported persisting dyspnea. CONCLUSION: To date, this is the 
      largest reported cohort of patients who received rib fixation for fractures 
      sustained during CPR. No complications associated with rib fixation were reported 
      whereas one infection after sternal fixation did occur. Current follow-up 
      demonstrated a good long-term quality of life after fixation, warranting further 
      studies on this topic. Deeper knowledge on this subject would be beneficial for a 
      wide spectrum of physicians.

TI  - Long-Term Survival and Quality of Life in Non-Surgical Adult Patients Supported 
      with Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Oxygenation.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11216452 [doi]
LID - 6452
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA 
      ECMO) for hemodynamic support is on the rise. Not much is known about the impact 
      of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its complications on long-term 
      survival and quality of life. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional 
      study, we evaluated the survival and quality of life in patients treated with VA 
      ECMO between May 2009 and July 2019. Follow-up was conducted between November 
      2019 and January 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 118 patients were evaluated in this 
      study. Of the 37 patients who were alive at hospital discharge, 32 answered the 
      EuroQol-5 dimensional-5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). For patients discharged 
      alive from the hospital, mean survival was 8.1 years, 8.4 years for cardiogenic 
      shock, and 5.0 years for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. EQ-5D-5L index 
      value of ECMO survivors was not significantly different from the general 
      age-matched population. Neurologic complications and major bleeding during index 
      hospitalization limit long-term quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain injury in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors 
      affects health status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is unknown 
      how HRQoL evolves over time, and assessments at different time points may lead to 
      different results. METHODS: In a NORCAST sub study, OHCA survivors eligible for 
      health status (EQ-5D-3L) and HRQoL (SF-36) assessments were examinated six months 
      and five years after OHCA. At five-year follow-up, survivors also retrospectively 
      assessed their health status for each consecutive year following OHCA. The next 
      of kin independently assessed health status and HRQoL of their respective OHCA 
      survivors. RESULTS: Among 138 survivors alive after six months and 117 after five 
      years, 80 (88% male) completed both follow-ups. Health status and HRQoL remained 
      stable over time, except for increasing SF-36 mental summary score and decreasing 
      physical functioning and physical component score. Anxiety and depression levels 
      were generally low, although younger survivors stated more anxiety than older 
      survivors. Retrospective assessment showed reduced health status for the first 
      two years, which increased only from the third year. Explorative analyses 
      revealed that younger age, longer time to return of spontaneous circulation 
      (tROSC) and late awakening affected health status, particularly in the first two 
      years post-arrest. CONCLUSIONS: OHCA survivors showed stable health status and 
      HRQoL with only minor differences between six months and five years. Younger 
      survivors with long tROSC, late awakening, and more anxiety and depression 
      symptoms at six months, had reduced health status the first two years with 
      significant improvements towards the fourth year.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) survivorship results in unique issues in 
      return to physical and psychological function. The purpose of the study was to 
      compare recovery across the first year between SCA survivors and other arrhythmia 
      patients who received a first-time implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) 
      for secondary prevention, participating in a social cognitive theory (SCT) 
      intervention. METHODS: 168 (129 males, 39 females) who received an ICD for 
      secondary prevention (SCA N = 65; other arrhythmia N = 103) were randomized to 
      one of two study conditions: SCT intervention (N = 85) or usual care (N = 83). 
      Outcomes were measured at baseline hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, & 12 months: (1) 
      Physical Function: Patient Concerns Assessment (PCA), SF-36 (PCS); (2) 
      Psychological Adjustment: State Trait Anxiety (STAI), CES-D depression, SF-36 
      (MCS); (3) Self-Efficacy: Self-Efficacy (SCA-SE), Self-management Behaviors 
      (SMB), Outcome Expectations (OE). Outcomes were compared over 12 months for 
      intervention condition x ICD indication using general estimating equations. 
      RESULTS: Participants were Caucasian (89%), mean age 63.95 +/- 12.3 years, EF% 
      33.95 +/- 13.9, BMI 28.19 +/- 6.2, and Charlson Index 4.27 +/- 2.3. Physical symptoms 
      (PCA) were higher over time for SCA survivors compared to the other arrhythmia 
      group (p = 0.04), ICD shocks were lower in SCA survivors in the SCT intervention 
      (p = 0.01); psychological adjustment (MCS) was significantly lower in SCA 
      survivors in the SCT intervention over 6 months, which improved at 12 months 
      (p = 0.05); outcome expectations (OE) were significantly lower for SCA survivors 
      in the SCT intervention (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: SCA survivors had greater 
      number of physical symptoms, lower levels of mental health and outcome 
      expectations over 12 months despite participation in a SCT intervention. Trial 
      registration Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04462887.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor 30-days survival after in-hospital 
      cardiac arrests (IHCA). The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was 
      associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported 
      outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA. METHODS: Patients aged >/= 65 years with 
      IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty 
      was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and 
      categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. 
      Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale 
      (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the 
      questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale. RESULTS: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 
      30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for 
      non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years 
      (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail 
      patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 
      85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better 
      health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, 
      p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, 
      respectively, p-value < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived 
      with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five 
      frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked 
      decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and 
      poorer general health.

AB  - AIM: Our aim was to determine the association of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
      (CPR) for in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) with quality of life after discharge. 
      METHODS: We performed a systematic review using available databases for studies 
      that measured any quality-of-life or functional outcome both before and after CPR 
      for IHCA. All screening and data abstraction was performed in duplicate. RESULTS: 
      We screened 10,927 records and included 24 papers representing 20 unique studies. 
      Fifteen studies measured Cerebral Performance Category. Survival ranged from 
      11.8% to 39.5%. The risk of impaired cerebral function after discharged ranged 
      from -16.1% (lower risk) to 44.7% increased risk of poor cerebral function after 
      surviving to discharge. Four studies measured discharge to an institutional 
      environment finding that the risk was increased by 18.2-72.2% among survivors. 
      One study measured EQ-5D and found no difference pre and post CPR. One study 
      measured performance of activities of daily living finding that survivors needed 
      assistance with more activities after discharge. CONCLUSION: Our review is 
      limited by the lack of adjustment for confounders, including the baseline level 
      of each outcome, in all included studies. Therefore, although risk for most 
      outcomes was increased after discharge vs pre-admission we cannot be certain if 
      this is a causal relationship.

TI  - One-Year Follow-Up of Patients Admitted for Emergency Coronary Angiography after 
      Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest.

LID - 3738
AB  - (1) Background: Despite the improvement of the in-hospital survival rate after 
      aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD), cerebral anoxia may have severe neurologic 
      consequences and may impair long-term outcome and quality of life of surviving 
      patients. The aim of this study was to assess neurological outcomes at one year 
      after resuscitated cardiac arrest; (2) Methods: This prospective, observational, 
      and multicentre study included patients >18 yo admitted in the catheterisation 
      laboratory for coronary angiography after aborted SCD between 1 May 2018 and 31 
      May 2020. Only patients who were discharged alive from hospital were evaluated. 
      The primary endpoint was survival without neurological sequelae at one-year 
      follow-up defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) of one or two. 
      Secondary end points included all-cause mortality, New York Heart Association 
      (NYHA) functional class, neurologic evaluation at discharge, three-month and 
      one-year follow-up using the CPC scale, and quality of life at 1 year using the 
      Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) questionnaire; (3) Results: Among 
      143 patients admitted for SCD within the study period, 61 (42.7%) were discharged 
      alive from hospital, among whom 55 (90.1%) completed the one-year follow-up. No 
      flow and low flow times were 1.9 +/- 2.4 min and 16.5 +/- 10.4 min, respectively. For 
      93.4% of the surviving patients, an initial shockable rhythm (n = 57) was 
      observed and acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed in 75.4% of them (n = 46). At 
      1 year, survival rate without neurologic sequelae was 87.2% (n = 48). Patients 
      with poor outcome were older (69.3 vs. 57.4 yo; p = 0.04) and had lower body mass 
      index (22.4 vs. 26.7; p = 0.013) and a lower initial Left Ventricle Ejection 
      Fraction (LVEF) (32.1% vs. 40.3%; p = 0.046). During follow-up, neurological 
      status improved in 36.8% of patients presenting sequelae at discharge, and 
      overall quality of life was satisfying for 66.7% of patients according to the 
      QOLIBRI questionnaire; (4) Conclusions: Among patients admitted to the 
      catheterisation laboratory for aborted SCD, mainly related to Acute Coronary 
      Syndrom (ACS), less than a half of them were alive at discharge. However, the 
      one-year survival rate without neurological sequelae was high and overall quality 
      of life was good.

TI  - Supraglottic airway device versus tracheal intubation in the initial airway 
      management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the AIRWAYS-2 cluster RCT.
PG  - 1-158
LID - 10.3310/VHOH9034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When a cardiac arrest occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be 
      started immediately. However, there is limited evidence about the best approach 
      to airway management during cardiac arrest. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to 
      determine whether or not the i-gel((R)) (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, UK) 
      supraglottic airway is superior to tracheal intubation as the initial advanced 
      airway management strategy in adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest. DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, open, parallel, two-group, multicentre, 
      cluster randomised controlled trial. A cost-effectiveness analysis accompanied 
      the trial. SETTING: The setting was four ambulance services in England. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 18 years who had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest and were attended by a participating paramedic were enrolled 
      automatically under a waiver of consent between June 2015 and August 2017. 
      Follow-up ended in February 2018. INTERVENTION: Paramedics were randomised 1 : 1 
      to use tracheal intubation (764 paramedics) or i-gel (759 paramedics) for their 
      initial advanced airway management and were unblinded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge or 30 days 
      after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whichever occurred earlier, collected by 
      assessors blinded to allocation. The modified Rankin Scale, a measure of 
      neurological disability, was dichotomised: a score of 0-3 (good outcome) or 4-6 
      (poor outcome/death). The primary outcome for the economic evaluation was 
      quality-adjusted life-years, estimated using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level 
      version. RESULTS: A total of 9296 patients (supraglottic airway group, 4886; 
      tracheal intubation group, 4410) were enrolled [median age 73 years; 3373 (36.3%) 
      women]; modified Rankin Scale score was known for 9289 patients. Characteristics 
      were similar between groups. A total of 6.4% (311/4882) of patients in the 
      supraglottic airway group and 6.8% (300/4407) of patients in the tracheal 
      intubation group had a good outcome (adjusted difference in proportions of 
      patients experiencing a good outcome: -0.6%, 95% confidence interval -1.6% to 
      0.4%). The supraglottic airway group had a higher initial ventilation success 
      rate than the tracheal intubation group [87.4% (4255/4868) vs. 79.0% (3473/4397), 
      respectively; adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 8.3%, 95% 
      confidence interval 6.3% to 10.2%]; however, patients in the tracheal intubation 
      group were less likely to receive advanced airway management than patients in the 
      supraglottic airway group [77.6% (3419/4404) vs. 85.2% (4161/4883), 
      respectively]. Regurgitation rate was similar between the groups [supraglottic 
      airway group, 26.1% (1268/4865); tracheal intubation group, 24.5% (1072/4372); 
      adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 1.4%, 95% confidence interval 
      -0.6% to 3.4%], as was aspiration rate [supraglottic airway group, 15.1% 
      (729/4824); tracheal intubation group, 14.9% (647/4337); adjusted difference in 
      proportions of patients: 0.1%, 95% confidence interval -1.5% to 1.8%]. The 
      longer-term outcomes were also similar between the groups (modified Rankin Scale: 
      at 3 months, odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.14; at 6 months, 
      odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.16). Sensitivity analyses did 
      not alter the overall findings. There were no unexpected serious adverse events. 
      Mean quality-adjusted life-years to 6 months were 0.03 in both groups 
      (supraglottic airway group minus tracheal intubation group difference -0.0015, 
      95% confidence interval -0.0059 to 0.0028), and total costs were  pound157 (95% 
      confidence interval - pound270 to  pound583) lower in the tracheal intubation group. 
      Although the point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio suggested 
      that tracheal intubation may be cost-effective, the huge uncertainty around this 
      result indicates no evidence of a difference between groups. LIMITATIONS: 
      Limitations included imbalance in the number of patients in each group, caused by 
      unequal distribution of high-enrolling paramedics; crossover between groups; and 
      the fact that participating paramedics, who were volunteers, might not be 
      representative of all paramedics in the UK. Findings may not be applicable to 
      other countries. CONCLUSION: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 
      randomisation to the supraglottic airway group compared with the tracheal 
      intubation group did not result in a difference in outcome at 30 days. There were 
      no notable differences in costs, outcomes and overall cost-effectiveness between 
      the groups. FUTURE WORK: Future work could compare alternative supraglottic 
      airway types with tracheal intubation; include a randomised trial of bag mask 
      ventilation versus supraglottic airways; and involve other patient populations, 
      including children, people with trauma and people in hospital. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN08256118. FUNDING: This project 
      was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health 
      Technology Assessment programme and supported by the NIHR Comprehensive Research 
      Networks and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 26,

OAB - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a serious medical emergency in which the heartbeat 
      and breathing stop suddenly. Every year in the UK, a large number of patients 
      (around 123 per 100,000) suffer a cardiac arrest outside hospital. Only 7-9% of 
      these patients survive to leave hospital. The best initial treatment in cardiac 
      arrest is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (commonly known as CPR), during which it 
      is vital to give chest compressions and maintain a clear airway. Two main 
      techniques are used to keep the airway clear: tracheal intubation (inserting a 
      breathing tube into the windpipe) and a supraglottic airway device (a newer 
      device that is inserted less deeply and sits just above the voicebox). Both 
      techniques are used routinely by paramedics in the UK when treating a cardiac 
      arrest, but there is no evidence about which technique is best. The AIRWAYS-2 
      trial aimed to find out whether or not a supraglottic airway device is better 
      than tracheal intubation. WHO PARTICIPATED AND WHAT WAS INVOLVED? Paramedics from 
      four UK ambulance services were put into one of two groups at random. One group 
      was randomly chosen to use tracheal intubation and the other group was randomly 
      chosen to use a supraglottic airway device at all adult cardiac arrests they 
      attended for approximately 2 years. Paramedics were able to apply their clinical 
      judgement and use a different device if they felt that this would be best for the 
      patient. A total of 1523 paramedics took part and enrolled 9296 patients. 
      Following cardiac arrest, a patient's recovery was assessed as good or poor 
      (including patients who did not survive). WHAT DID THE TRIAL FIND? A similar 
      percentage of patients in both groups had a good recovery. There was no evidence 
      to suggest that the supraglottic airway device was any better than tracheal 
      intubation for treating a cardiac arrest.

LID - e022238
AB  - Background In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment 
      elevation, immediate coronary angiography did not improve clinical outcomes when 
      compared with delayed angiography in the COACT (Coronary Angiography After 
      Cardiac Arrest) trial. Whether 1 of the 2 strategies has benefits in terms of 
      health care resource use and costs is currently unknown. We assess the health 
      care resource use and costs in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
      Methods and Results A total of 538 patients were randomly assigned to a strategy 
      of either immediate or delayed coronary angiography. Detailed health care 
      resource use and cost-prices were collected from the initial hospital episode. A 
      generalized linear model and a gamma distribution were performed. Generic quality 
      of life was measured with the RAND-36 and collected at 12-month follow-up. 
      Overall total mean costs were similar between both groups (EUR 33 575+/-19 612 
      versus EUR 33 880+/-21 044; P=0.86). Generalized linear model: (beta, 0.991; 95% CI, 
      0.894-1.099; P=0.86). Mean procedural costs (coronary angiography and 
      percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft) were higher in 
      the immediate angiography group (EUR 4384+/-3447 versus EUR 3028+/-4220; P<0.001). 
      Costs concerning intensive care unit and ward stay did not show any significant 
      difference. The RAND-36 questionnaire did not differ between both groups. 
      Conclusions The mean total costs between patients with out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest randomly assigned to an immediate angiography or a delayed invasive 
      strategy were similar during the initial hospital stay. With respect to the 
      higher invasive procedure costs in the immediate group, a strategy awaiting 
      neurological recovery followed by coronary angiography and planned 
      revascularization may be considered. Registration URL: https://trialregister.nl;

AB  - Global health education is offered increasingly during residency training. The 
      University of Minnesota has offered a global pediatrics track to residents since 
      2005. This study aimed to understand the impacts of a global pediatrics track on 
      graduates' career choices, skills, and current engagement in global health. An 
      electronic survey was sent to 110 track graduates in February to April 2020. Data 
      were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Content analysis of 
      written comments was conducted. The response rate was 62% overall, varying by 
      question. Overall, 75% of responding graduates reported global pediatrics track 
      participation affected their career choices. Eighty-four percent recalled plans 
      to work in global health after graduation and 64% of respondents reported working 
      in global health abroad or at home at the time of the survey. Incorporation of 
      public health and global research represented the greatest percentage change in 
      career plans from the time of enrollment to graduation (24% and 27%, 
      respectively). Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that track 
      participation improved their ability to elicit information about cultural beliefs 
      and practices, and 86% reported improvement in cost-conscious care. An increase 
      in global health knowledge and skills was the most common category of impact 
      cited by respondents. Neonatal resuscitation, bubble continuous positive airway 
      pressure, and homemade spacers for metered-dose inhalers were the most used 
      global health-adapted skills. Our study found that graduates of the global 
      pediatrics track perceive their participation affected their knowledge, skills, 
      and attitudes positively, with the potential to improve clinical care and promote 
      health equity locally and globally.

LID - 830571
AB  - Acute craniocerebral injury is a common traumatic disease in clinical practice, 
      characterized by rapid changes in condition and a high rate of death and 
      disability. Early and effective emergency care throughout the pre-hospital and 
      in-hospital period is the key to reducing the rate of death and disability and 
      promoting the recovery of patients. In this study, we conducted an observational 
      study of 130 patients with acute craniocerebral injury admitted between May 2020 
      and May 2021. Patients were randomly divided into a regular group and an 
      optimization group of 65 patients each, with patients in the regular group 
      receiving the conventional emergency care model and patients in the optimization 
      group receiving the pre-hospital and in-hospital optimal emergency care process 
      for intervention. In this study, we observed and compared the time taken to 
      arrive at the scene, assess the condition, attend to the patient and provide 
      emergency care, the success rate of emergency care within 48 h, the interleukin-6 
      (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) 
      after admission and 1 day before discharge, the National Institute of Health 
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) after 
      resuscitation and 1 day before discharge, and the complications of infection, 
      brain herniation, central hyperthermia, and electrolyte disturbances in both 
      groups. We collected and statistically analyzed the recorded data. The results 
      showed that the time taken to arrive at the consultation site, assess the 
      condition, receive the consultation, provide first aid was significantly lower in 
      the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the success rate of 
      treatment was significantly higher in the optimized group than in the regular 
      group (P < 0.05). In both groups, IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 decreased on the day 
      before discharge compared with the day of rescue, with the levels of each index 
      lower in the optimization group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the NIHSS 
      scores decreased and the SF-36 scores increased on the day before discharge 
      compared with the successful rescue in both groups, with the NIHSS scores in the 
      optimization group lower than in the regular group and the SF-36 scores higher 
      than in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall complication rate in the 
      optimization group was significantly lower than that in the regular group (P < 
      0.05). This shows that optimizing pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency care 
      procedures can significantly shorten the time to emergency care for patients with 
      acute craniocerebral injury, increase the success rate, reduce inflammation, 
      improve neurological function and quality of life, reduce the occurrence of 
      complications, and improve patient prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2019, European guidelines recommend considering extracorporeal 
      life support as salvage strategy for the treatment of acute high-risk pulmonary 
      embolism (PE) with circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest. However, data on 
      long-term survival, quality of life (QoL) and cardiopulmonary function after 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. METHODS: One hundred and 
      nineteen patients with acute PE and severe cardiogenic shock or in need of 
      mechanical resuscitation (CPR) received venoarterial or venovenous ECMO from 2007 
      to 2020. Long-term data were obtained from survivors by phone contact and 
      personal interviews. Follow-up included a QoL analysis using the EQ-5D-5L 
      questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing and cardiopulmonary 
      exercise testing. RESULTS: The majority of patients (n = 80, 67%) were placed on 
      ECMO during or after CPR with returned spontaneous circulation. Overall survival 
      to hospital discharge was 45.4% (54/119). Nine patients died during follow-up. At 
      a median follow-up of 54.5 months (25-73; 56 +/- 38 months), 34 patients answered 
      the QoL questionnaire. QoL differed largely and was slightly reduced compared to 
      a German reference population (EQ5D5L index 0.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.04; p  < 0.01). 
      25 patients (73.5%) had no mobility limitations, 22 patients (65%) could handle 
      their activities, while anxiety and depression were expressed by 10 patients 
      (29.4%). Return-to-work status was 33.3% (average working hours: 
      36.2 +/- 12.5 h/per week), 15 (45.4%) had retired from work early. 12 patients 
      (35.3%) expressed limited exercise tolerance and dyspnea. 59% (20/34) received 
      echocardiography and pulmonary function testing, 50% (17/34) cardiopulmonary 
      exercise testing. No relevant impairment of right ventricular function and an 
      only slightly reduced mean peak oxygen uptake (76.3% predicted) were noted. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Survivors from severe intractable PE in cardiogenic shock or even 
      under CPR with ECMO seem to recover well with acceptable QoL and only minor 
      cardiopulmonary limitations in the long term. To underline these results, further 
      research with larger study cohorts must be obtained.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evidence on physical and psychological well-being of in-hospital 
      cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors is scarce. The aim of this study is to describe 
      long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and 
      psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. METHODS: A multicenter 
      prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult 
      IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress 
      (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months 
      post-IHCA. RESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the 
      questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility 
      Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. 
      At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale 
      (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) 
      and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5). DISCUSSION: 
      Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a 
      substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data 
      suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior 
      to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive care has a strong impact on health-related quality of life 
      (HRQOL). The specific impact of cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm is poorly 
      known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We gathered patients included in two randomized 
      controlled trials (AWARE and HYPERION). The HYPERION trial included ICU-treated 
      non-shockable cardiac arrest patients. The AWARE study included ICU patients 
      requiring mechanical ventilation. We compared the 3-months HRQOL of these 
      patients to those of a large sample of the French general population. Physical 
      and mental dimension were compared. Multivariable linear regression was used to 
      pick up factors associated with HRQOL. RESULTS: 72 and 307 patients of the 
      HYPERION and the AWARE studies were compared to 20,574 French controls. ICU 
      patients evidenced lower scores in all the SF-36 dimensions compared to the 
      controls. Similar scores were observed in both HYPERION and AWARe trials. The 
      physical component score was lower in patients from the HYPERION trial compared 
      to those from the AWARE trials and to controls (38.6 [29.6-47.8], 35.4 
      [27.5-46.4] vs. 53.0 [46.0-56.7], [Formula: see text]). After adjustment for age 
      and gender, HYPERION and AWARE trial status were associated wit lower physical 
      component score. CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of life of unshockable 
      cardiac arrest survivors evaluated at 3 months was similar to ICU survivors and 
      significantly lower than in individuals from general population, especially in 
      the physical dimensions.

TI  - Quality of Life Following Urgent LVAD Implantation for ECMO Therapy in 
      Cardiogenic Shock: A Long-Term Follow-Up.
LID - 10.3390/medicina57080747 [doi]
LID - 747
AB  - Background and Objectives: Over the past decade, veno-arterial extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has developed into a mainstream treatment for 
      refractory cardiogenic shock (CS) to maximal conservative management. Successful 
      weaning of VA-ECMO may not be possible, and bridging with further mechanical 
      circulatory support (MCS), such as urgent implantation of a left ventricular 
      assist device (LVAD), may represent the only means to sustain the patient 
      haemodynamically. In the recovery phase, many survivors are not suitably prepared 
      physically or psychologically for the novel issues encountered during daily life 
      with an LVAD. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of our 
      institutional database between 2012 and 2019 was performed to identify patients 
      treated with VA-ECMO for CS who underwent urgent LVAD implantation whilst on MCS. 
      Post-cardiotomy cases were excluded. QoL was assessed prospectively during a 
      routine follow-up visit using the EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 level (EQ-5D-5L) and the 
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys. Results: Among 126 in-hospital 
      survivors of VA-ECMO therapy due to cardiogenic shock without prior cardiac 
      surgery, 31 (24.6%) urgent LVAD recipients were identified. In 11 (36.7%) cases, 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed (median 10, range 1-60 min) 
      before initiation of VA-ECMO, and in 5 (16.7%) cases, MCS was established under 
      CPR. Mean age at LVAD implantation was 51.7 (+/-14) years and surgery was 
      performed after a mean 12.1 (+/-8) days of VA-ECMO support. During follow-up of 
      46.9 (+/-25.5) months, there were 10 deaths after 20.4 (+/-12.1) months of LVAD 
      support. Analysis of QoL questionnaires returned a mean EQ-5D-5L score of 66% 
      (+/-21) of societal valuation for Germany and a mean PHQ-9 score of 5.7 (+/-5) 
      corresponding to mild depression severity. When compared with 49 elective LVAD 
      recipients without prior VA-ECMO therapy, there was no significant difference in 
      QoL results. Conclusions: Patients requiring urgent LVAD implantation under 
      VA-ECMO support due to CS are associated with comparable quality of life without 
      a significant difference from elective LVAD recipients. Close follow-up is 
      required to oversee patient rehabilitation after successful initial treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-reported health and life satisfaction are considered important 
      outcomes in people surviving cardiac arrest. However, most previous studies have 
      reported limited aspects on health, often based on composite scores, and few 
      studies have focused on life satisfaction. Investigating health aspects with a 
      broad and detailed perspective is important to increase the knowledge of life 
      after cardiac arrest from the perspective of survivors. In addition, the 
      knowledge of potential differences in health among survivors related to place of 
      arrest (in-hospital cardiac arrest; IHCA or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; OHCA) 
      is scarce. The aim was to describe and compare self-reported health and life 
      satisfaction in IHCA and OHCA survivors.  METHODS: This observational 
      cross-sectional study included adult cardiac arrest survivors six months after 
      resuscitation, treated at five Swedish hospitals between 2013 and 2018. 
      Participants received a study specific questionnaire including Health Index (HI), 
      EQ-5D 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Minimal Insomnia Sleeping Scale (MISS), 
      Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale (HADS), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). In order to 
      present characteristics descriptive statistics were applied. The Mann-Whitney U 
      test, chi-square test or Fishers' exact test were used to compare differences in 
      self-reported health and life satisfaction between in-hospital- and 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors RESULTS: In total, 212 survivors 
      participated. Based on scale scores and general measures, the median scores of 
      health and life satisfaction among survivors were high: HI total = 29, EQ 
      VAS = 80, and SWLS = 20. According to HI, most problems were reported for 
      tiredness (37.3 %) and strength (26.4 %), while pain/discomfort (57.5 %) and 
      anxiety/depression (42.5 %) where most common according to EQ-5D-5L. Except for 
      EQ-5D-5L mobility (p = 0.023), MSPSS significant other (p = 0.036), and MSPSS 
      family (p = 0.043), no health differences in relation to place of arrest were 
      identified. CONCLUSIONS: Although general health and life satisfaction were good 
      among cardiac arrest survivors, several prevalent health problems were reported 
      regardless of place of arrest. To achieve an improved understanding of health in 
      cardiac arrest survivors, it is important to assess specific symptoms as a 
      complement to composite scores of general, physical, emotional, and social 
      health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is an adverse event associated 
      with high mortality. Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on 
      incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac 
      arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after 
      IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors. METHODS: A multicentre prospective 
      cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. 
      Patients >/= 18 years receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were 
      included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by 
      pre-arrest Modified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through 
      the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related 
      quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year. 
      RESULTS: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 
      63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved 
      ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one 
      year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated 
      with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 
      69.7% was functionally independent. CONCLUSION: One-year survival after IHCA in 
      this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies. 
      Survival is associated with a patient's pre-arrest functional status and 
      morbidity. HRQoL appears acceptable, however functional rehabilitation warrants 
      attention. These findings provide a comprehensive insight in in-hospital cardiac 
      arrest prognosis.

AB  - AIM: To estimate the proportion of significant posttraumatic stress (PTS) in both 
      cardiac survivors with good neurologic recovery and informal caregivers, and to 
      pilot test the hypothesis that greater PTS are associated with worse quality of 
      life (QoL) in both cardiac arrest survivors and informal caregivers of cardiac 
      arrest survivors. METHODS: We distributed an online survey to survivor and 
      caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. Participants provided 
      demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 
      (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the 
      WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear 
      regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for 
      survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each 
      QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models. 
      RESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS 
      screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS 
      screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate 
      associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since 
      arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In 
      adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (beta: -0.35 to 
      -0.53, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent 
      years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in 
      survivors and informal caregivers. Further study is needed to validate these 
      findings in a larger, representative sample.

AB  - AIM: This study aimed to examine the associations between participation in 
      physical activities and objective and subjective factors modifiable by 
      rehabilitation in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue. METHODS: Participants in 
      a clinical feasibility study (N = 19) completed several subjective 
      (patient-reported) and objective outcome measures on one occasion only. The 
      associations between an individual's level of participation in physical 
      activities (Participation Objective Participation Subjective) and their levels of 
      cognition (Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment), body movement 
      (Keitel Functional Test), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
      Depression Scale), ambulation and pain (Health Utilities Index Mark 3), and 
      fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were explored. Pearson's 
      correlation coefficientr was calculated for all associations, except for body 
      movement (Spearman's correlation coefficient r(s) ). RESULTS: As hypothesized, we 
      found weak-to-moderate, positive associations between participation in physical 
      activities and objective factors of cognition (r = 0.370) and body movement (r(s) 
       = 0.414) and a subjective factor of ambulation ability (r = 0.501). We found 
      moderate, negative associations between participation in physical activities and 
      subjective factors of depressive symptoms (r=-0.590), pain (r=-0.495), physical 
      fatigue impact (r=-0.629), cognitive fatigue impact (r=-0.591), and psychosocial 
      fatigue impact (r=-0.557). CONCLUSION: The moderate, negative and positive 
      associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors 
      suggest that subjective complaints of depressive symptoms, ambulation ability, 
      pain, and fatigue impact may be important factors when seeking to improve 
      participation in physical activities. In particular, addressing physical and 
      cognitive endurance as well as perceptions of fatigue may hold the key to 
      increasing physical activity in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate associations between provider-patient communication, readiness 
      for discharge, and patients' illness perceptions with post-arrest quality of life 
      (QoL). METHODS: We distributed an online survey to survivors of cardiac arrest 
      who were members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. Survivors completed the 
      Questionnaire for the Quality of Provider-Patient Interactions (QQPPI), Readiness 
      for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS), and the Brief Illness Perception 
      Questionnaire (B-IPQ). When completing the QQPPI and RHDS, survivors were asked 
      to think back to their hospitalization and discharge. QoL domains (physical, 
      psychological, social) were measured via the WHO-QOL BREF. Three multiple 
      regression models examined associations between QQPPI, RHDS, and B-IPQ scores 
      with QoL domains, adjusted for age, sex, months since arrest, self-reported 
      understanding of cardiac arrest and potential post-arrest symptoms at discharge, 
      self-reported memory at discharge, and functional status as defined by the Lawton 
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. RESULTS: A total of 163 survivors 
      (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean time since arrest: 63.9 
      months) provided complete survey data. More threatening illness perceptions (beta: 
      -0.45, p ​< ​0.001) and lower readiness for discharge (beta: 0.21, p ​= ​0.01) were 
      associated with worse physical QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (beta: 
      -0.47, p ​< ​0.001) was associated with worse psychological QoL. More threatening 
      illness perceptions (beta: -0.28, p ​= ​0.001) and poor provider-patient 
      communication (beta: 0.35, p ​< ​0.001) were associated with worse social QoL. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable provider-patient relationship factors and illness 
      perceptions were associated with quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest 
      with good neurologic recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is affected after 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but data several years after the arrest 
      are lacking. We assessed long-term HRQoL in OHCA survivors and how known outcome 
      predictors impact HRQoL. METHODS: In adult OHCA survivors, HRQoL was assessed 
      five years post arrest using Short-form 36 (SF-36), EQ-5D-3 L (EQ-5D) and 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) among others. Results were compared 
      to the next of kins' estimates and to a Norwegian reference population. RESULTS: 
      Altogether 96 survivors were included mean 5.3 (range 3.6-7.2) years after OHCA. 
      HRQoL compared well to the reference population, except for lower score for 
      general health with 67.2 (95%CI (62.1; 72.3) vs. 72.9 (71.9; 74.0)), p = 0.03. 
      Younger (</=58 years) vs. older survivors scored lower for general health with mean 
      (SD) of 62.1 (27.5) vs. 73.0 (19.5), p = 0.03, vitality (55.2 (20.5) vs. 64.6 
      (17.3), p = 0.02, social functioning (75.3 (28.7) vs. 94.1 (13.5), p < 0.001 and 
      mental component summary (49.0 (9.9) vs. 55.8 (6.7), p < 0.001. They scored 
      higher for HADS-anxiety (4.8 (3.6 vs. 2.7 (2.5), p = 0.001, and had lower EQ-5D 
      index (0.72 (0.34) vs. 0.84 (0.19), p = 0.04. Early vs. late awakeners had higher 
      EQ-5D index (0.82 (0.23) vs. 0.71 (0.35), p = 0.04 and lower HADS-depression 
      scores (2.5 (2.9) vs. 3.8 (2.3), p = 0.04. Next of kin estimated HRQoL similar to 
      the survivors' own estimates. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL five years after OHCA was good 
      and mainly comparable to a matched reference population. Stratified analyses 
      revealed impaired HRQoL among younger survivors and those awakening late, mainly 
      for mental domains.

AB  - AIMS: We recently reported early outcomes in patients enrolled in a randomised 
      trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the PARAMEDIC2 
      (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of 
      Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial. The purpose of the present paper is 
      to report long-term survival, quality of life, functional and cognitive outcomes 
      at 3, 6 and 12-months. METHODS: PARAMEDIC2 was a pragmatic, individually 
      randomised, double blind, controlled trial with an economic evaluation. Patients 
      were randomised to either adrenaline or placebo. This paper reports results on 
      the modified Rankin Scale scores at 6-months, survival at 6 and 12-months, as 
      well as other cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes collected at 3 
      and 6 months (Two Simple Questions, the Mini Mental State Examination, the 
      Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline Evaluation for Cardiac Arrest, 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder 
      Checklist - Civilian Version, Short-Form 12-item Health Survey and the EuroQoL 
      EQ-5D-5L). RESULTS: 8014 patients were randomised with confirmed trial drug 
      administration. At 6-months, 78 (2.0%) of the patients in the adrenaline group 
      and 58 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo group had a favourable neurological 
      outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.97]). 117 
      (2.9%) patients were alive at 6-months in the adrenaline group compared with 86 
      (2.2%) in the placebo group (1.43 [1.05, 1.96], reducing to 107 (2.7%) and 80 
      (2.0%) respectively at 12-months (1.38 [1.00, 1.92]). Measures of 3 and 6-month 
      cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes were reduced, but there was no 
      strong evidence of differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Adrenaline improved 
      survival through to 12-months follow-up. The study did not find evidence of 
      improvements in favourable neurological outcomes. (ISCRTN 73485024).

TI  - Associations between depression and anxiety symptoms with quality of life in 
      cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery and informal caregivers of 
      cardiac arrest survivors.
LID - 100046 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surviving cardiac arrest is characterized by cognitive, 
      psychological, and functional impairments and apprehension over long-term 
      prognosis. We first estimated the proportion of clinically significant depression 
      and anxiety in cardiac arrest survivors and their informal caregivers, then 
      examined the association between depression and anxiety with worse quality of 
      life (QoL). METHODS: In an online survey, cardiac arrest survivors and caregivers 
      reported demographic and arrest characteristics, the Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and the WHOQOL-BREF physical, psychological, and social 
      QoL subscales. Six multiple regression models (three for survivors and three for 
      caregivers) tested associations between PHQ-4 scores with each QoL subscale, 
      adjusted for the following: for survivors - functional dependence, self-reported 
      memory problems, sex, income, months since arrest, and age; for caregivers - 
      months since arrest, age, and income. RESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean 
      age: 50.8 years, 49.7% women, positive depression screen: 21.3%, anxiety: 29.6%) 
      and 52 caregivers (mean age: 48.7 years, 86.5% women, positive depression screen: 
      21.2%, anxiety: 36.5%). In adjusted models, depression and anxiety were 
      associated with worse QoL on each subscale (beta: -0.39-0.7, p < .01). LIMITATIONS: 
      We assessed depression and anxiety and QoL cross-sectionally, which cannot 
      exclude bi-directionality. Further, there was a selection bias in our survey, as 
      the majority of survivors were of good neurologic recovery. CONCLUSION: 
      Depression and anxiety were moderately associated with worse QoL over functional 
      dependence and memory problems in survivors, and worse QoL in caregivers. Future 
      study should explore the feasibility of dyadic interventions in cardiac arrest 
      survivors and informal caregivers.

TI  - Randomized trial of the i-gel supraglottic airway device versus tracheal 
      intubation during out of hospital cardiac arrest (AIRWAYS-2): Patient outcomes at 
      three and six months.
PG  - 74-82

AB  - AIM: The AIRWAYS-2 cluster randomised controlled trial compared the i-gel 
      supraglottic airway device (SGA) with tracheal intubation (TI) as the first 
      advanced airway management (AAM) strategy used by Emergency Medical Service 
      clinicians (paramedics) treating adult patients with non-traumatic 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). It showed no difference between the two 
      groups in the primary outcome of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 30 
      days/hospital discharge. This paper reports outcomes to 6 months. METHODS: 
      Paramedics from four ambulance services in England were randomised 1:1 to use an 
      i-gel SGA (759 paramedics) or TI (764 paramedics) as their initial approach to 
      AAM. Adults who had a non-traumatic OHCA and were attended by a participating 
      paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent. Survivors were 
      invited to complete questionnaires at three and six months after OHCA. Outcomes 
      were analysed using regression methods. RESULTS: 767/9296 (8.3%) enrolled 
      patients survived to 30 days/hospital discharge and 317/767 survivors (41.3%) 
      consented and were followed-up to six months. No significant differences were 
      found between the two treatment groups in the primary outcome measure (mRS score: 
      3 months: odds ratio (OR) for good recovery (i-gel/TI, OR) 0.89, 95% CI 
      0.69-1.14; 6 months OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71-1.16). EQ-5D-5L scores were also similar 
      between groups and sensitivity analyses did not alter the findings. CONCLUSION: 
      There were no statistically significant differences between the TI and i-gel 
      groups at three and six months. We therefore conclude that the initially reported 
      finding of no significant difference between groups at 30 days/hospital discharge 
      was sustained when the period of follow-up was extended to six months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been reported for 
      out-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) separately, but 
      potential differences between the two groups are unknown. The aim of this study 
      is therefore to describe and compare HRQoL in patients surviving OHCA and IHCA. 
      METHODS: Patients >/=18 years with Cerebral Performance Category 1-3 included in 
      the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2014 and 2017 were 
      included. A telephone interview was performed based on a questionnaire sent 3-6 
      months post cardiac arrest, including EQ-5D-5L and the Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale. Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear- and ordinal logistic 
      regression analyses were used to describe and compare HRQoL in OHCA and IHCA 
      survivors. Adjustments were made for sex, age and initial rhythm. RESULTS: In 
      all, 1369 IHCA and 772 OHCA survivors were included. Most OHCA and IHCA survivors 
      reported no symptoms of with anxiety (88% and 84%) or depression (87% and 85%). 
      IHCA survivors reported significantly more problems in the health domains 
      mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain/discomfort (p < 0.001 for all) and 
      scored lower general health measured by EQ-VAS (median 70 vs. 80 respectively, 
      p < 0.001) compared with the OHCA survivors. CONCLUSION: Survivors of IHCA 
      reported significantly worse HRQoL compared to survivors of OHCA. Consequently, 
      research data gathered from one of these populations may not be generalizable to 
      the other.

AB  - AIMS: The TTM2-trial is a multi-centre randomised clinical trial where targeted 
      temperature management (TTM) at 33  degrees C will be compared with normothermia and 
      early treatment of fever (>/=37.8  degrees C) after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). 
      This paper presents the design and rationale of the TTM2-trial follow-up, where 
      information on secondary and exploratory outcomes will be collected. We also 
      present the explorative outcome analyses which will focus on neurocognitive 
      function and societal participation in OHCA-survivors. METHODS: Blinded 
      outcome-assessors will perform follow-up at 30-days after the OHCA with a 
      telephone interview, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Glasgow 
      Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). Face-to-face meetings will be performed at 6 and 
      24-months, and include reports on outcome from several sources of information: 
      clinician-reported: mRS, GOSE; patient-reported: EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level 
      responses version (EQ-5D-5L), Life satisfaction, Two Simple Questions; 
      observer-reported: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the 
      Elderly-Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA) and neurocognitive performance 
      measures: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test 
      (SDMT). Exploratory analyses will be performed with an emphasis on brain injury 
      in the survivors, where the two intervention groups will be compared for 
      potential differences in neuro-cognitive function (MoCA, SDMT) and societal 
      participation (GOSE). Strategies to increase inter-rater reliability and decrease 
      missing data are described. DISCUSSION: The TTM2-trial follow-up is a pragmatic 
      yet detailed pre-planned and standardised assessment of patient's outcome 
      designed to ensure data-quality, decrease missing data and provide optimal 
      conditions to investigate clinically relevant effects of TTM, including 
      OHCA-survivors' neurocognitive function and societal participation.

TI  - One-year outcome of patients admitted after cardiac arrest compared to other 
      causes of ICU admission. An ancillary analysis of the observational prospective 
      and multicentric FROG-ICU study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: While cardiac arrest (CA) patients discharged alive from intensive 
      care unit (ICU) are considered to have good one-year survival but potential 
      neurological impairment, comparisons with other ICU sub-populations non-admitted 
      for CA purpose are still lacking. This study aimed to compare long-term outcome 
      and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between CA patients and patients 
      admitted to ICU for all other causes. METHODS: In 1635 patients discharged alive 
      from 21 European ICUs in an ancillary analysis of a prospective multicentric 
      cohort, we compared CA causes of ICU admission to all other causes of ICU 
      admissions (named non-CAs). The primary endpoint was one-year survival rate after 
      ICU discharge. Secondary endpoints included HRQOL at 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU 
      discharge using the outcome survey short form-36 (SF36). Propensity score 
      matching was used to consider the probability of having CA. RESULTS: Of the 1635 
      patients, 1561 were included in this study comprised of 1447 non-CAs and 114 CAs. 
      At one-year in the non-matched population, survival rate was greater in the CA 
      group 89% versus the non-CA group 78% (log rank p = 0.0056). In the matched 
      population, this difference persisted between CAs and non-CAs (log rank 
      p = 0.049). The physical component summary of the SF36 scale was higher in the CA 
      group than in the non-CA group at all time points in both non-matched and matched 
      populations. CONCLUSIONS: CA patients discharged alive from ICU have a better 
      one-year survival and a better HRQOL specifically on physical functions than 
      patients admitted to ICU for other causes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on pulmonary arterial hypertension: A 
      prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 278-286
LID - 10.5606/tftrd.2019.2758 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary 
      rehabilitation (CPR) on cardiopulmonary function, quality of life, depression, 
      and hemodynamic parameters in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
      and to compare the efficacy of hospital- and home-based exercise programs. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2014 to May 2016, a total of 30 patients 
      with PAH were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to 
      either a hospital-based (n=15) or home-based exercise program (n=15). The 
      hospital group was assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation (three days/week, 1 
      hour/week 50 to 70% maximal oxygen uptake [PvO(2)]) program for eight weeks. The 
      home-based exercise group received home exercises alone. Before and after eight 
      weeks of rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated for their functional status 
      (PvO(2)), pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in one sec 
      (FEV1), mL, forced vital capacity (FVC), mL and FEV1/FVC%, quality of life using 
      Short Form-36 (SF-36), depression severity using Beck Depression Inventory, and 
      hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction, right 
      ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left 
      ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. 
      RESULTS: Of the patients, 12 completed the study in each group. There was no 
      statistically significant difference in the functional status, quality of life, 
      depression severity, and hemodynamic parameters after the rehabilitation compared 
      baseline between the groups. CONCLUSION: Based on our study results, short-term 
      CPR seems not to be beneficial in patients with PAH. We recommend long-term 
      rehabilitation programs to achieve more benefits from aerobic exercise training 
      in this patient population.

TI  - The AMBER care bundle for hospital inpatients with uncertain recovery nearing the 
      end of life: the ImproveCare feasibility cluster RCT.
PG  - 1-150
LID - 10.3310/hta23550 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to hospital with a terminal illness and uncertain 
      recovery often receive inconsistent care and do not have the opportunity to die 
      in their preferred place of death. Previous end-of-life care packages, such as 
      the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient, have sometimes been badly 
      implemented. The AMBER (Assessment; Management; Best practice; Engagement; 
      Recovery uncertain) care bundle was developed to remedy this. It has not been 
      evaluated in a randomised trial, but a definitive trial would face many hurdles. 
      OBJECTIVE: To optimise the design of and determine the feasibility of a 
      pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial of the AMBER care 
      bundle compared with best standard care. DESIGN: A feasibility cluster randomised 
      controlled trial including semistructured interviews with patients and relatives, 
      focus groups with health-care professionals, non-participant observations of 
      multidisciplinary team meetings, a standard care survey, heat maps and case note 
      reviews. Retrospective data were collected from the family or close friends of 
      deceased patients via a bereavement survey. SETTING: Four general medical wards 
      at district general hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: There were 65 
      participants (control, n = 36; intervention, n = 29). There were 24 interviews, 
      four focus groups, 15 non-participant meeting observations, six case note reviews 
      and three heat maps, and 15 of out 23 bereavement, standard care surveys were 
      completed. INTERVENTION: The AMBER care bundle is implemented by a nurse 
      facilitator. It includes the development and documentation of a medical plan, 
      consideration of outcomes, resuscitation and escalation status and daily plan 
      revisiting. The AMBER care bundle encourages staff, patients and families to talk 
      openly about their preferences and priorities should the worst happen. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Two 'candidate' primary outcomes were selected to be evaluated 
      for a future definitive trial: Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale 
      patient/family anxiety and communication subscale and 'howRwe'. The secondary 
      outcome measures were Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale symptoms, 
      Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status scale, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, 
      five-level version, Client Service Receipt Inventory, recruitment rate, 
      intervention fidelity and intervention acceptability. RESULTS: Data were 
      collected for 65 patients. This trial was not powered to measure clinical 
      effectiveness, but variance and changes observed in the Integrated Palliative 
      care Outcome Scale subscale indicated that this measure would probably detect 
      differences within a definitive trial. It was feasible to collect data on health, 
      social and informal care service use and on quality of life at two time points. 
      The AMBER care bundle was broadly acceptable to all stakeholders and was 
      delivered as planned. The emphasis on 'clinical uncertainty' prompted health-care 
      professional awareness of often-overlooked patients. Reviewing patients' AMBER 
      care bundle status was integrated into routine practice. Refinements included 
      simplifying the inclusion criteria and improving health-care professional 
      communication training. Improvements to trial procedures included extending the 
      time devoted to recruitment and simplifying consent procedures. There was also a 
      recommendation to reduce data collected from patients and relatives to minimise 
      burden. LIMITATIONS: The recruitment rate was lower than anticipated. The 
      inclusion criteria for the trial were difficult to interpret. Information sheets 
      and consent procedures were too detailed and lengthy for the target population. 
      Health-care professionals' enthusiasm and specialty were not considered while 
      picking trial wards. Participant recruitment took place later during hospital 
      admission and the majority of participants were lost to follow-up because they 
      had been discharged. Those who participated may have different characteristics 
      from those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility trial has demonstrated that 
      an evaluation of the AMBER care bundle among an acutely unwell patient 
      population, although technically possible, is not practical or feasible. The 
      intervention requires optimisation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials

OAB - Unwell hospital patients who are approaching the end of their lives and may die 
      at any moment receive inconsistent care and often do not have opportunities to 
      discuss their future care preferences. The AMBER (Assessment; Management; Best 
      practice; Engagement; Recovery uncertain) care bundle was developed to help 
      identify such patients, train health-care professionals to better communicate 
      their concerns with them and their families and, where possible, to realise their 
      preferences for place of care and death. The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying 
      Patient, previously used across England, was designed to provide the best 
      possible quality of care to those at the end of life. However, an independent 
      review identified that it often was not used appropriately, leading to poor 
      patient outcomes. A number of the criticisms of the Liverpool Care Pathway for 
      the Dying Patient, such as reports of quickened deaths from the withdrawal of 
      hydration/nutrition, as well as poor communication with patients and families, 
      may have been identified earlier if it had been thoroughly evaluated. The AMBER 
      care bundle, developed at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, aims to provide better 
      outcomes for patients with clinically uncertain recovery and their families. It 
      is important that the AMBER care bundle is properly investigated before wider 
      use. A bigger study of the AMBER care bundle would be complex and expensive, so 
      we examined whether or not this would be possible and acceptable to patients 
      cared for in four wards across four hospitals, before deciding whether or not to 
      go ahead with this bigger study. Two wards used the care bundle and two did not. 
      We interviewed participants, their families and staff, and examined participants' 
      clinical notes. We found that the AMBER care bundle was largely acceptable to 
      patients, relatives and staff, and generally delivered as intended. We 
      successfully collected information from 65 unwell patients at the beginning of 
      the trial and again 3-5 and 10-15 days later. However, a limited number of data 
      were collected at the final time point (10-15 days) due to many participants 
      being discharged from the hospital. Group discussions with staff and interviews 
      with participants and relatives identified important changes required to improve 
      the AMBER care bundle and views on how the trial was conducted. These included 
      simplifying the type of patients who may be appropriate for the AMBER care bundle 
      and improving communication training for staff. Although we identified that a 
      further study was technically possible, it is currently impractical. Future 
      solutions that would require further testing include focusing on clinical need 
      rather than trying to guess how the patient's condition will develop to identify 
      potential trial participants and using questions completed by the patients as 
      part of their routine care as a source of information. In the meantime, the AMBER 
      care bundle continues to be used in over 40 hospitals in England.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of 
      global mortality, survival rates have increased over the last decade. As such, 
      there is an increasing need to explore long-term functional outcomes of 
      survivors, such as return to work (RTW). METHODOLOGY: We analysed baseline and 
      12-month follow-up data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry for 
      patients that arrested between 2010 and 2016 who were working prior to their 
      arrest. We also conducted more detailed RTW interviews in a subset of OHCA 
      survivors who arrested between July and September 2017. Factors associated with 
      RTW were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A 
      total of 884 previously working survivors were included in the analysis, 650 
      (73%) of whom RTW. Male sex (AOR 1.80; 95%CI: 1.10-2.94), arrests witnessed by 
      emergency medical services (AOR 2.72; 95%CI: 1.50-9.25), discharge directly home 
      from hospital (AOR 4.13; 95%CI: 2.38-7.18) and favourable 12-month health-related 
      quality of life according to the EQ-5D were associated with RTW. Increasing age 
      (AOR 0.97; 95%CI: 0.95-0.98), traumatic arrest aetiology (AOR 0.18; 95%CI: 
      0.04-0.77), and labour-intensive occupations (AOR 0.44; 95%CI: 0.29-0.66) were 
      associated with decreased odds of RTW. Of the 23 OHCA survivors that participated 
      in the more detailed RTW telephone-interview, 87% RTW. Flexible work hours or 
      modified duties were offered to 74% of participants. Fatigue was the most 
      frequently reported barrier to RTW. CONCLUSION: This is the largest study to 
      collectively examine factors associated with RTW among survivors of OHCA. 
      Although larger qualitative studies are needed, our findings highlight which 
      patients are at risk of not RTW and who may benefit from targeted rehabilitation 
      strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Few studies have investigated the psychological and health-related 
      outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) over time. This longitudinal 
      study aims to evaluate psychological distress in terms of anxiety and depression, 
      self-assessed health and predictors of these outcomes in survivors of OHCA, 3 and 
      12 months after resuscitation. METHODS: Recruitment took place from 2008 to 2011 
      and survivors of OHCA were identified through the national Swedish 
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry. Inclusion criteria were age >/=18 years, 
      survival >/=12 months and a Cerebral Performance Category score </=2. Questionnaires 
      containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and European Quality of Life 
      5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) were administered at 3 and 12 months after the 
      OHCA. Participants were also asked to report treatment-requiring comorbidities. 
      RESULTS: Of 298 survivors, 85 (29%) were eligible for this study and 74 (25%) 
      responded. Clinically relevant anxiety was reported by 22 survivors at 3 months 
      and by 17 at 12 months, while clinical depression was reported by 10 at 3 months 
      and 4 at 12 months. The mean EQ-5D-3L index value increased from 0.82 (+/-0.26) to 
      0.88 (+/-0.15) over time. There were significantly less symptoms of psychological 
      distress (p=0.01) and better self-assessed health (p=0.003) at 12 months. 
      Treatment-requiring comorbidity predicted anxiety (OR 4.07, p=0.04), while being 
      female and young age predicted poor health (OR 6.33, p=0.04; OR 0.91, p=0.002) at 
      3 months. At 12 months, being female was linked to anxiety (OR 9.23, p=0.01) and 
      depression (OR 14.78, p=0.002), while young age predicted poor health (OR 0.93, 
      p=0.003). CONCLUSION: The level of psychological distress and self-assessed 
      health improves among survivors of OHCA between 3 and 12 months after 
      resuscitation. Higher levels of psychological distress can be expected among 
      female survivors and those with comorbidity, while survivors of young age and who 
      are female are at greater risk of poor health.

LID - 10.1002/ehf2.12433 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate health-related quality of life 
      (HRQL) among patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 
      northern Norway over a period of 27 years (1988-2015) and to identify variables 
      related to HRQL. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective inquiry of the ECMO 
      registry at the University Hospital of North Norway identified 74 ECMO-treated 
      patients (mean age 49 years, 65% males). Acute cardiac failure was the dominant 
      indication (58%), and venoarterial ECMO was the dominant mode of treatment (87%). 
      Mortality for discharged patients was recorded on 20 September 2016. Thirty (41%) 
      survivors were identified. Twenty-three survivors were eligible for the survey 
      and received a set of questionnaires at home. The main outcome measure was HRQL 
      as measured with the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36) (RAND Short Form-36 
      v1.2). Other questionnaires covered demographic information, problems with 
      functioning in usual daily activities (such as hobbies, household chores, family, 
      or work), employment status, and psychological distress. The survey was completed 
      by 20 (87%) survivors (mean age = 49 years, 12 men). Indications for ECMO 
      treatment (VA = 90%) had been respiratory failure (25%), cardiac failure (60%), 
      and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (15%). The average time since 
      ECMO treatment was 6.5 years. Seventy-five percent reported mental HRQL (SF-36 
      Mental Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 5) or physical HRQL (SF-36 Physical 
      Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 4.5) within the normal range (T = 50 +/- 10) in 
      comparison with age-matched population data from national norms. Half of the 
      responders reported problems on the SF-36 subscales general health and role 
      physical. Seventy percent reported problems on the SF-36 subscale role emotional. 
      All but one responder lived independently without any organized care, and 90% 
      reported no problems related to basic self-care. Half of those in working age had 
      returned to work after ECMO treatment. Forty percent of the responders reported 
      some degree of restrictions in usual daily activities, problems with mobility 
      (35%), anxiety/depression (35%), or pain/discomfort (55%). Significant univariate 
      associations were observed for poorer HRQL and higher reports of psychological 
      distress, pain, and experiencing restrictions in usual everyday activities. 
      Improved HRQL was significantly related to an extended time since ECMO treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our survey indicates an overall positive long-term HRQL outcome for 
      our ECMO survivors. A subset reported problems with functioning and HRQL. Future 
      research should focus on identification of the survivors at risk for poor 
      recovery who may benefit from rehabilitation interventions.

TI  - Quality of Life and 1-Year Survival in Patients With Early Septic Shock: 
      Long-Term Follow-Up of the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation Trial.
PG  - 765-773
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000003762 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine long-term survival and quality of life of patients with 
      early septic shock. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial. 
      SETTING: Fifty-one hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Hong Kong, and 
      the Republic of Ireland. PATIENTS: One-thousand five-hundred ninety-one patients 
      who presented to the emergency department with early septic shock between October 
      2008 and April 2014, and were enrolled in the Australasian Resuscitation in 
      Sepsis Evaluation trial. INTERVENTIONS: Early goal-directed therapy versus usual 
      care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Long-term survival was measured up to 12 
      months postrandomization. Health-related quality of life was measured using the 
      EuroQoL-5D-3L, Short Form 36 and Assessment of Quality of Life 4D at baseline, 
      and at 6 and 12 months following randomization. Mortality data were available for 
      1,548 patients (97.3%) and 1,515 patients (95.2%) at 6 and 12 months, 
      respectively. Health-related quality of life data were available for 85.1% of 
      survivors at 12 months. There were no significant differences in mortality 
      between groups at either 6 months (early goal-directed therapy 21.8% vs usual 
      care 22.6%; p = 0.70) or 12 months (early goal-directed therapy 26.4% vs usual 
      care 27.9%; p = 0.50). There were no group differences in health-related quality 
      of life at either 6 or 12 months (EuroQoL-5D-3L utility scores at 12 mo early 
      goal-directed therapy 0.65 +/- 0.33 vs usual care 0.64 +/- 0.34; p = 0.50), with the 
      health-related quality of life of both groups being significantly lower than 
      population norms. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting to the emergency department 
      with early septic shock, early goal-directed therapy compared with usual care did 
      not reduce mortality nor improve health-related quality of life at either 6 or 12 
      months.

AB  - AIM: Although survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improving, 
      little is known about the long-term outcome of survivors. In this study, we 
      assess the impact of sex on 12 month functional recovery and health-related 
      quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes in OHCA survivors. METHODS: Between 2010 and 
      2016, consecutive adult OHCA survivors were invited to participate in structured 
      telephone interviews using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), the 
      EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and 12-Item Short Form (SF-12) health survey. RESULTS: Of the 
      2300 patients discharged alive, 175 (7.6%) died during the follow-up period with 
      the rate of death at 12 months being higher in women compared to men (10.4% vs. 
      6.4%; p = 0.002). Of the 2125 12 month survivors, 1752 (82.5%) participated in 
      the interviews. Unadjusted outcomes were consistently poorer for females compared 
      to males, with fewer women reporting good functional recovery (GOSE >/= 7, 53.5% 
      vs. 64.8%, p < 0.001) and living at home without care (60.7% vs. 76.4%, 
      p < 0.001). After adjustment, female sex reduced the odds of good functional 
      recovery (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88; p = 0.004), living 
      at home without care (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.76; p < 0.001), an EQ-5D index 
      score of 1 (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.75; p < 0.001), an SF-12 mental component 
      summary >/=50 (AOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.78; p = 0.001) and an SF-12 physical 
      component summary >/=50 (AOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Women report poorer functional recovery and HRQoL after OHCA. Further research is 
      needed to better understand the reasons for these disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a 
      resource-intensive tool that provides haemodynamic and respiratory support in 
      patients who have suffered cardiac arrest. In this study, we investigated the 
      cost-utility of ECPR (cost/QALY) in cardiac arrest patients treated at our 
      institution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who 
      received ECPR following cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2018. All medical 
      care-associated charges with ECPR and subsequent hospital admission were 
      recorded. The quality-of-life of survivors was assessed with the Health Utilities 
      Index Mark II. The cost-utility of ECPR was calculated with cost and 
      quality-of-life data. RESULTS: ECPR was used in 32 patients (15/32 in-hospital, 
      47%) with a median age of 55.0 years (IQR 46.3-63.3 years), 59% male and 66% 
      African American. The median duration of ECPR support was 2.1 days (IQR 0.9-3.8 
      days). Survival to hospital discharge was 16%. The median score of the Health 
      Utilities Index Mark II at discharge for the survivors was 0.44 (IQR 0.32-0.52). 
      The median operating cost for patients undergoing ECMO was $125,683 per patient 
      (IQR $49,751-$206,341 per patient). The calculated cost-utility for ECPR was 
      $56,156/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The calculated cost-utility is within the 
      threshold considered cost-effective in the United States (<$150,000/QALY gained). 
      These results are comparable to the cost-effectiveness of heart transplantation 
      for end-stage heart failure. Larger studies are needed to assess the cost-utility 
      of ECPR and to identify whether other factors, such as patient characteristics, 
      affect the cost-utility benefit.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory cardiogenic shock: patient 
      survival and health-related quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study the outcome of patients with cardiogenic shock 
      who were treated with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), 
      including the subsequent long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 133 consecutive patients treated 
      in a single centre from 2007 to 2016. The HRQoL was studied using the EuroQuol-5 
      dimensions-3 level questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey at 
      a minimum of 1 year after VA ECMO. RESULTS: Of all patients, 66 (49.6%) were 
      weaned from VA ECMO and 16 (12.0%) patients were bridged directly to a 
      transplant, 15 (11.3%) to a ventricular assist device and 1 (0.8%) to a total 
      artificial heart. Survival to discharge was 63.9% and to 1 year, 60.9%. A higher 
      in-hospital mortality rate was independently associated with lower HCO3 at VA 
      ECMO implantation [odds ratio (OR) 1.2/decrease of 1 mmol/l in HCO3 (95% 
      confidence interval 1.1-1.3, P < 0.001)] and with increased need of red blood 
      cells transfused during intensive care [OR 1.9/unit of red blood cells needed/day 
      (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6, P  < 0.001)]. HRQoL measured with the 
      EuroQuol-5 dimensions-3 level questionnaire was equal to the HRQoL of the general 
      population. In the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire, patients reported better 
      emotional well-being and equal energy, pain and general health perception 
      compared to the general population. Limitations were experienced only in physical 
      health. In total, 56% of the patients </= 60 years had returned to work. 
      CONCLUSIONS: VA ECMO can provide acceptable long-term survival with good HRQoL 
      for selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. Timing of patient 
      assessment and of VA ECMO implantation is essential because deeper acidosis is 
      associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate.

AB  - AIM: To explore factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
      among cardiac arrest (CA) survivors treated with an implantable 
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in relation to gender, and to compare their 
      HRQoL with a general population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 990 
      adults treated with an ICD after suffering CA. All participants received a 
      questionnaire including demographics, comorbidities and instruments to measure 
      HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L and HADS), ICD-related concerns (ICDC), perceived control (CAS), 
      and type D personality (DS-14). HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) was compared to a general 
      Swedish population, matched for age and gender. Linear regression analyses were 
      used to explore factors associated with HRQoL. RESULTS: The CA survivors reported 
      better HRQoL in EQ index and less pain/discomfort compared to the general 
      population (p < 0.001). In contrast, they reported more problems in mobility and 
      usual activities (p < 0.01). Problems with anxiety and depression were reported 
      by 15.5% and 7.4% respectively. The following factors were independently 
      associated with all aspects of worse HRQoL: being unemployed, suffering more 
      comorbidity, perceiving less control, and having a type D personality. Further, 
      being female and suffering ICD-related concerns were independently associated 
      with worse HRQoL in three of the four final regression models. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      extensive population-based study showed that most CA survivors living with an ICD 
      rate their HRQoL as acceptable. In addition, their HRQoL is similar to a general 
      population. Women reported worse HRQoL compared to men. Several factors 
      associated with HRQoL were identified, and might be used when screening patients 
      for health problems and when developing health promoting interventions.

PG  - 96-105
LID - 10.1177/1474515118794598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although highly effective in preventing arrhythmic death, there is a 
      high prevalence of anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life among patients 
      who have received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Whether 
      mortality, ICD shock and readmission are predicted by patient-reported outcomes 
      is unknown. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe patient-reported outcomes 
      among patients with ICDs compared by: ICD indication and generator type (ICD or 
      cardiac resynchronisation therapy ICD), and to determine whether patient-reported 
      outcomes at discharge predict mortality, ICD therapy and readmission. METHODS: A 
      national cross-sectional survey at hospital discharge ( n=998) with register 
      follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale, Short Form-12, HeartQoL, EQ-5D and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. 
      Register data: ICD therapy, readmissions and mortality within one year following 
      discharge. RESULTS: Patients with primary prevention ICDs had significantly worse 
      patient-reported outcomes at discharge than patients with secondary prevention 
      ICDs. Likewise, patients with cardiac resynchronisation therapy ICDs had 
      significantly worse patient-reported outcomes at discharge than patients without 
      cardiac resynchronisation therapy. One-year mortality was predicted by 
      patient-reported outcomes, with the highest hazard ratio (HR) being anxiety (HR 
      2.02; 1.06-3.86), but was not predicted by indication or cardiac 
      resynchronisation therapy. ICD therapy and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular 
      fibrillation were not predicted by patient-reported outcomes, indication or 
      cardiac resynchronisation therapy. Overall, patient-reported outcomes predicted 
      readmissions, e.g. symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted all readmissions 
      within 3 months (HR 1.50; 1.13-1.98) and 1.47 (1.07-2.03), respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with primary indication ICDs and cardiac resynchronisation 
      therapy ICDs report worse patient-reported outcomes than patients with secondary 
      indication and no cardiac resynchronisation therapy. Patient-reported outcomes 
      such as mental health, quality of life and symptom burden predict one-year 
      mortality and acute and planned hospital readmissions.

LID - 6028494
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) therapy is feasible and 
      safe in patients as a transient protection against sudden cardiac death (SCD). 
      However, the impact of WCD therapy on quality of life (QoL) has not been studied. 
      METHODS: In our single-centre study, 109 consecutive patients with a prescription 
      of WCD were retrospectively analysed. Quality of life has been assessed by a 
      standardized questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L, modified). Additionally, clinical baseline 
      and follow-up data and recorded arrhythmic episodes were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean 
      WCD therapy time was 56.2 (+/- 42.4) days, with a daily wear time of 19.7 (+/- 5) 
      hours. A total of 3441 arrhythmia episodes were detected. Of these, 27 (1%) were 
      adequate but did not require shock therapy. Likewise, no inadequate shock therapy 
      occurred. WCD therapy negatively affected quality of life: 43% of patients 
      reported mental health issues. 37% reported pain or discomfort. Self-care, usual 
      activities, and mobility were restricted in 17%, 48%, and 36%, respectively. 29% 
      were afraid of receiving shock therapy, and 48% suffered from sleep disturbance. 
      However, 64% indicated having felt safe during WCD therapy. Accordingly, average 
      quality of life was rated 70/100 points. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, no SCD was 
      prevented by WCD therapy. In contrast, in this preliminary study quality of life 
      was reduced. Thus, careful recommendation of WCD therapy for high risk patients 
      should be considered.

TI  - Well-being among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a cross-sectional 
      retrospective study in Sweden.
PG  - e021729

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The psychological outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
      has been studied more extensively in recent years. Still, not much is known about 
      the well-being among OHCA survivors. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 
      we aim to investigate post-OHCA well-being among patients with a good 
      neurological outcome, 3 months after the cardiac event. To assess well-being, we 
      analyse the frequency of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) and health within this group. Further, we aim to evaluate the importance 
      of five prognostic factors for post-OHCA well-being. METHODS: Data collection 
      took place between 2008 and 2012, and every OHCA survivor within one region of 
      Sweden, with a cerebral performance category (CPC) score of </=2 at discharge, was 
      asked to participate. Survivors were identified through the Swedish 
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry, and postal questionnaires were sent out 
      3 months after the OHCA. The survey included Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      scale (HADS), PTSD Checklist Civilian version (PCL-C) and European Quality of 
      Life 5 Dimensions 3 level (EQ-5D-3L). RESULTS: Of 298 survivors, 150 were 
      eligible for this study and 94 responded. The mean time from OHCA to follow-up 
      was 88 days. There was no significant difference between respondents and 
      non-respondents in terms of sex, age, cardiac arrest circumstances or in-hospital 
      interventions. 48 participants reported reduced well-being, and young age was the 
      only factor significantly correlated to this outcome (p=0.02). Women reported 
      significantly higher scores in HADS (p=0.001) and PCL-C (p<0.001). Women also 
      reported significantly lower EQ-5D index values (p=0.002) and EQ-visual analogue 
      scale scores (p=0.002) compared with men. CONCLUSION: Reduced well-being is 
      experienced by half of OHCA survivors with a CPC score </=2, and young age is 
      negatively correlated to this outcome. The frequency of anxiety and PTSD is 
      higher among women, who also report worse health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on long-term functional outcome and quality of life (QoL) after 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are limited. We assessed long-term 
      functional outcome and health-related QoL of OHCA survivors regardless of arrest 
      aetiology. METHODS: All adult unconscious OHCA patients treated in 21 Finnish 
      ICUs between March 2010 and February 2011 were followed. Barthel Index (BI), 
      activities of daily living (ADL), accommodation, help needed and received, 
      working status, car driving and self-experienced cognitive deficits were assessed 
      in 1-year survivors (N = 206, 40.9% of the original FINNRESUSCI cohort) with a 
      structured telephone interview. Health-related QoL and more complex ADL-functions 
      were evaluated by EQ-5D and instrumental ADL questionnaires. RESULTS: Good 
      outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 1 or 2, had been reached by 
      90.3% of survivors. The median BI score was 100, and 91.3% of survivors were 
      independent in basic ADL-functions. The great majority of survivors were living 
      at home, only 8.7% lived in a sheltered home or needed institutionalized care. Of 
      home-living survivors 71.4% scored high in instrumental ADL assessment. The 
      majority (72.6%) of survivors who were working previously had returned to work. 
      Health-related QoL was similar as in age- and gender-adjusted Finnish population. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Long-term functional outcome was good in over 90% of patients 
      surviving OHCA, with health-related quality of life similar to that of an age and 
      gender matched population.

TI  - Longer-term quality of life following major trauma: age only significantly 
      affects outcome after the age of 80 years.
PG  - 773-785
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S158344 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Against the background of conflicting data on the topic, this study aimed to 
      determine the differences in longer-term patient outcomes following major trauma 
      with regard to age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective trauma center survey of 
      survivors of trauma (>/=16 years) was carried out employing a New Injury Severity 
      Score (NISS) >/=8 to investigate the influence of age on working capacity and 
      several outcome scores, such as the trauma medical outcomes study Short Form-36 
      (physical component [PCS] and mental component [MCS]), the Euro Quality of Life 
      (EuroQoL), or the Trauma Outcome Profile (TOP) at least 1 year following injury. 
      Chi square tests, t-tests, and Pearson correlations were used as univariate; 
      stepwise regression as multivariate analysis. Significance was set at p<0.05. 
      RESULTS: In all, 718 major trauma patients (53.4+/-19.4 years; NISS 18.4+/-9.2) 
      participated in the study. Multivariate analysis showed only low associations of 
      patient or trauma characteristics with longer-term outcome scores, highest for 
      the Injury Severity Score of the extremities with the PCS (R(2)=0.08) or the 
      working capacity of employed patients (n=383; R(2)=0.04). For age, overall 
      associations were even lower (best with the PCS, R(2)=0.04) or could not be 
      revealed at all (TOP or MCS). Subgroup analysis with regard to decennia revealed 
      the age effect to be mainly attributable to patients aged >/=80, who presented with 
      a significantly worse outcome compared to younger people in all overall and 
      physical component scores (p<0.001). In patients under 80 years an association of 
      age was only found for EuroQoL (R(2)=0.01) and the PCS (R(2)=0.03). CONCLUSION: 
      Given the small impact of age on the longer-term outcomes of major trauma 
      patients, at least up to the age of 80 years, resuscitation as well as 
      rehabilitation strategies should be adapted accordingly.

AB  - Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that 
      focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials 
      limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative 
      (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their 
      partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison 
      Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for 
      cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended 
      for large, randomised clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as 
      pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy 
      studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative 
      interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of 
      potential outcome domains. This list was prioritised through a Delphi process, 
      which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An 
      international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that 
      led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these 
      outcomes should be measured and further characterised relevant measurement tools. 
      Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies 
      of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological 
      function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival 
      status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or 
      both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with >/=1 tools from Health 
      Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 
      90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources 
      allow. (c) 2018 European Resuscitation Council and American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data identifies extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation 
      (eCPR) as a potential addendum of conventional cardiopulmonary-resuscitation 
      (cCPR) in highly specified circumstances and selected patients. However, 
      consented criteria indicating eCPR are lacking. Therefore we provide first 
      insights into the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes of patients 
      treated with eCPR in a real world setting. METHODS: Retrospective single-center 
      experience of 60 consecutive patients treated with eCPR between 01/2014 and 
      06/2016 providing 1-year survival- and HRQoL data obtained through the Short-Form 
      36 Survey (SF-36) after refractory out-of-hospital- (OHCA) and in-hospital 
      cardiac arrest (IHCA) of presumed cardiac etiology. RESULTS: Resuscitation 
      efforts until initiation of eCPR averaged 66 +/- 35 min and 63.3% of the patients 
      suffered from OHCA. Fifty-five (91.7%) of the overall events were witnessed and 
      bystander-CPR was performed in 73.3% (n = 44) of cases. Cause of arrest was 
      dominated by acute myocardial infarction (AMI, 66.7%) and initial rhythm slightly 
      outbalanced by ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT 53.3%). 12-month 
      survival was 31%. Survivors experienced more often bystander-CPR (p = .001) and a 
      shorter duration of cCPR (p = .002). While mid-term survivors' perceived HRQoL 
      was compromised compared to controls (p <== .0001 for PF, RP, RE and BP; p = .007 
      for GH; p = .016 for SF; p = .030 for MH; p = .108 for VT), scores however 
      resembled HRQoL of subjects on hemodialysis, following cardiogenic shock or 
      pulmonary failure treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 
      CONCLUSIONS: While HRQoL scores of our survivors ranged markedly below controls, 
      compared to patients on chronic hemodialysis, following ECMO for cardiogenic 
      shock or pulmonary failure most of the discrepancies ameliorated. Thus, 
      successfull eCPR in properly selected patients does translate into an encouraging 
      HRQoL approximating chronic renal failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiac arrest is high, with a poor survival rate of 
      8-14%. Currently, only limited evidence is available about long-term consequences 
      of cardiac arrest on quality of life of caregivers. AIMS: First, to determine the 
      level of daily functioning and quality of life in caregivers of cardiac arrest 
      survivors two years after the cardiac arrest. Second, to study the long-term 
      impact of witnessing the event of a cardiac arrest. METHODS: A longitudinal 
      cohort study including caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors. Participants 
      received a questionnaire at home. Outcome variables were instrumental daily 
      activities(FAI), emotional functioning(HADS), fatigue(FSS), caregiver 
      strain(CSI), impact of event(IES), and quality of life(SF36). RESULTS: 57 
      caregivers (89% female, age 56,9 +/- 12 years) participated. Two years after the 
      cardiac arrest, quality of life of caregivers equals that of the general 
      population, although almost 30% still scored high on the Impact of Events Scale. 
      Mean IES-, FSS-, CSI and FAI-scores were increased as compared to the general 
      population (P < 0.001). Two years after the cardiac arrest, caregivers that 
      witnessed the resuscitation (IES = 23.6 +/- 14.9) still experienced significantly 
      more trauma related stress than caregivers that did not witness the resuscitation 
      (11.9 +/- 12.5; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Two years after the cardiac arrest, quality 
      of life of caregivers is quite good, but almost one third of the caregivers still 
      experience a high level of trauma-related stress, especially in those that 
      witnessed the resuscitation. Future research will have to focus on the 
      effectiveness of support programs for caregivers of survivors of cardiac arrest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is 
      increasing. However, there is a lack of data concerning long-term quality of life 
      of affected patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the 
      psychological effects of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: 
      All patients who were admitted to our hospital after OHCA between 01 January 2008 
      and 30 June 2015 and could be discharged in good neurological condition were 
      asked to fill out the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 36-Item Short 
      Form Health Survey (SF-36). For statistical analysis, the mean, standard 
      deviation and student's t‑test were used (level of significance p < 0.05). 
      RESULTS: Of 280 OHCA survivors, 56 patients (20.0%) were discharged from the 
      hospital in good neurological condition. Of those, 20 patients (35.7%) were 
      willing to participate in this study, among them 11 women and 9 men. Compared to 
      the cohort of the German normative data, the results of the SF-36 questionnaire 
      of OHCA survivors showed significantly lower values in all SF-36 subscales and 
      also for the summary scores. There was no significant difference compared to 
      patients with myocardial infarction. Average values of the IES-R subscales for 
      intrusion and avoidance were 9.9 +/- 9.3 and 9.7 +/- 7.7, respectively, and 11.3 +/- 
      7.4 for hyperarousal. Calculations indicated the suspected diagnosis of 
      posttraumatic stress disorder in 2 of the 20 patients (10%). DISCUSSION: Even in 
      patients who could be discharged from the hospital after OHCA in good 
      neurological condition, the quality of life is significantly lower compared to 
      the standard population but not compared to patients with myocardial infarction. 
      The data also suggest that a relevant number of patients after OHCA is affected 
      by posttraumatic stress disorder. Further research efforts on optimization of 
      post-resuscitation care should not only focus on survival rates but also on 
      improving quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The survival rate of cardiac arrest patients is increasing. Our aim 
      was to compare the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest and analyse 
      the factors associated with outcome. METHODS: All adult cardiac arrest patients 
      admitted to the Tampere University Hospital intensive care unit between 2009 and 
      2011 were included in a retrospective follow-up study if surviving to discharge 
      and were asked to return a questionnaire after 6 months. Data on patient 
      demographics and pre-arrest quality of life were retrieved from medical records. 
      Data are given as means (SD) or medians [Q(1) , Q(3) ]. We used logistic 
      regression to identify factors associated with better quality of life after 
      cardiac arrest. RESULTS: Six months after cardiac arrest, 36% (79/222) were alive 
      and 70% (55/79) of those patients completed the follow-up EuroQoL (EQ-5D) quality 
      of life questionnaire. Median values for the EQ-5D before and after cardiac 
      arrest were 0.89 [0.63, 1] and 0.89 [0.62, 1], respectively (P = 0.75). Only the 
      EQ-5D prior to cardiac arrest was associated with better quality of life 
      afterwards (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.3; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life 
      remained good after cardiac arrest especially in those patients who had good 
      quality of life before cardiac arrest.

AB  - AIM: High quality evidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors' 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can measure the long-term impact of CA. 
      The aim of this study was to critically appraise the evidence of psychometric 
      quality and acceptability of measures used in the assessment of HRQoL in cardiac 
      arrest survivors. METHODS: Systematic literature searches (2004-2017) and named 
      author searches to identify articles pertaining to the measurement of HRQoL. Data 
      on study quality, measurement and practical properties were extracted and 
      assessed against international standards. RESULTS: From 356 reviewed abstracts, 
      69 articles were assessed in full. 25 provided evidence for 10 measures of HRQoL: 
      one condition-specific; three generic profile measures; two generic index; and 
      four utility measures. Although limited, evidence for measurement validity was 
      strongest for the HUI3 and SF-36. However, evidence for reliability, content 
      validity, responsiveness and interpretability and acceptability was generally 
      limited or not available in the CA population for all measures. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      review has demonstrated that a measure of quality of life specific to OHCA 
      survivors is not available. Limited evidence of validity exists for one utility 
      measure - the HUI3 - and a generic profile - the SF-36. Robust evidence of the 
      quality and acceptability of HRQoL measures in OHCA was limited or not available. 
      Future collaborative research must seek to urgently establish the relevance and 
      acceptability of these measures to OHCA survivors, to establish robust evidence 
      of essential measurement and practical properties over the short and long-term, 
      and to inform future HRQoL assessment in the OHCA population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The PARAMEDIC cluster randomised trial evaluated the LUCAS mechanical 
      chest compression device, and did not find evidence that use of mechanical chest 
      compression led to an improvement in survival at 30 days. This paper reports 
      patient outcomes from admission to hospital to 12 months after randomisation. 
      METHODS: Information about hospital length of stay and intensive care management 
      was obtained through linkage with Hospital Episode Statistics and the Intensive 
      Care National Audit and Research Centre. Patients surviving to hospital discharge 
      were approached to complete questionnaires (SF-12v2, EQ-5D, MMSE, HADS and 
      PTSD-CL) at 90days and 12 months. The study is registered with Current Controlled 
      Trials, number ISRCTN08233942. RESULTS: 377 patients in the LUCAS arm and 658 
      patients in the manual chest compression were admitted to hospital. Hospital and 
      intensive care length of stay were similar. Long term follow-up assessments were 
      limited by poor response rates (53.7% at 3 months and 55.6% at 12 months). 
      Follow-up rates were lower in those with worse neurological function. Among 
      respondents, long term health related quality of life outcomes and emotional 
      well-being was similar between groups. Cognitive function, measured by MMSE, was 
      marginally lower in the LUCAS arm mean 26.9 (SD 3.7) compared to control mean 
      28.0 (SD 2.3), adjusted mean difference -1.5 (95% CI -2.6 to -0.4). CONCLUSION: 
      There were no clinically important differences identified in outcomes at long 
      term follow-up between those allocated to the mechanical chest compression 
      compared to those receiving manual chest compression.

TI  - Long-term Outcome After Survival of a Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Longitudinal

PG  - 530-539
LID - 10.1177/1545968317697032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cardiac arrest can lead to hypoxic brain injury, which can affect 
      all levels of functioning. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 1-year outcome and the 
      pattern of recovery after surviving a cardiac arrest. METHODS: This was a 
      multicenter, prospective longitudinal cohort study with 1 year of follow-up 
      (measurements 2 weeks, 3 months, 1 year). On function level, physical/cardiac 
      function (New York Heart Association Classification), cognition (Cognitive Log 
      [Cog-log], Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), emotional functioning (Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale), and fatigue (Fatigue 
      Severity Scale) were assessed. In addition, level of activities (Frenchay 
      Activities Index, FAI), participation (Community Integration Questionnaire [CIQ] 
      and return to work), and quality of life (EuroQol 5D, EuroQol Visual Analogue 
      Scale, SF-36, Quality of Life after Brain Injury) were measured. RESULTS: In this 
      cohort, 141 cardiac arrest survivors were included. At 1 year, 14 (13%) survivors 
      scored below cutoff on the Cog-log. Both anxiety and depression were present in 
      16 (15%) survivors, 29 (28%) experienced posttraumatic stress symptoms and 55 
      (52%), severe fatigue. Scores on the FAI and the CIQ were, on average, 
      respectively 96% and 92% of the prearrest scores. Of those previously working, 41 
      (72%) had returned to work. Most recovery of cognitive function and quality of 
      life occurred within the first 3 months, with further improvement on some domains 
      of quality of life up to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term outcome in 
      terms of activities, participation, and quality of life after cardiac arrest is 
      reassuring. Nevertheless, fatigue is common; problems with cognition and emotions 
      occur; and return to work can be at risk.

AB  - AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LUCAS-2, a mechanical device for 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as compared to manual chest compressions in 
      adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We analysed 
      patient-level data from a large, pragmatic, multi-centre trial linked to 
      administrative secondary care data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to 
      measure healthcare resource use, costs and outcomes in both arms. A within-trial 
      analysis using quality adjusted life years derived from the EQ-5D-3L was 
      conducted at 12-month follow-up and results were extrapolated to the lifetime 
      horizon using a decision-analytic model. RESULTS: 4471 patients were enrolled in 
      the trial (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 group, 2819 assigned to the control 
      group). At 12 months, 89 (5%) patients survived in the LUCAS-2 group and 175 (6%) 
      survived in the manual CPR group. In the vast majority of analyses conducted, 
      both within-trial and by extrapolation of the results over a lifetime horizon, 
      manual CPR dominates LUCAS-2. In other words, patients in the LUCAS-2 group had 
      poorer health outcomes (i.e. lower QALYs) and incurred higher health and social 
      care costs. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the use of the mechanical 
      chest compression device LUCAS-2 represents poor value for money when compared to 
      standard manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

AB  - AIM: To describe health status and psychological distress among in-hospital 
      cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors in relation to gender. METHODS: This national 
      register study consists of data from follow-up registration of IHCA survivors 3-6 
      months post cardiac arrest (CA) in Sweden. A questionnaire was sent to the 
      survivors, including measurements of health status (EQ-5D-5L) and psychological 
      distress (HADS). RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, 594 IHCA survivors were included 
      in the study. The median values for EQ-5D-5L index and EQ VAS among survivors 
      were 0.78 (q1-q3=0.67-0.86) and 70 (q1-q3=50-80) respectively. The values were 
      significantly lower (p<0.001) in women compared to men. In addition, women 
      reported more problems than men in all dimensions of EQ-5D-5L, except self-care. 
      A majority of the respondents reported no problems with anxiety (85.4%) and/or 
      symptoms of depression (87.0%). Women reported significantly more problems with 
      anxiety (p<0.001) and symptoms of depression (p<0.001) compared to men. Gender 
      was significantly associated with poorer health status and more psychological 
      distress. No interaction effects for gender and age were found. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although the majority of survivors reported acceptable health status and no 
      psychological distress, a substantial proportion reported severe problems. Women 
      reported worse health status and more psychological distress compared to men. 
      Therefore, a higher proportion of women may be in need of support. Health care 
      professionals should make efforts to identify health problems among survivors and 
      offer individualised support when needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even if a large majority of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
      survivors appear to have a good neurological recovery with no important 
      sequellae, whether health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is altered is less 
      explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HRQOL was evaluated by telephone interview using 
      SF-36 questionnaire. Each OHCA case was age and gender-matched with 4 controls 
      from the French general population. Association between current condition of the 
      survivors with the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire was investigated using 
      MANCOVA. Cluster analysis was performed to identify patterns of HRQOL among CPC1 
      survivors. RESULTS: 255 patients discharged alive from our referral centre 
      between 2000 and 2013 (median age of 55y [45,64], 73.7% males) were interviewed. 
      Global physical and mental components did not differ between CPC 1 survivors and 
      controls (47.0 vs. 47.1, p=0.88 and 46.4 vs. 46.9, p=0.45) but substantially 
      differed between CPC2, CPC3 and the corresponding controls. Younger age, male 
      gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy at telephone interview 
      were significantly associated with better scores in each SF-36 dimensions. 
      Cluster analysis individualized 4 distinct subgroups of CPC1 patients 
      characterised by progressively increased score of SF-36. Return to work and 
      daily-life autonomy were differently distributed across these 4 groups while 
      pre-hospital Utstein variables were not. CONCLUSION: HRQOL of CPC1 OHCA survivors 
      appeared similar to that of the general population, but patients with CPC2 or 3 
      had altered HRQOL. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and 
      daily-life autonomy were independently associated with a better HRQOL.

LID - 10.1111/pace.13034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (iVF) is diagnosed in cardiac 
      arrest survivors without an identifiable cause. Data regarding the health-related 
      quality of life (HRQoL) in iVF patients are lacking. The purpose of this study 
      was to investigate the HRQoL of iVF patients and to compare it to patients with 
      an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) diagnosed with an underlying 
      disease and healthy subjects. METHODS: In 61 iVF patients with an ICD (iVF-ICD) 
      and 59 ICD patients with a diagnosis (diagnosis-ICD), HRQoL was assessed using 
      the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), 
      the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the ICD Patient Concerns (ICDC) 
      Questionnaire. In addition, 860 healthy subjects completed the SF-12. RESULTS: 
      IVF-ICD showed similar SF-12 physical summary scores compared with diagnosis-ICD 
      patients (50.8 [interquartile range (IQR) = 42.1-53.9] vs 54.1 [IQR = 46.5-58.3]; 
      P = 0.080) and healthy subjects (51.8 [IQR = 45.9-54.1]; P = 0.691). The mental 
      summary score was impaired in iVF-ICD patients compared with diagnosis-ICD 
      patients (45.9 [IQR = 40.7-49.4] vs 54.6 [IQR = 46.0-57.9]; P < 0.001) and 
      healthy subjects (47.7 [IQR = 43.0-50.4]; P = 0.027). Scores on all five EQ-5D 
      domains were similar between iVF-ICD patients and diagnosis-ICD patients, as well 
      as symptoms of severe depression (19% vs 12%; P = 0.101). ICD concerns were 
      similar between iVF-ICD and diagnosis-ICD patients (ICDC-scores 2 vs 2; P = 
      0.494). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that there is a reduced mental HRQoL in 
      patients with iVF compared to other cardiac arrest survivors. Screening and 
      treatment of psychological distress should therefore be considered in iVF 
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to gain insight in the functioning of caregivers of 
      cardiac arrest survivors at 12 months after a cardiac arrest. Secondly, the 
      course of the wellbeing of the caregivers during the first year was studied. 
      Finally, factors that are associated with a higher care burden at 12 months after 
      the cardiac arrest were investigated. SUBJECTS: A total of 195 family caregivers 
      of cardiac arrest survivors were included. MAIN MEASURES: Quality of life (SF-36, 
      EuroQol-VAS), caregiver strain (CSI) and emotional functioning (HADS, IES) were 
      measured at two weeks, three months and one year after the cardiac arrest. 
      Thereby, the caregiver was asked to fill out the cognitive failure questionnaire 
      (CFQ) to evaluate their view on the cognitive status of the patient. RESULTS: 
      Caregiver strain was high in 16 (15%) of the caregivers at 12 months. Anxiety was 
      present in 33 (25%) caregivers and depression in 18 (14%) caregivers at 12 
      months. The repeated measures MANOVA showed that during the first year the 
      following variables improved significantly: SF-36 domains social and mental 
      health, role physical, role emotional and vitality, caregiver strain, HADS and 
      IES ( P<0.001). At 12 months caregiver strain correlated significantly (explained 
      variance 63%, P=0.03) with caregiver HADS ( P=0.01), EuroQol-VAS ( P=0.02), and 
      the CFQ ( P<0.001), all measured at 12 months after the cardiac arrest. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall wellbeing of the caregivers improves during the first year 
      up to normal levels, but caregivers with emotional problems or perceived 
      cognitive problems at 12 months are at risk for developing a higher care burden.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although a number of validated health-related quality of life 
      (HR-QOL) instruments exist for critical care populations, a standardised approach 
      to assessing the HR-QOL of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors has 
      not been developed. We sought to compare the responses of 12-month OHCA survivors 
      to three HR-QOL and functional recovery instruments, and assess instrument 
      validity. METHODS: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry invited 
      12-month OHCA survivors to participate in telephone follow-up between January 
      2011 and December 2015. Responders provided answers to the 12 Item Short Form 
      Health Survey (SF-12), Three-Level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L) and the Glasgow Outcome 
      Scale-Extended (GOSE). The SF-12 was also used to derive the SF-6D. Responses 
      were used to assess the interpretability and construct validity of the 
      instruments. RESULTS: A total of 1188 patients and proxies responded. Large 
      ceiling effects were observed for the EQ-5D-3L (patients=46%, proxies=23%). 
      Substantial variability was also observed in SF-6D responses for patients who 
      reported full health according to the EQ-5D-3L. For patient responders, the 
      strongest correlations were observed between the EQ-5D-3L index score and SF-6D 
      (rho=0.65, p<0.001), and between the SF-6D and SF-12 physical component (rho=0.69, 
      p<0.001). The distribution of the SF-6D and EQ-5D-3L differed significantly for 
      patients reporting a lower or upper moderate GOSE outcome and lower or upper good 
      recovery (p<0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D-3L demonstrated 
      limited interpretability due to the presence of ceiling effects. However, the 
      measurement properties of the SF-12, SF-6D and GOSE suggest that these may be 
      useful measures of HR-QOL and functional recovery in OHCA survivors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention service 
      for cardiac arrest survivors called 'Stand still ..., and move on' from a societal 
      perspective. INTERVENTION: This concise nursing intervention consists of 
      screening for cognitive and emotional problems, information provision and 
      support, self-management promotion, and further referral if necessary. Earlier 
      research confirmed the feasibility of the intervention and its effectiveness in 
      improving emotional functioning and quality of life. METHODS: In this multicentre 
      randomized controlled trial with one year follow-up 185 patients were included 
      between April 2007 and December 2010. The experimental group received the 
      intervention, the control group received care-as-usual. Intervention costs, other 
      direct healthcare costs (e.g. hospital care, rehabilitation, medication, home 
      care) and indirect costs (productivity loss) were measured during ten months 
      using monthly cost-diaries. The economic evaluation comprised a cost-utility 
      analysis (SF-36) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (QOLIBRI) using bootstrapping 
      (5000 replications) to quantify uncertainty concerning the incremental cost 
      effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the probability of the intervention being 
      cost-effective was estimated. To check the robustness of the findings, two 
      sensitivity analyses were performed using the EQ-5D and the complete cases 
      respectively. RESULTS: Of 136 (74%) participants sufficient data concerning costs 
      were collected to be included in this economic evaluation. Intervention costs 
      were on average euro127 (SD 85). No significant differences between groups were 
      found with regard to overall costs. The ICERs of the cost-utility and the 
      cost-effectiveness analyses supported the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. 
      The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 54-76% for the SF-36 
      and 94% for the QOLIBRI. Findings were robust. CONCLUSION: The intervention 
      'Stand still ..., and move on' has positive societal economic effects and has a 
      high probability to be cost-effective. Implementation in regular healthcare is 
      recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN74835019.

      care: long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort from CHEST.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydroxyethyl starch for fluid resuscitation in critically ill 
      patients is not associated with improved short-term patient-centred outcomes 
      compared with crystalloid fluid solutions. However, its effect on longer term 
      health economic outcomes has not been reported. METHODS: We did a prespecified 
      cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort of patients from New South Wales enrolled 
      in the Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST), who were randomised 
      to treatment with either 6% hydroxyethyl starch with a molecular weight of 130 kD 
      and a molar substitution ratio of 0.4 or 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) for fluid 
      resuscitation. Clinical outcomes were mortality and life-years gained at 6 months 
      and 24 months, health-related quality of life at 6 months, and quality-adjusted 
      life-years gained at 6 months. Health economic outcomes were hospital and 
      intensive-care unit (ICU) resource use and costs at 24 months and 
      cost-effectiveness, which we defined as the probability of reaching a 
      willingness-to-pay threshold of less than A$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
      gained at 6 months and $100 000 per life-year gained at 24 months. CHEST is 
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00935168. FINDINGS: 3537 (51%) of 
      7000 patients were enrolled into CHEST from New South Wales, of whom 3450 (98%) 
      were included in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Mortality at both 6 months and 
      24 months did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 
      months: 397/1684 [24%] vs 382/1706 [22%]; relative risk [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 
      0.93-1.19; p=0.41; 24 months: 586/1687 [35%] vs 594/1708 [35%]; RR 1.00, 95% CI 
      0.91-1.10; p=0.89). The mean number of life-years gained at 6 months and 24 
      months was similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 
      0.41 days [SD 0.18] vs 0.41 days [0.17]; p=0.25; 24 months: 1.46 years [SD 0.80] 
      vs 1.47 years [0.79]; p=0.72). At 6 months, the mean health-related quality of 
      life score was 0.67 (SD 0.34) with hydroxyethyl starch versus 0.69 (0.35) with 
      saline (p=0.33). The mean number of quality-adjusted life-years gained did not 
      differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups at 6 months (0.26 days 
      [SD 0.18] vs 0.26 days [0.18]; p=0.33). Total hospital costs (including ICU 
      costs) at 24 months were similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline 
      groups (A$62 196 [55 935] vs $62 617 [56 452]; p=0.83). The probability that 
      hydroxyethyl starch was cost effective was 11% at 6 months and 29% at 24 months. 
      INTERPRETATION: Although longer term clinical outcomes did not differ between 
      patients resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch or saline in the ICU, from a 
      health-care payer's perspective, the probability that hydroxyethyl starch is cost 
      effective in these patients is low. FUNDING: Division of Critical Care and

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively investigate cognitive recovery from 3 to 12 months 
      after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and the 
      associations between cognitive performance at 3 months and health-related quality 
      of life (HRQL), psychological distress and work status after 12 months. METHODS: 
      At both assessments, neuropsychological tests were used to measure aspects of 
      general mental ability, verbal and visual memory, psychomotor speed and executive 
      function. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to measure mental and physical HRQL, 
      and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess psychological 
      distress. RESULTS: 33 survivors completed both exams (31 males, mean age 58.6 
      years, SD=13). The OHCAs were witnessed and due to cardiac origins. Nine patients 
      were awake at admission to the hospital. Longer coma duration was associated with 
      poorer cognitive results. Memory impairments were the most common symptom. The 
      mean changes and effect sizes indicated minor improvements in cognitive 
      performance from 3 to 12 months (Hedges g</=.26). Reliable change indices for an 
      individual's results further confirmed the stability of the group statistics. The 
      HADS scores showed increased depressive symptoms, and mental HRQL was reduced 
      from 3 to 12 months. Higher reports of psychological distress were related to 
      worse HRQL. Work participation increased. Better cognitive results at 3 months 
      were correlated with better HRQL and return to work at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The current data describe stability in results from 3 to 12 months. A worse 
      cognitive performance at 3 months and higher reports of psychological distress 
      were associated with lower HRQL.

AB  - AIM: Reports on differences between respondents and non-respondents of 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors are sparse. This study compares 
      respondents with non-respondents in a follow-up study of a consecutive sample of 
      OHCA survivors and describes the relation between respondents' self-reported 
      morbidity and health. METHODS/DESIGN: Questionnaires were administered within 12 
      months after the OHCA. The study population was adult patients who had survived 
      an OHCA during 2008 to 2011, with a cerebral performance score of </=2 at 
      discharge. The patients were identified through the Swedish registry of OHCA. The 
      Self-administered comorbidity questionnaire and EQ VAS (Euroqol questionnaire 
      visual analogue scale) was used to measure morbidity and health status. RESULTS: 
      Of 298 survivors, 224 were eligible for the study and 127 responded. Mean time 
      from cardiac arrest (CA) to follow up was 178 days. Comparing the 127 respondents 
      with the 97 lost to follow-up and non-respondents, no significant differences 
      were found in terms of age, sex, factors at resuscitation and in-hospital 
      interventions. The EQ VAS median was 75 (25th,75th percentile 60,80)). Self-rated 
      health differed between respondents reporting 0-2 conditions (n=68) and 
      respondents reporting more than two (n=43), median EQ VAS 78 (68,90) and 65 
      (50,80)), respectively; p-value 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a limited response 
      rate, representativeness in terms of patient characteristics among survivors of 
      OHCA with an acceptable cerebral function is achievable. A considerable 
      proportion of the survivors lived with the burden of multi-morbidity which 
      worsened health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Approximately half of the survivors of cardiac arrest have 
      cognitive impairments due to hypoxic brain injury. To describe the outcome after 
      a cardiac arrest, the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) is frequently used. 
      Although widely used, its validity is still debatable. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 
      the construct validity of the Cerebral Performance Category in survivors of a 
      cardiac arrest. Participants were 18 years and older that survived a cardiac 
      arrest more than six months. METHODS: Cross-sectional design. A method to 
      administer the CPC in a structured and reproducible manner was developed. This 
      'Structured CPC' was administered by a structured interview. Construct variables 
      were Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ), Barthel Index (BI), Frenchay Activity 
      Index (FAI), Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and Quality of Life after 
      Brain Injury (Qolibri). Associations were tested based on Spearman correlation 
      coefficients. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants responded. In 58 (94%) patients 
      the CPC was determined, resulting in CPC 1 (48%), CPC 2 (23%) and CPC 3 (23%). 
      The CPC-scoring correlated significantly with the CFQ (r=-0.40); BI (r=-0.57); 
      FAI (r=-0.65), CIQ (r=-0.53) and Qolibri (r=-0.67). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: 
      In this study we developed the 'Structured CPC' to improve the transparency and 
      reproducibility of the original CPC. A moderate correlation between the 
      'Structured CPC' and the constructs 'activities', 'participation' and 'quality of 
      life' confirmed the validity of the 'Structured CPC'. CLINICAL MESSAGE: The 
      'Structured CPC' can be used as an instrument to measure the level of functioning 
      after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Comparison of patient and partner quality of life and health outcomes in the 
      first year after an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
PG  - 94-106

AB  - Recovery following an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) impacts both 
      the patient and partner, often in divergent ways. Patients may have had a cardiac 
      arrest or cardiac arrhythmias, whereas partners may have to perform CPR and 
      manage the ongoing challenges of heart disease therapy. Currently, support for 
      post-ICD care focuses primarily on restoring patient functioning with few 
      interventions available to partners who serve as primary support. This 
      descriptive study examined and compared patterns of change for both patients and 
      partners during the first year post-ICD implantation. For this longitudinal 
      study, the sample included 42 of 55 (76.4 %) patient-partner dyads who 
      participated in the 'usual care' group of a larger intervention RCT with patients 
      following ICD implant for secondary prevention of cardiac arrest. Measures taken 
      at across five time points (at hospital discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months 
      follow up) tracked physical function (SF-12 PCS, symptoms); psychological 
      adjustment (SF-12 MCS; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; CES-D); relationship impact 
      (Family Functioning, DOII; Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity, MIS); and 
      healthcare utilization (ED visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). Repeated 
      measures analysis of variance was used to characterize and compare outcome trends 
      for patients and partners across the first 12 months of recovery. Patients were 
      66.5 +/- 11.3 (mean + SD) years old, predominately Caucasian male (91 %), with 
      Charlson co-morbidities of 4.4 +/- 2.4. Partners were 62.5 +/- 11.1 years old, 
      predominantly female (91 %) with Charlson co-morbidities of 2.9 +/- 3.0. Patient 
      versus partner differences were observed in the pattern of physical health (F = 
      10.8, p < 0.0001); patient physical health improved while partner health showed 
      few changes. For partners compared to patients, anxiety, depression, and illness 
      demands on family functioning tended to be higher. Patient mutuality was stable, 
      while partner mutuality increased steadily (F = 2.5, p = 0.05). Patient 
      sensitivity was highest at discharge and declined; partner sensitivity increased 
      (F = 10.2, p < 0.0001) across the 12-month recovery. Outpatient visits for 
      patients versus partners differed (F = 5.0, p = 0.008) due most likely to the 
      number of required patient ICD visits. Total hospitalizations and ED visits were 
      higher for patients versus partners, but not significantly. The findings 
      highlight the potential reciprocal influences of patient and partner responses to 
      the ICD experience on health outcomes. Warranted are new, sound and feasible 
      strategies to counterbalance partner needs while simultaneously optimizing 
      patient recovery outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is an emerging option to treat 
      selected patients with cardiac arrest refractory to cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
      (CPR). Our primary objective was to determine the mortality at 30 days and at 
      hospital discharge among adult patients receiving veno-arterial ECLS for 
      refractory cardiac arrest. Our secondary objectives were to determine the 1-year 
      survival and the health-related quality of life, and to examine factors 
      associated with 30-day mortality. METHODS: In a retrospective, single-center 
      investigation within a tertiary referral center, we analyzed the prospectively 
      collected data of 49 patients rescued from refractory cardiac arrest through 
      emergent implantation of ECLS (E-CPR) (18.1% of our overall ECLS activity, 
      2005-2013), implanted in-hospital and during ongoing external cardiac massage in 
      all cases. A prospective follow-up with administration of the Medical Outcomes 
      Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire was performed. 
      RESULTS: The mean age was 47.6 +/- 1.6 years; out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
      occurred in 12% of cases; average low-flow time was 47.2 +/- 33 minutes; causes of 
      cardiac arrest were heart disease (61.2%), trauma (14.3%), respiratory disease 
      (4.1%), sepsis (2%), and miscellaneous (18.4%). PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Rates of 
      survival at E-CPR explantation and at 30 days were 42.9% and 36.7%, respectively; 
      brain death occurred in 24.5% of cases. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Increased 
      simplified acute physiology score; higher serum lactate levels and lower body 
      temperature at the time of implantation were associated with 30-day mortality. 
      Bridge to heart transplantation or implantation of a long-term ventricular assist 
      device was performed in 8.2%. No deaths occurred during the follow-up after 
      discharge (36.7% survival; average follow-up was 15.6 +/- 19.2 months). The average 
      Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores (SF-36 
      questionnaire) were, respectively, 45.2 +/- 6.8 and 48.3 +/- 7.7 among survivors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a viable treatment 
      for selected patients with cardiac arrest refractory to CPR. In our series, 
      approximately one third of rescued patients were alive at 6 months and presented 
      quality-of-life scores comparable to those previously observed in patients 
      treated with ECLS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: For survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with good 
      outcomes, it is not known whether and how health-related quality of life is 
      affected by the cognitive impairments frequently observed in these patients. This 
      study explores how neuropsychological tests of memory, exe-cutive and psychomotor 
      functioning relate to the physical and mental aspects of health-related quality 
      of life in functionally independent and community dwelling OHCA survivors 
      discharged early from hospital. METHODS: The study included 42 adult survivors 
      (mean age 62 years, 38 males). Health-related quality of life was measured 
      approximately 3 months post-OHCA with the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 
      (SF-36). Cognition was measured with established neuropsychological tests. 
      Regression analyses were used to examine associations between neuropsychological 
      domains and physical and mental health-related quality of life, respectively, 
      when controlling for age, education and length of coma. RESULTS: The physical, 
      but not the mental, component of the SF-36 was significantly worse than Norwegian 
      population data. Neuropsychological tests showed frequent impairments most often 
      in the memory domain. Worse psychomotor functioning was associated with worse 
      physical health-related quality of life, whereas worse memory performance was 
      associated with worse mental health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: The 
      cognitive impairments frequently reported in OHCA survivors with good outcomes 
      may compromise health-related quality of life. Cognitive functioning should be 
      addressed even in survivors with rapid recovery.

TI  - Near-peer emergency medicine for medical students in Port-au-Prince, Haiti: an 
      example of rethinking global health interventions in developing countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During a 3-year time frame, a partnership between medical trainees in 
      Haiti and the United States was forged with the objective of implementing an 
      emergency response skills curriculum at a medical school in Port-au-Prince. The 
      effort sought to assess the validity of a near-peer, bidirectional, 
      cross-cultural teaching format as both a global health experience for medical 
      students and as an effective component of improving medical education and 
      emergency response infrastructure in developing countries such as Haiti. METHOD: 
      Medical students and emergency medicine (EM) residents from a North American 
      medical school designed and taught a module on emergency response skills in PAP 
      and certified medical students in basic cardiac life support (BLS) over 2 
      consecutive years. Five-point Likert scale self-efficacy (SE) surveys and 
      multiple-choice fund of knowledge (FOK) assessments were distributed pre- and 
      postmodule each year and analyzed with paired t tests and longitudinal follow-up 
      of the first cohort. Narrative evaluations from participants were collected to 
      gather feedback for improving the module. FINDINGS: Challenges included bridging 
      language barriers, maintaining continuity between cohorts, and adapting to 
      unexpected schedule changes. Overall, 115 students were certified in BLS with 
      significant postcurriculum improvements in SE scores (2.75 +/- 0.93 in 2013 and 
      2.82 +/- 1.06 in 2014; P < 0.001) and FOK scores (22% +/- 15% in 2013 and 41% +/- 16% 
      in 2014; P < 0.001). Of 24 Haitian students surveyed at 1-year follow-up from the 
      2013 cohort, 7 (29.3%) reported using taught skills in real-life situations since 
      completing the module. The US group was invited to repeat the project for a third 
      year. CONCLUSIONS: Near-peer, cross-cultural academic exchange is an effective 
      method of medical student-centered emergency training in Haiti. Limitations such 
      as successfully implementing sustainability measures, addressing cultural 
      differences, and coordinating between groups persist. This scalable, 
      reproducible, and mutually beneficial collaboration between North American and 
      Haitian medical trainees is a valid conduit for building Haiti's emergency 
      response infrastructure and promoting global health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Estimate prevalence of cognitive problems due to hypoxic brain injury 
      in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors referred for cardiac 
      rehabilitation and association with quality of life as well as autonomy and 
      participation. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHOD/DESIGN: Consecutive OHCA 
      patients. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Failures 
      Questionnaire (CFQ) and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the 
      Elderly (IQCODE) were administered 4 weeks after the OHCA. Cognitive problems 
      were defined if MMSE <28, CFQ >32 or IQCODE >3.6. The Impact on Participation and 
      Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ) (participation/autonomy), the SF-36 Health Survey 
      (SF-36) (quality of life) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) 
      (anxiety/depression) were administered. Correlations between cognitive problems 
      and participation/autonomy and quality of life were calculated. RESULTS: 63 of 77 
      patients were male (82%), median age 59 years (range 15-84). MMSE median 29 
      (interquartile range 28-30), CFQ mean 20.9 (SD 9.4) and IQCODE mean 3.1 (SD 0.2). 
      Eighteen patients (23%) scored positive for cognitive problems. Significant 
      correlations were found between MMSE and IPAQ: autonomy inside (r = -0.38), 
      family role (r = -0.26), autonomy outside (r = -0.32), social relations (r = 
      -0.38) and social functioning (r = 0.32). MMSE was related to SF-36: social 
      functioning (r = 0.32). The CFQ was related to IPAQ: autonomy outdoors (r = 0.29) 
      and SF-36: bodily pain (r = -0.37), vitality (r = -0.25), mental health (r = 
      -0.35) and role emotional (r = -0.40). The IQCODE was related to IPAQ: autonomy 
      indoors (r = 0.26) and to SF-36: vitality (r = -0.33) and social functioning (r = 
      -0.41). CONCLUSION: Twenty-three percent of the patients referred for cardiac 
      rehabilitation showed cognitive problems. Associations were found between 
      cognitive problems and several aspects of participation/autonomy and perceived 
      quality of life.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Assessment of morbidity is an important component of evaluating 
      interventions for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). OBJECTIVE: 
      We evaluated among survivors of OHCA cognition, functional status, health-related 
      quality of life and depression as functions of patient and emergency medical 
      services (EMS) factors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort sub-study of a randomized 
      trial. SETTING: The parent trial studied two comparisons in persons with 
      non-traumatic OHCA treated by EMS personnel participating in the Resuscitation 
      Outcomes Consortium. PARTICIPANTS: Consenting survivors to discharge. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Telephone assessments up to 6 months after discharge included 
      neurologic function (modified Rankin score, MRS), cognitive impairment (Adult 
      Lifestyle and Function Mini Mental Status Examination, ALFI-MMSE), health-related 
      quality of life (Health Utilities Index Mark 3, HUI3) and depression (Telephone 
      Geriatric Depression Scale, T-GDS). RESULTS: Of 15,794 patients enrolled in the 
      parent trial, 729 (56% of survivors) consented. About 644 respondents (88% of 
      consented) completed >/= 1 assessment. Likelihood of assessment was associated with 
      baseline characteristics and study site. Most respondents had MRS </= 3 (82.7%), no 
      cognitive impairment (82.7% ALFI-MMSE >/= 17), no severe impairment in health 
      (71.6%, HUI3 >/= 0.7) and no depression (90.1% T-GDS</=10). Outcomes did not differ 
      by trial intervention or time from hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      The majority of patients in this large cohort who survived cardiac arrest and 
      were interviewed had no, mild or moderate health impairment. Concern about poor 
      quality of life is not a valid reason to abandon efforts to improve an EMS

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term health status and health-related quality of life 
      in survivors of cardiac arrest in childhood and their parents. In addition, to 
      identify predictors of health status and health-related quality of life. DESIGN: 
      This medical follow-up study involved consecutive children surviving cardiac 
      arrest between January 2002 and December 2011, who had been admitted to the ICU. 
      Health status was assessed with a medical interview, physical examination, and 
      the Health Utilities Index. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the 
      Child Health Questionnaires and Short-Form 36. SETTING: A tertiary care 
      university children's hospital. PATIENTS: Of the eligible 107 children, 57 (53%) 
      filled out online questionnaires and 47 visited the outpatient clinic (median 
      age, 8.7 yr; median follow-up interval, 5.6 yr). INTERVENTIONS: None. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the participants, 60% had an in-hospital 
      cardiac arrest, 90% a nonshockable rhythm, and 50% a respiratory etiology of 
      arrest. Mortality rate after hospital discharge was 10%. On health status, we 
      found that 13% had long-term neurologic deficits, 34% chronic symptoms (e.g., 
      fatigue, headache), 19% at least one sign suggestive of chronic kidney injury, 
      and 15% needed special education. Health Utilities Index scores were 
      significantly decreased on most utility scores and the overall Health Utilities 
      Index mark 3 score. Compared with Dutch normative data, parent-reported 
      health-related quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors was significantly 
      worse on general health perception, physical role functioning, parental impact, 
      and overall physical summary. On patient reports, no significant differences with 
      normative data were found. Parents reported better family cohesion and better 
      health-related quality of life for themselves on most scales. Patients' health 
      status, general health perceptions, and physical summary scores were 
      significantly associated with cardiac arrest-related preexisting condition. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Considering the impact of cardiac arrest, the overall outcome after 
      cardiac arrest in childhood is reasonably good. Prospective long-term outcome 
      research in large homogeneous groups is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of a cardiac arrest frequently have cognitive and emotional 
      problems and their quality of life is at risk. We developed a brief nursing 
      intervention to detect cognitive and emotional problems, provide information and 
      support, promote self-management, and refer them to specialised care if 
      necessary. This study examined its effectiveness. METHODS: Multicentre randomised 
      controlled trial with measurements at two weeks, three months and twelve months 
      after cardiac arrest. 185 adult cardiac arrest survivors and 155 caregivers 
      participated. Primary outcome measures were societal participation and quality of 
      life of the survivors at one year. Secondary outcomes were the patient's 
      cognitive functioning, emotional state, extended daily activities and return to 
      work, and the caregiver's well-being. Data were analysed using 'intention to 
      treat' linear mixed model analyses. RESULTS: After one year, patients in the 
      intervention group had a significantly better quality of life on SF-36 domains 
      Role Emotional (estimated mean differences (EMD)=16.38, p=0.006), Mental Health 
      (EMD=6.87, p=0.003) and General Health (EMD=8.07, p=0.010), but there was no 
      significant difference with regard to societal participation. On the secondary 
      outcome measures, survivors scored significantly better on overall emotional 
      state (HADS total, EMD=-3.25, p=0.002) and anxiety (HADS anxiety, EMD=-1.79, 
      p=0.001) at one year. Furthermore, at three months more people were back at work 
      (50% versus 21%, p=0.006). No significant differences were found for caregiver 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors can be improved by 
      an intervention focused on detecting and managing the cognitive and emotional 
      consequences of a cardiac arrest. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trials, 
      ISRCTN74835019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To study functional neurologic and cognitive outcome and 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a cohort of patients included in a 
      randomised controlled trial on glucose control following out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest (OHCA) from ventricular fibrillation (VF) treated with therapeutic 
      hypothermia. METHODS: Patients alive at 6 months after being discharged from the 
      hospital underwent clinical neurological and extensive neuropsychological 
      examinations. Functional outcome was evaluated with the Cerebral Performance 
      Category scale, the modified Rankin scale and the Barthel Index. Cognitive 
      outcome was evaluated by neuropsychological test battery including two measures 
      of each cognitive function: cognitive speed, execution, memory, verbal skills and 
      visuospatial performance. We also assessed quality of life with a HRQoL 15D 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 90 OHCA-VF patients included in the original trial, 57 
      were alive at 6 months. Of these, 52 (91%) were functionally independent and 54 
      (95%) lived at their previous home. Focal neurological deficits were scarce. 
      Intact cognitive performance was observed in 20 (49%), mild to moderate deficits 
      in 14 (34%) and severe cognitive deficits in 7 (17%) of 41 patients assessed by a 
      neuropsychologist. Cognitive impairments were most frequently detected in 
      executive and memory functions. HRQoL of the CA survivors was comparable to that 
      of age- and gender matched population. CONCLUSIONS: Functional outcome six months 
      after OHCA and therapeutic hypothermia was good in the great majority of the 
      survivors, and half of them were cognitively intact. Of note, the HRQoL of CA 
      survivors did not differ from that of age- and gender matched population.

AB  - AIM: To describe survival and causes of death after cardiac arrest (CA) and the 
      life situation of very long term survivors. METHODS: Individuals with successful 
      resuscitation treated at the Sahlgrenska university hospital during 1995-1999 and 
      presented in former CA publications were studied. Survival time and causes of 
      death data were extracted from the individuals who had died's records. Very long 
      term survivors were offered a follow up visit at home. Mini Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE) used to describe cognitive abilities and EQ-5D to assess 
      quality of life. The life situation was also explored. RESULTS: 14 out of 104 
      possible participants had survived to follow up. The median time to follow up 
      among the 8 who agreed to participation was 17 years. Out of the 8 participants, 
      4 failed to reach the cut off score of normal cognitive abilities in the MMSE and 
      7/8 participants did not reach the cut off score for normal cognitive function in 
      the MoCA. Overall the participants were content with their life situation and 
      QoL. However, a tendency towards lower scores on the cognitive testing and a 
      lower self-reported QoL was observed. No depression, post-traumatic stress 
      disorder or anxiety disorder were found. CONCLUSIONS: A CA may lead to permanent 
      cognitive impairments and the risk of dementia may be higher because of the 
      injuries sustained during the collapse. However, further studies with more 
      participants are needed to fully determine the risk of cognitive impairment after 
      a CA. Regarding life situation, there was a tendency of lower QoL with lower

      for long term studies regarding this new population.

AB  - AIM: Neuropsychological testing has uncovered cognitive impairment in cardiac 
      arrest survivors with good neurologic outcome according to the cerebral 
      performance categories. We investigated cognitive function and health-related 
      quality of life four years after cardiac arrest. METHODS: Thirty cardiac arrest 
      survivors over the age of 18 in cerebral performance category 1 or 2 on hospital 
      discharge completed the EQ-5D-5L and HADS questionnaires prior to cognitive 
      testing using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The 
      results were compared with population norms. RESULTS: Twenty-nine per cent of 
      patients were cognitively impaired. The pattern of cognitive impairment reflects 
      dysfunction in the medial temporal lobe, with impaired short-time memory and 
      executive function slightly but distinctly affected. There was a significant 
      reduction in quality of life on the EQ-VAS, but not on the EQ index. CONCLUSION: 
      Cognitive impairment four years after cardiac arrest affected more than one 
      quarter of the patients. Short-term memory was predominantly affected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is the main determinant of clinical 
      outcome after cardiac arrest. The study was designed to determine long-term 
      neurological and psychological status in cardiac arrest survivors, as well as to 
      compare neuropsychological outcomes between patients treated with mild 
      therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) and patients who did not undergo hypothermia 
      treatment. METHODS: The article describes a single-center, retrospective, 
      observational study on 28 post-cardiac arrest adult patients treated in the 
      cardiac intensive care unit who qualified for MTH vs. 37 control group patients, 
      hospitalized at the same center following cardiac arrest in the preceding years 
      and fulfilling criteria for induced hypothermia, but who were not treated due to 
      unavailability of the method at that time. Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Barthel 
      Index and RAND-36 were used to assess performance status and quality of life in 
      both study groups after hospital discharge. RESULTS: There were no statistically 
      significant differences in physical functioning found between groups either at 
      the end of hospital treatment or at long-term follow-up (DRS: p = 0.11; Barthel 
      Index: p = 0.83). In long-term follow-up, MTH patients showed higher vitality 
      (p = 0.02) and reported fewer complaints on role limitations due to emotional 
      problems (p = 0.04) compared to the control group. No significant differences 
      were shown between study groups in terms of physical capacity and independent 
      functioning. CONCLUSION: To conclude, in long-term follow-up, MTH patients showed 
      higher vitality and reported fewer complaints on role limitations due to 
      emotional problems compared to the control group. This suggest that MTH helps to 
      preserve global brain function in cardiac arrest survivors. However, the results 
      can be biased by a small sample size and variable observation periods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant global health 
      problem. There has been considerable investment in improving the emergency 
      medical response to OHCA, with associated improvements in survival. However, 
      concern remains that survivors have a poor quality of life. This study describes 
      the quality of life of OHCA survivors at 1-year postarrest in Victoria, 
      Australia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult OHCA patients who arrested between 2010 and 
      2012 were identified from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry. 
      Paramedics attended 15 113 OHCA patients of which 46.3% received an attempted 
      resuscitation. Nine hundred and twenty-seven (13.2%) survived to hospital 
      discharge of which 76 (8.2%) died within 12 months. Interviews were conducted 
      with 697 (80.7%) patients or proxies, who were followed-up via telephone 
      interview, including the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, the 12-item short form 
      health survey, and the EuroQol. The majority (55.6%) of respondents had a good 
      recovery via the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended>/=7 (41.1% if patients who died 
      postdischarge were included and nonrespondents were assumed to have poor 
      recovery). The mean EuroQol index score for respondents was 0.82 (standard 
      deviation, 0.19), which compared favorably with an adjusted population norm of 
      0.81 (standard deviation, 0.34). The mean 12-item short form Mental Component 
      Summary score for patients was 53.0 (standard deviation, 10.2), whereas the mean 
      Physical Component Summary score was 46.1 (standard deviation, 11.2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest published study assessing the quality of life of 
      OHCA survivors. It provides good evidence that many survivors have an acceptable 
      quality of life 12 months postarrest, particularly in comparison with population 
      norms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) use overall 
      performance category (OPC)/cerebral performance category (CPC) as outcome. We 
      studied quality of life, neuro-cognitive functioning and independency in daily 
      life of patients and strain of caregivers 6-12 months after cardiac arrest. 
      METHODS: Two hundred and twenty patients (>18 year) who survived 6-12 months 
      after OHCA and relatives were interviewed by telephone with validated 
      questionnaires (Short-form Health Survey) (SF-12), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), 
      telephonic interview cognitive status (TICS) and Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and 
      compared with OPC and CPC at discharge. SF-12 of elderly (>/=80 years) was compared 
      to an open Dutch population of >/=80 years. RESULTS: Of all patients, 45% had 
      normal physical and 90% had normal mental SF-12. Eighty-one percent had a normal 
      MRS (MRS</=2). Eighty-four percent had normal TICS. Compared to the reference 
      population, elderly scored 40.5 on the mental physical [corrected] and 53.2 on 
      the physical mental [corrected] SF-12, while the reference population scored 38.1 
      (theta=0.20) and 54.4 (theta=-0.15), respectively, (n.s.) Of the patients with OPC</=2 and 
      CPC</=2 at discharge 15% scored MRS 3-5 and 15% abnormal TICS at follow-up, 
      respectively. Ninety-two percent of all patients gave their quality of life a 
      value of >/=6 (maximum 10). Patients treated with hypothermia scored on most health 
      outcomes similar to those who did not need such treatment. Sixteen percent of 
      caregivers experienced strain, correlating significantly with TICS of patients. 
      CONCLUSION: The great majority of survivors have normal functioning and cognition 
      6-12 months after OHCA. Functional and neuro-cognitive telephonic tests 6-12 
      months after OHCA are simple and better reflect patients functioning at home than 
      OPC/CPC at discharge.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the impact of nonfatal 
      cardiovascular (CV) events on changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL). 
      BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of the impact of nonfatal CV events on 
      long-term changes in HRQL in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: 
      The VALIANT (Valsartan In Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial enrolled 14,703 
      patients post-MI complicated by Killip class II or higher (scale measuring heart 
      failure severity post-MI ranging from class I to IV) and/or reduced ejection 
      fraction. The HRQL substudy included 2,556 (17.4%) patients who completed the 
      EQ-5D with 5 questions, with responses mapped to utility weight on a scale of 0 
      to 1 and a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) 
      imaginable health state. EQ-5D was administered at baseline and 6, 12, 20, and 24 
      months. The trajectory of EQ-5D scores was developed by using linear mixed 
      effects regression models with calculation of deviation from this trajectory 
      after nonfatal CV events. Patients who died before the next EQ-5D assessment were 
      excluded. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 597 patients experienced a nonfatal CV 
      event and survived to have another EQ-5D assessment. Their baseline EQ-5D scores 
      were lower than patients without a subsequent nonfatal CV event (VAS 61.0 +/- 19 vs 
      68.2 +/- 18 [p < 0.001] and US-based utility score 0.76 +/- 0.22 vs 0.83 +/- 0.17 [p < 
      0.001]). These patients with CV events experienced a trajectory-adjusted 6.6 
      point decrease (p < 0.001) in VAS scores and a 0.07 decrease (p < 0.001) in 
      utility score after the nonfatal CV event. CONCLUSIONS: MI survivors suffering a 
      CV event experienced significantly worse HRQL than their previous trajectory, 
      suggesting that generic instruments can be responsive to nonfatal events. 
      Reduction in nonfatal CV events may affect longitudinal changes in HRQL.

TI  - Quality of life and pruritus in patients with severe sepsis resuscitated with 
      hydroxyethyl starch long-term follow-up of a randomised trial.
PG  - R58

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) on patient-centered 
      outcome measures have not been fully described in patients with severe sepsis. We 
      assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the occurrence of pruritus in 
      patients with severe sepsis randomized to resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 or 
      Ringer's acetate. METHODS: We did post hoc analyses of the Danish survivors 
      (n=295) of the 6S trial using mailed questionnaires on self-perceived HRQoL 
      (Short Form (SF) - 36) and pruritus. RESULTS: Median 14 months (interquartile 
      range 10 to 18) after randomization, 182 (61%) and 185 (62%) completed 
      questionnaires were obtained for the assessment of HRQoL and pruritus, 
      respectively. Responders were older than nonresponders, but characteristics at 
      randomization of the responders in the HES vs. Ringer's groups were comparable. 
      At follow-up, the patients in the HES group had lower mental component summary 
      scores than those in the Ringer's group (median 45 (interquartile range 36 to 55) 
      vs. 53 (39 to 60), P=0.01). The group differences were mainly in the scales of 
      vitality and mental health. There was no difference in the physical component 
      summary scores between groups, but patients in the HES group scored worse in 
      bodily pain. Forty-nine percent of patients allocated to HES had experienced 
      pruritus at any time after ICU discharge compared to 43% of those allocated to 
      Ringer's (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.55, P=0.43). 
      CONCLUSIONS: At long-term follow-up patients with severe sepsis assigned to 
      resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 had worse self-perceived HRQoL than those 
      assigned to Ringer's acetate whereas there were no statistically significant 
      differences in the occurrence of pruritus.

PG  - 822-6

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread use of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      prophylaxis in hospitalized patients, pulmonary embolism continues to occur. 
      Massive pulmonary embolism is associated with a high mortality. Surgical 
      embolectomy has traditionally been reserved for cases with haemodynamic collapse 
      or where thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed. METHODS: Data on 10 
      patients who underwent surgical embolectomy (40% male, mean age 49 years (range 
      25-72)) from January 2003 to February 2010 were prospectively collected and 
      retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Diagnosis was made using computed tomography 
      pulmonary angiography in eight patients and echocardiography in two. Syncope was 
      the most common presenting symptom (7 out of 10, 70%) and relative immobilization 
      was the most common risk factor (7 out of 10, 70%). Four patients (40%) suffered 
      preoperative cardiac arrest, with a further two on induction of anaesthesia. 
      Thirty-day mortality was 4 out of 10 (40%), with one late death. Mean follow-up 
      of five survivors was 39 months and included clinic review or telephone 
      interview, SF-36 questionnaire for quality of life, transthoracic 
      echocardiography for right ventricular (RV) function and respiratory function 
      testing. All survivors received an inferior vena cava filter and 6 months of 
      anticoagulation with no cases of recurrent thromboembolism. RV systolic 
      dysfunction was severe in all cases prior to surgery, but improved to near normal 
      at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors had good quality of life, were functionally 
      NYHA class I-II with normal respiratory function.

TI  - Functional outcomes and quality of life of young adults who survive 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
PG  - 532-7
LID - 10.1136/emermed-2012-201267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluating the quality of life of young adult survivors of 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is important as they are likely to have a 
      longer life expectancy than older patients. The aim of this study was to assess 
      their functional and quality of life outcomes. METHODOLOGY: The Victorian 
      Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry records were used to identify survivors of OHCA 
      that occurred between 2003 and 2008 in the 18-39 year-old age group. Survivors 
      were administered a telephone questionnaire using Short Form (SF-12), EQ-5D and 
      Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ascertained 
      at hospital discharge from the medical record was recorded for the uncontactable 
      survivors. RESULTS: Of the 106 young adult survivors, five died in the 
      intervening years and 45 were not contactable or refused. CPC scores were 
      obtained for 37 (74%) of those who did not take part in telephone follow-up, and 
      7 (19%) of these had a CPC >/= 3 indicating severe cerebral disability. The median 
      follow-up time was 5 years (range 2.7- 8.6 years) for the 56 (53%) patients 
      included. Of these, 84% were living at home independently, 68% had returned to 
      work, and only 11% reported marked or severe disability. The majority of patients 
      had no problems with mobility (75%), personal care (75%), usual activities (66%) 
      or pain/discomfort (71%). However, 61% of respondents reported either moderate 
      (48%) or severe (13%) anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of survivors have good 
      functional and quality of life outcomes. Telephone follow-up is feasible in the 
      young adult survivors of cardiac arrest; loss to follow-up is common.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The psychological strain of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
      (ICD) is infrequently explored in prospective studies, which have until now 
      generally focused on the dimensions anxiety and depression. Furthermore, vital 
      exhaustion (VE; ICD10 F 48.0) is known as a very good predictor for negative 
      outcome in patients with coronary heart disease. The influence of VE on patients 
      with an ICD is presented and analyzed in a prospective study. METHODS: A total of 
      249 patients with an ICD completed a set of questionnaires (HADS, EQ-5D, VE) at 
      baseline and at the 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The patients with high levels of 
      depression, anxiety, and VE after ICD implantation did not show spontaneous 
      remission after 1 year. DISCUSSION: As expected, the implanatation of an ICD is 
      associated with high acceptance and increased life quality in about 3/4 of 
      patients. However, there is a subgroup of patients (20-30%) who have difficulties 
      and the measured dimensions remain at elevated levels after implantation, thus, 
      indicating that these patients probably need competent psychological help.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after a drowning incident as a child.
PG  - 1318-22
LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.05.018 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and school performance in subjects 
      having received either bystander or emergency medical service personnel initiated 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a drowning incident in childhood. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 64 children admitted to pediatric intensive care (PICU) 
      after successful CPR between 1985 and 2007. Eleven died in the PICU, 9 other 
      within 6 months. In 2009 all long-term survivors, except for two, lived at home. 
      Of the 40 patients eligible for the study, 29 (73%) responded to a questionnaire. 
      HRQoL was assessed with the generic 15D, or its versions for adolescents (16D) or 
      children (17D), and compared to that of general population. These HRQoL scores, 
      age-specific survival probabilities, and HRQoL scores of the general population 
      were used in a Markov model to estimate the number of QALYs gained. RESULTS: 
      Median age of the respondents was 17.3 (range: 3.0-28.4) years and 62% were male. 
      At the time of drowning their median age had been 3.0 (range: 1.2-15.7) years. 
      The drowning incident was associated with a significant loss in HRQoL in the 
      oldest age group (total HRQoL total score 0.881 compared to 0.971 in the general 
      population, P<0.01) but not in children (HRQoL score 0.944 vs. 0.938). When 
      submersion time exceeded 10min mean HRQoL score was significantly lower than in 
      patients with a shorter submersion (0.844 vs. 0.938, P=0.032). The mean 
      undiscounted and discounted (at 3%) number of QALYs gained by treatment were 40.8 
      and 17.0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A good HRQoL will be achieved in the 
      majority of patients surviving long-term after a drowning incident in childhood, 
      although HRQoL is affected by the submersion time.

      critically ill persons 75 years and older: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-9-35 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of 3-month 
      mortality in critically ill older persons under medical care and to assess the 
      clinical impact of an ICU stay on physical and cognitive dependence and 
      subjective health status in survivors. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 
      observational cohort study including all older persons 75 years and older 
      consecutively admitted into ICU during a one-year period, except those admitted 
      after cardiac arrest, All patients were followed for 3 months or until death. 
      Comorbidities were assessed using the Charlson index and physical dependence was 
      evaluated using the Katz index of Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Cognitive 
      dependence was determined by a score based on the individual components of the 
      Lawton index of Daily Living and subjective health status was evaluated using the 
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) score. RESULTS: One hundred patients were 
      included in the analysis. The mean age was 79.3 +/- 3.4 years. The median Charlson 
      index was 6 [IQR, 4 to 7] and the mean ADL and cognitive scores were 5.4 +/- 1.1 
      and 1.2 +/- 1.4, respectively, corresponding to a population with a high level of 
      comorbidities but low physical and cognitive dependence. Mortality was 61/100 
      (61%) at 3 months. In multivariate analysis only comorbidities assessed by the 
      Charlson index [Adjusted Odds Ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; p < 0.003] and the 
      number of organ failures assessed by the SOFA score [Adjusted Odds Ratio, 2.5; 
      95% CI, 1.1-5.2; p < 0.02] were independently associated with 3-month mortality. 
      All 22 patients needing renal support after Day 3 died. Compared with 
      pre-admission, physical (p = 0.04), and cognitive (p = 0.62) dependence in 
      survivors had changed very little at 3 months. In addition, the mean NHP score 
      was 213.1 +/- 132.8 at 3 months, suggesting an acceptable perception of their 
      quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In a selected population of non surgical patients 
      75 years and older, admission into the ICU is associated with a 3-month survival 
      rate of 38% with little impact on physical and cognitive dependence and 
      subjective health status. Nevertheless, a high comorbidity level (ie, Charlson 
      index), multi-organ failure, and the need for extra-renal support at the early 
      phase of intensive care could be considered as predictors of death.

LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.01.018 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Prognostication may be difficult in comatose cardiac arrest 
      survivors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is potentially useful in the 
      prediction of neurological outcome, and it may detect acute ischemia at an early 
      stage. In a pilot setting we determined the prevalence and development of 
      cerebral ischemia using serial MRI examinations and neurological assessment. 
      METHODS: Ten witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were included. MRI 
      was carried out approximately 2h after admission to the hospital, repeated after 
      24h of therapeutic hypothermia and 96 h after the arrest. The images were 
      assessed for development of acute ischemic lesions. Neurophysiological and 
      cognitive tests as well as a self-reported quality-of-life questionnaire, Short 
      Form-36 (SF-36), were administered minimum 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: 
      None of the patients had acute cerebral ischemia on MRI at admission. Three 
      patients developed ischemic lesions after therapeutic hypothermia. There was a 
      change in the apparent diffusion coefficient, which significantly correlated with 
      the temperature (p < 0.001). The neurophysiological tests appeared normal. The 
      patients scored significantly better on SF 36 than the controls as regards both 
      bodily pain (p = 0.023) and mental health (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: MRI performed 
      in an early phase after cardiac arrest has limitations, as MRI performed after 24 
      and 96 h revealed ischemic lesions not detectable on admission. ADC was related 
      to the core temperature, and not to the volume distributed intravenously. 
      Follow-up neurophysiologic tests and self-reported quality of life were good.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In cardiac arrest patients (in hospital and pre hospital) does 
      resuscitation produce a good Quality of Life (QoL) for survivors after discharge 
      from the hospital? METHODS: Embase, Medline, The Cochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews, Academic Search Premier, the Central Database of Controlled Trials and 
      the American Heart Association (AHA) Resuscitation Endnote Library were searched 
      using the terms ('Cardiac Arrest' (Mesh) OR 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation' 
      (Mesh) OR 'Heart Arrest' (Mesh)) AND ('Outcomes' OR 'Quality of Life' OR 
      'Depression' OR 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder' OR 'Anxiety OR 'Cognitive 
      Function' OR 'Participation' OR 'Social Function' OR 'Health Utilities Index' OR 
      'SF-36' OR 'EQ-5D' as text term. RESULTS: There were 9 inception (prospective) 
      cohort studies (LOE P1), 3 follow up of untreated control groups in randomised 
      control trials (LOE P2), 11 retrospective cohort studies (LOE P3) and 47 case 
      series (LOE P4). 46 of the studies were supportive with respect to the search 
      question, 17 neutral and 7 negative. DISCUSSION: The majority of studies 
      concluded that QoL after cardiac arrest is good. This review demonstrated a 
      remarkable heterogeneity of methodology amongst studies assessing QoL in cardiac 
      arrest survivors. There is a requirement for consensus development with regard to 
      quality of life and patient centred outcome assessment in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Follow-up studies of patients surviving emergency resternotomy, open 
      cardiac massage, and additional emergency cardiac surgery following coronary 
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain sparse and studies focusing on 
      health-related quality of life are lacking. Our aim was to elucidate the 
      long-term course of patients experiencing this hazardous complication. METHODS: 
      Between 1988 and 1999, 76 patients suffered sudden hemodynamic collapse following 
      isolated CABG. All patients underwent emergency resternotomy and open cardiac 
      massage. An emergency cardiac reoperation was performed in the 62 (82%) primary 
      survivors. Additional 76 patients were pair-matched to the study patients on the 
      basis of their preoperative characteristics and served as controls. Of the study 
      patients, 41 (54%), and of the controls, 76, (100%) were discharged. In December 
      2009, all patients were traced with respect to mortality data and the 
      health-related quality of life of living patients was studied using the RAND-36 
      Item Health Survey questionnaire. RESULTS: Altogether 19 (73%) of the 26 study 
      patients, and 38 (84%) of the 45 controls were available. After exclusion of the 
      early deaths, the life expectancy was similar between the groups: neither overall 
      (p = 0.60) nor cardiac (p = 0.64) survival differed significantly after a mean 
      follow-up time of 15.1 +/- 3.5 years. In addition, cardiac re-interventions were 
      equally frequently required in both the groups. The RAND-36 scores were congruent 
      (p = ns) between the groups and the age- and sex-matched national reference 
      population in the health-related quality-of-life dimensions describing physical, 
      mental, and social domains. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have survived severe 
      hemodynamic collapse, open cardiac massage, and emergency cardiac reoperation 
      following CABG achieve similar long-term prognosis in terms of survival and 
      cardiac interventions as the pair-matched control patients. In addition, 15 years 
      postoperatively, they have a good health-related quality of life, similar to that 
      of an age- and sex-matched national reference population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study factors related to quality of life after a hypoxic period due 
      to cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: Eighty-eight 
      survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, admitted to a Dutch academic 
      hospital between 2001 and 2006. METHODS: Patients received a set of 
      questionnaires at home. The main outcome measures were physical and mental 
      quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-36). 
      Potential determinants were cognitive complaints, emotional problems 
      depression/anxiety), post-traumatic stress, fatigue, daily functioning and 
      participation in society. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed with 
      physical and mental quality of life as dependent variables. RESULTS: Sixty-three 
      (72%) patients responded. Mean time since cardiac arrest was 36 months (standard 
      deviation (SD) 19). Backward regression analyses showed that physical quality of 
      life was significantly (p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.531) related to cognitive 
      complaints (beta = -0.378), instrumental daily life activities (beta = 0.262), 
      post-traumatic stress (beta = -0.246) and fatigue (beta = -0.226). Mental quality 
      of life was significantly (p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.664) explained by 
      anxiety/depression (beta = -0.609), fatigue (beta = -0.177) and cognitive 
      complaints (beta = -0.175). CONCLUSION: Quality of life is related to cognitive 
      complaints, fatigue, anxiety/depression, post-traumatic stress and difficulties 
      in daily activities in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
      Rehabilitation programmes for this group should specifically address these 
      topics.

TI  - Two simple questions to assess neurologic outcomes at 3 months after 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: experience from the public access defibrillation 
      trial.
PG  - 530-3
LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.01.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two simple questions have been used to classify neurologic outcome in 
      patients with stroke. Could they be similarly applied to patients with cardiac 
      arrest? METHODS: As part of a randomized trial, study personnel interviewed by 
      telephone survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to assess their outcomes 3 
      months after discharge. They asked two simple questions: (1) In the last 2 weeks, 
      did you require help from another person for your everyday activities? and (2) Do 
      you feel that you have made a complete mental recovery form your heart arrest? 
      Next they administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from the Adult 
      Lifestyles and Function Interview (ALFI) to assess cognition on a scale from 0 to 
      22 and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) to assess quality of life on a 
      scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). RESULTS: Based on responses to the 
      two simple questions, 32 survivors were classified as dependent (n=5, 16%), 
      independent (n=3, 9%) and full recovery (n=24, 75%). The mean ALFI-MMSE score was 
      19.1 (standard deviation 5.1), and the mean HUI3 score was 0.76 (standard 
      deviation 0.28). The classification based on the two simple questions was 
      significantly correlated with ALFI-MMSE (p=0.002) and HUI3 (p=0.001). Scores for 
      the HUI3 were missing in eight survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic outcomes based 
      on the two simple questions after cardiac arrest can be easily determined, 
      sensibly applied, and readily interpreted. These preliminary findings justify 
      further evaluation of this simple and practical approach to classify neurologic 
      outcome in survivors of cardiac arrest.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To analyse the neurological status of survivors after cardiac 
      arrest (CA) treated with hypothermia. METHODS: We prospectively included all 
      patients with CA treated with hypothermia at intensive care units (ICU) in two 
      university hospitals and one regional hospital. All adult survivors at 6 months 
      after CA, n=48, were invited for neurological follow-up and 43 accepted. History, 
      clinical status, ability testing and questionnaires were administered to screen 
      for difficulties, including Assessment of Motor and Process Skills, 
      Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination, Frontal Lobe Assessment Battery, 
      EQ-VAS quality of life scale, Skane Sleep Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Rating Scale, Self-reported Montgomery and Astrand Depression Rating Scale, 
      Global Deterioration Scale, Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, and the Cerebral 
      Performance Categories (CPC). RESULTS: No patient was found to be in a chronic 
      vegetative state and all patients were living at home, one with extensive help. 
      Thirty-six patients were in CPC1 at follow-up, and some degree of neurological 
      sequelae was found in 40 patients, but was mild in all but 3. Three patients had 
      no subjective complaints, nor could any deficits be detected. Initial defects 
      improved over-time. Short-term memory loss, executive frontal lobe dysfunction 
      along with mild depression and sleep rhythm disturbances were the most common 
      findings. CONCLUSIONS: Mild cognitive impairment is common following 
      hypothermia-treated cardiac arrest but has little effect on activities of daily 
      living or quality of life.

TI  - Life after survival: long-term daily functioning and quality of life after an 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
PG  - 517-22
LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2009.01.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about long-term consequences of cardiac arrest is sparse. 
      Because the survival rate is expected to increase, better knowledge of long-term 
      functioning and quality of survival is essential. OBJECTIVES: To determine the 
      level of functioning of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors 1-6 years later, 
      and to evaluate the predictive value of medical variables on long-term 
      functioning. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study including 63 survivors of an 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, admitted to a Dutch University hospital between 
      2001 and 2006. Participants received a questionnaire by post. Primary outcome 
      measures were: participation in society (Community Integration Questionnaire) and 
      quality of life (SF-36). Secondary outcome measures were: physical, cognitive and 
      emotional impairment, daily functioning and caregiver strain. Statistical 
      analyses included multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: On average 3 years 
      post-cardiac arrest, 74% of the patients experienced a low participation level in 
      society compared with the general population. Over 50% reported severe fatigue, 
      38% feelings of anxiety and/or depression and 24% a decreased quality of life. 
      Caregivers reported stress related responses, feelings of anxiety and lower 
      quality of life. Seventeen percent of the caregivers reported high caregiver 
      strain, which was associated with the patient's level of functioning. Gender, 
      age, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and therapeutic hypothermia 
      contributed to outcome on at least one domain of long-term functioning. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, many patients and 
      partners encounter extensive impairments in their level of functioning and 
      quality of life. Gender, age, PCI and therapeutic hypothermia are associated with 
      differences in long-term functioning of patients.

AB  - AIMS: To assess the impact of therapeutic hypothermia on cognitive function and 
      quality of life in comatose survivors of out of Hospital Cardiac arrest (OHCA). 
      METHODS: We prospectively studied comatose survivors of OHCA consecutively 
      admitted in a 4-year period. Therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in the last 
      2-year period, intervention period (n=79), and this group was compared to 
      patients admitted the 2 previous years, control period (n=77). We assessed 
      Cerebral Performance Category (CPC), survival, Mini Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE) and self-rated quality of life (SF-36) 6 months after OHCA in the subgroup 
      with VF/VT as initial rhythm. RESULTS: CPC in patients alive at hospital 
      discharge was significantly better in the intervention period with a CPC of 1-2 
      in 97% vs. 71% in the control period, p=0.003, corresponding to an adjusted odds 
      ratio of a favourable cerebral outcome of 17, p=0.01. No significant differences 
      were found in long-term survival (57% vs. 56% alive at 30 months), MMSE, or 
      SF-36. Therapeutic hypothermia (hazard ratio: 0.15, p=0.007) and bystander CPR 
      (hazard ratio 0.19, p=0.002) were significantly related to survival in the 
      intervention period. CONCLUSION: CPC at discharge from hospital was significantly 
      improved following implementation of therapeutic hypothermia in comatose patients 
      resuscitated from OCHA with VF/VT. However, significant improvement in survival, 
      cognitive status or quality of life could not be detected at long-term follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term outcome of bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest victims in Estonia by using the survival rate and quality of life 
      assay. METHODS: All resuscitation attempts made from 01.01.1999 to 31.12.2002 in 
      Estonia were retrospectively screened for bystander-witnessed adult 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of cardiac origin. The patients who survived 
      hospital discharge were included in the study. Their long-term survival data were 
      retrieved from Estonian Population Registry on March 15, 2004. Quality of life 
      was assessed by RAND-36 questionnaire. Comparisons were made with population 
      norms, and patients suffering from myocardial infarction or angina pectoris. 
      RESULTS: 854 bystander-witnessed resuscitation attempts were made in four years. 
      91 patients (10.7%) survived to hospital discharge. Their one-year survival rate 
      was 77.0% and five-year survival rate 64.3%. 44 patients responded to quality of 
      life questionnaire, sent 16-62 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
      (response rate 77.2%). Respondents rated their quality of life significantly 
      worse than general population in five out of eight categories. The 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with known cardiovascular disease in 
      history (n=30) had quality of life similar to patients suffering from myocardial 
      infarction or angina pectoris who had not required resuscitation. CONCLUSION: In 
      Estonia majority of bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims 
      who survive hospital discharge are alive one and also more than three years after 
      resuscitation. Their quality of life is worse than that of general population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Assessing the neurological and disability status of cardiac arrest 
      (CA) survivors is important for evaluating the outcomes of resuscitation 
      interventions. The Cerebral Performance Category (CPC)--the standard outcome 
      measurement after CA--has been criticized for its poorly defined, subjective 
      criteria, lack of information regarding its psychometric properties, and poor 
      relationships with long-term measures of disability and quality of life (QOL). 
      This study examined the relationships among the CPC and measures of global 
      disability and QOL at discharge from the hospital and at 1 month after CA. 
      METHODS: Twenty-one CA survivors participated in the study. A medical chart 
      review was conducted at the time of discharge to determine CPC and Modified 
      Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, while 1-month in-person interview was conducted to 
      collect mRS and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) scores. Data collected 
      during the interview were used to determine follow-up CPC scores. RESULTS: The 
      strength of relationships among measures at discharge and 1 month ranged between 
      fair to good. An examination of scatter plots revealed substantial variability 
      and a wide distribution of chart review and 1-month mRS and HUI3 scores within 
      each CPC category. CPC scores obtained through chart review were significantly 
      better than the CPC 1-month scores, thus overestimating the participants' 
      cognitive and disability status 1 month later. CONCLUSION: When compared to 
      disability and quality of life measures, it is apparent that the CPC has limited 
      ability to discriminate between mild and moderate brain injury. The validity of 
      using the chart review method for obtaining scores is questionable.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the costs and health 
      status outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients who present 
      after sudden cardiac arrest with in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation. METHODS: Five-year survival, health-related quality of life 
      (Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 questionnaire, SF-36), ICU costs, hospital 
      costs and post-hospital health care costs per survivor, costs per life year 
      gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life year gained of patients admitted to a 
      single ICU were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred ten of 354 patients (31%) were 
      alive 5 years after hospital discharge. The mean health status index of 5-year 
      survivors was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.85). Women rated their 
      health-related quality of life significantly better than men did (0.87 versus 
      0.74; P < 0.05). Costs per hospital discharge survivor were 49,952 euro. 
      Including the costs of post-hospital discharge health care incurred during their 
      remaining life span, the total costs per life year gained were 10,107 euro. 
      Considering 5-year survivors only, the costs per life year gained were calculated 
      as 9,816 euro or 14,487 euro per quality-adjusted life year gained. Including 
      seven patients with severe neurological sequelae, costs per life year gained in 
      5-year survivors increased by 18% to 11,566 euro. CONCLUSION: Patients who leave 
      the hospital following cardiac arrest without severe neurological disabilities 
      may expect a reasonable quality of life compared with age- and gender-matched 
      controls. Quality-adjusted costs for this patient group appear to be within 
      ranges considered reasonable for other groups of patients.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Cerebral Performance Category score is an easy to use but 
      unvalidated measure of functional outcome after cardiac arrest. We evaluate the 
      comparability of results from the Cerebral Performance Category scale versus 
      those of the validated but more complex Health Utilities Index scale for 
      health-related quality of life. METHODS: This prospective substudy of the Ontario 
      Prehospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) Study included adult out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest patients treated in 20 cities. This prospective cohort study 
      included all survivors of out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest enrolled in phase 
      II (rapid basic life support with defibrillation) and phase III (advanced life 
      support) of the OPALS Study, as well as the intervening run-in phase. Survivors 
      were interviewed at 12 months for Cerebral Performance Category Score and the 
      Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (Health Utilities Index). RESULTS: Of 8,196 
      eligible out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 1995 and 2002, 418 
      (5.1%) survived to discharge, and 305 (3.7%) completed the Health Utilities Index 
      interview and had Cerebral Performance Category scored at 12 months. The 305 
      patients had the following data: mean age 63.9 years; male 78.0%; 
      paramedic-witnessed arrest 25.6%; bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation 32.1%; 
      initial rhythm ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia 86.9%, Cerebral 
      Performance Category 1 267, Cerebral Performance Category 2 26, Cerebral 
      Performance Category 3 12. Overall, the median scores (interquartile range) were 
      Cerebral Performance Category 1 (1 to 1) and Health Utilities Index 0.84 (0.61 to 
      0.97). The Cerebral Performance Category score ruled out good quality of life 
      (Health Utilities Index >0.80), with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 98% to 100%) and specificity 27.1% (95% CI 20% to 35%); thus, when 
      the Cerebral Performance Category score was 2 or 3, it was unlikely that the 
      Health Utilities Index score would be good. The Cerebral Performance Category 
      score had sensitivity 55.6% (95% CI 42% to 67%) and specificity 96.8% (95% CI 94% 
      to 98%) for predicting poor quality of life (Health Utilities Index >0.40); ie, 
      when Cerebral Performance Category was 1, it was highly unlikely that the Health 
      Utilities Index score would be poor. The weighted kappa was 0.39 and the 
      interclass correlation was 0.51. CONCLUSION: This represents the largest study 
      yet conducted of the performance of the Cerebral Performance Category score in 
      1-year survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Overall, the Cerebral 
      Performance Category score classified patients well for their quality of life, 
      ruling out a good Health Utilities Index score with high sensitivity and ruling 
      in poor Health Utilities Index score with high specificity. The Cerebral 
      Performance Category is an important tool in that it indicates broad functional 
      outcome categories that are useful for a number of key clinical and research 
      applications but should not be considered a substitute for the Health Utilities 
      Index.

PG  - 361-5

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality-of-life (QoL) instruments evaluate various aspects of 
      physical, mental, and emotional health, but how these psychosocial 
      characteristics impact long-term outcome after cardiac arrest and ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      the relationship of baseline QoL scores with long-term survival of patients 
      enrolled in the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial. 
      METHODS: Formal QoL measures included SF-36 mental and physical components, 
      Patient Concerns Checklist, and Ferrans and Powers Quality-of-Life Index-Cardiac 
      Version. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess the association of 
      survival and these measures, adjusting for index arrhythmia type, gender, race, 
      age, ejection fraction, history of congestive heart failure, antiarrhythmic 
      therapy, and beta-blocker use. RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 546 +/- 356 
      days, 129 deaths occurred among 740 patients. Higher baseline SF-36 physical 
      summary scores (P <.001), higher baseline QoL Index summary scores (P = .015), 
      and lower baseline Patient Concerns Checklist summary scores (P = .047) were 
      associated with longer survival, even after adjustment for clinical variables. 
      When QoL measures were examined simultaneously, only the SF-36 physical summary 
      score remained significant (P = .002). CONCLUSION: During recovery after 
      sustained VT or cardiac arrest, formal baseline QoL assessment provides important 
      prognostic information independent of traditional clinical data.

TI  - Mortality and outcomes of elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit at 
      Cairns Base Hospital, Australia.
PG  - 334-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the survival and outcome of elderly patients admitted to 
      the intensive care unit at Cairns Base Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective review 
      of patients aged 60 years or over admitted to the ICU (a Level 2 general unit) at 
      Cairns Base Hospital, a regional hospital in Queensland, during 2003-2005. 
      Mortality was determined by review of hospital records, the Queensland register 
      of deaths, and direct patient or family contact in November 2006. Demographic and 
      clinical details were collected, and the EuroQol-5D questionnaire was used to 
      assess current and pre-ICU quality of life. RESULTS: 432 patients aged >or= 60 
      years had 469 admissions to the ICU during 2003-2005. Long-term outcome was 
      determined for 68%: 201 (46%) were confirmed dead, and 94 (22%) were confirmed 
      alive, while the outcome for 137 (32%) remained unknown. Allowing for an 
      estimated mortality of 39% in the unknown group, the overall estimated mortality 
      was 60%. Mean follow-up time was 2.4 (SD, 0.9) years (range, 11-35 months). As 
      age increased, mortality increased: 37% for the 60-70 years age group; 50% for 
      70-80 years; 61% for 80-90 years, and 83% for > 90 years. The quality of life of 
      survivors was lower on follow-up than on ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly 
      patients admitted to the ICU have high mortality. As age increases, mortality 
      increases. Elderly survivors can expect a lower quality of life after an ICU 
      admission, although on average the difference is not great.

TI  - Life after survival: long-term daily life functioning and quality of life of 
      patients with hypoxic brain injury as a result of a cardiac arrest.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the level of daily functioning and quality of life of 
      patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest and to investigate the 
      predictive value of the duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia in long-term 
      functioning. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A Dutch 
      rehabilitation centre. SUBJECTS: Thirty-two patients with hypoxic brain injury 
      caused by a cardiac arrest 2-7 years ago, who were admitted to a brain injury 
      rehabilitation programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive Failures Questionnaire 
      (CFQ), Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), Impact on Participation and Autonomy 
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Quality of Life after Brain Injury questionnaire 
      (QOLIBRI). Data on duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia were retrieved 
      from medical files. RESULTS: A significant association was found between duration 
      of coma, complaints of cognitive functioning (r = 0.57, P < 0.05) and quality of 
      life after brain injury (r = -0.70, P < 0.01). Duration of post-traumatic amnesia 
      was associated with both daily functioning (r = -0.70, P < 0.01) and quality of 
      life (r = -0.70, P < 0.01). Furthermore complaints of cognitive functioning were 
      associated with both the level of participation in society (r = 0.76, P < 0.01) 
      and quality of life (r = 0.77, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcome of 
      patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest shows that this group 
      is limited in cognitive and daily functioning, participation and quality of life. 
      Based on the duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia, an estimation of daily 
      life functioning and quality of life 2-7 years after a cardiac arrest can be 
      made.

TI  - Improved survival associated with prophylactic implantable defibrillators in 
      elderly patients with prior myocardial infarction and depressed ventricular 
      function: a MADIT-II substudy.
PG  - 833-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aim to evaluate the mortality benefit from defibrillator therapy 
      in eligible elderly patients. Effective primary prevention of sudden cardiac 
      death with implantable cardioverter defibrillators is well demonstrated in 
      patients with coronary disease and depressed ventricular function. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Among 1,232 patients enrolled with prior infarct and left ventricular 
      ejection fraction < or = 0.30, 204 were > or = 75 years old. Of these 204 
      patients, 121 underwent defibrillator implant. Relative to the younger patients, 
      those > or = 75 years had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, elevated 
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN), widened QRS, and lower use of beta-blockers and 
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Relevant clinical covariates were similar in 
      elderly patients randomized to conventional and defibrillator therapy. The hazard 
      ratio for the mortality risk in patients > or = 75 years assigned to 
      defibrillator implant compared with those in conventional therapy was 0.56 (95 
      confidence interval 0.29-1.08; P = 0.08) after a mean follow-up of 17.2 months. 
      Comparatively, the hazard ratio in patients < 75 years assigned to defibrillator 
      implant was 0.63 (0.45-0.88; P = 0.01) after 20.8 months. Elderly patients had 
      similar reductions in quality of life (QoL) regardless of treatment 
      randomization. Scores through Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI) Questionnaire 
      changes from baseline to 1 year were -0.22 for patients with conventional therapy 
      versus -0.20 for patients with ICD, and -0.36 versus -0.27 at 2 years, 
      respectively (P = NS). CONCLUSION: The implantable defibrillator is associated 
      with an equivalent reduction of mortality in elderly and younger patients, with 
      no compromise in the QoL in the older age subjects.

TI  - Incidence of shock and quality of life in young patients with implantable 
      cardioverter-defibrillator.
PG  - 258-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the incidence and causes of ICD therapies in children and 
      young adults and verify their impact on the quality of life (QoL). METHODS: From 
      March/1977 to February/2006, 29 patients (15.7+/-5.4 years old) were submitted to 
      ICD implants. Aborted cardiac arrest (41.5%), sustained ventricular tachycardia 
      (27.6%) and primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death (30.9%) indicated device 
      therapy. The number of therapies was evaluated by interviewing patients and by 
      ICD diagnostic data. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure the QoL and the 
      results were compared to healthy population. The expectative of freedom from ICD 
      therapies were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: After 2.6+/-1.8 
      years follow-up, 8 (27.6%) patients received 141 appropriate ICD shocks due to 
      ventricular tachycardia (6) or ventricular fibrillation (2), and 11 (37.9%) 
      patients received 152 inappropriate ICD shocks due to supraventricular 
      tachyarrhythmias (8) or oversensing (3). Expectative of freedom from appropriate 
      shocks was 74.2+/-9.0% and 66.7+/-10.7% after one and three years, respectively. 
      Compared to healthy population, QoL decreased in physical function (61.7+/-28.7), 
      vitality (64.7+/-19.1), mental health (65.9+/-22.7) and role-emotional domains 
      (66.7+/-38.5). All patients referred fear and concern related to ICD use. 
      CONCLUSION: Despite the efficacy of ICD therapies, the high incidence of 
      appropriate and inappropriate shocks interfered in patients QoL and adaptation to 
      the device.

TI  - Long-term prognosis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to report survival beyond 6 months, including 
      quality of life, for patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with a 
      physician-based EMS in an urban area. METHODS: We collected data related to OHCA 
      prospectively during a 2-year period. Long-term survival was determined by 
      cross-referencing our database with two Danish national registries. Patients 
      older than 18 years who had survived for more than 6 months after OHCA were 
      contacted, and after informed written consent was obtained, an interview was 
      conducted in their home and a questionnaire on quality of life (SF-36) and the 
      mini mental state examination (MMSE) were administered. RESULTS: We had data on 
      984 cases of OHCA. In 512 cases CPR was attempted and at 6 months, a total of 63 
      patients were alive corresponding to 12.3% [95% CI: 9.7-15.5%] of all who were 
      treated. Of the 33 patients examined, the median MMSE was 29 (16-30) and two 
      patients, corresponding to 6%, [95% CI: 0.7-20.6%] had an MMSE below 24. Two out 
      of eight aspects of the SF-36 were significantly worse than national norms at the 
      same age, but none of the summary scores differed significantly. CONCLUSION: 
      Survival beyond 6 months was found in 12.3% OHCA in a physician-based EMS. 
      Summary scores of quality of life were not significantly different from the 
      national norm but 2 out of 8 subscores were lower. Signs of dementia were 
      uncommon as only 6% had an MMSE score below 24.

TI  - A review of the evidence on the effects and costs of implantable cardioverter 
      defibrillator therapy in different patient groups, and modelling of 
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility for these groups in a UK context.
PG  - iii-iv, ix-xi, 1-164
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To update the systematic review evidence on the effectiveness, 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cost-effectiveness of implantable 
      cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); compilation of new data on the service 
      provision in the UK; and on the clinical characteristics, survival, quality of 
      life and costs of ICD patients in the UK, and a new cost-effectiveness model 
      using both international RCT and UK-specific data. DATA SOURCES: Electronic 
      databases searched from November 1999 to March 2003, this was supplemented by a 
      systematic review of research published during 2003-5. Survey data. REVIEW 
      METHODS: Studies were selected and assessed. A survey of ICD centres was carried 
      out. Basic data were obtained from two major implanting centres including 535 
      patients (approximately 10% of overall UK activity) implanted between 1991 and 
      2002, and retrieval of fuller data, on patient characteristics, management and 
      resource use, from patient notes for a sample of 426 patients was attempted. A 
      cross-sectional survey collected HRQoL data (using the Nottingham Health Profile, 
      Short Form 36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, EuroQoL 5 
      Dimensions and disease-specific questions) on a sample of 229 patients. A Markov 
      model combined UK patient data with data from published randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) to estimate incremental costs per life-year or quality-adjusted 
      life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: None of the economic analyses in the studies 
      found could be directly applied to the UK. The multiple sources of routine data 
      available (including the national ICD database) provide an imperfect picture of 
      the need for and use of ICDs. Implantation rates have been rising to a rate of 
      around 20 per million population. Mean age is increasing and most ICDs are 
      implanted into men aged 45-74 years. There is significant geographical variation. 
      A survey of 41 UK centres provided additional evidence, particularly of variation 
      in level of activity and resourcing. Most detailed data were obtained for 380 
      patients (89%). The postal survey produced a 73% response rate. Demographic 
      characteristics of these patients were similar to ICD recipients in the UK as a 
      whole and patients included in secondary prevention RCTs. Mean actuarial survival 
      at 1, 3 and 5 years was 92%, 86% and 71%, respectively. Patient age at 
      implantation and functional status significantly affected survival. Levels of 
      most of the HRQoL measures were lower than for a UK general population. There was 
      no evidence of a change with time from implantation. Patients who had suffered 
      ICD shocks had significantly poorer HRQoL. Most patients nevertheless expressed a 
      high level of satisfaction with ICD therapy. Mean initial costs of implantation 
      showed little variation between centres (23,300 pounds versus 22,100 pounds) or 
      between earlier and more recent implants. There appeared to be greater variation 
      between patients presenting along different pathways. Postdischarge costs (tests, 
      medications and follow-up consultations) and costs of additional hospitalisations 
      were also calculated. Using the Markov model it was found that over a 20-year 
      horizon, mean discounted incremental costs were 70,900 pounds (35,000-142,400 
      pounds). Mean discounted gain was 1.24 years (0.29-2.32) or 0.93 QALYs. 
      Cost-effectiveness was most favourable for men aged over 70 years with a left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 35%. If the treatment effect were to 
      continue, then the cost per life-year over a lifetime might fall to around 32,000 
      pounds. Five RCTs of ICDs, a meta-analysis and, a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
      ICDs used in primary prevention, and a meta-analysis of ICDs in patients with 
      non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy have been published recently. These trials provide 
      confirmation of survival benefit of ICDs used in primary prevention in both 
      ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy patients. Costs per QALY ranged from 
      US$34,000 in older trials to controls being both less expensive and more 
      effective (CABG Patch, DINAMIT). More recent trials estimated cost per QALY 
      between $50,300 and $70,200. The inconsistency in evidence for a HRQoL benefit 
      has not been resolved and further work on risk stratification is necessary. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of short- to medium-term patient benefit from ICDs is 
      strong but cost-effectiveness modelling indicates that the extent of that benefit 
      is probably not sufficient to make the technology cost-effective as used 
      currently in the UK. One reason is the high rates of postimplantation 
      hospitalisation. Better patient targeting and efforts to reduce the need for such 
      hospitalisation may improve cost-effectiveness. Further cost-effectiveness 
      modelling, underpinned by an improved ICD database with reliable long-term 
      follow-up, is required. The absence of a robust measure of the incidence of 
      sudden cardiac death is noted and this may be an area where further 
      organisational changes with improved data collection would help.

TI  - Sex differences in outcome after ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that early defibrillation programs 
      improve survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Reports also 
      suggest that women fare worse than men do after cardiovascular events, but there 
      is no population-based study of sex differences after an OHCA with early 
      defibrillation. We, therefore, compared the short- and long-term survival and 
      quality-of-life (QOL) in women and men after an OHCA. METHODS: All patients with 
      a ventricular fibrillation (VF) OHCA who received early defibrillation in 
      Olmstead County, Minnesota between November 1990 and December 2000 were included. 
      Using medical records and the cardiac arrest database, the short- and long-term 
      survival and QOL based on a SF-36 survey of each sex were compared. Adjusted QOL 
      scores were obtained by using age- and sex-specific norms from a sample of the 
      general U.S. population; an adjusted score of 50 (normalized mean) was considered 
      normal. RESULTS: Thirty-seven female and 163 male patients presented with a VF 
      OHCA and early defibrillation. Survival to hospital admission was significantly 
      better for women than men [30 female survivors to admission (81%), 112 male 
      (69%), p = 0.04]. Paradoxically, survival to discharge among those admitted was 
      worse for women [13 female survivors to discharge (43%), 66 male (61%), p = 
      0.04]. The average length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 years. The 5-year expected 
      survival was 83% in women and 78% in men (p = 0.48). There was no difference in 
      call-to-shock time (6+/-2, 6+/-2 min, p = 0.6) or whether the arrest was 
      witnessed (86, 82%, p = 0.64). There was no statistical difference between women 
      and men in age (64+/-17, 65+/-14 years), ejection fraction (40+/-17, 40+/-18%), 
      diabetes (17, 29%, p = 0.16), hypertension (23, 28%, p = 0.58) or known CAD (27, 
      48%, p = 0.06). Adjusted QOL scores were similar between women and men in terms 
      of pain (52+/-9, 52+/-10) vitality (47+/-11, 40+/-9), general health (49+/-9, 
      44+/-7), social function (51+/-10, 51+/-8), and mental health (50+/-10, 49+/-6). 
      CONCLUSION: Women are more likely to survive to hospital admission following an 
      OHCA. However, admitted women less likely to survive their hospital stay. 
      Long-term survival and QOL are equally favorable in both sexes.

TI  - Impact of age on long-term survival and quality of life following out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early defibrillation programs have improved long-term outcomes 
      following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation. Although 
      long-term collective quality of life and survival are favorable, there are 
      subsets of these patients who may be predisposed to worse outcomes. In 
      particular, elderly patients may present with more comorbid medical conditions 
      affecting their outcome. However, the impact of age on mortality rate and quality 
      of life after rapid defibrillation is unknown. DESIGN: Observational study. 
      SETTING: Hospital. SUBJECTS: All patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
      between November 1990 and January 2001 who received rapid defibrillation for 
      ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients received 
      treatment at one hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Long-term outcome and quality of life 
      were followed. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The quality 
      of life was established by an SF-36 survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two 
      hundred patients presented in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest; of these, 138 (69%) survived to hospital admission, seven (4%) died in 
      the emergency department, and 79 (39%) were discharged neurologically intact. The 
      average age was 62+/-16 yrs, with 51% (n = 40) of the population > or =65. The 
      average length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 yrs. The 5-yr survival in patients <65 
      was 94% (confidence interval, 86-100%) and 66% (confidence interval, 52-84%) in 
      patients > or =65 (p <.001). The observed survival in the younger group was not 
      different from that expected in a U.S. age- and gender-matched population. 
      However, in the older group, the expected survival was significantly lower 
      compared with an age- and gender-matched U.S. population (p =.01) but similar to 
      an age-, gender-, and disease-matched cohort of patients from Olmsted County not 
      experiencing an arrest. In both age-dependent cohort populations, the quality of 
      life scores crossed the norm in all categories with exception of vitality in 
      patients >65 yrs old (42.6+/-7.2). In direct comparison between the two patient 
      groups, the older cohort reported lower levels of physical functioning (p =.002), 
      role-emotional score (p =.03), and role-physical score (p =.007). Other SF-36 
      scores were not different between the groups. Sixty-five percent of patients <65 
      yrs returned to work compared with 56% of older patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      survival rate for ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is 
      significantly improved by the presence of a rapid defibrillation program. In 
      patients <65 yrs old, long-term survival is equal to that of normal individuals 
      and quality of life is similar to the general population. The survival, although 
      high, in older patients is less than that in age-matched healthy controls, and 
      physical and emotional quality of life scores are decreased.

TI  - Long-term subjective memory function in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest survivors resuscitated by early defibrillation.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain injury after a cardiac arrest remains a major cause of 
      morbidity. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have yielded improved 
      survival of patients after hospital discharge following ventricular fibrillation 
      (VF) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early defibrillation that promptly 
      restores a circulating rhythm should decrease the hypoxic period and subsequent 
      organ injury. Therefore this study was designed to determine if long-term memory 
      complaints persist in VF OHCA survivors resuscitated in an early defibrillation 
      program when compared with a healthy control population not experiencing cardiac 
      arrest. METHODS: All patients with an OHCA between November 1990 and January 2001 
      who received defibrillation by emergency medical services personnel in Olmsted 
      County, MN, USA, were included. The memory function questionnaire (MFQ), a 
      64-item, 7-point Likert-scaled instrument to evaluate the perception of everyday 
      memory functioning was sent to all survivors. The MFQ comprises four scales: 
      general frequency of forgetting (rates general forgetting), retrospective 
      functioning (compares current memory with past ability), seriousness of 
      forgetting (rates how memory impairment impacts daily life), and mnemonics usage 
      (measures adaptation). The MFQ is scaled so that high scores reflect less severe 
      memory complaints. The comparison population comprised members of the Mayo Older 
      Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) cohort. Quality of life was ascertained with 
      a short form (SF)-36 survey. RESULTS: Seventy-nine of the 200 VF OHCA patients 
      (40%) were discharged. Twenty-two patients have died since dismissal, with an 
      overall average length of follow-up of 4.9+/-3.0 years. Thirty-eight (67%) of the 
      survivors completed the MFQ. Compared with the normal, there was a significant 
      decrease in the general frequency of forgetting score of 144.2+/-37.4 versus 
      168.1+/-27.3 ( P<0.001) and the seriousness of forgetting score of 84.8 +/-26.7 
      versus 95.2+/-19.7 (P=0.004). The retrospective function-scale scores were not 
      significantly different ( 18.4+/-6.8 versus 18.7+/- 5.0 (P=0.74). Younger 
      patients (lesser than 65 years of age) reported an increase in general forgetting 
      and the seriousness of forgetting compared with older survivors. A comparison 
      with SF-36 scores suggested an association between general forgetting and 
      decreased vitality (P=0.03) and the seriousness of forgetting with a decreased 
      general health (P=0.005), mental health (P=0.009), physical functioning ( P=0.02 
      ), and vitality ( P=0.05). CONCLUSION: In a cohort of VF OHCA patients, survivors 
      report more memory complaints in comparison with a general healthy older 
      population. There were more long-term-memory complaints in younger patients. 
      Patients with higher long-term quality-of-life score have fewer memory 
      complaints.

TI  - Life after death: posttraumatic stress disorder in survivors of cardiac 
      arrest--prevalence, associated factors, and the influence of sedation and 
      analgesia.
PG  - 378-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiac arrest is possibly one of the most traumatizing conditions for 
      patients, but to date, its influence on psychic morbidity remains unknown. 
      Posttraumatic stress disorder is a unique symptom configuration after an extreme 
      event consisting of intrusion re-experiencing, avoidance and numbness, and 
      hyperarousal symptoms. We studied a) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) in long term survivors of cardiac arrest; b) the role of specific 
      stress factors related to cardiac arrest for the development of PTSD; and c) the 
      influence of sedation and analgesia during or after cardiac arrest on the 
      occurrence of PTSD. DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study. SETTING: University 
      teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Analysis was performed in cardiac arrest survivors 
      who were discharged with favorable neurologic outcome during an 8-yr period 
      (1991-1999). INTERVENTIONS: All patients received the Davidson Trauma Score for 
      the assessment of PTSD and a modified German version of the EuroQol questionnaire 
      for assessment of quality of life. Cardiac arrest circumstances and 
      administration of sedation and analgesia were assessed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: Of 1,630 initially resuscitated patients, 270 patients were discharged 
      with good neurologic outcome. A total of 226 patients were contacted, and 143 
      patients (63% of all eligible patients) completed the study. Mean time from 
      cardiac arrest to follow up was 45 months (range, 24-66). Thirty-nine patients 
      (27%; 95% confidence interval, 21% to 35%) had a Davidson Trauma Score >40 and 
      fulfilled criteria for PTSD. Patients with PTSD had a significantly lower quality 
      of life. The only independent risk factor for the development of PTSD was younger 
      age. There was no difference between patients with or without PTSD regarding the 
      use of sedation and analgesia during or after cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION: The 
      prevalence of PTSD in cardiac arrest survivors is high. Besides younger age, 
      neither clinical factors nor the use of sedation and analgesia were associated 
      with development of PTSD.

TI  - Assessment of quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation.
PG  - 131-5
AB  - This prospective cohort study evaluated the impact of the time-related elements 
      of the "chain of survival" on the quality of life of patients, taking their 
      characteristics into account. Between 1995 and 2002, consecutive, out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest patients from Amsterdam and the surrounding areas were included in 
      this study. A total of 227 patients (12%) survived to hospital discharge and 174 
      were definitive survivors who were available for assessment at 6 months. Quality 
      of life was measured with the 136-item Sickness Impact Profile (SIP); cognitive 
      functioning was assessed through the Mini Mental State Examination. SIP profiles 
      were compared with profiles of an open Dutch population of the elderly and 
      patients who experienced a stroke. Time intervals of the chain of survival were 
      calculated from the estimated moment of collapse and related to outcome using 
      regression analysis. The SIP profile of survivors was a little above the 
      reference profile, indicating a slightly poorer quality of life, and below the 
      profile of patients after stroke, indicating a better quality of life. Impaired 
      cognitive function was associated with delay in the start of cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 19). Absence of the 
      need for advanced cardiopulmonary life support was associated with better 
      cognitive functioning (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.9). 
      Female gender and older age were associated with impaired physical functioning. 
      Trends were found for better outcomes after early access, immediate 
      resuscitation, early defibrillation, and early advanced care.

TI  - Health-related quality of life is better for cardiac arrest survivors who 
      received citizen cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
PG  - 1939-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the prehospital factors associated with better 
      health-related quality of life for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, 20-community, cohort study involved 
      consecutive, adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who survived to 1 
      year. Patients were contacted by telephone and evaluated for the Health Utilities 
      Index Mark III (HUI3), which describes health as a utility score on a scale from 
      0 (dead) to 1.0 (perfect health). The 8091 cardiac arrest patients had overall 
      survival rates of 5.2% to hospital discharge and 4.0% to 1 year. We successfully 
      contacted and evaluated 268 of 316 (84.8%) of known 1-year survivors. The median 
      HUI3 score was 0.80 (interquartile range, 0.50 to 0.97), which compares well with 
      age-adjusted values for the general population (0.83). Logistic regression 
      identified 2 factors independently associated with very good quality of life 
      (HUI3 >0.90) and their odds ratios (95% CIs), as follows: age 80 years or older, 
      0.3 (0.1 to 0.84), and citizen-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 2.0 
      (1.2 to 3.4) (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study is the largest ever conducted for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, 
      clearly shows that these patients have good quality of life, and is the first to 
      demonstrate that citizen-initiated CPR is strongly and independently associated 
      with better quality of life. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing 
      community citizen CPR readiness. Given the low rate of citizen-initiated CPR in 
      many communities, we believe that local and national initiatives should 
      vigorously promote the practice of bystander CPR.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after successful early 
      defibrillation.
PG  - 2626-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular 
      fibrillation is high. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have improved the 
      rate of survival to hospital discharge. We conducted a population-based analysis 
      of the long-term outcome and quality of life of survivors. METHODS: All patients 
      who had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between November 1990 and January 2001 
      who received early defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, 
      Minnesota, were included. The survival rate was compared with that of an age-, 
      sex-, and disease-matched (2:1) control population of residents who had not had 
      an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and with that of age- and sex-matched controls 
      from the general U.S. population. The quality of life was assessed with use of 
      the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and 
      compared with U.S. population norms. RESULTS: Of 200 patients who presented with 
      an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation, 145 (72 percent) 
      survived to hospital admission (7 died in the emergency department) and 79 (40 
      percent) were neurologically intact (good overall capability or moderate overall 
      disability) at discharge. The mean (+/-SD) length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 
      years. Nineteen patients died after discharge from the hospital. The expected 
      five-year survival rate (79 percent) was identical to that among age-, sex-, and 
      disease-matched controls (P=0.68) but lower than that among the age- and 
      sex-matched U.S. population (86 percent, P=0.02). Fifty patients completed SF-36 
      surveys at the end of follow-up, and the majority had a nearly normal quality of 
      life, with the exception of reduced vitality. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival 
      among patients who have undergone rapid defibrillation after out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest is similar to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched patients 
      who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The quality of life among the 
      majority of survivors is similar to that of the general population.

TI  - Quality of life 6-months after cardiac arrest.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of outcome after cardiac arrest focuses mainly on 
      survival. Survivors of cardiac arrest end up in different states of health and 
      survival alone may not be a sensitive measure for successful cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate health-related quality of life 
      (HR-QOL) of cardiac arrest survivors with EQ-5D, a generic instrument developed 
      by the EuroQol group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1997 to December 2000, all 
      cardiac arrest adult patients admitted to an eight-bed medical/surgical (ICU) of 
      a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. At 6-months after ICU discharge survivors 
      attended a follow-up interview and answered EQ-5D questionnaire. A match-control 
      group was created choosing for each survivor of cardiac arrest two controls, with 
      similar age range (+/-5 years) and similar Apache II (+/-3 Apache II units), that 
      were randomly selected among other ICU patients. RESULTS: From a total of 1106 
      patients, 97 (9%) patients were admitted after cardiac arrest. Forty-seven 
      patients (48%) were discharged from ICU. Of these, 11 patients died in the ward. 
      Thirty-six (37%) patients were discharged from hospital. Twelve patients died 
      after hospital discharge but before 6-month evaluation. Five patients were not 
      evaluated, three because they were living in distant locations and two for 
      unknown reasons. Nineteen patients attended the follow-up consultation. Eight of 
      these patients were actively working and six of them had managed to return to 
      their previous activity. Eleven patients were retired and seven of these managed 
      to return to their previous level of activity while four patients presented with 
      anoxic encephalopathy: one with mild and one with moderate neurological 
      dysfunction, two with severe anoxic neurological dysfunction. Although a higher 
      percentage of cardiac arrest survivors reported more extreme problems in some 
      dimensions than other ICU patients, no significant differences were found on 
      HR-QOL, when evaluated by EQ-5D. CONCLUSIONS: When evaluated with EQ-5D at 
      6-months after ICU discharge, survivors of cardiac arrest exhibit a HR-QOL 
      similar to other ICU survivors. These results agree with previous reports stating 
      that CPR is frequently unsuccessful but if survival is achieved a fairly good 
      quality of life can be expected.

TI  - Life after a ventricular arrhythmia.
PG  - 404-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few data from community-based evaluations of outcomes after 
      a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (LTVA). We evaluated patients' quality 
      of life (QOL) and medical costs after hospitalization and treatment for their 
      first episode of an LTVA. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated QOL by use of the 
      Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 mental health and 
      vitality scales, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) symptom scale, 
      and resource use in patients discharged after a first episode of an LTVA in a 
      managed care population of 2.4 million members. RESULTS: We enrolled 264 subjects 
      with new cases of LTVA. Although functional status initially decreased compared 
      with self-reports of pre-event functional status, both functional status and 
      symptom levels improved significantly during the study period. These improvements 
      were greater in patients receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
      (ICD) than in patients receiving amiodarone. Ratings of mental health and 
      vitality were not significantly different between the treatment groups and did 
      not change significantly during follow-up. The total 2-year medical costs were 
      higher for patients receiving an ICD than for patients receiving amiodarone, 
      despite lower costs during the follow-up period for the patients receiving an 
      ICD. CONCLUSIONS: New onset of an LTVA has a substantial negative initial impact 
      on QOL. With therapy, most patients have improvements in their QOL and symptom 
      level, possibly more so after treatment with an ICD. The costs of treating these 
      patients are very high.

TI  - Quality of life in long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
PG  - 7-13
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The quality of life in long-term survivors of out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest may be a good outcome measure after resuscitation. Therefore, the 
      psychosocial situation and quality of life in such patients after successful 
      resuscitation was evaluated. METHODS: Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest in a community referred to a single tertiary care centre were compared 
      with matched controls. Quality of life was evaluated in 50 consecutive arrest 
      cases (40 males, 10 females; 60+/-13 years) 5-68 months (mean 31.7) after 
      resuscitation according to American Heart Association protocols. RESULTS: The 
      Psychological General Well-being Index questionnaire indicated no significant 
      differences in anxiety, depression, vitality, general well-being, or self-control 
      between patients and controls. However, the Nottingham Health Profile 
      questionnaire demonstrated significant decreases in physical mobility 
      (14.5+/-18.1 vs. 4.0+/-8.5, P=0.0001), energy levels (25.3+/-31.0 vs. 2.0+/-8.0, 
      P=0.0001), emotional reactions (11.3+/-16.6 vs. 4.0+/-10.2, P=0.009), and sleep 
      patterns (19.2+/-28.6 vs. 8.4+/-16.7, P=0.023) in the arrest patients. Little 
      differences were measured with the Everyday-Life Questionnaire. 49 of the 50 
      arrest patients judged their situation after resuscitation worth living; no 
      significant changes in familial, and psychosocial parameters occurred. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life was associated with few changes in psychosocial 
      profile after successful resuscitation. The subjective negative factors bore 
      little impact on the quality of daily living in our patients. Thus, continued 
      efforts to improve out-of-hospital resuscitation measures for cardiac arrest are 
      justified since long-term survivors can expect a good quality of life after 
      successful resuscitation.

TI  - Functional status and quality of life in long-term survivors of cardiac arrest 
      after cardiac surgery.
PG  - 1408-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term survival, functional status, and quality of life 
      in patients who experienced cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery. DESIGN: 
      Prospective, observational study. SETTING: An 18-bed, adult cardiac surgery 
      intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching center. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine cardiac 
      surgery patients who suffered an unexpected cardiac arrest in the immediate 
      postoperative period. INTERVENTIONS: The New York Heart Association 
      classification and a questionnaire based on the Nottingham Health Profile were 
      used to evaluate functional status and quality of life 4 yrs after hospital 
      discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 29 patients who experienced 
      cardiac arrest during the first 24 hrs after cardiac surgery, 27 patients (93%) 
      were successfully resuscitated and 23 patients (79%) survived to hospital 
      discharge. Evaluation 4 yrs postdischarge showed that, of the 29 patients, 16 
      patients (55%) were still alive (long-term survivors). Functional status 
      assessment of long-term survivors revealed that 12 patients (75%) were grouped in 
      New York Heart Association class I, 3 patients (19%) in class II, and 1 patient 
      (6%) in class III. None of them had a neurologic deficit. They all were living 
      independently at home, without need of any nursing care. No patient reported any 
      abnormal emotional reactions, and six patients (38%) had mild sleep disturbances, 
      such as early awaking. Regarding activities of daily living, 20% returned to 
      work, 94% were able to look after their home, 96% had a social life, 63% were 
      sexually active, 81% were involved in their hobbies, and 75% had gone on 
      holidays. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery patients who experience an unexpected 
      cardiac arrest in the immediate postoperative period have a 55% chance of being 
      alive 4 yrs postdischarge. The majority of these long-term survivors has a good 
      outcome with respect to functional status and quality of life.

TI  - Quality-of-life six months after CABG surgery in patients randomized to ICD 
      versus no ICD therapy: findings from the CABG Patch Trial.
PG  - 1305-13
AB  - ICDs can affect a patient's perceived quality-of-life (QOL). This article 
      describes the QOL in patients who participated in The CABG Patch Trial. This 
      trial evaluated the potential benefit of empiric ICD implantation in patients 
      with an increased risk of arrhythmic cardiac death as determined by reduced 
      ejection fraction (<0.36) and an abnormal signal-averaged ECG. Patients were 
      randomized to control (no ICD) or treatment (ICD) limbs. QOL was measured using 
      the SF-36 and other measures among 490 (68%) of 719 patients available at 6-month 
      follow-up. Analysis was performed on 228 control patients (those without ICDs) 
      and 262 patients with ICDs. RESULTS: Six months after having CABG surgery, 
      patients in the ICD group had lower levels of psychological well-being than those 
      in the control group. In addition, compared to controls, patients whose ICDs had 
      delivered therapy reported feeling less healthy, had reduced physical and 
      emotional role functioning, and had lower levels of psychological well-being. 
      CONCLUSION: Strategies aimed at easing patients' adjustment to ICDs should be 
      developed and tested for efficacy in the setting of ICD prophylaxis.

TI  - Long-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an 8-year follow-up.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Between 1988 and 1994, 441 patients were successfully resuscitated outside 
      hospital in the city of Rotterdam, of whom 276 (63%) were discharged from 
      hospital alive. Long-term survival was studied amongst those who were discharged 
      alive. The duration of follow-up averaged 6.71 years. A survival rate of 88% 
      after 1 year, 81% after 3 years, 77% after 5 years and 73% after 7 years was 
      found. After multivariate analysis, age, diagnosis and gender were found to be 
      independent and significant predictors of survival. No significant difference in 
      survival was found in patients who had been resuscitated by emergency personnel, 
      physicians and bystanders. Patients who were still alive were sent a 
      EuroQol-questionnaire. No differences in outcomes between the four groups were 
      found. Since long-term prognosis after out-of-hospital resuscitation is 
      satisfactory, learning programmes for resuscitation should be continued.

TI  - What is the quality of life for survivors of cardiac arrest? A prospective study.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life of survivors of in-hospital and 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and to correlate quality of life with clinically 
      important parameters. METHODS: Cohort followed at least six months after hospital 
      discharge. Eligible patients had survived to hospital discharge after sudden 
      cardiac arrest in 1) EDs, wards, and intensive care units of five university 
      hospitals and 2) all locations outside hospitals in two midsized cities. Of 126 
      patients discharged alive, 30 died before they could be interviewed. Of the 96 
      patients remaining, 86 (90% of available patients, 68% of survivors to discharge) 
      completed the interview. Quality of life was assessed with the Health Utilities 
      Index Mark 3, which describes health as a utility score on a scale from perfect 
      health (equal to 1.0) to death (equal to 0.) RESULTS: Mean age (+/- SD) of 
      interviewed survivors was 65 +/- 14 years, and 47 (55%) were male; mean time 
      between collapse and initiation of CPR was 2.2 +/- 2.6 minutes. Mean utility was 
      0.72 (+/- 0.22). Utilities were significantly higher among patients who had a 
      shorter duration of resuscitation (mean = 0.81 for those who received less than 2 
      minutes of CPR, 0.76 for those who received 3 to 10 minutes, and 0.65 for others, 
      p = 0.05, r2 = 0.07). Mean utilities of survivors were worse than those of the 
      general population (mean = 0.85 +/- 0.16, p < 0.01) and those whose activities 
      were not limited by chronic disease (mean = 0.91 +/- 0.08, p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although overall survival was poor, most survivors had acceptable 
      health-related quality of life. Therefore, concerns about poor quality of life 
      are not a valid reason to abandon efforts to improve the health care system's 
      response to victims of sudden cardiac arrest. Further research is necessary to 
      identify effective strategies for improving both survival and quality of life 
      after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Quality of life after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
PG  - 524-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the influence of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 
      (CPR) on the components of quality of life (QOL) of patients after discharge from 
      the hospital. DESIGN: Extracted from a prospective national survey on Dutch 
      intensive care units (ICUs). SETTING: Thirty-six ICUs of both university and 
      nonuniversity hospitals, spread throughout the country. METHODS: For a period of 
      6 months, 9,803 consecutive ICU admissions entered the study. Outcome in 
      connection with in-hospital CPR was analyzed by comparing the CPR group (n = 477) 
      with a standardized control group without CPR (n = 500). INTERVENTIONS: 
      Activities of daily living were registered at the time of hospital admission. A 
      record was kept of each patient for demographics, severity of illness, length of 
      stay, daily use of manpower and ICU technology, and mortality. Six months after 
      hospital discharge, the QOL of 69 patients in both the CPR and control groups was 
      measured with the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). RESULTS: CPR was performed in 
      4.8 percent of the patients, mainly from the general ward. These patients were 
      older, had a higher severity of illness, and a higher daily consumption of 
      nursing resources. The QOL did not correlate with severity of illness on 
      admission, length of stay, or consumption of resources in the ICU. On the whole, 
      the SIP scores of both CPR and control groups did not differ much: 11.7 vs 10.7, 
      and circulatory arrest did not appear to impair the self-sufficiency in the study 
      group significantly in comparison with the controls. An increased dysfunction was 
      found in the CPR group of patients concerning their work and their psychosocial 
      functioning. CONCLUSION: Patients who have recovered from a circulatory arrest 
      after CPR resuscitation find their capacity for resuming work diminished after 
      discharge from the hospital, while they seem to experience a postponed negative 
      effect on their mental functioning, especially the functions connected with the 
      awareness of their environment.

TI  - Health status and quality of life following cardiac transplantation.
PG  - 490-3
AB  - There is little information regarding the functional status and quality of life 
      of cardiac transplant patients. This investigation is the largest study 
      describing outcome up to 10 years after cardiac transplantation. We conducted a 
      cross-sectional survey of 200 cardiac transplant recipients using the Sickness 
      Impact Profile and a supplementary questionnaire. The response rate was 48%. The 
      median duration post-cardiac transplantation was 2.3 years (range, 0.5 to 9.7 
      years). The median age was 53 years (range, 27.1 to 68.7). In comparison to 
      previously published studies, our sample of cardiac transplant recipients had 
      worse quality of life than normals, similar scores to cardiac arrest survivors 
      and post-myocardial infarction patients, and better quality of life than patients 
      with low back pain. We found that those not working (44%) reported a lower 
      quality of life. Musculoskeletal-neurologic complaints were highly prevalent, 
      with generalized weakness in 54% responding, fatigue in 42%, and low back pain in 
      37%. Lower quality of life was found in patients reporting a higher number of 
      musculoskeletal-neurological disorders. We conclude that there are specific areas 
      for rehabilitation intervention in patients post-cardiac transplantation, and 
      suggest areas for future research directed towards enhancing quality of life for 
      cardiac transplant recipients.

TI  - Prehospital cardiac arrest survival and neurologic recovery.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Many studies of prehospital defibrillation have been conducted but the effects of 
      airway intervention are unknown and neurologic follow-up has been incomplete. A 
      non-randomized cohort prospective study was conducted to determine the 
      effectiveness of defibrillation in prehospital cardiac arrest. Two ambulance 
      companies in the study area developed a defibrillation protocol and they formed 
      the experimental group. A subgroup of these patients received airway management 
      with an esophageal obturator airway (EOA) or endotracheal intubation (ETT). The 
      control group was composed of patients who suffered a prehospital cardiac arrest 
      and did not receive prehospital defibrillation. All survivors were assessed for 
      residual deficits using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Dementia Rating 
      Scale (DRS). A total of 221 patients were studied over a 32-month period. Both 
      the experimental group (N = 161) and the control group (N = 60) were comparable 
      with respect to age, sex distribution, and ambulance response time. Survival to 
      hospital discharge was 2/60 (3.3%) in the control group and 12/161 (6.3%) in the 
      experimental group. This difference is not statistically significant. Survival in 
      the experimental group by airway management technique was basic airway support 
      (3/76 3.9%), EOA (3/67 4.5%), and ETT (6/48 12.5%). The improved effect on 
      survival by ETT management was statistically significant. Survivors had minor 
      differences in memory, work, and recreation as compared to ischemic heart disease 
      patients as measured by the SIP and DRS. No effect of defibrillation was found on 
      survival to hospital discharge. However, endotracheal intubation improved 
      survival in defibrillated patients. Survivors had a good functional outcome.

AB  - We interviewed 308 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and matched 
      controls who had suffered a myocardial infarction. The Sickness Impact Profile 
      (SIP) scores of controls were somewhat lower (better) than those of cases, but 
      responses of cases and controls to additional questions about stair climbing, 
      irritability and mood were virtually identical. Half as many (18 per cent) 
      controls as cases (38 per cent) reported poorer memory function; nevertheless, 63 
      per cent of cases and 79 per cent of controls who had been working outside the 
      home at the time of the event were employed at the time of the interview.

AB  - The health status of long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was 
      studied six months after the event. Although Sickness Impact Profile scores for 
      arrest survivors were higher (worse) than scores of enrollees in a prepaid closed 
      panel health plan, in most cases problems of survivors were not incapacitating. 
      Approximately three-fifths of survivors reported same or better memory function 
      and stair climbing ability compared to that at time of arrest. Three-fifths of 
      those who had been working continued to do so.

PG  - 259-63
AB  - To determine how emergency service factors affect the health status of survivors 
      of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 424 survivors were studied six months later. 
      The principal research tool was the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), a 
      behaviorally-based instrument for measuring sickness-related dysfunction. Time to 
      initiation of care and time to definitive care were significantly related to 
      dysfunction. The critical time intervals can be influenced by the manner in which 
      communities provide emergency care.
