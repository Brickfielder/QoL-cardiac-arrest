TI  - Preliminary Exploration of Long-Term Patient Outcomes After Tracheostomy in Burns: A Burn Model System Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Upper airway management is crucial to burn care. Endotracheal intubation is often performed in the setting of inhalation injury, burns of the face and neck, or large burns requiring significant resuscitation. Tracheostomy may be necessary in patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support. This study compares long-term, patient-reported outcomes in burn patients with and without tracheostomy.Materials and methods: Data from the Burn Model System Database, collected from 2013 to 2020, were analyzed. Demographic and clinical data were compared between those with and without tracheostomy. The following patient-reported outcomes, collected at 6-, 12-, and 24-mo follow-up, were analyzed: Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure, employment status, and days to return to work. Regression models and propensitymatched analyses were used to assess the associations between tracheostomy and each outcome.Results: Of 714 patients included in this study, 5.5% received a tracheostomy. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated that only VR-12 Physical Component Summary scores at 24-mo follow-up were significantly worse among those requiring tracheostomy. Tracheostomy was not associated with VR-12 Mental Component Summary, Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, or Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure scores. Likewise, tracheostomy was not found to be independently associated with employment status or days to return to work.Conclusions: This preliminary exploration suggests that physical and psychosocial recovery, as well as the ability to regain employment, are no worse in burn patients requiring tracheostomy. Future investigations of larger scale are still needed to assess center- and provider-level influences, as well as the influences of various hallmarks of injury severity. Nonetheless, this work should better inform goals of care discussions with patients and families regarding the use of tracheostomy in burn injury.Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Severe Abdominal Trauma: A Secondary Analysis of the Damage Control Laparotomy Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
CP  - 17th Annual Meeting Academic Surgical Congress
AB  - Introduction: Little is known about patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following abdominal trauma. We hypothesized that patients undergoing definitive laparotomy (DEF) would have better PROs compared to those treated with damage control laparotomy (DCL). Methods: The DCL Trial randomized DEF versus DCL in abdominal trauma. PROs were measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D) questionnaire at discharge and six months postdischarge (1 = perfect health, 0 = death, and <0 = worse than death) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian. Unadjusted Bayesian analysis with a neutral prior was used to assess the posterior probability of achieving minimal clinically important difference. Results: Of 39 randomized patients (21 DEF versus 18 DCL), 8 patients died (7 DEF versus 1 DCL). Of those who survived, 28 completed the EQ-5D at discharge (12 DEF versus 16 DCL) and 25 at 6 mo (12 DEF versus 13 DCL). Most patients were male (79%) with a median age of 30 (interquartile range (IQR) 21-42), suffered blunt injury (56%), and were severely injured (median injury severity score 33, IQR 21 - 42). Median EQ-5D value at discharge was 0.20 (IQR 0.06 - 0.52) DEF versus 0.31 (IQR -0.03 - 0.43) DCL, and at six months 0.51 (IQR 0.30 0.74) DEF versus 0.50 (IQR 0.28 - 0.84) DCL. The posterior probability of minimal clinically important difference DEF versus DCL at discharge and six months was 16% and 23%, respectively.

TI  - Is frailty associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest? - A Swedish cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Frailty is associated with poor 30-days survival after in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.Methods: Patients aged >= 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Results: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, respectively, p-value < 0.01).Conclusion: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and poorer general health.

TI  - Assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review of patient-reported outcome measures
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: High quality evidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can measure the long-term impact of CA. The aim of this study was to critically appraise the evidence of psychometric quality and acceptability of measures used in the assessment of HRQoL in cardiac arrest survivors.
   Methods: Systematic literature searches (2004-2017) and named author searches to identify articles pertaining to the measurement of HRQoL. Data on study quality, measurement and practical properties were extracted and assessed against international standards.
   Results: From 356 reviewed abstracts, 69 articles were assessed in full. 25 provided evidence for 10 measures of HRQoL: one condition-specific; three generic profile measures; two generic index; and four utility measures. Although limited, evidence for measurement validity was strongest for the HUI3 and SF-36. However, evidence for reliability, content validity, responsiveness and interpretability and acceptability was generally limited or not available in the CA population for all measures.
   Conclusions: This review has demonstrated that a measure of quality of life specific to OHCA survivors is not available. Limited evidence of validity exists for one utility measure - the HUI3 - and a generic profile - the SF-36. Robust evidence of the quality and acceptability of HRQoL measures in OHCA was limited or not available. Future collaborative research must seek to urgently establish the relevance and acceptability of these measures to OHCA survivors, to establish robust evidence of essential measurement and practical properties over the short and long-term, and to inform future HRQoL assessment in the OHCA population.

TI  - How do survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest perceive their health compared to the norm population? A nationwide registry study from Norway
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Self-perceived health status data is usually collected using patient-reported outcome measures. Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out -ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate. Results: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 +/- 0.24 vs 0.82 +/- 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 +/- 21 vs 79 +/- 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension. Conclusions: Norwegian OHCA survivors reported poorer health than the general population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L. PROMs use in this population can be used to inform follow-up and health care delivery.

TI  - Determinants of health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: With a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors globally, the focus of OHCA management has now broadened to survivorship. An outcome central to survivorship is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to the determinants of HRQoL of OHCA survivors.Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 15 August 2022 to identify studies investigating the asso-ciation of at least one determinant and HRQoL in adult OHCA survivors. All articles were independently reviewed by two investigators. We abstracted data pertaining to determinants and classified them using a well-established HRQoL theoretical framework - the Wilson and Cleary (re-vised) model.Results: 31 articles assessing a total of 35 determinants were included. Determinants were classified into the five domains in the HRQoL model. 26 studies assessed determinants related to individual characteristics (n = 3), 12 studied biological function (n = 7), nine studied symptoms (n = 3), 16 studied functioning (n = 5), and 35 studied characteristics of the environment (n = 17). In studies that included multivariable analyses, most reported that individual characteristics (older age, female sex), symptoms (anxiety, depression), and functioning (impaired neurocognitive function) were sig-nificantly associated with poorer HRQoL.Conclusions: Individual characteristics, symptoms, and functioning played significant roles in explaining the variability in HRQoL. Significant non-modifiable determinants such as age and sex could be used to identify populations at risk of poorer HRQoL, while significant modifiable determinants such as psychological health and neurocognitive functioning could serve as targets for post-discharge screening and rehabilitation plans.

TI  - COSCA (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Adults: An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomised clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritised through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterised relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with >= 1 tools from Health Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources allow.

TI  - In-depth assessment of health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Evidence on physical and psychological well-being of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors is scarce. The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Methods: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Results: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5). Discussion: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Low physical activity level in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with obesity, mobility problems and cognitive impairment: Results from the TTM2 trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To describe the level of physical activity 6 months after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and to explore potential risk factors of a low level of physical activity. Methods: Post-hoc analyses of the international multicentre Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial. At 6 months, survivors at 61 sites in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland were invited to a follow-up. The participants answered two questions on self-reported physical activity. Answers were categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of physical activity and further dichotomized into a low versus moderate/high level of physical activity. Potential risk factors for a low level of physical activity were collected and investigated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results: At 6 months, 807 of 939 (86%) OHCA survivors answered the two questions of physical activity; 34% reported a low, 44% moderate and 22% high level of physical activity. Obesity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.77, p = 0.018), mobility problems by EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.06-2.84, p = 0.029), and cognitive impairment by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.82, p = 0.013) were significantly associated with a low level of physical activity in the multivariable analysis. Conclusion: One third of the OHCA survivors reported a low level of physical activity. Obesity, mobility problems, and cognitive impairment were associated with a low level of physical activity.

TI  - Psychometric evaluation of EQ-5D-5L in OHCA survivors from the TTM2 trial: a post hoc analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aims: Our aim was to investigate the psychometric properties of the health assessment instrument EQ-5D-5L in OHCA survivors. Methods: We included survivors from the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial, who completed EQ-5D-5L at 6 months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the hypothesised unidimensional latent structure of EQ level sum score (EQ LSS), summarizing scores across Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/depression. Differential item functioning was evaluated for age. We examined internal consistency and precision for the EQ LSS. We evaluated construct validity of EQ LSS, EQ value and EQ VAS, using the modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, representing functional outcome and cognitive function-two common health challenges experienced by OHCA survivors. Results: 783 of 939 (84%) eligible survivors were included. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit and strong factor loadings for all dimensions (0.61-0.90). We observed a significant but negligible effect of age on Mobility (b = 0.29, p < 0.001, Delta R-2 = 0.019). Internal consistency was 0.88. The floor effect was 35%. Survivors with more functional dependency and/or cognitive problems reported significantly worse health by EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS (all, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The psychometric properties of EQ LSS support its use to measure health status in OHCA research. The strong association between health and functional dependency indicate robust and comparable construct validity for EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS in this sample.

TI  - Long-term impact of chronic pelvic pain on quality of life in women with and without endometriosis
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) has a significant impact on patients' health-relatedquality of life (HRQoL). Endometriosis is a common cause of CPR Data is lacking on long-term HRQoL outcomes in patients with endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain (EACPP) versus other causes of chronic pelvic pain (OCPP). Methods: In this retrospective single-survey study, 198 patients completed the EHP-30 and the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) Global Health validated questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 8-10 years after index surgery. Results: Demographic comparison revealed significant differences in racial demographics and disability status between the EACPP and OCPP groups. There was no significant difference in EHP-30, PROMIS Global Physical, or Global Mental scores between the two groups. Patients with lower stage endometriosis (stage I/II) reported diminished HRQoL in the EHP-30 and Global Physical scores as compared to patients with higher stage (stage III/IV) endometriosis or OCR Additionally, no differences were found between incidence of abuse history and EHP-30 and PROM IS scores between the two groups. Higher age and higher PROMIS Global Physical scores were associated with lower pain and higher HRQoL scores on the EHP-30. Persistently high rates of sexual dysfunction were seen across both groups. Discussion: This study demonstrates that women with EACPP and OCPP appear to have similar natural histories and quality of life on long term follow-up. Race, age, disability, and physical health status may play key roles in perceived quality of life. The high rate of persistent sexual dysfunction is concerning and requires increased clinician intervention.

TI  - Quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a TOMAHAWK sub-study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims The TOMAHAWK trial compared immediate coronary angiography with a delayed/selective strategy in 554 resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevations. Mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. In addition to survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key outcome parameter for OHCA patients.Methods and results The analysis included 169 survivors from the TOMAHAWK trial who completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up (6M-FU/12M-FU). HRQoL was assessed using a questionnaire based on the EuroQoL-5D-3L. This tool includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best imaginable subjective health) and a descriptive system with five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No relevant differences were found between patients in the immediate angiography group and those in the delayed/selective angiography group regarding EQ-VAS scores at 6M-FU (70 +/- 21 vs. 74 +/- 18) and 12M-FU (72 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 17). Patients reported the most problems with usual activities (33% and 38%, respectively), and the fewest limitations in self-care (18% and 17%, respectively) at 6M-FU. Women reported more problems than men in all five dimensions. Elderly patients (>= 65 years) were more likely than younger OHCA survivors to indicate limitations in mobility, self-care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort.Conclusion OHCA survivors of the TOMAHAWK trial rated their HRQoL 6 and 12 months after the event as relatively good, but there were notable differences between women and men and between younger and elderly patients. The angiography strategy did not affect HRQoL.Trial registration www.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02750462.

TI  - Self-reported limitations in physical function are common 6 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors generally report good health-related quality of life, but physical aspects of health seem more affected than other domains. Limitations in physical function after surviving OHCA have received little attention.
   Aims: To describe physical function 6 months after OHCA and compare it with a group of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) controls, matched for country, age, sex and time of the cardiac event. A second aim was to explore variables potentially associated with self-reported limitations in physical function in OHCA survivors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional sub-study of the Targeted Temperature Management at 33 degrees C versus 36 degrees C (TTM) trial with a follow-up 6 months post-event. Physical function was the main outcome assessed with the self-reported Physical Functioning-10 items scale (PF-10). PF-10 is presented as T-scores (0-100), where 50 represents the norm mean. Scores <47 at a group level, or <45 at an individual level indicate limitations in physical function.
   Results: 287 OHCA survivors and 119 STEMI controls participated. Self-reported physical function by PF-10 was significantly lower for OHCA survivors compared to STEMI controls (mean 46.0, SD 11.2 vs. 48.8, SD 9.0, p= 0.025). 38% of OHCA survivors compared to 26% of STEMI controls reported limitations in physical function at an individual level (p = 0.022). The most predictive variables for self-reported limitations in physical function in OHCA survivors were older age, female sex, cognitive impairment, and symptoms of anxiety and depression after 6 months.
   Conclusion: Self-reported limitations in physical function are more common in OHCA survivors compared to STEMI controls.

TI  - CARDIS (Cardiac ARrest DIgital Support): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a web-based support intervention for cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Surviving sudden cardiac arrest often lead to long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. Although clinical guidelines recommend structured post-cardiac arrest follow-up, such follow-up is often lacking or inconsistent. Tailored digital interventions are scarce but may help address gaps in follow-up resources. The CARDIS trial evaluates the effects on patient-reported outcome measures of a co-created, web-based support programme designed to improve wellbeing, self management, and reintegration into everyday life for cardiac arrest survivors. Methods: CARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling cardiac arrest survivors aged >18 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard post-cardiac arrest care, including a routine followup visit with screening and management of cognitive, physical and emotional health, as well as a printed booklet. The intervention group will additionally receive access to a webbased selfguided support programme for 3 months. After study completion, control participants will be offered the programme. Outcomes: Primary outcome is overall wellbeing and health (QWB) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported cognitive problems, HRQoL, life satisfaction, symptoms of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. A process evaluation will evaluate social selection bias, adherence and participants experiences. Discussion: The CARDIS trial will investigate the use of more accessible and standardised follow-up pathways by complementing existing care structures, thereby enhancing equity in long-term recovery and quality-of-life without requiring additional healthcare resources. The process evaluation will provide data on adherence, social selection, and engagement, essential for future implementation. Trial registration: The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07240714).

TI  - Health-related quality of life in young Norwegian survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to pre-arrest exercise habits
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in young survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Norway with an age and sex-matched reference population and to assess the associations between exercise volume prior to OHCA and HRQoL after. Methods: We present data from survivors aged 18-50 years registered with OHCA in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017. Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise habits prior to OHCA. Respondents were randomly matched 1:1 for age and sex with a reference population (data were available from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data). Results: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised >5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly (p < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical-and mental health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting >5 hours of exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less. Conclusion: Poorer HRQoL in survivors compared to the reference population should prompt us to explore how treatment and rehabilitation could be improved and adapted. More exercise before OHCA favoured better HRQoL after, which aligns well with the recognised positive association between HRQoL and physical activity in general.

TI  - Assessing adult attachment after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an exploratory analysis and construct validation of the ECR-RS
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To explore the construct validity of the 'Experience in Close Relationships-Relationship Structures'-questionnaire (ECR-RS) in a population of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Objectives were to (i) describe item-and scale-level response patterns, and (ii) evaluate the preliminary construct validity of the ECR-RS, including its dimensional (structural), known-groups, and convergent validity. Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional validation study, with OHCA survivors completing the ECR-RS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the mental health component from the Short Form-12 (SF-12 MCS) three months post-arrest. Descriptive statistics and floor/ceiling analyses were performed. Dimensional validity was assessed using response distribution patterns and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by reliability using Cronbach's as. Known-group validity was tested using a priori hypotheses, Spearman's correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Convergent validity was evaluated by correlating ECR-RS total scores with HADS and SF-12 MCS. Results: Among 123 survivors (median age 59.9 years, 84 % male), ECR-RS total scores were low on both subscales and floor effects were observed at scale level (31 % for avoidant and 72 % for anxious attachment). EFA supported the expected two-factor structure, though item 4-6 showed poor loadings/cross-loadings. Internal consistency was acceptable (total scale Cronbach's a = 0.88) and improved when problematic items were excluded. Known-group hypotheses were not supported. Anxious attachment correlated moderately with symptoms of anxiety and depression and was inversely correlated with mental health scores. Conclusion: The ECR-RS demonstrated partial construct validity among OHCA survivors, but item-level inconsistencies and pronounced floor effects limit its utility. Findings highlight the need fora revised instrument better suited to post-cardiac arrest relational and psychological dynamics.

TI  - Impact of frailty on mortality, functional outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: insights from the TTM2-trial
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose To explore the association of frailty with mortality, functional outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods This is a cohort-based secondary analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial, an international, prospective, multicentre study. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (1-9): fit (1-3), prefrail (4), frail (5), and severely frail (6-9). Main outcomes were mortality and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 6 and 24 months. Additional outcomes included neuroprognostication, withdrawal-of-life-sustaining-therapies (WLST), functional decline (retrospectively reported pre-arrest versus 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score), health status (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and life satisfaction at 6 and 24 months. Results Of 1861 participants, 240 (13%) were prefrail, and 188 (10%) were frail or severely frail. Mortality and poor functional outcome increased significantly with greater frailty. Compared to fit participants, adjusted ORs (95% CI) for 6 month mortality were: prefrail 2.7 (1.8-3.8), frail 3.7 (1.9-7.1), and severely frail 8.9 (4.2-18.7); and poor functional outcome: prefrail 2.9 (1.9-4.2), frail 3.9 (1.9-8.1), and severely frail 35.4 (8.4-148.8). Severely frail participants underwent neuroprognostication less often (p < 0.001), while WLST was more common in the prefrail, frail and severely frail (p < 0.001). Prefrail and frail survivors tended to report more frequent functional decline and lower health status, though with individual variation. Conclusion Frailty was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Findings suggest more frequent functional decline and lower overall health status in frail survivors.

TI  - Smartphone-Based Video Antenatal Preterm Birth Education The Preemie Prep for Parents Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Pediatric-Academic-Societies (PAS)
AB  - IMPORTANCE Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and child morbidity. Preterm birth is not always unexpected, yet standard prenatal care does not offer anticipatory education to parents at risk of delivering preterm, which leaves parents unprepared to make health care choices during the pregnancy that can improve survival and decrease morbidity in case of preterm birth.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of the Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) program on maternal knowledge of preterm birth, preparation for decision-making, and anxiety.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Recruitment for this randomized clinical trial conducted at a US academic medical center took place from February 3, 2020, to April 12, 2021. A total of 120 pregnant persons with a risk factor for preterm birth were enrolled between 16 and 21 weeks' gestational age and followed up through pregnancy completion.
   INTERVENTION Starting at 18 weeks' gestational age, P3 program participants received links delivered via text message to 51 gestational age-specific short animated videos. Control participants received links to patient education webpages from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At 25 weeks' gestation, scores on the Parent Prematurity Knowledge Questionnaire (scored as percent correct), Preparation for Decision Making Scale (scored 0-100), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety computerized adaptive test. Analysis was based on an intention to treat.
   RESULTS A total of 120 pregnant participants (mean [SD] age, 32.5 [4.9] years) were included in the study; 60 participants were randomized to each group. Participants in the P3 group scored higher than those in the control group on knowledge of long-term outcomes at 25 weeks (88.5% vs 73.2%; estimated difference, 15.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.3-22.5 percentage points; P < .001). Participants in the P3 group reported being significantly more prepared than did participants in the control group for neonatal resuscitation decision-making at 25 weeks (Preparation for Decision Making Scale score, 76.0 vs 52.3; difference, 23.7; 95% CI, 14.1-33.2). There was no difference between the P3 group and the control group in anxiety at 25 weeks (mean [SE] PROMIS Anxiety scores, 53.8 [1.1] vs 54.0 [1.1]; difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -3.2 to 2.9).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, pregnant persons randomly assigned to the P3 program had more knowledge of core competencies and were more prepared to make decisions that affect maternal and infant health, without experiencing worse anxiety. Mobile antenatal preterm birth education may provide a unique benefit to parents with preterm birth risk factors.

TI  - Health-Related Quality of Life and Long-Term Survival After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - This cohort study examines whether health-related quality of life 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is associated with long-term survival among adults who survived in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   QuestionIs health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest associated with long-term survival?FindingsIn this cohort study including 2000 survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest and 1108 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), poorer HRQOL reported with the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaire was associated with reduced long-term survival (assessed up to 7 years) in both cohorts, although uncertainty was higher among OHCA survivors.MeaningFindings suggest that HRQOL measured after cardiac arrest with the EQ-5D-5L may help identify survivors at risk of reduced long-term survival and inform follow-up care and rehabilitation; further research should confirm clinical utility.
   ImportanceHealth-related quality of life (HRQOL) follow-up can increase knowledge of cardiac arrest outcomes from the patient's perspective. Whether HRQOL affects long-term survival is unknown.ObjectiveTo investigate whether HRQOL 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is associated with long-term survival.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study linked 5 national registers with nationwide coverage in Sweden across a 7-year period and included survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, with follow-up through June 30, 2021. Participants were adults surviving at least 90 days after IHCA or OHCA who completed follow-up EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaires. Analyses were performed December 2 to 20, 2024.ExposuresEQ-5D-5L level sum score (LSS; sum of EQ-5D-5L dimensions, ranging from 5 [no problems] to 25 [extreme problems in all dimensions]), and the visual analog scale EQ VAS, 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest.Main Outcome and MeasuresLong-term survival up to a maximum of 7 years among patients surviving IHCA and OHCA.ResultsIn total, 2000 survivors of IHCA (median [IQR] age, 73 [65-80] years, 66% male) and 1108 survivors of OHCA (median [IQR] age, 69 [59-75] years, 77% male) were included. There were 475 deaths among patients with IHCA and 132 deaths among patients with OHCA. For patients with IHCA, the LSS distribution was 394 (20%) for LSS 5, 1034 (52%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 572 (29%) for LSS 11 to 25. For patients with OHCA, the LSS distribution was 299 (27%) for LSS 5, 637 (58%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 168 (15%) for LSS 11 to 25. In the IHCA population, LSS 11 to 25 had higher hazard of death compared with LSS 5 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.50 [95% CI, 1.82-3.43]), whereas LSS 6 to 10 did not (AHR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.88-1.65]). In OHCA, no associations were found between LSS categories and long-term survival (LSS 11-25 vs LSS 5: AHR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.83-2.42]; LSS 6-10 vs LSS 5: AHR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.56-1.39]). In both IHCA and OHCA, spline modeling using LSS and EQ VAS as continuous variables showed significant increases in hazards of death with poorer HRQOL, although the estimates in the OHCA population showed greater uncertainty.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cohort study of patients who survived beyond 90 days after IHCA or OHCA, poorer HRQOL reported with EQ-5D-5L scores 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest was associated with reduced long-term survival in both groups, with greater uncertainty for OHCA estimates. HRQOL assessment may help guide follow-up care.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; a comparison of prehospital return-of-spontaneous circulation and refractory arrest managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for selected refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is increasingly used. Detailed knowledge of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term cognitive function is limited. HRQoL and cognitive function were assessed in ECPR-survivors and OHCA-survivors with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation after standard advanced cardiac life support Methods: Fifteen ECPR-survivors and 22 age-matched sACLS-survivors agreed to participate in this follow-up study. Participants were examined with echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and neuropsychological testing, and answered HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and Short Form 36 (SF-36)), and Results: Most patients were male (73 % and 82 %) and median age at follow-up was similar between groups (55 years and 60 years). Low flow time was significantly longer for ECPR-survivors (86 min vs. 15 min) and lactate levels were significantly higher (14.1 mmol/l vs. 3.9 mmol/l). No betweengroup difference was found in physical function nor in cognitive function with scores corresponding to the 23rd worst percentile of the general population. SACLS-survivors had HRQoL on level with the Danish general population while ECPR-survivors scored lower in both EQ-5D-5L (index score 0.73 vs. 0.86, p = 0.03, visual analog scale: 70 vs. 84, p = 0.04) and in multiple SF-36 health domains (role physical, bodily pain, general health, and Conclusions: Despite substantially longer low flow times with thrice as high lactate levels, ECPR-survivors were similar in cognitive and physical function compared to sACLS-survivors. Nonetheless, ECPR-survivors reported lower HRQoL overall and related to mental health, pain management, and the perception of limitations in physical role.

AB  - Aim: To compare the long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between patients receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) and conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods and Settings: A retrospective cohort study using the Australian and New Zealand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EXCEL) registry for ECPR cases and the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) for CCPR cases. All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12month EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS). Results: There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data. The ECPR cohort was younger [mean(SD) 50.4(13.46) vs 60.5(14.01) yrs, p < 0.01] and more likely to have received bystander CPR [19(79%) ECPR vs 397(52%) CCPR, p < 0.001]. Both cohorts had similar proportions of males, witnessed arrests and initial shockable rhythms. Median (IQR) arrest to ROSC/ECMO time was longer in ECPR than CCPR [61(41.5-97) vs 6(2-14) minutes, p < 0.001]. The median (IQR) EQ-5D-5L utility score [0.95 (0.72-1) ECPR vs 0.96 (0.86-1) CCPR, p = 0.64] and median (IQR) EQ-VAS at 12 months [80 (64.5-90) ECPR vs 75 (60-85) CCPR, p = 0.39] were similar. There were no significant differences in the EQ-5D-5L utility scores and EQ-VAS even after Conclusions: Despite significant baseline differences between ECPR and CCPR, there were no differences in HRQoL at 12 months.

TI  - Long-term survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with mechanical circulatory support
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Studies on long-term outcomes after refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) are limited. This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS.Methods: This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cere -bral Performance Category (CPC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2. Health-related quality of life was measured by questionnaires (Short Form-36 (SF-36)).Results: A total of 101 patients with refractory OHCA were treated with MCS at Aarhus University Hospital between 2015 and 2019. The total low-flow time was median 105 min [IQR, 94-123] minutes. The hospital discharge rate was 27%. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 years +/- 1.6 (range 2.8- 6.1 years), 21 patients remained alive of whom 15 consented to participate in the present study. Good neurological outcome with CPC 1-2 was found in 93% (14/15) patients. No severe cognitive function was discovered; mean MoCA score of 26.4 +/- 3.1. Functional capacity examined by CPX showed acceptable VO2 max values (23.9 +/- 6.3 mL/kg/min). Mean SF-36 scores revealed an overall high level of quality of life in long-term survivors.Conclusions: Long-term survival with a good neurological outcome with functional recovery was high in patients with refractory OHCA treated with MCS. These patients may expect a reasonable quality of life after discharge despite prolonged resuscitation.

TI  - Physical, psychological, cognitive, social health outcomes, and health-related quality of life in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers: Protocol of the quality cardiac arrest survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS)
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an emergency with historically low survival rates. Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers. Objective: Our primary aim is to determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being. Methods: The Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants aged >= 18 years and caregivers aged >= 21 years will be recruited from all public hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, and Zarit Burden Interview. Discussion: This study allows us to understand the natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA sequelae.

TI  - Sex-related differences in long-term quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide cross-sectional survey study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims Sex differences in survival and short-term outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are well documented, but its impact on long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unclear.
   Methods and results This cross-sectional survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess HRQoL among adult OHCA survivors in Denmark between 2001 and 2019 who were alive as of 1 October 2020. Survivors were grouped by time since cardiac arrest: 0-4, >4-8, >8-12, and >12 years post-arrest. Among 2552 respondents (56.1% response rate), 2075 were men (81.3%) and 477 were women (18.7%). The mean survey age was 60.2 years (SD 14.7) for women and 66.0 years (SD 11.8) for men. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and EuroQol Health Questionnaire index scores were both lower for women than for men [69 vs. 75 and 0.76 (SD 0.21) vs. 0.84 (SD 0.17), respectively; P < 0.001]. The SF-12 physical and mental health scores were also lower for women [40.3 (SD 12.9) and 50.9 (SD 8.8)] compared with men [44.0 (SD 12.1) and 53.3 (SD 8.1); P < 0.001]. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for anxiety (5.4 vs. 3.5; P < 0.001) and for depression (4.0 vs. 3.2; P < 0.001) were higher among women. In multivariable logistic regression, female sex remained significantly associated with poorer long-term HRQoL outcomes. Trends remained consistent regardless of time since cardiac arrest.
   Conclusion Female OHCA survivors reported less favourable long-term HRQoL outcomes compared with male survivors, irrespective of time elapsed since cardiac arrest.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest - a five-year follow-up study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is affected after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but data several years after the arrest are lacking. We assessed long-term HRQoL in OHCA survivors and how known outcome predictors impact HRQoL.
   Methods: In adult OHCA survivors, HRQoL was assessed five years post arrest using Short-form 36 (SF-36), EQ-5D-3 L (EQ-5D) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) among others. Results were compared to the next of kins' estimates and to a Norwegian reference population.
   Results: Altogether 96 survivors were included mean 5.3 (range 3.6-7.2) years after OHCA. HRQoL compared well to the reference population, except for lower score for general health with 67.2 (95%CI (62.1; 72.3) vs. 72.9 (71.9; 74.0)), p = 0.03. Younger (<= 58 years) vs. older survivors scored lower for general health with mean (SD) of 62.1 (27.5) vs. 73.0 (19.5), p = 0.03, vitality (55.2 (20.5) vs. 64.6 (17.3), p = 0.02, social functioning (75.3 (28.7) vs. 94.1 (13.5), p < 0.001 and mental component summary (49.0 (9.9) vs. 55.8 (6.7), p < 0.001. They scored higher for HADS-anxiety (4.8 (3.6 vs. 2.7 (2.5), p = 0.001, and had lower EQ-5D index (0.72 (0.34) vs. 0.84 (0.19), p = 0.04. Early vs. late awakeners had higher EQ-5D index (0.82 (0.23) vs. 0.71 (0.35), p = 0.04 and lower HADS-depression scores (2.5 (2.9) vs. 3.8 (2.3), p = 0.04. Next of kin estimated HRQoL similar to the survivors' own estimates.
   Conclusions: HRQoL five years after OHCA was good and mainly comparable to a matched reference population. Stratified analyses revealed impaired HRQoL among younger survivors and those awakening late, mainly for mental domains.

TI  - Changes in health status and health related quality of life from six months to five years in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors - A NORCAST sub study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Brain injury in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors affects health status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is unknown how HRQoL evolves over time, and assessments at different time points may lead to different results. Methods: In a NORCAST sub study, OHCA survivors eligible for health status (EQ-5D-3L) and HRQoL (SF-36) assessments were examinated six months and five years after OHCA. At five-year follow-up, survivors also retrospectively assessed their health status for each consecutive year fol-lowing OHCA. The next of kin independently assessed health status and HRQoL of their respective OHCA survivors. Results: Among 138 survivors alive after six months and 117 after five years, 80 (88% male) completed both follow-ups. Health status and HRQoL remained stable over time, except for increasing SF-36 mental summary score and decreasing physical functioning and physical component score. Anxiety and depression levels were generally low, although younger survivors stated more anxiety than older survivors. Retrospective assessment showed reduced health status for the first two years, which increased only from the third year. Explorative analyses revealed that younger age, long-er time to return of spontaneous circulation (tROSC) and late awakening affected health status, particularly in the first two years post-arrest. Conclusions: OHCA survivors showed stable health status and HRQoL with only minor differences between six months and five years. Younger survivors with long tROSC, late awakening, and more anxiety and depression symptoms at six months, had reduced health status the first two years with significant improvements towards the fourth year.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest in Children: Long-Term Health Status and Health-Related Quality of Life
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To assess long-term health status and health-related quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest in childhood and their parents. In addition, to identify predictors of health status and health-related quality of life.
   Design: This medical follow-up study involved consecutive children surviving cardiac arrest between January 2002 and December 2011, who had been admitted to the ICU. Health status was assessed with a medical interview, physical examination, and the Health Utilities Index. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the Child Health Questionnaires and Short-Form 36.
   Setting: A tertiary care university children's hospital.
   Patients: Of the eligible 107 children, 57 (53%) filled out online questionnaires and 47 visited the outpatient clinic (median age, 8.7 yr; median follow-up interval, 5.6 yr).
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of the participants, 60% had an in-hospital cardiac arrest, 90% a nonshockable rhythm, and 50% a respiratory etiology of arrest. Mortality rate after hospital discharge was 10%. On health status, we found that 13% had long-term neurologic deficits, 34% chronic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache), 19% at least one sign suggestive of chronic kidney injury, and 15% needed special education. Health Utilities Index scores were significantly decreased on most utility scores and the overall Health Utilities Index mark 3 score. Compared with Dutch normative data, parent-reported health-related quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors was significantly worse on general health perception, physical role functioning, parental impact, and overall physical summary. On patient reports, no significant differences with normative data were found. Parents reported better family cohesion and better health-related quality of life for themselves on most scales. Patients' health status, general health perceptions, and physical summary scores were significantly associated with cardiac arrest-related preexisting condition.
   Conclusions: Considering the impact of cardiac arrest, the overall outcome after cardiac arrest in childhood is reasonably good. Prospective long-term outcome research in large homogeneous groups is needed.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after surviving an out-of-hospital compared to an in-hospital cardiac arrest: A Swedish population-based registry study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been reported for out-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) separately, but potential differences between the two groups are unknown. The aim of this study is therefore to describe and compare HRQoL in patients surviving OHCA and IHCA.
   Methods: Patients >= 18 years with Cerebral Performance Category 1-3 included in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2014 and 2017 were included. A telephone interview was performed based on a questionnaire sent 3-6 months post cardiac arrest, including EQ-5D-5L and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear- and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to describe and compare HRQoL in OHCA and IHCA survivors. Adjustments were made for sex, age and initial rhythm.
   Results: In all, 1369 IHCA and 772 OHCA survivors were included. Most OHCA and IHCA survivors reported no symptoms of with anxiety (88% and 84%) or depression (87% and 85%). IHCA survivors reported significantly more problems in the health domains mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain/discomfort (p < 0.001 for all) and scored lower general health measured by EQ-VAS (median 70 vs. 80 respectively, p < 0.001) compared with the OHCA survivors.
   Conclusion: Survivors of IHCA reported significantly worse HRQoL compared to survivors of OHCA. Consequently, research data gathered from one of these populations may not be generalizable to the other.

TI  - Comparison of health-related quality of life and functional recovery measurement tools in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Although a number of validated health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) instruments exist for critical care populations, a standardised approach to assessing the HR-QOL of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors has not been developed. We sought to compare the responses of 12-month OHCA survivors to three HR-QOL and functional recovery instruments, and assess instrument validity.
   Methods: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry invited 12-month OHCA survivors to participate in telephone follow-up between January 2011 and December 2015. Responders provided answers to the 12 Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Three-Level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). The SF-12 was also used to derive the SF-6D. Responses were used to assess the interpretability and construct validity of the instruments.
   Results: A total of 1188 patients and proxies responded. Large ceiling effects were observed for the EQ-5D-3L (patients = 46%, proxies = 23%). Substantial variability was also observed in SF-6D responses for patients who reported full health according to the EQ-5D-3L. For patient responders, the strongest correlations were observed between the EQ-5D-3L index score and SF-6D (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001), and between the SF-6D and SF-12 physical component (rho=0.69, p < 0.001). The distribution of the SF-6D and EQ-5D-3L differed significantly for patients reporting a lower or upper moderate GOSE outcome and lower or upper good recovery (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).
   Conclusions: The EQ-5D-3L demonstrated limited interpretability due to the presence of ceiling effects. However, the measurement properties of the SF-12, SF-6D and GOSE suggest that these may be useful measures of HR-QOL and functional recovery in OHCA survivors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Long-Term Survival and Quality of Life in Non-Surgical Adult Patients Supported with Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Oxygenation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) for hemodynamic support is on the rise. Not much is known about the impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its complications on long-term survival and quality of life. Methods: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we evaluated the survival and quality of life in patients treated with VA ECMO between May 2009 and July 2019. Follow-up was conducted between November 2019 and January 2020. Results: Overall, 118 patients were evaluated in this study. Of the 37 patients who were alive at hospital discharge, 32 answered the EuroQol-5 dimensional-5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). For patients discharged alive from the hospital, mean survival was 8.1 years, 8.4 years for cardiogenic shock, and 5.0 years for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. EQ-5D-5L index value of ECMO survivors was not significantly different from the general age-matched population. Neurologic complications and major bleeding during index hospitalization limit long-term quality of life. Conclusions: Patients treated with VA ECMO have high in-hospital mortality, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cardio-pulmonary resuscitation patients being at higher risk of early death. However, once discharged from the hospital, most patients remain alive with a reasonable quality of life.

TI  - Life after survival: Long-term daily functioning and quality of life after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Information about long-term consequences of cardiac arrest is sparse. Because the survival late is expected to increase, better knowledge of long-term functioning and quality of survival is essential.
   Objectives: To determine the level of functioning of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest Survivors 1-6 years later, and to evaluate the predictive value of medical variables oil long-term functioning.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study including 63 survivors of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted to a Dutch University hospital between 2001 and 2006. Participants received a questionnaire by post. Primary outcome measures were: participation in Society (Community Integration Questionnaire) and quality of life (SF-36). Secondary outcome Measures were: physical, cognitive and emotional impairment, daily functioning and caregiver strain. Statistical analyses included multiple regression analyses.
   Results: On average 3 years post-cardiac arrest, 74% of the patients experienced a low participation level in society compared with the general population. Over 50% reported severe fatigue, 38% feelings of anxiety and/or depression and 24% a decreased quality of life. Caregivers reported stress related responses, feelings of anxiety and lower quality of life. Seventeen percent of the caregivers reported high caregiver strain, which was associated with the patient's level of functioning. Gender, age, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and therapeutic hypothermia contributed to outcome on at least one domain of long-term functioning.
   Conclusions: After surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, many patients and partners encounter extensive impairments in their level of functioning and quality of life. Gender, age, PCI and therapeutic hypothermia are associated with differences in long-term functioning of patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Importance Allocating resources to increase survival after cardiac arrest requires survivors to have a good quality of life, but long-term data are lacking.Objective To determine the quality of life of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2019.Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the health-related quality of life of all adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry between June 1, 2001, and August 31, 2019, who were alive in October 2020 (follow-up periods, 0-1, >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, >10-15, and >15-20 years since arrest). The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.Exposure All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Main Outcome and Measures Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.Results Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.Conclusions and Relevance Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population. These findings support resource allocation and efforts targeted to increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Health status and psychological distress among in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors in relation to gender
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To describe health status and psychological distress among in -hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors in relation to gender.
   Methods: This national register study consists of data from follow-up registration of IHCA survivors 3-6 months post cardiac arrest (CA) in Sweden. A questionnaire was sent to the survivors, including measurements of health status (EQ-5D-5L) and psychological distress (HADS).
   Results: Between 2013 and 2015, 594 IHCA survivors were included in the study. The median values for EQ-5D-5L index and EQVAS among survivors were 0.78 (ql-q3 = 0.67-0.86) and 70 (ql -q3 = 50-80) respectively. The values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in women compared to men. In addition, women reported more problems than men in all dimensions of EQ-5D-5L, except self -care. A majority of the respondents reported no problems with anxiety (85.4%) and/or symptoms of depression (87.0%). Women reported significantly more problems with anxiety (p < 0.001) and symptoms of depression (p < 0.001) compared to men. Gender was significantly associated with poorer health status and more psychological distress. No interaction effects for gender and age were found.
   Conclusions: Although the majority of survivors reported acceptable health status and no psychological distress, a substantial proportion reported severe problems. Women reported worse health status and more psychological distress compared to men. Therefore, a higher proportion of women may be in need of support. Health care professionals should make efforts to identify health problems among survivors and offer individualised support when needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term survival and health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is an adverse event associated with high mortality. Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors. Methods: A multicentre prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. Patients > 18 years receiving car-diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by pre-arrest Mod-ified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year. Results: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 69.7% was functionally independent. Conclusion: One-year survival after IHCA in this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies. Survival is associated with a patient's pre-arrest functional status and morbidity. HRQoL appears acceptable, however functional rehabilitation warrants attention. These findings provide a comprehensive insight in in-hospital cardiac arrest prognosis.

TI  - Long-term follow-up and quality of life in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background: Since 2019, European guidelines recommend considering extracorporeal life support as salvage strategy for the treatment of acute high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest. However, data on long-term survival, quality of life (QoL) and cardiopulmonary function after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking.
   Methods: One hundred and nineteen patients with acute PE and severe cardiogenic shock or in need of mechanical resuscitation (CPR) received venoarterial or venovenous ECMO from 2007 to 2020. Long-term data were obtained from survivors by phone contact and personal interviews. Follow-up included a QoL analysis using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
   Results: The majority of patients (n = 80, 67%) were placed on ECMO during or after CPR with returned spontaneous circulation. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 45.4% (54/119). Nine patients died during follow-up. At a median follow-up of 54.5 months (25-73; 56 +/- 38 months), 34 patients answered the QoL questionnaire. QoL differed largely and was slightly reduced compared to a German reference population (EQ5D5L index 0.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.04; p < 0.01). 25 patients (73.5%) had no mobility limitations, 22 patients (65%) could handle their activities, while anxiety and depression were expressed by 10 patients (29.4%). Return-to-work status was 33.3% (average working hours: 36.2 +/- 12.5 h/per week), 15 (45.4%) had retired from work early. 12 patients (35.3%) expressed limited exercise tolerance and dyspnea. 59% (20/34) received echocardiography and pulmonary function testing, 50% (17/34) cardiopulmonary exercise testing. No relevant impairment of right ventricular function and an only slightly reduced mean peak oxygen uptake (76.3% predicted) were noted.
   Conclusions: Survivors from severe intractable PE in cardiogenic shock or even under CPR with ECMO seem to recover well with acceptable QoL and only minor cardiopulmonary limitations in the long term. To underline these results, further research with larger study cohorts must be obtained.

TI  - Systematic review of quality of life and other patient-centred outcomes after cardiac arrest survival
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: In cardiac arrest patients (in hospital and pre hospital) does resuscitation produce a good Quality of Life (QoL) for survivors after discharge from the hospital?
   Methods: Embase, Medline, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Academic Search Premier, the Central Database of Controlled Trials and the American Heart Association (AHA) Resuscitation End-note Library were searched using the terms ('Cardiac Arrest' (Mesh) OR 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation' (Mesh) OR 'Heart Arrest' (Mesh)) AND ('Outcomes' OR 'Quality of Life' OR 'Depression' OR 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder' OR 'Anxiety OR 'Cognitive Function' OR 'Participation' OR 'Social Function' OR 'Health Utilities Index' OR 'SF-36' OR 'EQ-5D' as text term.
   Results: There were 9 inception (prospective) cohort studies (LOE P1), 3 follow up of untreated control groups in randomised control trials (LOE P2), 11 retrospective cohort studies (LOE P3) and 47 case series (LOE P4).46 of the studies were supportive with respect to the search question, 17 neutral and 7 negative.
   Discussion: The majority of studies concluded that QoL after cardiac arrest is good. This review demonstrated a remarkable heterogeneity of methodology amongst studies assessing QoL in cardiac arrest survivors. There is a requirement for consensus development with regard to quality of life and patient centred outcome assessment in this population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Functional outcomes and quality of life of young adults who survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background Evaluating the quality of life of young adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is important as they are likely to have a longer life expectancy than older patients. The aim of this study was to assess their functional and quality of life outcomes.
   Methodology The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry records were used to identify survivors of OHCA that occurred between 2003 and 2008 in the 18-39 year-old age group. Survivors were administered a telephone questionnaire using Short Form (SF-12), EQ-5D and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ascertained at hospital discharge from the medical record was recorded for the uncontactable survivors.
   Results Of the 106 young adult survivors, five died in the intervening years and 45 were not contactable or refused. CPC scores were obtained for 37 (74%) of those who did not take part in telephone follow-up, and 7 (19%) of these had a CPC >= 3 indicating severe cerebral disability. The median follow-up time was 5 years (range 2.7- 8.6 years) for the 56 (53%) patients included. Of these, 84% were living at home independently, 68% had returned to work, and only 11% reported marked or severe disability. The majority of patients had no problems with mobility (75%), personal care (75%), usual activities (66%) or pain/discomfort (71%). However, 61% of respondents reported either moderate (48%) or severe (13%) anxiety.
   Conclusions The majority of survivors have good functional and quality of life outcomes. Telephone follow-up is feasible in the young adult survivors of cardiac arrest; loss to follow-up is common.

TI  - Sex differences in the quality-of-life and functional outcome of cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Although survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improving, little is known about the long-term outcome of survivors. In this study, we assess the impact of sex on 12 month functional recovery and health-related quality-of-life (HROoL) outcomes in OHCA survivors.
   Methods: Between 2010 and 2016, consecutive adult OHCA survivors were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and 12-Item Short Form (SF-12) health survey.
   Results: Of the 2300 patients discharged alive, 175 (7.6%) died during the follow-up period with the rate of death at 12 months being higher in women compared to men (10.4% vs. 6.4%; p = 0.002). Of the 2125 12 month survivors, 1752 (82.5%) participated in the interviews. Unadjusted outcomes were consistently poorer for females compared to males, with fewer women reporting good functional recovery (GOSE >= 7, 53.5% vs. 64.8%, p < 0.001) and living at home without care (60.7% vs. 76.4%, p < 0.001). After adjustment, female sex reduced the odds of good functional recovery (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88; p = 0.004), living at home without care (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.76; p < 0.001), an EQ-5D index score of 1 (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.75; p < 0.001), an SF-12 mental component summary >= 50 (AOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.78; p = 0.001) and an SF-12 physical component summary >= 50 (AOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Women report poorer functional recovery and HROoL after OHCA. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for these disparities.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after successful early defibrillation
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation is high. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have improved the rate of survival to hospital discharge. We conducted a population-based analysis of the long-term outcome and quality of life of survivors.
   METHODS: All patients who had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between November 1990 and January 2001 who received early defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, Minnesota, were included. The survival rate was compared with that of an age-, sex-, and disease-matched (2:1) control population of residents who had not had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and with that of age- and sex-matched controls from the general U.S. population. The quality of life was assessed with use of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and compared with U.S. population norms.
   RESULTS: Of 200 patients who presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation, 145 (72 percent) survived to hospital admission (7 died in the emergency department) and 79 (40 percent) were neurologically intact (good overall capability or moderate overall disability) at discharge. The mean (+/-SD) length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 years. Nineteen patients died after discharge from the hospital. The expected five-year survival rate (79 percent) was identical to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched controls (P=0.68) but lower than that among the age- and sex-matched U.S. population (86 percent, P=0.02). Fifty patients completed SF-36 surveys at the end of follow-up, and the majority had a nearly normal quality of life, with the exception of reduced vitality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival among patients who have undergone rapid defibrillation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is similar to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched patients who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The quality of life among the majority of survivors is similar to that of the general population.

TI  - Quality of Life and Functional Outcomes 12 Months After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant global health problem. There has been considerable investment in improving the emergency medical response to OHCA, with associated improvements in survival. However, concern remains that survivors have a poor quality of life. This study describes the quality of life of OHCA survivors at 1-year postarrest in Victoria, Australia.
   Methods and Results-Adult OHCA patients who arrested between 2010 and 2012 were identified from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry. Paramedics attended 15 113 OHCA patients of which 46.3% received an attempted resuscitation. Nine hundred and twenty-seven (13.2%) survived to hospital discharge of which 76 (8.2%) died within 12 months. Interviews were conducted with 697 (80.7%) patients or proxies, who were followed-up via telephone interview, including the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, the 12-item short form health survey, and the EuroQol. The majority (55.6%) of respondents had a good recovery via the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended >= 7 (41.1% if patients who died postdischarge were included and nonrespondents were assumed to have poor recovery). The mean EuroQol index score for respondents was 0.82 (standard deviation, 0.19), which compared favorably with an adjusted population norm of 0.81 (standard deviation, 0.34). The mean 12-item short form Mental Component Summary score for patients was 53.0 (standard deviation, 10.2), whereas the mean Physical Component Summary score was 46.1 (standard deviation, 11.2).
   Conclusions-This is the largest published study assessing the quality of life of OHCA survivors. It provides good evidence that many survivors have an acceptable quality of life 12 months postarrest, particularly in comparison with population norms.

TI  - Health-related quality of life one year after refractory cardiac arrest treated with conventional or extracorporeal CPR; a secondary analysis of the INCEPTION-trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Prospective, trial-based data comparing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) through extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) or conventional CPR (CCPR) are scarce. We aimed to determine HRQoL during 1-year after refractory OHCA in patients treated with ECPR and CCPR. Methods: We present a secondary analysis of the multicenter INCEPTION-trial, which studied the effectiveness of ECPR versus CCPR in patients with refractory OHCA. HRQoL was prospectively assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Poor HRQoL was pragmatically defined as an EQ-5D-5L health utility index (HUI) > 1 SD below the age-adjusted norm. We used mixed linear models to assess the difference in HRQoL over time and univariable analyses to assess factors potentially associated with poor HRQoL. Results: A total of 134 patients were enrolled, and hospital survival was 20% (27 patients). EQ-5D-5L data were available for 25 patients (5 ECPR and 20 CCPR). One year after OHCA, the estimated mean HUI was 0.73 (0.05) in all patients, 0.84 (0.12) in ECPR survivors, and 0.71 (0.05) in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.31). Eight (32%) survivors had a poor HRQoL. HRQoL was good in 17 (68%) patients, with 100% in ECPR survivors versus 60% in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.14). Conclusion: One year after refractory OHCA, 68% of the survivors had a good HRQoL. We found no statistically significant difference in HRQoL one year after OHCA in patients treated with ECPR compared to CCPR. However, numerical differences may be clinically relevant in favor of ECPR.

TI  - The impact of therapeutic hypothermia on neurological function and quality of life after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To assess the impact of therapeutic hypothermia on cognitive function and quality of life in comatose survivors of out of Hospital Cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Methods: We prospectively studied comatose survivors of OHCA consecutively admitted in a 4-year period. Therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in the last 2-year period, intervention period (n = 79), and this group was compared to patients admitted the 2 previous years, control period (n = 77). We assessed Cerebral Performance Category (CPC), Survival, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and self-rated quality of life (SF-36) 6 months after OHCA in the Subgroup with VF/VT as initial rhythm.
   Results: CPC in patients alive at hospital discharge was significantly better in the intervention period with a CPC of 1- 2 in 97% vs. 71% in the control period, p = 0.003, corresponding to an adjusted odds ratio of a favourable cerebral outcome of 17, p = 0.01. No significant differences were found in long-term Survival (57% vs. 56% alive at 30 months), MMSE, or SF-36. Therapeutic hypothermia (hazard ratio: 0.15, p = 0.007) and bystander CPR (hazard ratio 0.19, p = 0.002) were significantly related to Survival in the intervention period.
   Conclusion: CPC at discharge from hospital was significantly improved following implementation of therapeutic hypothermia in comatose patients resuscitated from OCHA with VF/VT. However, significant improvement in survival, cognitive status or quality of life could not be detected at long term follow-up. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: The neurological and functional outcome and health-related quality of life one year later
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Data on long-term functional outcome and quality of life (QoL) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are limited. We assessed long-term functional outcome and health-related QoL of OHCA survivors regardless of arrest aetiology.
   Methods: All adult unconscious OHCA patients treated in 21 Finnish ICUs between March 2010 and February 2011 were followed. Barthel Index (BI), activities of daily living (ADL), accommodation, help needed and received, working status, car driving and self-experienced cognitive deficits were assessed in 1-year survivors (N = 206, 40.9% of the original FINNRESUSCI cohort) with a structured telephone interview. Health-related QoL and more complex ADL-functions were evaluated by EQ-5D and instrumental ADL questionnaires.
   Results: Good outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 1 or 2, had been reached by 90.3% of survivors. The median BI score was 100, and 91.3% of survivors were independent in basic ADL-functions. The great majority of survivors were living at home, only 8.7% lived in a sheltered home or needed institutionalized care. Of home-living survivors 71.4% scored high in instrumental ADL assessment. The majority (72.6%) of survivors who were working previously had returned to work. Health-related QoL was similar as in age-and gender-adjusted Finnish population.
   Conclusions: Long-term functional outcome was good in over 90% of patients surviving OHCA, with health-related quality of life similar to that of an age and gender matched population.

TI  - Long-Term Follow-Up on Health-Related Quality of Life After Mechanical Circulatory Support in Children
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of mechanical circulatory support after acute cardiopulmonary failure.
   Design: Prospective follow-up study.
   Setting: Single-institutional in a center for congenital heart disease and pediatric cardiology.
   Patients: Fifty patients who underwent 58 mechanical circulatory support therapies in our institution from 2001 to 2012. Median age was 2 (0-213) months, and median supporting time was 5 (1-234) days. Indication groups: 1) extracorporeal life support in low cardiac output: 30 cases (52%); 2) extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 13 cases (22%); 3) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome: four cases (7%); and 4) ventricular assist devices: 11 cases (19%).
   Interventions: Health-related quality of life was measured using standardized questionnaires according to the age group and completed by either parent proxies in children under 7 years old or the survivors themselves.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fifty percentage of the patients were discharged home, and 22 long-term survivors (44%) were studied prospectively for health-related quality of life. Median follow-up period was 4.5 (0.3-11.3) years. Median age at follow-up was 5 (0.6-29) years old. Nineteen long-term survivors filled in the health-related quality of life questionnaires and were classified into three age groups: 0-4 years (n = 7): median health-related quality of life score, 69 (59-86) points; 4-12 years (n = 7): median health-related quality of life score, 50 (48-85) points; older than 12 years (n = 5): median health-related quality of life score, 90 (80-100) points.
   Conclusion: Long-term survivors' health-related quality of life as reported by their parents is lower than that of healthy children. However, the self-assessed health-related quality of life of the patients older than 12 years in our group is comparable to a healthy control population.

TI  - Post-intensive care syndrome and health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective cohort study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Patients discharged from intensive care are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which consists of physical, psychological, and/or neurological impairments. This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93). More than one-third of cardiac arrest survivors experience symptoms of PICS 2 years after resuscitation, with the highest impairment observed in the physical and psychological domains. However, long-term survivors of cardiac arrest report intact health-related quality of life when compared to the general population. Future research should focus on appropriate prevention, screening, and treatment strategies for PICS in cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Association between therapeutic hypothermia and long-term quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has increasingly become a part of the current standard of care for treating patients with cardiac arrest (CA). However, little is known regarding the association between TH and long-term quality of life (QoL) in adult survivors of CA. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the association between TH implementation and long-term QoL outcomes in adult survivors of CA following hospital discharge.
   Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and Cochrane databases to identify randomized and observational studies from January 2005 to January 2016 investigating the relationship between TH implementation immediately post-CA and long-term QoL in CA survivors post-hospital discharge.
   Results: We included 9 studies with a total of 801 patients. Six of these were prospective cohort studies, 2 were substudies of randomized controlled trials, and 1 was a retrospective cohort study. Six studies included patients only with out-of-hospital CA while 3 included patients with both in-hospital and out-of-hospital CA. There was marked between-study heterogeneity with respect to study population, TH implementation, and QoL assessment tool. TH was not associated with long-term QoL in this population.
   Conclusions: In this systematic review, the included studies do not suggest any association between TH implementation in CA with long-term QoL in CA survivors. Further larger scale studies are needed to investigate the sustainability of TH effects long term in this patient population. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Predictors of long-term functional outcome and health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Even if a large majority of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors appear to have a good neurological recovery with no important sequellae, whether health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is altered is less explored.
   Patients and methods: HRQOL was evaluated by telephone interview using SF-36 questionnaire. Each OHCA case was age and gender-matched with 4 controls from the French general population. Association between current condition of the survivors with the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire was investigated using MANCOVA. Cluster analysis was performed to identify patterns of HRQOL among CPC1 survivors.
   Results: 255 patients discharged alive from our referral centre between 2000 and 2013 (median age of 55y [45,64], 73.7% males) were interviewed. Global physical and mental components did not differ between CPC 1 survivors and controls (47.0 vs. 47.1, p = 0.88 and 46.4 vs. 46.9, p = 0.45) but substantially differed between CPC2, CPC3 and the corresponding controls. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy at telephone interview were significantly associated with better scores in each SF-36 dimensions. Cluster analysis individualized 4 distinct subgroups of CPC1 patients characterised by progressively increased score of SF-36. Return to work and daily-life autonomy were differently distributed across these 4 groups while pre-hospital Utstein variables were not.
   Conclusion: HRQOL of CPC1 OHCA survivors appeared similar to that of the general population, but patients with CPC2 or 3 had altered HRQOL. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy were independently associated with a better HRQOL. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long term outcomes of participants in the PARAMEDIC2 randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: We recently reported early outcomes in patients enrolled in a randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the PARAMEDIC2 (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial. The purpose of the present paper is to report long-term survival, quality of life, functional and cognitive outcomes at 3, 6 and 12-months.
   Methods: PARAMEDIC2 was a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with an economic evaluation. Patients were randomised to either adrenaline or placebo. This paper reports results on the modified Rankin Scale scores at 6-months, survival at 6 and 12-months, as well as other cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes collected at 3 and 6 months (Two Simple Questions, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline Evaluation for Cardiac Arrest, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, Short-Form 12-item Health Survey and the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L).
   Results: 8014 patients were randomised with confirmed trial drug administration. At 6-months, 78 (2.0%) of the patients in the adrenaline group and 58 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo group had a favourable neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.97]). 117 (2.9%) patients were alive at 6-months in the adrenaline group compared with 86 (2.2%) in the placebo group (1.43 [1.05, 1.96], reducing to 107 (2.7%) and 80 (2.0%) respectively at 12-months (1.38 [1.00, 1.92]). Measures of 3 and 6-month cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes were reduced, but there was no strong evidence of differences between groups.
   Conclusion: Adrenaline improved survival through to 12-months follow-up. The study did not find evidence of improvements in favourable neurological outcomes.
