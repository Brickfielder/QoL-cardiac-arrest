TI  - Psychosocial symptoms of ventricular arrhythmias: Integrating patient-reported outcomes into clinical care
T2  - HEART RHYTHM O2
AB  - Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are a valuable metric for assessing the quality of life and overall well-being in patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The incorporation of PROMs into the workflow of a VA clinic not only allows for more patientcentered care but also may improve detection and treatment of clinically relevant anxiety or depression symptoms. Awareness of the factors known to correlate with adverse PROM scores may guide PROM administration and subsequent referral to mental health services. Further, change or stability in PROM scores can be used as a gauge to guide the effectiveness of cardiac and psychological treatment in certain populations that are the focus of this manuscript: patients with ICDs (with and without shocks), cardiac arrest survivors, and those with inherited arrhythmia syndromes.

TI  - Sex Differences in Patient-Reported Outcomes in the Immediate Recovery Period After Resuscitation: Findings From the Cross-sectional DenHeart Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - BackgroundA paucity of resuscitation studies have examined sex differences in patient-reported outcomes upon hospital discharge. It remains unclear whether male and female patients differ in health outcomes in their immediate responses to trauma and treatment after resuscitation.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to examine sex differences in patient-reported outcomes in the immediate recovery period after resuscitation.MethodsIn a national cross-sectional survey, patient-reported outcomes were measured by 5 instruments: symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire [B-IPQ]), symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ESAS]), quality of life (Heart Quality of Life Questionnaire), and perceived health status (12-Item Short Form Survey).ResultsOf 491 eligible survivors of cardiac arrest, 176 (80% male) participated. Compared with male, resuscitated female reported worse symptoms of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety score >= 8) (43% vs 23%; P = .04), emotional responses (B-IPQ) (mean [SD], 4.9 [3.12] vs 3.7 [2.99]; P = .05), identity (B-IPQ) (mean [SD], 4.3 [3.10] vs 4.0 [2.85]; P = .04), fatigue (ESAS) (mean [SD], 5.26 [2.48] vs 3.92 [2.93]; P = .01), and depressive symptoms (ESAS) (mean [SD], 2.60 [2.68] vs 1.67 [2.19]; P = .05).ConclusionsBetween sexes, female survivors of cardiac arrest reported worse psychological distress and illness perception and higher symptom burden in the immediate recovery period after resuscitation. Attention should focus on early symptom screening at hospital discharge to identify those in need of targeted psychological support and rehabilitation.

TI  - Preliminary Exploration of Long-Term Patient Outcomes After Tracheostomy in Burns: A Burn Model System Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Upper airway management is crucial to burn care. Endotracheal intubation is often performed in the setting of inhalation injury, burns of the face and neck, or large burns requiring significant resuscitation. Tracheostomy may be necessary in patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support. This study compares long-term, patient-reported outcomes in burn patients with and without tracheostomy.Materials and methods: Data from the Burn Model System Database, collected from 2013 to 2020, were analyzed. Demographic and clinical data were compared between those with and without tracheostomy. The following patient-reported outcomes, collected at 6-, 12-, and 24-mo follow-up, were analyzed: Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure, employment status, and days to return to work. Regression models and propensitymatched analyses were used to assess the associations between tracheostomy and each outcome.Results: Of 714 patients included in this study, 5.5% received a tracheostomy. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated that only VR-12 Physical Component Summary scores at 24-mo follow-up were significantly worse among those requiring tracheostomy. Tracheostomy was not associated with VR-12 Mental Component Summary, Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, or Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure scores. Likewise, tracheostomy was not found to be independently associated with employment status or days to return to work.Conclusions: This preliminary exploration suggests that physical and psychosocial recovery, as well as the ability to regain employment, are no worse in burn patients requiring tracheostomy. Future investigations of larger scale are still needed to assess center- and provider-level influences, as well as the influences of various hallmarks of injury severity. Nonetheless, this work should better inform goals of care discussions with patients and families regarding the use of tracheostomy in burn injury.Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Severe Abdominal Trauma: A Secondary Analysis of the Damage Control Laparotomy Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
CP  - 17th Annual Meeting Academic Surgical Congress
AB  - Introduction: Little is known about patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following abdominal trauma. We hypothesized that patients undergoing definitive laparotomy (DEF) would have better PROs compared to those treated with damage control laparotomy (DCL). Methods: The DCL Trial randomized DEF versus DCL in abdominal trauma. PROs were measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D) questionnaire at discharge and six months postdischarge (1 = perfect health, 0 = death, and <0 = worse than death) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian. Unadjusted Bayesian analysis with a neutral prior was used to assess the posterior probability of achieving minimal clinically important difference. Results: Of 39 randomized patients (21 DEF versus 18 DCL), 8 patients died (7 DEF versus 1 DCL). Of those who survived, 28 completed the EQ-5D at discharge (12 DEF versus 16 DCL) and 25 at 6 mo (12 DEF versus 13 DCL). Most patients were male (79%) with a median age of 30 (interquartile range (IQR) 21-42), suffered blunt injury (56%), and were severely injured (median injury severity score 33, IQR 21 - 42). Median EQ-5D value at discharge was 0.20 (IQR 0.06 - 0.52) DEF versus 0.31 (IQR -0.03 - 0.43) DCL, and at six months 0.51 (IQR 0.30 0.74) DEF versus 0.50 (IQR 0.28 - 0.84) DCL. The posterior probability of minimal clinically important difference DEF versus DCL at discharge and six months was 16% and 23%, respectively.

TI  - Significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among cardiac patients feeling lonely
T2  - HEART
AB  - Objective To explore whether living alone and loneliness 1) are associated with poor patient-reported outcomes at hospital discharge and 2) predict cardiac events and mortality 1 year after hospital discharge in women and men with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure or heart valve disease. Methods A national cross-sectional survey including patients with known cardiac disease at hospital discharge combined with national register data at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Loneliness was evaluated using one self-reported question, and information on cohabitation was available from national registers. Patient-reported outcomes were Short Form-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and HeartQoL. Clinical outcomes were 1-year cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation) and all-cause mortality from national registers. Results A total of 13 443 patients (53%) with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure or heart valve disease completed the survey. Of these, 70% were male, and mean age was 66.1 among women and 64.9 among men. Across cardiac diagnoses, loneliness was associated with significantly poorer patient-reported outcomes in men and women. Loneliness predicted all-cause mortality among women and men (HR 2.92 (95% CI 1.55 to 5.49) and HR 2.14 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.22), respectively). Living alone predicted cardiac events in men only (HR 1.39 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.85)). Conclusions A strong association between loneliness and poor patient-reported outcomes and 1-year mortality was found in both men and women across cardiac diagnoses. The results suggest that loneliness should be a priority for public health initiatives, and should also be included in clinical risk assessment in cardiac patients.

TI  - Is frailty associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest? - A Swedish cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Frailty is associated with poor 30-days survival after in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.Methods: Patients aged >= 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Results: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, respectively, p-value < 0.01).Conclusion: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and poorer general health.

TI  - Assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review of patient-reported outcome measures
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: High quality evidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can measure the long-term impact of CA. The aim of this study was to critically appraise the evidence of psychometric quality and acceptability of measures used in the assessment of HRQoL in cardiac arrest survivors.
   Methods: Systematic literature searches (2004-2017) and named author searches to identify articles pertaining to the measurement of HRQoL. Data on study quality, measurement and practical properties were extracted and assessed against international standards.
   Results: From 356 reviewed abstracts, 69 articles were assessed in full. 25 provided evidence for 10 measures of HRQoL: one condition-specific; three generic profile measures; two generic index; and four utility measures. Although limited, evidence for measurement validity was strongest for the HUI3 and SF-36. However, evidence for reliability, content validity, responsiveness and interpretability and acceptability was generally limited or not available in the CA population for all measures.
   Conclusions: This review has demonstrated that a measure of quality of life specific to OHCA survivors is not available. Limited evidence of validity exists for one utility measure - the HUI3 - and a generic profile - the SF-36. Robust evidence of the quality and acceptability of HRQoL measures in OHCA was limited or not available. Future collaborative research must seek to urgently establish the relevance and acceptability of these measures to OHCA survivors, to establish robust evidence of essential measurement and practical properties over the short and long-term, and to inform future HRQoL assessment in the OHCA population.

TI  - An international collaborative study to co-produce a patient-reported outcome measure of cardiac arrest survivorship and health-related quality of life (CASHQoL): A protocol for developing the long-form measure
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Current measures of health-related quality of life are neither sufficiently sensitive or specific to capture the complex and heterogenous nature of the recovery and survivorship associated with cardiac arrest. To address this critical practice gap, we plan a mixed-methods study to co-produce and evaluate a new cardiac arrest-specific patient/survivor-reported outcome measure (PROM). Methods: International guidelines have informed a two-stage, iterative, and interactive process. Stage one will establish what is important to measure following cardiac arrest. A meta-ethnography of published qualitative research and a qualitative exploration of the experiences of survivors and their key supporters will inform the development of a measurement framework. This will be supple-mented by existing, extensive reviews describing concepts that have previously been measured in this population. Focus groups with survivors, key supporters, and healthcare professionals, followed by further interviews with survivors and key supporters, will inform the iterative refinement of the framework, candidate items, and PROM structure. Stage two will involve a psychometric evaluation following completion by a large cohort of survivors. Measurement theory will inform: the identifica-tion of items that best measure important outcomes; item reduction; and provide robust evidence of measurement and practical properties.Discussion: An international, collaborative approach to PROM development will engage survivors, key supporters, researchers, and health pro-fessionals from study commencement. Successful co-production of the cardiac arrest survivorship and health-related quality of life (CASHQoL) mea-sure will provide a robust, relevant, and internationally applicable measure, suitable for completion by adult survivors, and integration into research, registries, and routine care settings.Ethical approval: University of Warwick Biomedical & Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 22/20-21 granted 10/11/20).

TI  - Risk Factors of Cage Subsidence in Patients Received Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion
T2  - SPINE
AB  - Study Design. A retrospective cohort study.
   Objective. To determine the risk factors of cage subsidence in patients undergoing minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF) and its correlation with patientreported outcomes.
   Summary of Background Data. Cage subsidence is among the cage-related complications after TLIF and may lead to poor outcomes. Few studies have addressed the incidence of cage subsidence in MI-TLIF.
   Methods. This retrospective study of a prospectively collected database was conducted from October 2015 to October 2017. All patients received MI-TLIF with a minimum of 2-year followup. All levels were separated into the cage subsidence (CS group) and no cage subsidence (non-CS group) groups. Cage subsidence was evaluated using lateral radiographs and defined as more than 2mm migration of the cage into the endplate of adjacent vertebral body. Patient demographics, perioperative details, and radiographic parameters were recorded. Cagerelated parameters were cage height, cage insertion level, and cage position. Cage position was recorded using central point ration (CPR). Patient-reported outcome was analyzed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively.
   Results. Ninety-three patients (126 levels) were included. Mean age was 66.5 years with an average follow-up of 36.9 months. Overall incidence of cage subsidence was 34.1%. The CS group had significantly higher body mass index, less bone mineral density (BMD), shorter disc height, and higher CPR than the nonCS group. BMD, disc height, and CPR were significantly negatively correlated with depth of cage subsidence. ODI improvement was significantly lesser in the CS group than in the non-CS group. Fusion rate and complications were unrelated to cage subsidence.
   Conclusion. The BMD, disc height, and cage position were the most significant risk factors that were negatively correlated with depth of cage subsidence. Placing a TLIF cage anteriorly if possible may reduce the risk of cage subsidence.

TI  - How do survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest perceive their health compared to the norm population? A nationwide registry study from Norway
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Self-perceived health status data is usually collected using patient-reported outcome measures. Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out -ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate. Results: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 +/- 0.24 vs 0.82 +/- 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 +/- 21 vs 79 +/- 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension. Conclusions: Norwegian OHCA survivors reported poorer health than the general population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L. PROMs use in this population can be used to inform follow-up and health care delivery.

TI  - German Cardiac Arrest Registry: rationale and design of G-CAR
T2  - CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background In Germany, 70,000-100,000 persons per year suffer from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite medical progress, survival rates with good neurological outcome remain low. For many important clinical issues, no or only insufficient evidence from randomised trials is available. Therefore, a systemic and standardised acquisition of the treatment course and of the outcome of OHCA patients is warranted.
   Study design The German Cardiac Arrest Registry (G-CAR) is an observational, prospective, multicentre registry. It will determine the characteristics, initial treatment strategies, invasive procedures, revascularisation therapies and the use of mechanical circulatory support devices with a focus on extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A special feature is the prospective 12-month follow-up evaluating mortality, neurological outcomes and several patient-reported outcomes in the psychosocial domain (health-related quality of life, cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and social reintegration). In a pilot phase of 24 months, 15 centres will include approximately 400 consecutive OHCA patients >= 18 years. Parallel to and after the pilot phase, scaling up of G-CAR to a national level is envisaged.
   Conclusion G-CAR is the first national registry including a long-term follow-up for adult OHCA patients. Primary aim is a better understanding of the determinants of acute and long-term outcomes with the perspective of an optimised treatment.

TI  - An international, consensus-derived Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest effectiveness trials: the COSCA initiative
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Accurate and relevant assessment is essential to determining the impact of ill-health and the relative benefit of healthcare. This review details the recent development of a core outcome set for cardiac arrest effectiveness trials - the COSCA initiative.
   Recent findings
   The reported heterogeneity in outcome assessment and a lack of outcome reporting guidance were key triggers for the development of the COSCA. The historical failure of existing research to adequately capture the perspective of survivors and their family members in defining survival is described. Working collaboratively with international stakeholders - including survivors, family members and advocates - as research partners and participants ensured that a range of perspectives were considered throughout all stages of COSCA development. Three core domains and methods of assessment were recommended: survival - at 30 days or hospital discharge; neurological function assessed at 30 days or hospital discharge with the modified Rankin Scale; and health-related quality of life assessed at 90 days (as a minimum) with one of three generic measures.
   Summary
   The COSCA recommendation describes a small group of outcomes that should be reported as a minimum across large, randomized clinical effectiveness trials for cardiac arrest.

TI  - Paediatric Resuscitation Outcome in Children with Heart Disease (ProCHD): protocol of a Germany-wide multicentre, prospective open registry
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction While paediatric cardiac arrest is a rare event, consequences for the patients are significant with a considerable risk of morbidity, disability and mortality. The risk of cardiac arrest is substantially increased in children with congenital heart disease. Nevertheless, there is a lack of data concerning this population. To close this knowledge gap, this multicentre, prospective, open registry aims to implement a standardised structure for data collection and follow-up of paediatric cardiac arrests associated with heart diseases in Germany. Methods and analysis All paediatric patients who experience a cardiac arrest and receive at least 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are invited to participate in this registry. The dataset comprises demographical, clinical, resuscitation and outcome data, collected in accordance with the Utstein guidelines. Neurological assessments, cognitive and motor tests are conducted at fixed intervals. Additionally, patient-reported outcome measures will be surveyed. Primary outcomes are survival to discharge and neurodevelopmental outcome after discharge and 2 years. The data are pseudonymised prior to submission to an online REDCap database, which is centrally hosted on a server located in Leipzig, Germany. Ethics and dissemination This study follows the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee in Leipzig. Registry results will allow us to understand the epidemiology, guideline adherence, risk factors and will be presented at conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

TI  - The Danish-Norwegian randomized trial on beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: Design, rationale, and baseline characteristics
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Background and aims The evidence for beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction (MI) is randomized trials conducted more than 30 years ago, and the continued efficacy has been questioned.Design and methods The ongoing Danish (DANBLOCK) and Norwegian (BETAMI) randomized beta-blocker trials are joined to evaluate the effectiveness and risks of long-term beta-blocker therapy after MI. Patients with normal or mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF >= 40%) will be randomized to open-label treatment with beta-blockers or no such therapy. The event-driven trial will randomize similar to 5700 patients and continue until 950 primary endpoints have occurred. As of July 2023, 5228 patients have been randomized. Of the first 4000 patients randomized, median age was 62 years, 79% were men, 48% had a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and 84% had a normal LVEF. The primary endpoint is a composite of adjudicated recurrent MI, incident heart failure (HF), coronary revascularization, ischaemic stroke, all-cause mortality, malignant ventricular arrhythmia, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The primary safety endpoint includes a composite of recurrent MI, HF, all-cause mortality, malignant ventricular arrhythmia, or resuscitated cardiac arrest 30 days after randomization. Secondary endpoints include each of the components of the primary endpoint, patient-reported outcomes, and other clinical outcomes linked to beta-blocker therapy. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. End of follow-up is expected in December 2024.Conclusion The combined BETAMI-DANBLOCK trial will have the potential to affect current clinical practice for beta-blocker therapy in patients with normal or mildly reduced LVEF after MI.

TI  - Determinants of health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: With a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors globally, the focus of OHCA management has now broadened to survivorship. An outcome central to survivorship is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to the determinants of HRQoL of OHCA survivors.Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 15 August 2022 to identify studies investigating the asso-ciation of at least one determinant and HRQoL in adult OHCA survivors. All articles were independently reviewed by two investigators. We abstracted data pertaining to determinants and classified them using a well-established HRQoL theoretical framework - the Wilson and Cleary (re-vised) model.Results: 31 articles assessing a total of 35 determinants were included. Determinants were classified into the five domains in the HRQoL model. 26 studies assessed determinants related to individual characteristics (n = 3), 12 studied biological function (n = 7), nine studied symptoms (n = 3), 16 studied functioning (n = 5), and 35 studied characteristics of the environment (n = 17). In studies that included multivariable analyses, most reported that individual characteristics (older age, female sex), symptoms (anxiety, depression), and functioning (impaired neurocognitive function) were sig-nificantly associated with poorer HRQoL.Conclusions: Individual characteristics, symptoms, and functioning played significant roles in explaining the variability in HRQoL. Significant non-modifiable determinants such as age and sex could be used to identify populations at risk of poorer HRQoL, while significant modifiable determinants such as psychological health and neurocognitive functioning could serve as targets for post-discharge screening and rehabilitation plans.

TI  - Health-Related Quality of Life in Traumatic Brain Injury: Is a Proxy Report Necessary?
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB  - Despite its importance to care, clinicians and researchers often discount patient-reported outcomes in favor of proxy reports, in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The rationale relates to concerns about lack of awareness of patients regarding their functioning. However, although lack of awareness occurs in some patients with severe TBI, or in TBI involving certain lesion locations, or very soon after injury, this conclusion has been overgeneralized. The objective of this study is to determine the validity of patient-reported health-related quality of life by evaluating its relationship to injury severity and more objective indices of outcome, in a representative series of adults with TBI. A consecutive sample of 374 persons with TBI at least 14 years old, and having a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score 12, an acute seizure, or a CT scan showing TBI- related findings. Seventy-six percent (374/491) of the eligible survivors were assessed at 6 months post-injury on the Life Satisfaction Survey. The greatest decrease in satisfaction was in the ability to think and remember, work, receive adequate income, and participate in leisure and recreational activities. Dissatisfaction significantly related to the functional limitation in that area as judged by the patients themselves (p<0.001) or by someone who knew them well (p0.001). The most severely injured group reported the most dissatisfaction for 13 out of 17 areas assessed. Patients with TBI, in general, do not need a proxy to report on their behalf regarding their functional limitations or health-related quality of life.

TI  - International Consensus on Evidence Gaps and Research Opportunities in Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Report From the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Workshop
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - The increased accessibility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following the COVID-19 pandemic and the publication of the first randomized trial of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) prompted the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to sponsor a workshop on ECPR. Two more randomized trials have since been published in 2022 and 2023. Based on the combined findings and review of the evidence, an international panel of authors identified gaps in science, inequities in care and diversity in outcomes, and suggested research opportunities and next steps. The science pertaining to ECPR would benefit from the United States contributing uniform data to existing registries and sharing common data with the ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) international registry to increase the sample size for observational research. In addition, well-designed efficacy trials, recruiting across different regions of care evaluating long-term follow-up, including patient reported outcomes, cost effectiveness, and equity measures, would contribute significantly to the body of science. Workshop participants defined the population of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest most likely to benefit from ECPR. ECPR-eligible patients include those aged 18 to 75 years functioning independently without comorbidity; before suffering a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without any obvious cause of the cardiac arrest; presenting in a shockable rhythm and transported with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation to an ECPR-capable institute within 30 minutes, which is recommended after 3 rounds of advanced life support treatment without return of spontaneous circulation. There are significant inequities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care that need to be addressed such that outcomes are optimized for each target region before implementing ECPR in a clinical or implementation trial.

TI  - COSCA (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Adults: An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomised clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritised through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterised relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with >= 1 tools from Health Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources allow.

TI  - Low physical activity level in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with obesity, mobility problems and cognitive impairment: Results from the TTM2 trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To describe the level of physical activity 6 months after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and to explore potential risk factors of a low level of physical activity. Methods: Post-hoc analyses of the international multicentre Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial. At 6 months, survivors at 61 sites in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland were invited to a follow-up. The participants answered two questions on self-reported physical activity. Answers were categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of physical activity and further dichotomized into a low versus moderate/high level of physical activity. Potential risk factors for a low level of physical activity were collected and investigated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results: At 6 months, 807 of 939 (86%) OHCA survivors answered the two questions of physical activity; 34% reported a low, 44% moderate and 22% high level of physical activity. Obesity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.77, p = 0.018), mobility problems by EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.06-2.84, p = 0.029), and cognitive impairment by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.82, p = 0.013) were significantly associated with a low level of physical activity in the multivariable analysis. Conclusion: One third of the OHCA survivors reported a low level of physical activity. Obesity, mobility problems, and cognitive impairment were associated with a low level of physical activity.

TI  - Web-Based Distress Management for Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Sudden cardiac arrest caused by cardiac arrhythmias is 1 of the leading causes of death worldwide. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are considered as standard care for patients with increased risk of arrhythmias. However, 1 in 4 ICD patients experiences psychological distress post-ICD implantation. The WEB-based distress management program for ICD patients (WEBCARE) was developed to mitigate anxiety and depression and enhance health-related quality of life in ICD patients. This study investigates the 6-and 12-months outcomes. Method: A total of 289 consecutive ICD patients from 6 referral hospitals in the Netherlands were randomized to either the WEBCARE (n = 146) or usual care (n = 143) group. Patients in the WEBCARE group received an online, 12-weeks fixed, 6 lesson behavioral treatment based on problem solving therapy. Patients in the usual care group receive care as usual. Results: Current findings show no significant difference on anxiety, depression or quality of life between the WEBCARE and Usual Care group at 6-and 12-months postimplantation. Conclusions: In this clinical trial of a Web-based behavioral intervention for ICD patients, the Web-based treatment was not superior to usual care on the long-term regarding patient reported outcomes. Future studies are warranted to examine the applicability of blended-care models and focus on further personalizing the program in order to increase adherence and improve outcomes.

TI  - Brain-related outcome measures in trials recruiting critically-ill children
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose of review
   Randomized controlled trials leading to innovations that improve outcomes in acute life-threatening illnesses in children are scarce. A key issue is how we refocus research on outcomes that matter and are more relevant to those making emergency decisions, and those involved with managing and living with the late-outcome. We have used information from recent trials in critically ill children - in particular those illnesses without any primary neurologic involvement - to develop an approach to brain-related outcomes that will maximize child and family benefit from research.
   Recent findings
   Fifteen recent pediatric critical care trials illustrate four types of brain-related outcomes assessment: death or organ-system-failures - as illustrated by studies in systemic illness; neurological and neuropsychological outcomes - as illustrated by the glycemic control studies; cognitive outcomes - as illustrated by a sedative trial; and composite outcomes - as illustrated by the therapeutic hypothermia studies.
   Summary
   The 15 research trials point to five areas that will need to be addressed and incorporated into future trial design, including use of: neurologic monitoring during intensive care unit admission; postdischarge outcomes assessments; strategies to improve retention in long-term follow-up; child and family-centered outcomes; and core outcomes datasets.

TI  - In-depth assessment of health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Evidence on physical and psychological well-being of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors is scarce. The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Methods: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Results: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5). Discussion: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Psychometric evaluation of EQ-5D-5L in OHCA survivors from the TTM2 trial: a post hoc analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aims: Our aim was to investigate the psychometric properties of the health assessment instrument EQ-5D-5L in OHCA survivors. Methods: We included survivors from the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial, who completed EQ-5D-5L at 6 months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the hypothesised unidimensional latent structure of EQ level sum score (EQ LSS), summarizing scores across Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/depression. Differential item functioning was evaluated for age. We examined internal consistency and precision for the EQ LSS. We evaluated construct validity of EQ LSS, EQ value and EQ VAS, using the modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, representing functional outcome and cognitive function-two common health challenges experienced by OHCA survivors. Results: 783 of 939 (84%) eligible survivors were included. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit and strong factor loadings for all dimensions (0.61-0.90). We observed a significant but negligible effect of age on Mobility (b = 0.29, p < 0.001, Delta R-2 = 0.019). Internal consistency was 0.88. The floor effect was 35%. Survivors with more functional dependency and/or cognitive problems reported significantly worse health by EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS (all, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The psychometric properties of EQ LSS support its use to measure health status in OHCA research. The strong association between health and functional dependency indicate robust and comparable construct validity for EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS in this sample.

T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) has a significant impact on patients' health-relatedquality of life (HRQoL). Endometriosis is a common cause of CPR Data is lacking on long-term HRQoL outcomes in patients with endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain (EACPP) versus other causes of chronic pelvic pain (OCPP). Methods: In this retrospective single-survey study, 198 patients completed the EHP-30 and the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) Global Health validated questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 8-10 years after index surgery. Results: Demographic comparison revealed significant differences in racial demographics and disability status between the EACPP and OCPP groups. There was no significant difference in EHP-30, PROMIS Global Physical, or Global Mental scores between the two groups. Patients with lower stage endometriosis (stage I/II) reported diminished HRQoL in the EHP-30 and Global Physical scores as compared to patients with higher stage (stage III/IV) endometriosis or OCR Additionally, no differences were found between incidence of abuse history and EHP-30 and PROM IS scores between the two groups. Higher age and higher PROMIS Global Physical scores were associated with lower pain and higher HRQoL scores on the EHP-30. Persistently high rates of sexual dysfunction were seen across both groups. Discussion: This study demonstrates that women with EACPP and OCPP appear to have similar natural histories and quality of life on long term follow-up. Race, age, disability, and physical health status may play key roles in perceived quality of life. The high rate of persistent sexual dysfunction is concerning and requires increased clinician intervention.

TI  - Quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a TOMAHAWK sub-study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims The TOMAHAWK trial compared immediate coronary angiography with a delayed/selective strategy in 554 resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevations. Mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. In addition to survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key outcome parameter for OHCA patients.Methods and results The analysis included 169 survivors from the TOMAHAWK trial who completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up (6M-FU/12M-FU). HRQoL was assessed using a questionnaire based on the EuroQoL-5D-3L. This tool includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best imaginable subjective health) and a descriptive system with five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No relevant differences were found between patients in the immediate angiography group and those in the delayed/selective angiography group regarding EQ-VAS scores at 6M-FU (70 +/- 21 vs. 74 +/- 18) and 12M-FU (72 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 17). Patients reported the most problems with usual activities (33% and 38%, respectively), and the fewest limitations in self-care (18% and 17%, respectively) at 6M-FU. Women reported more problems than men in all five dimensions. Elderly patients (>= 65 years) were more likely than younger OHCA survivors to indicate limitations in mobility, self-care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort.Conclusion OHCA survivors of the TOMAHAWK trial rated their HRQoL 6 and 12 months after the event as relatively good, but there were notable differences between women and men and between younger and elderly patients. The angiography strategy did not affect HRQoL.Trial registration www.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02750462.

TI  - CARDIS (Cardiac ARrest DIgital Support): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a web-based support intervention for cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Surviving sudden cardiac arrest often lead to long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. Although clinical guidelines recommend structured post-cardiac arrest follow-up, such follow-up is often lacking or inconsistent. Tailored digital interventions are scarce but may help address gaps in follow-up resources. The CARDIS trial evaluates the effects on patient-reported outcome measures of a co-created, web-based support programme designed to improve wellbeing, self management, and reintegration into everyday life for cardiac arrest survivors. Methods: CARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling cardiac arrest survivors aged >18 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard post-cardiac arrest care, including a routine followup visit with screening and management of cognitive, physical and emotional health, as well as a printed booklet. The intervention group will additionally receive access to a webbased selfguided support programme for 3 months. After study completion, control participants will be offered the programme. Outcomes: Primary outcome is overall wellbeing and health (QWB) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported cognitive problems, HRQoL, life satisfaction, symptoms of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. A process evaluation will evaluate social selection bias, adherence and participants experiences. Discussion: The CARDIS trial will investigate the use of more accessible and standardised follow-up pathways by complementing existing care structures, thereby enhancing equity in long-term recovery and quality-of-life without requiring additional healthcare resources. The process evaluation will provide data on adherence, social selection, and engagement, essential for future implementation. Trial registration: The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07240714).

TI  - Self-reported limitations in physical function are common 6 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors generally report good health-related quality of life, but physical aspects of health seem more affected than other domains. Limitations in physical function after surviving OHCA have received little attention.
   Aims: To describe physical function 6 months after OHCA and compare it with a group of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) controls, matched for country, age, sex and time of the cardiac event. A second aim was to explore variables potentially associated with self-reported limitations in physical function in OHCA survivors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional sub-study of the Targeted Temperature Management at 33 degrees C versus 36 degrees C (TTM) trial with a follow-up 6 months post-event. Physical function was the main outcome assessed with the self-reported Physical Functioning-10 items scale (PF-10). PF-10 is presented as T-scores (0-100), where 50 represents the norm mean. Scores <47 at a group level, or <45 at an individual level indicate limitations in physical function.
   Results: 287 OHCA survivors and 119 STEMI controls participated. Self-reported physical function by PF-10 was significantly lower for OHCA survivors compared to STEMI controls (mean 46.0, SD 11.2 vs. 48.8, SD 9.0, p= 0.025). 38% of OHCA survivors compared to 26% of STEMI controls reported limitations in physical function at an individual level (p = 0.022). The most predictive variables for self-reported limitations in physical function in OHCA survivors were older age, female sex, cognitive impairment, and symptoms of anxiety and depression after 6 months.
   Conclusion: Self-reported limitations in physical function are more common in OHCA survivors compared to STEMI controls.

TI  - Role of single-dose intravenous iron therapy for the treatment of anaemia after orthopaedic trauma: protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Orthopaedic trauma and fracture care commonly cause perioperative anaemia and associated functional iron deficiency due to a systemic inflammatory state. Modern, strict transfusion thresholds leave many patients anaemic; managing this perioperative anaemia is an opportunity to impact outcomes in orthopaedic trauma surgery. The primary outcome of this pilot study is feasibility for a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate intravenous iron therapy (IVIT) to improve patient well-being following orthopaedic injury. Measurements will include rate of participant enrolment, screening failure, follow-up, missing data, adverse events and protocol deviation.
   Methods and analysis This single-centre, pilot, double-blind RCT investigates the use of IVIT for acute blood loss anaemia in traumatically injured orthopaedic patients. Patients are randomised to receive either a single dose infusion of low-molecular weight iron dextran (1000mg) or placebo (normal saline) postoperatively during their hospital stay for trauma management. Eligible subjects include adult patients admitted for lower extremity or pelvis operative fracture care with a haemoglobin of 7-11g/dL within 7days postoperatively during inpatient care. Exclusion criteria include history of intolerance to intravenous iron supplementation, active haemorrhage requiring ongoing blood product resuscitation, multiple planned procedures, pre-existing haematologic disorders or chronic inflammatory states, iron overload on screening or vulnerable populations. We follow patients for 3months to measure the effect of iron supplementation on clinical outcomes (resolution of anaemia and functional iron deficiency), patient-reported outcomes (fatigue, physical function, depression and quality of life) and translational measures of immune cell function.
   Ethics and dissemination This study has ethics approval (Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Review Board, STUDY00022441). We will disseminate the findings through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

TI  - Perioperative medicine: The outlook
T2  - ANESTHESIE & REANIMATION
AB  - Perioperative medicine, a natural extension of anesthesiology and critical care, is emerging as a pivotal specialty in response to an aging population, rising comorbidities, and the growth of minimally invasive and outpatient surgery. Its goal is to design individualized care pathways that integrate prehabilitation, post-hospital follow-up, and city-hospital coordination to ensure safe recovery, particularly for high-risk patients. The structuring of these pathways relies on multidisciplinary teams and the creation of dedicated "care pathway team" capable of anticipating patient needs, preparing discharge, and streamlining communication between hospital and community providers. Indicators, long viewed merely as quality control tools, are evolving into levers for anticipation, decision-making, and personalization of care, particularly through the integration of patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs, PREMs). The rise of digital health and artificial intelligence opens major opportunities: early detection of complications, virtual patient modeling, clinical decision support, and connected follow-up. Their success, however, depends on interoperable information systems, high-quality data, and active medical oversight to mitigate bias. Over the next thirty years, anesthesiology, resuscitation, and perioperative medicine will need to combine pharmacological and technological innovation with environmental sustainability - reducing the carbon footprint of clinical practices - while also improving caregivers' quality of life. By positioning itself as both an interface specialty and a driver of innovation, perioperative medicine is set to become a cornerstone of sustainable, patient-centered healthcare.

TI  - The role of in-hospital traumatic distress after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in later fatigue, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Aim: To investigate potential in-hospital cognitive and psychopathological factors associated with fatigue three months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted across three heart centers in Denmark. While in-hospital, OHCA survivors were screened for cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and traumatic distress using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised. At three-month follow-up, fatigue severity was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS >= 4 indicates clinically important fatigue. Logistic regression models were applied. Results: Overall, 173 survivors were included (mean age 63.1 +/- 11.7 years). At follow-up, the median FSS score was 3.2 points (IQR 2-9) and 42 % of survivors presented with clinically important fatigue (FSS >= 4). Those with fatigue were more often female, had longer hospital stays, reported greater in-hospital symptoms of anxiety, depression and traumatic distress, poorer sleep quality and health-related quality of life at follow-up. In the multivariable regression model, including age, sex, length of stay, anxiety, depression, traumatic distress and sleep quality, only traumatic distress was independently associated with FSS >= 4 (OR 4.6, 95 % CI: 1.5-14.7, p = 0.009). Conclusion: More than a third of OHCA survivors self-reported fatigue at three-month follow-up. In-hospital symptoms of traumatic distress were associated with higher odds of fatigue. While these findings underscore the potential value of early identification of traumatic distress, further research is needed to evaluate the benefits of screening and to identify interventions to support recovery after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of the relationship between cognition and recovery outcomes after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Purpose: Cognitive function is often impaired for cardiac arrest (CA) survivors due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Whether cognitive impairment at hospital discharge is associated with recovery defined as functional status and fatigue measured at 1-month post-discharge is not known. Methods: Consecutive CA patients admitted at an academic center (May 14, 2021-June 23, 2023) were assessed for cognitive impairment (modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-m < 33) and depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire) at hospital discharge. Poor functional status (primary outcome; modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3) and fatigue severity (patient-reported outcome; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were assessed 1-month post-discharge. Hierarchical regressions tested associations of cognitive function with outcomes. Results: Of 112 participants (mean age 54.4 +/- 14.8; 38% female; 43% White race, 20% Black race, 29% Hispanic ethnicity) completing discharge TICS-m, 63 (56%) had indicated cognitive impairment, and 68 (61%) had poor 1-month functional outcome. Worse discharge cognitive function was independently associated with a higher risk of poor 1-month functional outcome (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02) after adjusting for age, education, sex, race, ethnicity, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and depressive symptoms. Fatigue severity lacked significant associations with cognitive function, but was associated with depressive symptoms (B = 1.03 [0.00, 2.05], p = 0.04). Conclusion: Cognitive function at discharge after CA was significantly and independently associated with functional outcome 1 month after hospital discharge. Psychological distress contributed to fatigue severity. This highlights the need for screening and addressing cognitive and emotional problems pre-hospital discharge.

TI  - Worldwide experience with a totally subcutaneous implantable defibrillator: early results from the EFFORTLESS S-ICD Registry
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Aims The totally subcutaneous implantable-defibrillator (S-ICD) is a new alternative to the conventional transvenous ICD system to minimize intravascular lead complications. There are limited data describing the long-term performance of the S-ICD. This paper presents the first large international patient population collected as part of the EFFORTLESS S-ICD Registry.
   Methods and results The EFFORTLESS S-ICD Registry is a non-randomized, standard of care, multicentre Registry designed to collect long-term, system-related, clinical, and patient reported outcome data from S-ICD implanted patients since June 2009. Follow-up data are systematically collected over 60-month post-implant including Quality of Life. The study population of 472 patients of which 241 (51%) were enrolled prospectively has a mean follow-up duration of 558 days (range 13-1342 days, median 498 days), 72% male, mean age of 49 +/- 18 years (range 9-88 years), 42% mean left ventricular ejection fraction. Complication-free rates were 97 and 94%, at 30 and 360 days, respectively. Three hundred and seventeen spontaneous episodes were recorded in 85 patients during the follow-up period. Of these episodes, 169 (53%) received therapy, 93 being for Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation (VT/VF). One patient died of recurrent VF and severe bradycardia. Regarding discrete VT/VF episodes, first shock conversion efficacy was 88% with 100% overall successful clinical conversion after a maximum of five shocks. The 360-day inappropriate shock rate was 7% with the vast majority occurring for oversensing (62/73 episodes), primarily of cardiac signals (94% of oversensed episodes).
   Conclusion The first large cohort of real-world data from an International patient S-ICD population demonstrates appropriate system performance with clinical event rates and inappropriate shock rates comparable with those reported for conventional ICDs.

TI  - Return to work and everyday life following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Results from the national survey, DenHeart
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - Background: With increasing survival rates following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), knowledge on return to everyday life, including return to work, should be getting increasing attention.
   Objectives: To i) describe patterns of labor market affiliation up to 12 months after discharge among a work-force population and to, ii) investigate the association between clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health at discharge and a composite endpoint of prolonged sick leave and leaving the workforce after 3 and 12 months.
   Methods: Data from the national survey, DenHeart, were used, including measures of self-reported health: HeartQoL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), combined with register-based follow-up.
   Results: During the study period, n = 572 OHCA patients were discharged from five Heart centres, n = 184 were part of the workforce. At discharge, 60% were on paid sick leave, and 20% at 12 months. Age (per one year older) increased the odds of experiencing the composite endpoint at 3 and 12 months (3 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.10, 12 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.09) among the total population (n = 184). Self -reported health at discharge was not associated with the endpoint.
   Conclusion: One -fifth of the OHCA survivors at a working-age prior to the OHCA was still on paid sick leave after 12 months. Increasing age was the only characteristic associated with a composite endpoint of pro-longed sick leave or leaving the workforce at 3 and 12 months after discharge. With increasing survival rates, healthcare professionals need to support the population in resuming daily life, including returning to the workforce, when relevant. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Health-related quality of life in young Norwegian survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to pre-arrest exercise habits
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in young survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Norway with an age and sex-matched reference population and to assess the associations between exercise volume prior to OHCA and HRQoL after. Methods: We present data from survivors aged 18-50 years registered with OHCA in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017. Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise habits prior to OHCA. Respondents were randomly matched 1:1 for age and sex with a reference population (data were available from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data). Results: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised >5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly (p < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical-and mental health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting >5 hours of exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less. Conclusion: Poorer HRQoL in survivors compared to the reference population should prompt us to explore how treatment and rehabilitation could be improved and adapted. More exercise before OHCA favoured better HRQoL after, which aligns well with the recognised positive association between HRQoL and physical activity in general.

TI  - Long-term functional outcomes and health-related quality of life following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA): A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To evaluate long-term functional outcomes following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro were searched to 14 February 2025. Eligible studies included adults (>= 18 years) who received conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation for IHCA and reported neurological, cognitive, psychological, or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes at >= 3 months post-IHCA. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Meta-analyses of binary outcomes were performed using random-intercept logistic regression. Narrative synthesis was used where pooling of results was not feasible. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251009496). Results: Thirty-nine studies from 21 countries were included (sample size n = 16-1539 patients). Most were moderate to high risk of bias. Across the full cohort, the pooled proportion of poor neurological outcome was 78.9% (95% CI 73.5-83.4%; I-2 = 95.6%). Among survivors, 9.9% (95% CI 5.8-16.3%; I-2 86.4%) had poor neurological outcome, with lower proportions at longer follow-up. Clinically significant anxiety and depression affected 13.1% (95% CI 6.1-26.0%; I-2 = 92.3%) and 8.1% (95% CI 4.6-13.7%; I-2 = 75.7%) of survivors, respectively. HRQoL impairments were frequently reported, particularly in pain/discomfort (60.5% [95% CI 57.9-63.0%; I-2 = 37.6%]), usual activities (52.6% [95% CI 50.0-55.2%; I-2 = 0.0%]), and anxiety/depression (49.0% [95% CI 46.4-51.6%; I-2 = 0.0%]). Cognitive impairments were reported in one study. Substantial statistical heterogeneity (I-2 > 75%) was observed across most analyses. Wide variation in outcome measures, follow-up duration, and reporting methods limited synthesis. Conclusion: While many IHCA survivors achieve favourable long-term outcomes, a significant proportion experience persistent impairments. Greater standardisation in outcome measurement and reporting is needed to improve comparability across studies and guide post-arrest care.

TI  - Long-term safety and efficacy of selumetinib in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 on a phase 1/2 trial for inoperable plexiform neurofibromas
T2  - NEURO-ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background Selumetinib shrank inoperable symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and provided clinical benefit for many in our previously published phase 1/2 clinical trials (SPRINT, NCT01362803). At the data cutoff (DCO) of the prior publications, 65% of participants were still receiving treatment. This report presents up to 5 years of additional safety and efficacy data from these studies. Methods This manuscript includes data from the phase 1 and phase 2, stratum 1 study which included participants with clinically significant PN-related morbidity. Participants received continuous selumetinib dosing (1 cycle = 28 days). Safety and efficacy data through February 27, 2021 are included. PN response assessed by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis: Confirmed partial response (cPR) >= 20% decrease from baseline on 2 consecutive evaluations. Phase 2 participants completed patient-reported outcome measures assessing tumor pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale-11) and interference of pain in daily life (pain interference index). Results For the 74 children (median age 10.3 years; range 3-18.5) enrolled, overall cPR rate was 70% (52/74); median duration of treatment was 57.5 cycles (range 1-100). Responses were generally sustained with 59% (44) lasting >= 12 cycles. Tumor pain intensity (n = 19, P = .015) and pain interference (n = 18, P = .0059) showed durable improvement from baseline to 48 cycles. No new safety signals were identified; however, some developed known selumetinib-related adverse events (AEs) for the first time after several years of treatment. Conclusions With up to 5 years of additional selumetinib treatment, most children with NF1-related PN had durable tumor shrinkage and sustained improvement in pain beyond that previously reported at 1 year. No new safety signals were identified; however, ongoing monitoring for known selumetinib-related AEs is needed while treatment continues.

TI  - Assessing adult attachment after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an exploratory analysis and construct validation of the ECR-RS
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To explore the construct validity of the 'Experience in Close Relationships-Relationship Structures'-questionnaire (ECR-RS) in a population of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Objectives were to (i) describe item-and scale-level response patterns, and (ii) evaluate the preliminary construct validity of the ECR-RS, including its dimensional (structural), known-groups, and convergent validity. Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional validation study, with OHCA survivors completing the ECR-RS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the mental health component from the Short Form-12 (SF-12 MCS) three months post-arrest. Descriptive statistics and floor/ceiling analyses were performed. Dimensional validity was assessed using response distribution patterns and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by reliability using Cronbach's as. Known-group validity was tested using a priori hypotheses, Spearman's correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Convergent validity was evaluated by correlating ECR-RS total scores with HADS and SF-12 MCS. Results: Among 123 survivors (median age 59.9 years, 84 % male), ECR-RS total scores were low on both subscales and floor effects were observed at scale level (31 % for avoidant and 72 % for anxious attachment). EFA supported the expected two-factor structure, though item 4-6 showed poor loadings/cross-loadings. Internal consistency was acceptable (total scale Cronbach's a = 0.88) and improved when problematic items were excluded. Known-group hypotheses were not supported. Anxious attachment correlated moderately with symptoms of anxiety and depression and was inversely correlated with mental health scores. Conclusion: The ECR-RS demonstrated partial construct validity among OHCA survivors, but item-level inconsistencies and pronounced floor effects limit its utility. Findings highlight the need fora revised instrument better suited to post-cardiac arrest relational and psychological dynamics.

TI  - Impact of frailty on mortality, functional outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: insights from the TTM2-trial
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose To explore the association of frailty with mortality, functional outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods This is a cohort-based secondary analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial, an international, prospective, multicentre study. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (1-9): fit (1-3), prefrail (4), frail (5), and severely frail (6-9). Main outcomes were mortality and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 6 and 24 months. Additional outcomes included neuroprognostication, withdrawal-of-life-sustaining-therapies (WLST), functional decline (retrospectively reported pre-arrest versus 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score), health status (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and life satisfaction at 6 and 24 months. Results Of 1861 participants, 240 (13%) were prefrail, and 188 (10%) were frail or severely frail. Mortality and poor functional outcome increased significantly with greater frailty. Compared to fit participants, adjusted ORs (95% CI) for 6 month mortality were: prefrail 2.7 (1.8-3.8), frail 3.7 (1.9-7.1), and severely frail 8.9 (4.2-18.7); and poor functional outcome: prefrail 2.9 (1.9-4.2), frail 3.9 (1.9-8.1), and severely frail 35.4 (8.4-148.8). Severely frail participants underwent neuroprognostication less often (p < 0.001), while WLST was more common in the prefrail, frail and severely frail (p < 0.001). Prefrail and frail survivors tended to report more frequent functional decline and lower health status, though with individual variation. Conclusion Frailty was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Findings suggest more frequent functional decline and lower overall health status in frail survivors.

TI  - Developing a national trauma research action plan: Results from the Burn Research Gap Delphi Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND The 2016 National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine call for a national integrated, military-civilian trauma action plan to achieve zero preventable deaths and disability after injury included a proposal to establish a National Trauma Research Action Plan to "strengthen trauma research and ensure that the resources available for this research are commensurate with the importance of injury and the potential for improvement in patient outcomes." The Department of Defense funded the Coalition for National Trauma Research to generate a comprehensive research agenda spanning the continuum of trauma/burn care from prehospital to rehabilitation. The Burn/Reconstructive Surgery group represents one focus area for this research agenda development. METHODS Experts in burn and reconstructive surgery research identified gaps in knowledge, generated research questions and prioritized questions using a consensus driven Delphi survey approach. Participants were identified using established Delphi recruitment guidelines to ensure heterogeneity and generalizability with military and civilian representatives. Literature reviews informed the panel. Panelists were encouraged to use a PICO format to generate research questions: Patient/Population; Intervention; Compare/Control; Outcome. Participants ranked the priority of each question on a nine-point Likert scale, which was categorized to represent low, medium, and high priority items. Consensus was defined based on >= 60% panelist agreement. RESULTS Subject matter experts generated 949 research questions in 29 Burn & 26 Reconstruction topics. Five hundred ninety-seven questions reached consensus. Of these, 338 (57%) were high-priority, 180 (30%), medium-priority, and 78 (13%) low-priority questions. CONCLUSION Many high-priority questions translate to complex wound management and outcomes. Panel recognition that significant gaps in knowledge exist in understanding functional outcomes after injury underscores the importance of long-term recovery metrics even when studying acute injury or interventions such as resuscitation or inhalation injury. Funding agencies and burn/reconstructive surgery researchers should consider these gaps when they prioritize future research.

TI  - Continuous glycemia monitoring in perioperative period in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty: A protocol for a prospective observational study
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - In every surgical subspecialty surgical site infection (SSI) or implant infections, although occur seldom, pose a threat to patients' health. Risk factors of such states is diabetes mellitus (DM), considered one of the most widespread health-related problems of the 21st century. Orthopedists perform big joint replacements that usually concern older adults and therefore often deal with patients suffering from comorbidities. DM is frequently one of them and can furthermore often remain underdiagnosed. The other risk for complication is a rapid beginning of the rehabilitation which starts on the day following the surgery. To eliminate the debilitating impact of DM and hypoglycemia on surgical patients, we aim to investigate the relationship between the glycemia values and the postoperative outcomes in certain periods of time in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will have inserted a glycemia measuring device (Dexcom G5, Inc., San Diego, CA) in the periods of time. First time it will take place 14 days prior to the surgery and right after the surgery for the second time for the period of another 14 days. All patients will undergo standard total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty procedures. Patients will be assessed preoperatively and 14 days, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The assessment of the joint condition will consist of: patient-reported outcomes (The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Harris Hip Score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]); assessment of potential SSI and cardiovascular complications (the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score [FINDRISC], the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) and the clinical examination. To investigate the influence of orthopedic surgery (anesthesia) on glycemia and the significance and safety of early patients mobilization after the big joints surgeries. To investigate changes of glycemia in patients with normal glycemia metabolism, potentially protecting them from hypoglycemia during hospital stay and increasing their awareness of potential development of DM in the future. Additionally, this study will correlate perioperative glycemic levels with risk of cardiovascular events in one year follow-up, and its influence on SSI and implant complications.

TI  - Smartphone-Based Video Antenatal Preterm Birth Education The Preemie Prep for Parents Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Pediatric-Academic-Societies (PAS)
AB  - IMPORTANCE Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and child morbidity. Preterm birth is not always unexpected, yet standard prenatal care does not offer anticipatory education to parents at risk of delivering preterm, which leaves parents unprepared to make health care choices during the pregnancy that can improve survival and decrease morbidity in case of preterm birth.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of the Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) program on maternal knowledge of preterm birth, preparation for decision-making, and anxiety.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Recruitment for this randomized clinical trial conducted at a US academic medical center took place from February 3, 2020, to April 12, 2021. A total of 120 pregnant persons with a risk factor for preterm birth were enrolled between 16 and 21 weeks' gestational age and followed up through pregnancy completion.
   INTERVENTION Starting at 18 weeks' gestational age, P3 program participants received links delivered via text message to 51 gestational age-specific short animated videos. Control participants received links to patient education webpages from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At 25 weeks' gestation, scores on the Parent Prematurity Knowledge Questionnaire (scored as percent correct), Preparation for Decision Making Scale (scored 0-100), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety computerized adaptive test. Analysis was based on an intention to treat.
   RESULTS A total of 120 pregnant participants (mean [SD] age, 32.5 [4.9] years) were included in the study; 60 participants were randomized to each group. Participants in the P3 group scored higher than those in the control group on knowledge of long-term outcomes at 25 weeks (88.5% vs 73.2%; estimated difference, 15.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.3-22.5 percentage points; P < .001). Participants in the P3 group reported being significantly more prepared than did participants in the control group for neonatal resuscitation decision-making at 25 weeks (Preparation for Decision Making Scale score, 76.0 vs 52.3; difference, 23.7; 95% CI, 14.1-33.2). There was no difference between the P3 group and the control group in anxiety at 25 weeks (mean [SE] PROMIS Anxiety scores, 53.8 [1.1] vs 54.0 [1.1]; difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -3.2 to 2.9).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, pregnant persons randomly assigned to the P3 program had more knowledge of core competencies and were more prepared to make decisions that affect maternal and infant health, without experiencing worse anxiety. Mobile antenatal preterm birth education may provide a unique benefit to parents with preterm birth risk factors.

TI  - Health-Related Quality of Life and Long-Term Survival After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - This cohort study examines whether health-related quality of life 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is associated with long-term survival among adults who survived in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   QuestionIs health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest associated with long-term survival?FindingsIn this cohort study including 2000 survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest and 1108 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), poorer HRQOL reported with the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaire was associated with reduced long-term survival (assessed up to 7 years) in both cohorts, although uncertainty was higher among OHCA survivors.MeaningFindings suggest that HRQOL measured after cardiac arrest with the EQ-5D-5L may help identify survivors at risk of reduced long-term survival and inform follow-up care and rehabilitation; further research should confirm clinical utility.
   ImportanceHealth-related quality of life (HRQOL) follow-up can increase knowledge of cardiac arrest outcomes from the patient's perspective. Whether HRQOL affects long-term survival is unknown.ObjectiveTo investigate whether HRQOL 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is associated with long-term survival.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study linked 5 national registers with nationwide coverage in Sweden across a 7-year period and included survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, with follow-up through June 30, 2021. Participants were adults surviving at least 90 days after IHCA or OHCA who completed follow-up EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaires. Analyses were performed December 2 to 20, 2024.ExposuresEQ-5D-5L level sum score (LSS; sum of EQ-5D-5L dimensions, ranging from 5 [no problems] to 25 [extreme problems in all dimensions]), and the visual analog scale EQ VAS, 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest.Main Outcome and MeasuresLong-term survival up to a maximum of 7 years among patients surviving IHCA and OHCA.ResultsIn total, 2000 survivors of IHCA (median [IQR] age, 73 [65-80] years, 66% male) and 1108 survivors of OHCA (median [IQR] age, 69 [59-75] years, 77% male) were included. There were 475 deaths among patients with IHCA and 132 deaths among patients with OHCA. For patients with IHCA, the LSS distribution was 394 (20%) for LSS 5, 1034 (52%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 572 (29%) for LSS 11 to 25. For patients with OHCA, the LSS distribution was 299 (27%) for LSS 5, 637 (58%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 168 (15%) for LSS 11 to 25. In the IHCA population, LSS 11 to 25 had higher hazard of death compared with LSS 5 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.50 [95% CI, 1.82-3.43]), whereas LSS 6 to 10 did not (AHR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.88-1.65]). In OHCA, no associations were found between LSS categories and long-term survival (LSS 11-25 vs LSS 5: AHR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.83-2.42]; LSS 6-10 vs LSS 5: AHR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.56-1.39]). In both IHCA and OHCA, spline modeling using LSS and EQ VAS as continuous variables showed significant increases in hazards of death with poorer HRQOL, although the estimates in the OHCA population showed greater uncertainty.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cohort study of patients who survived beyond 90 days after IHCA or OHCA, poorer HRQOL reported with EQ-5D-5L scores 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest was associated with reduced long-term survival in both groups, with greater uncertainty for OHCA estimates. HRQOL assessment may help guide follow-up care.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes after Non-Traumatic Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Patients: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Long-term outcomes after non-traumatic pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are not well understood. This systematic review aimed to summarize long-term outcomes (1 year and beyond), including overall survival, survival with favorable neurological outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes) amongst pediatric OHCA patients who survived to discharge. Embase, Medline, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 6, 2021. Studies were included if they reported outcomes at 1 year or beyond after pediatric OHCA. Data abstraction and quality assessment was conducted by three authors independently. Qualitative outcomes were reported systematically. Seven studies were included, and amongst patients that survived to hospital discharge or to 30 days, longer-term survival was at least 95% at 24 months of follow up. A highly variable proportion (range 10-71%) of patients had favorable neurological outcomes at 24 months of follow up. With regard to health-related quality of life outcomes, at a time point distal to 1 year, at least 60% of pediatric non-traumatic OHCA patients were reported to have good outcomes. Our study found that at least 95% of pediatric OHCA patients, who survived to discharge, survived to a time point distal to 1 year. There is a general paucity of data surrounding the pediatric OHCA population.

TI  - Effect of intra-arrest transport, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate invasive assessment in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a long-term follow-up of the Prague OHCA trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Randomized data evaluating the impact of the extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) approach on long-term clinical outcomes in patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are lacking. The objective of this follow-up study was to assess the long-term clinical outcomes of the ECPR-based versus CCPR approach.Methods The Prague OHCA trial was a single-center, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with witnessed refractory OHCA of presumed cardiac origin, without return of spontaneous circulation, were randomized during ongoing resuscitation on scene to conventional CPR (CCPR) or an ECPR-based approach (intra-arrest transport, ECPR if ROSC is not achieved prehospital and immediate invasive assessment).Results From March 2013 to October 2020, 264 patients were randomized during ongoing resuscitation on scene, and 256 patients were enrolled. Long-term follow-up was performed 5.3 (interquartile range 3.8-7.2) years after initial randomization and was completed in 255 of 256 patients (99.6%). In total, 34/123 (27.6%) patients in the ECPR-based group and 26/132 (19.7%) in the CCPR group were alive (log-rank P = 0.01). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in the neurological outcome, survival after hospital discharge, risk of hospitalization, major cardiovascular events and quality of life. Of long-term survivors, 1/34 (2.9%) in the ECPR-based arm and 1/26 (3.8%) in the CCPR arm had poor neurological outcome (both patients had a cerebral performance category score of 3).Conclusions Among patients with refractory OHCA, the ECPR-based approach significantly improved long-term survival. There were no differences in the neurological outcome, major cardiovascular events and quality of life between the groups, but the trial was possibly underpowered to detect a clinically relevant difference in these outcomes. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01511666, Registered 19 January 2012.Conclusions Among patients with refractory OHCA, the ECPR-based approach significantly improved long-term survival.

TI  - Long-term survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with mechanical circulatory support
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Studies on long-term outcomes after refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) are limited. This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS.Methods: This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cere -bral Performance Category (CPC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2. Health-related quality of life was measured by questionnaires (Short Form-36 (SF-36)).Results: A total of 101 patients with refractory OHCA were treated with MCS at Aarhus University Hospital between 2015 and 2019. The total low-flow time was median 105 min [IQR, 94-123] minutes. The hospital discharge rate was 27%. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 years +/- 1.6 (range 2.8- 6.1 years), 21 patients remained alive of whom 15 consented to participate in the present study. Good neurological outcome with CPC 1-2 was found in 93% (14/15) patients. No severe cognitive function was discovered; mean MoCA score of 26.4 +/- 3.1. Functional capacity examined by CPX showed acceptable VO2 max values (23.9 +/- 6.3 mL/kg/min). Mean SF-36 scores revealed an overall high level of quality of life in long-term survivors.Conclusions: Long-term survival with a good neurological outcome with functional recovery was high in patients with refractory OHCA treated with MCS. These patients may expect a reasonable quality of life after discharge despite prolonged resuscitation.

TI  - Long-term function, quality of life and healthcare utilization among survivors of pediatric out-of- hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Survival following pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has improved over the past 2 decades but data on survivors' long-term outcomes are limited. We aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes in pediatric OHCA survivors more than one year after cardiac arrest.Methods: OHCA survivors <18 years old who received post-cardiac arrest care in the PICU at a single center between 2008-2018 were included. Parents of patients <18 years and patients >= 18 years at least one year after cardiac arrest completed a telephone interview. We assessed neuro-logic outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category [PCPC]), activities of daily living (Pediatric Glasgow Outcomes Scale-Extended, Functional Status Scale (FSS)), HRQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Core and Family Impact Modules), and healthcare utilization. Unfavorable neurologic outcome was defined as PCPC > 1 or worsening from pre-arrest baseline to discharge. Findings: Forty four patients were evaluable. Follow-up occurred at a median of 5.6 years [IQR 4.4, 8.9] post-arrest. Median age at arrest was 5.3 [1.3,12.6] years; median CPR duration was 5 [1.5, 7] minutes. Survivors with unfavorable outcome at discharge had worse FSS Sensory and Motor Function scores and higher rates of rehabilitation service utilization. Parents of survivors with unfavorable outcome reported greater disruption to family functioning. Healthcare utilization and educational support requirements were common among all survivors.Conclusions: Survivors of pediatric OHCA with unfavorable outcome at discharge have more impaired function multiple years post-arrest. Sur-vivors with favorable outcome may experience impairments and significant healthcare needs not fully captured by the PCPC at hospital discharge.

TI  - Sex-specific health-related quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains low, although the number of survivors is increasing, and survivors are living longer. With increasing long-term survival, there is a need to understand health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures. Although there are current recommendations for measuring HRQoL in OHCA survivors, there is significant heterogeneity in assessment timing and the measurement tools used to quantify HRQoL outcomes, making the interpretation and comparison of HRQoL difficult. Identifying groups of survivors of OHCA with poor HRQoL measures could be used for targeted intervention studies. Sex differences in OHCA resuscitation characteristics, post-cardiac arrest treatment, and short-term survival outcomes are well-documented, although variability in study methods and statistical adjustments appear to affect study results and conclusions. It is unclear whether sex differences exist in HRQoL among OHCA survivors and if study methods and statistical adjustment for patient characteristics or arrest circumstances impact the rsults. In this narrative review article, we provide an overview of the assessment of HRQoL and the main domains of HRQoL. We summarize the literature regarding sex differences in HRQoL in OHCA survivors. Few multivariable-adjusted studies reported HRQoL sex differences and there was significant heterogeneity in study size, timing of assessment, and domains measured and reported. What is reported suggests females have worse HRQoL than males, especially in the domains of physical function and mental health, but results should be interpreted with caution. Lastly, we discuss the challenges of a non-uniform approach to measurement and future directions for assessing and improving HRQoL in OHCA survivors.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest in Children: Long-Term Health Status and Health-Related Quality of Life
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To assess long-term health status and health-related quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest in childhood and their parents. In addition, to identify predictors of health status and health-related quality of life.
   Design: This medical follow-up study involved consecutive children surviving cardiac arrest between January 2002 and December 2011, who had been admitted to the ICU. Health status was assessed with a medical interview, physical examination, and the Health Utilities Index. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the Child Health Questionnaires and Short-Form 36.
   Setting: A tertiary care university children's hospital.
   Patients: Of the eligible 107 children, 57 (53%) filled out online questionnaires and 47 visited the outpatient clinic (median age, 8.7 yr; median follow-up interval, 5.6 yr).
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of the participants, 60% had an in-hospital cardiac arrest, 90% a nonshockable rhythm, and 50% a respiratory etiology of arrest. Mortality rate after hospital discharge was 10%. On health status, we found that 13% had long-term neurologic deficits, 34% chronic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache), 19% at least one sign suggestive of chronic kidney injury, and 15% needed special education. Health Utilities Index scores were significantly decreased on most utility scores and the overall Health Utilities Index mark 3 score. Compared with Dutch normative data, parent-reported health-related quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors was significantly worse on general health perception, physical role functioning, parental impact, and overall physical summary. On patient reports, no significant differences with normative data were found. Parents reported better family cohesion and better health-related quality of life for themselves on most scales. Patients' health status, general health perceptions, and physical summary scores were significantly associated with cardiac arrest-related preexisting condition.
   Conclusions: Considering the impact of cardiac arrest, the overall outcome after cardiac arrest in childhood is reasonably good. Prospective long-term outcome research in large homogeneous groups is needed.

TI  - Impact of resuscitation duration on 12-month functional recovery following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initially shockable rhythms
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To describe the impact of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) duration on the 12-month functional recovery and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with initially shockable rhythms. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of adults (aged >= 18 years) who had an emergency medical service (EMS) attempted resuscitation with an initially shockable rhythm between 2015 and 2024. We excluded paediatric cases, traumatic aetiology and EMS witnessed OHCA. Survivors to hospital discharge were followed up 12 months post-arrest to assess functional recovery according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. CPR duration was defined as the total cumulative EMS resuscitation time until either return of spontaneous circulation or resuscitation termination. Results: Of the 7922 OHCA with an initially shockable rhythm, 6371 met the inclusion criteria. 2054 (32.6 %) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of those, 1769 (86.1 %) patients were confirmed alive at 12-months, and 1429 responded to follow-up. The 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles of CPR duration for those who survived to 12 months with favourable functional recovery were 8, 25, and 69 min, respectively. Among all patients with initially shockable rhythms, each minute increase in CPR duration was associated with reduced risk-adjusted odds of 12-month favourable functional recovery (AOR = 0.905, 95 %CI 0.899-0.911) and HRQoL. Among 12-month responders only, increasing CPR duration was associated with lower odds of favourable recovery (AOR = 0.989, 95 %CI 0.980-0.998) and living at home without care. Conclusion: In OHCA with an initially shockable rhythm, increasing CPR duration is associated with poorer long-term functional recovery and quality-of-life.

TI  - Physical, psychological, cognitive, social health outcomes, and health-related quality of life in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers: Protocol of the quality cardiac arrest survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS)
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an emergency with historically low survival rates. Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers. Objective: Our primary aim is to determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being. Methods: The Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants aged >= 18 years and caregivers aged >= 21 years will be recruited from all public hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, and Zarit Burden Interview. Discussion: This study allows us to understand the natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA sequelae.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; a comparison of prehospital return-of-spontaneous circulation and refractory arrest managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for selected refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is increasingly used. Detailed knowledge of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term cognitive function is limited. HRQoL and cognitive function were assessed in ECPR-survivors and OHCA-survivors with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation after standard advanced cardiac life support Methods: Fifteen ECPR-survivors and 22 age-matched sACLS-survivors agreed to participate in this follow-up study. Participants were examined with echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and neuropsychological testing, and answered HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and Short Form 36 (SF-36)), and Results: Most patients were male (73 % and 82 %) and median age at follow-up was similar between groups (55 years and 60 years). Low flow time was significantly longer for ECPR-survivors (86 min vs. 15 min) and lactate levels were significantly higher (14.1 mmol/l vs. 3.9 mmol/l). No betweengroup difference was found in physical function nor in cognitive function with scores corresponding to the 23rd worst percentile of the general population. SACLS-survivors had HRQoL on level with the Danish general population while ECPR-survivors scored lower in both EQ-5D-5L (index score 0.73 vs. 0.86, p = 0.03, visual analog scale: 70 vs. 84, p = 0.04) and in multiple SF-36 health domains (role physical, bodily pain, general health, and Conclusions: Despite substantially longer low flow times with thrice as high lactate levels, ECPR-survivors were similar in cognitive and physical function compared to sACLS-survivors. Nonetheless, ECPR-survivors reported lower HRQoL overall and related to mental health, pain management, and the perception of limitations in physical role.

TI  - Cardiac arrest, stony heart, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation: An updated revisit
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The post-resuscitation period is recognized as the main predictor of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) outcomes. The first description of post-resuscitation syndrome and stony heart was published over 50 years ago. Major manifestations may include but are not limited to, persistent precipitating pathology, systemic ischemia/reperfusion response, post-cardiac arrest brain injury, and finally, post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) after successful resuscitation. Why do some patients initially survive successful resuscitation, and others do not? Also, why does the myocardium response vary after resuscitation? These questions have kept scientists busy for several decades since the first successful resuscitation was described. By modifying the conventional modalities of resuscitation together with new promising agents, rescuers will be able to salvage the jeopardized post-resuscitation myocardium and prevent its progression to a dismal, stony heart. Community awareness and staff education are crucial for shortening the resuscitation time and improving short- and long-term outcomes. Awareness of these components before and early after the restoration of circulation will enhance the resuscitation outcomes. This review extensively addresses the underlying pathophysiology, management, and outcomes of post-resuscitation syndrome. The pattern, management, and outcome of PAMD and post-cardiac arrest shock are different based on many factors, including in-hospital cardiac arrest vs out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), witnessed vs unwitnessed cardiac arrest, the underlying cause of arrest, the duration, and protocol used for CPR. Although restoring spontaneous circulation is a vital sign, it should not be the end of the game or lone primary outcome; it calls for better understanding and aggressive multi-disciplinary interventions and care. The development of stony heart post-CPR and OHCA remain the main challenges in emergency and critical care medicine.

TI  - Cognitive function, quality of life and mental health in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a review
T2  - ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - There is growing interest in the long-term outcomes of patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This paper aims to summarise the available literature on the long-term cognitive, health-related quality of life (QoL) and mental health outcomes of survivors of OHCA. Between 30 and 50% of survivors of OHCA experience cognitive deficits for up to several years post-discharge. Deficits of attention, declarative memory, executive function, visuospatial abilities and verbal fluency are commonly reported. Survivors of OHCA appear to report high rates of mental illness, with up to 61% experiencing anxiety, 45% experiencing depression and 27% experiencing post-traumatic stress. Fatigue appears to be a commonly reported long-term outcome for survivors of OHCA. Investigations of long-term QoL for these patients have produced mixed findings. Carers of survivors of OHCA report high rates of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, with insufficient social and financial support. The heterogeneous range of instruments used to assess cognitive function and QoL prevent any clear conclusions being drawn from the available literature. The potential biases inherent in this patient population and the interaction between QoL, cognitive performance and mental health warrant further investigation, as does the role of post-discharge support services in improving long-term patient outcomes.

TI  - Long-term survival and neurological outcome of patients who received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The long-term outcome in patients who received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of non-traumatic aetiology was assessed. Methods: The neurological outcome in survivors and their level of performance, subjective well-being and quality of life were evaluated. Results: A follow-up study of 27 cardiac arrest survivors was conducted; four patients (15%) died during the first year, a total of seven patients (26%) within 5 years. Twenty-two patients (81%) were discharged from hospital without neurological deficit (cerebral performance category (CPC) score: 1), three patients scored CPC 2 and two patients CPC 3. Heart failure classification on discharge was, according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria 2.1 +/- 0.9. Fifteen patients (56%) managed to return to their previous level of activity. At the time of follow-up 18 patients (67%) were still alive, of whom 15 responded to a survey regarding life satisfaction. Thirteen patients (87%) judged their situation to be worth living and twelve (80%) considered their survival a second chance, while five (33%) feared they could suffer another cardiac arrest. Reactions from close relatives included fear/anxiety (n = 14; 78%), a sustained burden on family life (n = 12; 67%), and occasional depression (n = 7; 39%). Conclusions: Thrombolytic therapy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may produce a favourable neurological outcome. The majority of long-term survivors reported a good subjective quality of life. In one-third of close family members some negative factors had a lasting impact on the quality of daily living. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term survival and health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is an adverse event associated with high mortality. Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors. Methods: A multicentre prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. Patients > 18 years receiving car-diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by pre-arrest Mod-ified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year. Results: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 69.7% was functionally independent. Conclusion: One-year survival after IHCA in this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies. Survival is associated with a patient's pre-arrest functional status and morbidity. HRQoL appears acceptable, however functional rehabilitation warrants attention. These findings provide a comprehensive insight in in-hospital cardiac arrest prognosis.

TI  - Long-term multidisciplinary follow-up programs in pediatric cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Long-term outcome studies after pediatric cardiac arrest (CA) are few. They require a CA registry and dedicated outcome teams. Learning about the long-term outcomes is very important for developing prognostication guidelines, improving post -cardiac care, counseling caregivers about the future of their child, and creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention studies to improve outcomes. Few PICUs worldwide provide a multidisciplinary follow-up program as routine practice at an outpatient clinic with standardized measurements, using validated instruments including neuropsychological assessments by psychologists. The primary goal of such a follow-up program should be to provide excellent care to children and their caregivers, thereby resulting in a high attendance. Pediatric psychologists, neurologists and pediatricians/pediatric intensivists should ideally be involved to screen for delayed development and psychosocial problems and offer appropriate care at the same time. Preferably, outcomes should consist of evaluation of morbidity (physical and neuropsychological), functional health and Health Related Quality Of Life (QoL) of the patient and their caregivers.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest - a five-year follow-up study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is affected after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but data several years after the arrest are lacking. We assessed long-term HRQoL in OHCA survivors and how known outcome predictors impact HRQoL.
   Methods: In adult OHCA survivors, HRQoL was assessed five years post arrest using Short-form 36 (SF-36), EQ-5D-3 L (EQ-5D) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) among others. Results were compared to the next of kins' estimates and to a Norwegian reference population.
   Results: Altogether 96 survivors were included mean 5.3 (range 3.6-7.2) years after OHCA. HRQoL compared well to the reference population, except for lower score for general health with 67.2 (95%CI (62.1; 72.3) vs. 72.9 (71.9; 74.0)), p = 0.03. Younger (<= 58 years) vs. older survivors scored lower for general health with mean (SD) of 62.1 (27.5) vs. 73.0 (19.5), p = 0.03, vitality (55.2 (20.5) vs. 64.6 (17.3), p = 0.02, social functioning (75.3 (28.7) vs. 94.1 (13.5), p < 0.001 and mental component summary (49.0 (9.9) vs. 55.8 (6.7), p < 0.001. They scored higher for HADS-anxiety (4.8 (3.6 vs. 2.7 (2.5), p = 0.001, and had lower EQ-5D index (0.72 (0.34) vs. 0.84 (0.19), p = 0.04. Early vs. late awakeners had higher EQ-5D index (0.82 (0.23) vs. 0.71 (0.35), p = 0.04 and lower HADS-depression scores (2.5 (2.9) vs. 3.8 (2.3), p = 0.04. Next of kin estimated HRQoL similar to the survivors' own estimates.
   Conclusions: HRQoL five years after OHCA was good and mainly comparable to a matched reference population. Stratified analyses revealed impaired HRQoL among younger survivors and those awakening late, mainly for mental domains.

TI  - Life after survival: Long-term daily functioning and quality of life after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Information about long-term consequences of cardiac arrest is sparse. Because the survival late is expected to increase, better knowledge of long-term functioning and quality of survival is essential.
   Objectives: To determine the level of functioning of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest Survivors 1-6 years later, and to evaluate the predictive value of medical variables oil long-term functioning.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study including 63 survivors of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted to a Dutch University hospital between 2001 and 2006. Participants received a questionnaire by post. Primary outcome measures were: participation in Society (Community Integration Questionnaire) and quality of life (SF-36). Secondary outcome Measures were: physical, cognitive and emotional impairment, daily functioning and caregiver strain. Statistical analyses included multiple regression analyses.
   Results: On average 3 years post-cardiac arrest, 74% of the patients experienced a low participation level in society compared with the general population. Over 50% reported severe fatigue, 38% feelings of anxiety and/or depression and 24% a decreased quality of life. Caregivers reported stress related responses, feelings of anxiety and lower quality of life. Seventeen percent of the caregivers reported high caregiver strain, which was associated with the patient's level of functioning. Gender, age, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and therapeutic hypothermia contributed to outcome on at least one domain of long-term functioning.
   Conclusions: After surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, many patients and partners encounter extensive impairments in their level of functioning and quality of life. Gender, age, PCI and therapeutic hypothermia are associated with differences in long-term functioning of patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in health status and health related quality of life from six months to five years in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors - A NORCAST sub study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Brain injury in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors affects health status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is unknown how HRQoL evolves over time, and assessments at different time points may lead to different results. Methods: In a NORCAST sub study, OHCA survivors eligible for health status (EQ-5D-3L) and HRQoL (SF-36) assessments were examinated six months and five years after OHCA. At five-year follow-up, survivors also retrospectively assessed their health status for each consecutive year fol-lowing OHCA. The next of kin independently assessed health status and HRQoL of their respective OHCA survivors. Results: Among 138 survivors alive after six months and 117 after five years, 80 (88% male) completed both follow-ups. Health status and HRQoL remained stable over time, except for increasing SF-36 mental summary score and decreasing physical functioning and physical component score. Anxiety and depression levels were generally low, although younger survivors stated more anxiety than older survivors. Retrospective assessment showed reduced health status for the first two years, which increased only from the third year. Explorative analyses revealed that younger age, long-er time to return of spontaneous circulation (tROSC) and late awakening affected health status, particularly in the first two years post-arrest. Conclusions: OHCA survivors showed stable health status and HRQoL with only minor differences between six months and five years. Younger survivors with long tROSC, late awakening, and more anxiety and depression symptoms at six months, had reduced health status the first two years with significant improvements towards the fourth year.

TI  - The quality of life in extracorporeal life support survivors: single-center experience of a long-term follow-up
T2  - CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the health-related quality of life on a very long-term follow-up in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during neonatal and pediatric age.DesignProspective follow-up study.SettingPediatric Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary-care University-Hospital.PatientsOut of 20 neonates and 21 children treated with ECMO in our center, 24 patients underwent short-term neurological follow-up. Twenty of them underwent long-term neurological follow-up.InterventionShort-term follow-up was performed at 18months and consisted in clinical evaluation, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. Long-term follow-up was performed in 2017, at the mean period 19.72years from ECMO (median 20.75, range 11.50-24.08) and consisted in a standardized questionnaires self-evaluation (PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale) of health-related quality of life and an interviewed about the presence of organ morbidity, school level, or work position.Measurements and main resultsSixty-one percent (25/41) of the patients survived within 30days after ECMO treatment. Short-term follow-up was performed in 24 patients (1 patient but died before the evaluation): 21 patients (87%) showed a normal neurological status, and 3 developed severe disability. Long-term follow-up was performed in 20 long-term survivors (3 patients were not possible to be contacted and considered lost to follow-up): mean age of patients at long-term follow-up was 21.23 (median 20.96, range 13.33-35.58) years; 90% (18/20) of them have no disability with a complete normal quality of life and 95% have no cognitive impairment.ConclusionsECMO represents a life-saving treatment for infants and children with respiratory and/or heart failure; survivors show a good quality of life comparable to healthy peers.

TI  - Sex-related differences in long-term quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide cross-sectional survey study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims Sex differences in survival and short-term outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are well documented, but its impact on long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unclear.
   Methods and results This cross-sectional survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess HRQoL among adult OHCA survivors in Denmark between 2001 and 2019 who were alive as of 1 October 2020. Survivors were grouped by time since cardiac arrest: 0-4, >4-8, >8-12, and >12 years post-arrest. Among 2552 respondents (56.1% response rate), 2075 were men (81.3%) and 477 were women (18.7%). The mean survey age was 60.2 years (SD 14.7) for women and 66.0 years (SD 11.8) for men. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and EuroQol Health Questionnaire index scores were both lower for women than for men [69 vs. 75 and 0.76 (SD 0.21) vs. 0.84 (SD 0.17), respectively; P < 0.001]. The SF-12 physical and mental health scores were also lower for women [40.3 (SD 12.9) and 50.9 (SD 8.8)] compared with men [44.0 (SD 12.1) and 53.3 (SD 8.1); P < 0.001]. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for anxiety (5.4 vs. 3.5; P < 0.001) and for depression (4.0 vs. 3.2; P < 0.001) were higher among women. In multivariable logistic regression, female sex remained significantly associated with poorer long-term HRQoL outcomes. Trends remained consistent regardless of time since cardiac arrest.
   Conclusion Female OHCA survivors reported less favourable long-term HRQoL outcomes compared with male survivors, irrespective of time elapsed since cardiac arrest.

TI  - Quality of life of long-term survivors after out-of-hospital resuscitation
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Background: After having survived cardiac arrest, the quality of life, life satisfaction, and professional reintegration are particularly important in the long-term course after out-of-hospital resuscitation for those affected. The study examined various criteria in long-term survival of more than 360 days after out-of-hospital resuscitation in an urban rescue service system. Methods: The patient collective consisted of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 1 year after hospital discharge from 2020-2022 in D & uuml;sseldorf, Germany. The survivors were interviewed 12-18 months after hospital discharge using a multidimensional questionnaire on their general state of health, living situation, neurological status (CPC = Cerebral Performance Category Score), subjective perception of quality of life/life satisfaction and work situation. Result: The questionnaire was sent to 149 patients, of whom 103 responded (response rate: 69%, male: 83%, age: 61 +/- 13 years). Of the respondents, 91% rated themselves as having a good neurological treatment outcome (CPC 1-2). Mild to severe anxiety/depression was experienced by 48% and pain symptoms by 44%. More often to significantly more often than before the OHCA, 74% had fatigue and 59% suffered from mild to severe concentration disorders. Furthermore, 41% felt that their own quality of life was the same or better than before the event and 61% rated their own life satisfaction as very good to good. 73% of patients returned to work within 1 year. Conclusion: Long-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest shows an overall high CPC rating, but only half of the patients rated their own quality of life/life satisfaction as positive. The high rate of cognitive and psychological problems and the associated restrictions in daily life lead to reduced quality of life/life satisfaction despite a high CPC rating. Regular patient evaluations and alternative scores can help to identify health problems in order to offer patient-adapted therapy options for comprehensive rehabilitation.

TI  - The influence of comorbidity on survival and long-term outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Comorbid conditions have been associated with morbidity, functional status and quality of life for patients with a wide range of diseases. Previous studies have attempted to elucidate the influence of pre-arrest comorbidities on survival and neurological recovery following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), however the findings are conflicting.
   Methods: Baseline comorbidities recorded within prehospital patient care records were linked with baseline and 12-month follow-up data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry for adult (>16 years) non-traumatic OHCA patients. Dates of death from the Victorian death registry were also obtained for patients surviving to hospital discharge. Multivariable logistic, linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the influence of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) on survival to hospital discharge, 12-month functional recovery and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), and long-term mortality over an eight-year period.
   Results: A total of 15,953 patients were included. Increasing CCI was independently associated with reduced odds of survival to hospital discharge (CCI = 1: OR = 0.87 [95% CI 0.76-1.00]; CCI = 2: OR = 0.80 [95% CI 0.68-0.94]; CCI = 3: OR = 0.62 [95% CI 0.50-0.78]; CCI >= 4: OR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.41-0.68]). Additionally, increasing CCI was associated with reduced odds of 12-month functional recovery, a reduced chance of favourable 12-month HR-QOL, and an increased hazard of mortality after discharge from hospital.
   Conclusion: Consideration of a patient's baseline comorbidity may assist prognostication decisions for cardiac arrest patients. Exploration of the effect of additional rehabilitation on HR-QOL and long-term survival outcomes for OHCA patients with a high baseline comorbidity burden may be warranted.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes After Cardiac Arrest: Protocol for the Extended Follow-Up Sub-Study of the STEPCARE Trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background The international multi-center randomized controlled STEPCARE-trial will investigate optimal management of sedation, temperature, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during intensive care in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients due to various etiologies. The primary outcome is mortality at 6 months. This protocol describes an extended follow-up sub-study of the STEPCARE-trial with the main objective to provide detailed long-term outcomes for survivors and caregivers. It will focus on potential neuroprotection and improved recovery for different targets of sedation, temperature, and MAP management at 6 and 12 months post-OHCA. Methods All survivors and one caregiver per survivor at selected STEPCARE sites will be invited to participate. Randomization is stratified by site. This sub-study extends the main STEPCARE follow-up at 6 months by undertaking detailed assessments, face-to-face meetings, inclusion of a caregiver, and repeating the assessments at 12 months. Our main outcome for survivors is cognitive function measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and for caregivers, the caregiver burden measured by the Zarit Burden Interview. Additional outcomes include symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fatigue, physical function, life satisfaction, and life impact (disability), assessed by psychometrically robust measures. The estimated sample size is 600. Efforts to improve interrater reliability and decrease missing data are integral to the study design. Conclusion These detailed long-term outcomes will explore the possible benefits or risks of fever, sedation, and blood pressure management in post-OHCA survivors. Additionally, this study will explore survivorship after cardiac arrest from various perspectives, including different causes of arrest.

TI  - Long-term quality of life and uncertainty in patients living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - PURPOSE: This study describes the quality of life (QOL) and uncertainty in patients who have an l implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and predicts QOL at long-term follow-up.
   METHODS: Long-term follow-up was defined as 6.9 years 1 year (range 4.11-8.7 years). QOL was measured with the Quality of Life Index, and uncertainty was measured with the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale.
   RESULTS: The overall QOL and health/functioning were unchanged over time. QOL in the socioeconomic (P = .002) and psychologic/spiritual domains (P = .012) decreased in the first year. From baseline to long-term follow-up, the QOL in the family domain (P = .011) and uncertainty (P = .002) decreased. Uncertainty was a predictor of low QOL.
   CONCLUSION: QOL was reasonably good 6.9 years post-ICD implantation. Patients felt less uncertain once they had passed the first year of their illness.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after surviving an out-of-hospital compared to an in-hospital cardiac arrest: A Swedish population-based registry study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been reported for out-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) separately, but potential differences between the two groups are unknown. The aim of this study is therefore to describe and compare HRQoL in patients surviving OHCA and IHCA.
   Methods: Patients >= 18 years with Cerebral Performance Category 1-3 included in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2014 and 2017 were included. A telephone interview was performed based on a questionnaire sent 3-6 months post cardiac arrest, including EQ-5D-5L and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear- and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to describe and compare HRQoL in OHCA and IHCA survivors. Adjustments were made for sex, age and initial rhythm.
   Results: In all, 1369 IHCA and 772 OHCA survivors were included. Most OHCA and IHCA survivors reported no symptoms of with anxiety (88% and 84%) or depression (87% and 85%). IHCA survivors reported significantly more problems in the health domains mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain/discomfort (p < 0.001 for all) and scored lower general health measured by EQ-VAS (median 70 vs. 80 respectively, p < 0.001) compared with the OHCA survivors.
   Conclusion: Survivors of IHCA reported significantly worse HRQoL compared to survivors of OHCA. Consequently, research data gathered from one of these populations may not be generalizable to the other.

TI  - Post-intensive care syndrome and health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective cohort study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Patients discharged from intensive care are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which consists of physical, psychological, and/or neurological impairments. This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93). More than one-third of cardiac arrest survivors experience symptoms of PICS 2 years after resuscitation, with the highest impairment observed in the physical and psychological domains. However, long-term survivors of cardiac arrest report intact health-related quality of life when compared to the general population. Future research should focus on appropriate prevention, screening, and treatment strategies for PICS in cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: The neurological and functional outcome and health-related quality of life one year later
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Data on long-term functional outcome and quality of life (QoL) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are limited. We assessed long-term functional outcome and health-related QoL of OHCA survivors regardless of arrest aetiology.
   Methods: All adult unconscious OHCA patients treated in 21 Finnish ICUs between March 2010 and February 2011 were followed. Barthel Index (BI), activities of daily living (ADL), accommodation, help needed and received, working status, car driving and self-experienced cognitive deficits were assessed in 1-year survivors (N = 206, 40.9% of the original FINNRESUSCI cohort) with a structured telephone interview. Health-related QoL and more complex ADL-functions were evaluated by EQ-5D and instrumental ADL questionnaires.
   Results: Good outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 1 or 2, had been reached by 90.3% of survivors. The median BI score was 100, and 91.3% of survivors were independent in basic ADL-functions. The great majority of survivors were living at home, only 8.7% lived in a sheltered home or needed institutionalized care. Of home-living survivors 71.4% scored high in instrumental ADL assessment. The majority (72.6%) of survivors who were working previously had returned to work. Health-related QoL was similar as in age-and gender-adjusted Finnish population.
   Conclusions: Long-term functional outcome was good in over 90% of patients surviving OHCA, with health-related quality of life similar to that of an age and gender matched population.

TI  - Long-term health-related quality of life in survivors of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation compared to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation-A cohort study using Australian and New Zealand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation registry and the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To compare the long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between patients receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) and conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods and Settings: A retrospective cohort study using the Australian and New Zealand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EXCEL) registry for ECPR cases and the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) for CCPR cases. All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12month EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS). Results: There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data. The ECPR cohort was younger [mean(SD) 50.4(13.46) vs 60.5(14.01) yrs, p < 0.01] and more likely to have received bystander CPR [19(79%) ECPR vs 397(52%) CCPR, p < 0.001]. Both cohorts had similar proportions of males, witnessed arrests and initial shockable rhythms. Median (IQR) arrest to ROSC/ECMO time was longer in ECPR than CCPR [61(41.5-97) vs 6(2-14) minutes, p < 0.001]. The median (IQR) EQ-5D-5L utility score [0.95 (0.72-1) ECPR vs 0.96 (0.86-1) CCPR, p = 0.64] and median (IQR) EQ-VAS at 12 months [80 (64.5-90) ECPR vs 75 (60-85) CCPR, p = 0.39] were similar. There were no significant differences in the EQ-5D-5L utility scores and EQ-VAS even after Conclusions: Despite significant baseline differences between ECPR and CCPR, there were no differences in HRQoL at 12 months.

TI  - Long-term functional recovery and health-related quality of life of elderly out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Understanding the prognosis of elderly out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients is vital to informing resuscitation and advanced care planning decisions. However, short-term outcomes such as survival to hospital discharge do not account for post-arrest quality of life. We describe the 12-month functional recovery and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of elderly OHCA survivors, including those arresting in aged care facilities.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry data for all OHCA survivors to hospital discharge aged >= 65 years between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2016. The influence of age on functional recovery and independent living was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: During the study period, 20,103 elderly OHCAs were attended, 9016 (44.9%) of whom received a resuscitation attempt. In total, 876 (9.7%) patients survived to hospital discharge and 777 were alive 12 months post-arrest. Of these, 651 participated in 12-month follow-up (response rate 83.8%). Most (60.6%) resided at home without additional care and 66.6% reported a good functional recovery, however both measures decreased with increasing age (p < 0.001). Mental HR-QOL increased with increasing age and was significantly better than the age-and sex-matched Australian population. Each 10-year increase in age was associated with a 40.8% (95% CI 25.6-53.0%) reduction in the odds of good functional recovery, and a 65.8% (95% CI 55.8-73.5%) reduction in the odds of living independently. Of the 2575 OHCAs in an aged care facility, 2.2% survived to hospital discharge, however no patient reported a good 12-month functional recovery.
   Conclusions: Most elderly OHCA survivors resided independently with good functionality 12 months post-arrest. However, increasing age was associated with less favourable outcomes. New strategies are needed with regard to resuscitation in aged care facilities.

TI  - Long-Term Quality of Life After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JAMA CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Importance Allocating resources to increase survival after cardiac arrest requires survivors to have a good quality of life, but long-term data are lacking.Objective To determine the quality of life of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2019.Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the health-related quality of life of all adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry between June 1, 2001, and August 31, 2019, who were alive in October 2020 (follow-up periods, 0-1, >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, >10-15, and >15-20 years since arrest). The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.Exposure All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Main Outcome and Measures Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.Results Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.Conclusions and Relevance Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population. These findings support resource allocation and efforts targeted to increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest quality of life follow-up study of survivors in Munster, Ireland
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Quality of life of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors is believed to be as important as a factor in resuscitation outcome as the survival rate. The aim of this investigation is to assess the quality of life outcomes of survivors of out-of- hospital cardiac arrest in the Munster region. OHCAR was used to identify survivors who were contacted in writing to invite their participation. Internationally standardized phone based questionnaires were utilized to assess quality of life. The mean age of participants was 63.5 years with 85% male and 15% female. Eighty percent (n = 16) had no issues with mobility, 90% (n = 18) had no issues with personal care, 90% could undertake all usual activities, and 90% (n = 18) experienced no anxiety or depression. In conclusion, survivors of OHCA in the Munster area, who participated in this study, survive at a very high functional level.

TI  - Long-term functional outcome and quality of life 5-8 years after out of hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To determine functional outcomes and quality of life several years post OHCA and identify associated factors. Methods: This is a long-term follow-up sub-study of the TTH48 multicentre trial. OHCA survivors from participating sites were contacted 5-8 years post OHCA. Survival rates were collected from medical registries. Telephone interviews were performed to collect basic outcomes and quality of life. Questionnaires surveyed patients and relatives levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep, fatigue, cognitive decline and everyday life participation. Results: 279 patients were included at the participating sites, 161 (58%) were still alive. A vast majority of the participating survivors (97.8%) had favourable outcomes (CPC 1-2) and quality of life was comparable to the background population. Among the participating OHCA survivors, 5.5% met the criteria for anxiety, 2.7% for depression, 4.5% for PTSD, 24.5% reported sleep problems, 45.5% reported fatigue, and 40.7% were working full-or part-time. Among the participating relatives, 7.0% met the criteria for anxiety, 1.2% for depression, 3.5% for PTSD, and 52.3% of the relatives reported that the patient had suffered cognitive decline post OHCA. ROSC delay, higher age, and female sex were negatively associated with several long-term outcomes. Treatment allocation was not associated with better outcomes. Conclusions: Long-term OHCA survivors had acceptable outcomes, though self-reported sleep and fatigue problems and relatives-reported cognitive decline were prevalent. Higher age and longer ROSC delay were risk factors of poorer outcome, primarily driven by mortality. Female sex was a risk factor of worse self-reported outcomes.

TI  - Cognitive and Functional Consequence of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Cardiac arrest is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Better-quality bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, cardiocerebral resuscitation principles, and intensive post-resuscitation hospital care have improved survival. However, cognitive and functional impairment after cardiac arrest remain areas of concern. Research focus has shifted beyond prognostication in the immediate post-arrest period to identification of mechanisms for long-term brain injury and implementation of promising protocols to reduce neuronal injury. These include therapeutic temperature management (TTM), as well as pharmacologic and psychological interventions which also improve overall neurological function. Comprehensive assessment of cognitive function post-arrest is hampered by heterogeneous measures among studies. However, the domains of attention, long-term memory, spatial memory, and executive function appear to be affected. As more patients survive cardiac arrest for longer periods of time, there needs to be a greater focus on interventions that can enhance cognitive and psychosocial function post-arrest.

TI  - Neurologic long term outcome after drowning in children
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Drowning is a major source of mortality and morbidity in children worldwide. Neurocognitive outcome of children after drowning incidents cannot be accurately predicted in the early course of treatment. Therefore, aggressive out-of-hospital and in-hospital treatment is emphasized. There are "miracle" cases after long submersion times that have been reported in the medical literature, which mostly concern small children. However, many of the survivors will remain severely neurologically compromised after remarkably shorter submersion times and will consequently be a great burden to their family and society for the rest of their lives. The duration of submersion, the need of advanced life support at the site of the accident, the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival at the emergency room are important factors related to survival with mild neurological deficits or intact function in drowned children. Data on long-term outcome are scarce. The used outcome measurement methods and the duration of follow-up have not been optimal in most of the existing studies. Proper neurological and neurophysiological examinations for drowned children are superior to outcome scales based chart reviews. There is evidence that gross neurological examination at the time of discharge from the hospital in young children does not reveal all the possible sequelae related to hypoxic brain injury and thus long-term follow-up of drowned resuscitated children is strongly recommended.

TI  - Long-Term Follow-Up on Health-Related Quality of Life After Mechanical Circulatory Support in Children
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of mechanical circulatory support after acute cardiopulmonary failure.
   Design: Prospective follow-up study.
   Setting: Single-institutional in a center for congenital heart disease and pediatric cardiology.
   Patients: Fifty patients who underwent 58 mechanical circulatory support therapies in our institution from 2001 to 2012. Median age was 2 (0-213) months, and median supporting time was 5 (1-234) days. Indication groups: 1) extracorporeal life support in low cardiac output: 30 cases (52%); 2) extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 13 cases (22%); 3) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome: four cases (7%); and 4) ventricular assist devices: 11 cases (19%).
   Interventions: Health-related quality of life was measured using standardized questionnaires according to the age group and completed by either parent proxies in children under 7 years old or the survivors themselves.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fifty percentage of the patients were discharged home, and 22 long-term survivors (44%) were studied prospectively for health-related quality of life. Median follow-up period was 4.5 (0.3-11.3) years. Median age at follow-up was 5 (0.6-29) years old. Nineteen long-term survivors filled in the health-related quality of life questionnaires and were classified into three age groups: 0-4 years (n = 7): median health-related quality of life score, 69 (59-86) points; 4-12 years (n = 7): median health-related quality of life score, 50 (48-85) points; older than 12 years (n = 5): median health-related quality of life score, 90 (80-100) points.
   Conclusion: Long-term survivors' health-related quality of life as reported by their parents is lower than that of healthy children. However, the self-assessed health-related quality of life of the patients older than 12 years in our group is comparable to a healthy control population.

TI  - Cardiac arrest survivors treated with or without mild therapeutic hypothermia: performance status and quality of life assessment
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is the main determinant of clinical outcome after cardiac arrest. The study was designed to determine long-term neurological and psychological status in cardiac arrest survivors, as well as to compare neuropsychological outcomes between patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) and patients who did not undergo hypothermia treatment.
   Methods: The article describes a single-center, retrospective, observational study on 28 post-cardiac arrest adult patients treated in the cardiac intensive care unit who qualified for MTH vs. 37 control group patients, hospitalized at the same center following cardiac arrest in the preceding years and fulfilling criteria for induced hypothermia, but who were not treated due to unavailability of the method at that time. Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Barthel Index and RAND-36 were used to assess performance status and quality of life in both study groups after hospital discharge.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in physical functioning found between groups either at the end of hospital treatment or at long-term follow-up (DRS: p = 0.11; Barthel Index: p = 0.83). In long-term follow-up, MTH patients showed higher vitality (p = 0.02) and reported fewer complaints on role limitations due to emotional problems (p = 0.04) compared to the control group. No significant differences were shown between study groups in terms of physical capacity and independent functioning.
   Conclusion: To conclude, in long-term follow-up, MTH patients showed higher vitality and reported fewer complaints on role limitations due to emotional problems compared to the control group. This suggest that MTH helps to preserve global brain function in cardiac arrest survivors. However, the results can be biased by a small sample size and variable observation periods.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after successful early defibrillation
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation is high. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have improved the rate of survival to hospital discharge. We conducted a population-based analysis of the long-term outcome and quality of life of survivors.
   METHODS: All patients who had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between November 1990 and January 2001 who received early defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, Minnesota, were included. The survival rate was compared with that of an age-, sex-, and disease-matched (2:1) control population of residents who had not had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and with that of age- and sex-matched controls from the general U.S. population. The quality of life was assessed with use of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and compared with U.S. population norms.
   RESULTS: Of 200 patients who presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation, 145 (72 percent) survived to hospital admission (7 died in the emergency department) and 79 (40 percent) were neurologically intact (good overall capability or moderate overall disability) at discharge. The mean (+/-SD) length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 years. Nineteen patients died after discharge from the hospital. The expected five-year survival rate (79 percent) was identical to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched controls (P=0.68) but lower than that among the age- and sex-matched U.S. population (86 percent, P=0.02). Fifty patients completed SF-36 surveys at the end of follow-up, and the majority had a nearly normal quality of life, with the exception of reduced vitality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival among patients who have undergone rapid defibrillation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is similar to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched patients who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The quality of life among the majority of survivors is similar to that of the general population.

TI  - Post-admission outcomes of participants in the PARAMEDIC trial: A cluster randomised trial of mechanical or manual chest compressions
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The PARAMEDIC cluster randomised trial evaluated the LUCAS mechanical chest compression device, and did not find evidence that use of mechanical chest compression led to an improvement in survival at 30 days. This paper reports patient outcomes from admission to hospital to 12 months after randomisation.
   Methods: Information about hospital length of stay and intensive care management was obtained through linkage with Hospital Episode Statistics and the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre. Patients surviving to hospital discharge were approached to complete questionnaires (SF-12v2, EQ-5D, MMSE, HADS and PTSD-CL) at 90 days and 12 months. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN08233942.
   Results: 377 patients in the LUCAS arm and 658 patients in the manual chest compression were admitted to hospital. Hospital and intensive care length of stay were similar. Long term follow-up assessments were limited by poor response rates (53.7% at 3 months and 55.6% at 12 months). Follow-up rates were lower in those with worse neurological function. Among respondents, long term health related quality of life outcomes and emotional well-being was similar between groups. Cognitive function, measured by MMSE, was marginally lower in the LUCAS arm mean 26.9 (SD 3.7) compared to control mean 28.0 (SD 2.3), adjusted mean difference -1.5 (95% CI -2.6 to -0.4).
   Conclusion: There were no clinically important differences identified in outcomes at long term follow-up between those allocated to the mechanical chest compression compared to those receiving manual chest compression. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Life after cardiac arrest: A very long term follow up
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To describe survival and causes of death after cardiac arrest (CA) and the life situation of very long term survivors.
   Methods: Individuals with successful resuscitation treated at the Sahlgrenska university hospital during 1995-1999 and presented in former CA publications were studied. Survival time and causes of death data were extracted from the individuals who had died's records. Very long term survivors were offered a follow up visit at home. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) used to describe cognitive abilities and EQ-5D to assess quality of life. The life situation was also explored.
   Results: 14 out of 104 possible participants had survived to follow up. The median time to follow up among the 8 who agreed to participation was 17 years. Out of the 8 participants, 4 failed to reach the cut off score of normal cognitive abilities in the MMSE and 7/8 participants did not reach the cut off score for normal cognitive function in the MoCA.
   Overall the participants were content with their life situation and QoL. However, a tendency towards lower scores on the cognitive testing and a lower self-reported QoL was observed. No depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety disorder were found.
   Conclusions: A CA may lead to permanent cognitive impairments and the risk of dementia may be higher because of the injuries sustained during the collapse. However, further studies with more participants are needed to fully determine the risk of cognitive impairment after a CA. Regarding life situation, there was a tendency of lower QoL with lower scores on the cognitive testing. With a new treatment paradigm, there is a need for long term studies regarding this new population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Association between therapeutic hypothermia and long-term quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has increasingly become a part of the current standard of care for treating patients with cardiac arrest (CA). However, little is known regarding the association between TH and long-term quality of life (QoL) in adult survivors of CA. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the association between TH implementation and long-term QoL outcomes in adult survivors of CA following hospital discharge.
   Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and Cochrane databases to identify randomized and observational studies from January 2005 to January 2016 investigating the relationship between TH implementation immediately post-CA and long-term QoL in CA survivors post-hospital discharge.
   Results: We included 9 studies with a total of 801 patients. Six of these were prospective cohort studies, 2 were substudies of randomized controlled trials, and 1 was a retrospective cohort study. Six studies included patients only with out-of-hospital CA while 3 included patients with both in-hospital and out-of-hospital CA. There was marked between-study heterogeneity with respect to study population, TH implementation, and QoL assessment tool. TH was not associated with long-term QoL in this population.
   Conclusions: In this systematic review, the included studies do not suggest any association between TH implementation in CA with long-term QoL in CA survivors. Further larger scale studies are needed to investigate the sustainability of TH effects long term in this patient population. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Quality of Life and Functional Outcomes 12 Months After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant global health problem. There has been considerable investment in improving the emergency medical response to OHCA, with associated improvements in survival. However, concern remains that survivors have a poor quality of life. This study describes the quality of life of OHCA survivors at 1-year postarrest in Victoria, Australia.
   Methods and Results-Adult OHCA patients who arrested between 2010 and 2012 were identified from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry. Paramedics attended 15 113 OHCA patients of which 46.3% received an attempted resuscitation. Nine hundred and twenty-seven (13.2%) survived to hospital discharge of which 76 (8.2%) died within 12 months. Interviews were conducted with 697 (80.7%) patients or proxies, who were followed-up via telephone interview, including the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, the 12-item short form health survey, and the EuroQol. The majority (55.6%) of respondents had a good recovery via the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended >= 7 (41.1% if patients who died postdischarge were included and nonrespondents were assumed to have poor recovery). The mean EuroQol index score for respondents was 0.82 (standard deviation, 0.19), which compared favorably with an adjusted population norm of 0.81 (standard deviation, 0.34). The mean 12-item short form Mental Component Summary score for patients was 53.0 (standard deviation, 10.2), whereas the mean Physical Component Summary score was 46.1 (standard deviation, 11.2).
   Conclusions-This is the largest published study assessing the quality of life of OHCA survivors. It provides good evidence that many survivors have an acceptable quality of life 12 months postarrest, particularly in comparison with population norms.

TI  - Very long-term survivors of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest show considerable impairment of daily life
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Reliable data on long-term outcomes after cardiac arrest (CA) remain scarce. Identifying factors persistently impacting the quality of life after CA is crucial to improve long-term outcomes.
   Methods: Adult in- and out-of-hospital CA patients surviving to hospital discharge between 1996 and 2015 were retrospectively included. We classified survivors in stages of survival time and assessed long-term survival and quality of life by contacting patients via a standardized telephone questionnaire including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
   Results: Of 4,234 patients, 1,573 (37.2%) survived to hospital discharge. Among those, 693(44.1%) were alive at the time of the interview. We obtained interviews in 178 patients at a survival time of 7.8 (4.2-12.6) years. Younger age, female gender, and shorter duration of initial hospitalization and coma were associated with long-term survival. Conversely, higher median age at time of CA predicted poor outcome (mRS >= 3) and impaired quality of daily life. Around 25% declared being impaired in mobility, with female gender and higher age being predictors. Impairment in personal care and hygiene was stated in 11.8%, and activities of daily life such as shopping troubled 33.1%. Chronic pain impairing daily life was reported in 47.2% of cases, and lower socioeconomic status was suggestive of unfavourable outcome.
   Conclusion: Very long-term survivors showed considerable impairment of quality of life in terms of reduced mobility, self-care, or chronic pain. Higher age at time of CA and lower socioeconomic status showed worse outcomes. A more personalized screening of survivors for risk factors and long-term support are suggested.

TI  - Outcomes after ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Expanding the chain of survival
T2  - MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death in the United States, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) the most common initial rhythm when cardiac disease causes arrest. Survival after VF out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) depends on a sequence of events called the chain of survival, which includes rapid access to emergency medical services, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation, and advanced care. Because-of widespread implementation of defibrillation programs, more patients survive VF OHCAs, making subsequent care of these patients important. Early hospitalization must focus on potential neurologic injury and therapy targeted at the underlying cardiac disease and antiarrhythmic therapy for long-term secondary prevention of sudden death. Attention to certain cohorts who are at high risk. despite their underlying disease, such as women and elderly patients, is necessary. These cohorts may have the greatest response to short-term and long-term therapies for cardiac rehabilitation. With these approaches, long-term survival and quality of life after VF OHCA are favorable. Broadening the focus of the chain of survival to include in-hospital and long-term care will further improve favorable outcomes achieved in an early defibrillation program.

TI  - Deterioration in quality of life and long-term mortality among survivors of in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest: A population-based cohort study in South Korea
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: This study investigated the changes in quality of life (QOL) after in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (IHCA) among survivors and examined the association between worsening QOL and 3-year all-cause mortality.Methods: This population-based cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. Adult survivors who experienced IHCA between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, and were alive for over 1 year after IHCA were included. Worsening QOL among IHCA survivors was determined using three criteria: decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability.Results: A total of 22,611 IHCA survivors from 903 hospitals were included in the final analysis, and 7,796 (34.5%) experienced worsening QOL. Specifically, 5,595 (24.7%), 1,694 (7.5%), and 1,617 (7.2%) survivors experienced decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability, respectively. The proportion of brain lesion disability increased from 6.3% to 10.8% after IHCA. In multivariable Cox regression, worsening QOL was not associated with 3-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96, 1.11; P = 0.372). However, among the QOL factors, acquired disability was associated with a 1.29-fold higher risk of 3-year all-cause mortality among IHCA survivors (aHR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.46; P < 0.001).Conclusion: Approximately one-third of IHCA survivors experienced worsening QOL (decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability) at 1-year follow-up after IHCA in South Korea. Although overall worsening of QOL was not associated with 3-year all-cause mortality, acquired disability was associated with increased 3-year all-cause mortality among IHCA survivors.

TI  - Long-term follow-up and quality of life in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background: Since 2019, European guidelines recommend considering extracorporeal life support as salvage strategy for the treatment of acute high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest. However, data on long-term survival, quality of life (QoL) and cardiopulmonary function after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking.
   Methods: One hundred and nineteen patients with acute PE and severe cardiogenic shock or in need of mechanical resuscitation (CPR) received venoarterial or venovenous ECMO from 2007 to 2020. Long-term data were obtained from survivors by phone contact and personal interviews. Follow-up included a QoL analysis using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
   Results: The majority of patients (n = 80, 67%) were placed on ECMO during or after CPR with returned spontaneous circulation. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 45.4% (54/119). Nine patients died during follow-up. At a median follow-up of 54.5 months (25-73; 56 +/- 38 months), 34 patients answered the QoL questionnaire. QoL differed largely and was slightly reduced compared to a German reference population (EQ5D5L index 0.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.04; p < 0.01). 25 patients (73.5%) had no mobility limitations, 22 patients (65%) could handle their activities, while anxiety and depression were expressed by 10 patients (29.4%). Return-to-work status was 33.3% (average working hours: 36.2 +/- 12.5 h/per week), 15 (45.4%) had retired from work early. 12 patients (35.3%) expressed limited exercise tolerance and dyspnea. 59% (20/34) received echocardiography and pulmonary function testing, 50% (17/34) cardiopulmonary exercise testing. No relevant impairment of right ventricular function and an only slightly reduced mean peak oxygen uptake (76.3% predicted) were noted.
   Conclusions: Survivors from severe intractable PE in cardiogenic shock or even under CPR with ECMO seem to recover well with acceptable QoL and only minor cardiopulmonary limitations in the long term. To underline these results, further research with larger study cohorts must be obtained.

TI  - Neurological outcome and general health status of long-term survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Objective For Germany, few data are available on health status and long-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The present study investigates the general health status and long-term neurological outcome 2.5-5 years after the resuscitation attempt, as well as the association between treatment outcome and prehospital patient and treatment factors. Methods All resuscitation attempts performed over a period of 30 months (2011-2013) by the emergency medical services of the city of Bonn were retrospectively analyzed on the basis of treatment records and the German Resuscitation Registry. General health status was recorded following the SF-12 (12-item Short Form Health Survey) and long-term neurological outcome was categorized (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC]). The available data were subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Of a total of 458 patients, 17.9% survived to hospital discharge, 13.8% survived more than 2.5 years, and 7.7% survived to the cutoff date of the survey. Of the surviving patients, 85.3% had a good neurological outcome (CPC <= 2), which was favored by lower age, observed collapse, defibrillation, and absence of vasopressor administration (multivariate analysis). Furthermore, 74.2% of survivors described their health status as good. Interpretation Overall, few patients survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the long term. Long-term survivors rate their health status as good and show a good neurological outcome. This treatment outcome seems to depend on the same parameters as the primary resuscitation success (survival to hospital admission). The further establishment of clinical tools for early prognostication is desirable. For this purpose, further long-term studies of larger patient collectives with access to routine data are necessary.

TI  - RECOVERY, LONG-TERM COGNITIVE OUTCOME AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOLLOWING OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), the functional outcomes of those with rapid early or with very delayed recoveries are known. For patients between those extremes early recovery is variable, and the probability of longer-term recovery and the implications for quality of life have not been clearly defined.
   Methods: Twenty-five patients of a consecutive cohort of OHCA survivors with coma duration between 12 h and 7 days and a matched group with acute coronary syndrome underwent cognitive and disability assessments 3 and 12 months after OHCA. Correlations and regression analyses of demographic, clinical arrest variables, and cognitive tests with quality of life outcomes were performed.
   Results: The OHCA group had impairments in all cognitive domains. There was little cognitive improvement. The OHCA group reported significantly greater health impact and lower quality of life at twelve months than the controls. Longer duration of coma (4-7 versus <= 3 days) and greater cognitive impairment at three months, particularly memory impairment, were both associated with reduced late quality of life.
   Conclusions: These survivors of OHCA had persistent long-term cognitive deficits. Quality of life at one year after OHCA was reduced compared to cardiac controls. Coma duration and memory impairment at three months were harbingers of long term reduced quality of life.

TI  - Long-term follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors: Protocol of the DESAC (Devenir des survivants d'Arrets Cardiaques) study, a French multicentric prospective cohort
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: While the short-term prognosis of cardiac arrest patients -nearly 250,000 new cases per year in Europe -has been extensively studied, less is known regarding the mid and long-term outcome of survivors.Objective: The aim of the DESAC study is to describe mid-and long-term survival rate and functional status of cardiac arrest survivors, and to assess the influence of pre and intra hospital therapeutic strategies on these two outcomes. Methods: Between Jul 2015 and Oct 2018, adult patients over 18 years who were discharged alive from any intensive care units (public and private hospitals) in the Ile-de-France area (Paris and suburbs, France) after a non-traumatic cardiac arrest were screened for participation in this multicen-tric study. Survivors were included after they signed (or the proxies) an informed consent before discharge during initial hospitalisation. We calcu-lated that including 600 patients in total would allow an 80% power to demonstrate a 2 years survival rate difference of 10% between patients who did and those who did not receive therapeutic hypothermia after resuscitation. Pre-and in-hospital data related to the circumstances surrounding the event and to the therapeutic interventions (such as cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation, emergent coronary revascularization, neuroprotec-tive therapeutics) were collected. After discharge, patients were interviewed at 3 months, 6 months and every year thereafter for a minimum follow-up of 26 months and a maximum follow-up of 48 months. Information on vital status, occurrence of cardiovascular events, medications and a comprehensive assessment of the functional status (qualitive of life as assessed by the Short-Form General Health Survey (SF36) scale, activities of daily living (ADL) scale, neurological Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) and Overall Performance Categories (OPC) scales, socio-professional activities) were collected at follow-up interviews.Discussion: The DESAC study should provide important information regarding several dimensions of the mid and long-term prognosis of cardiac arrest survivors and on the benefit (and potentially harm) of early therapeutic strategies.

TI  - The functional status and perceived quality of life in long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background: Limited data exist on how long-term survivors after pre-hospital cardiac arrest lead their lives. This study assessed functional status and perceived quality of life in patients surviving for 15 years after successful resuscitation from witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as a result of ventricular fibrillation.
   Methods: A 15-year follow-up study of 59 1-year survivors after successful pre-hospital resuscitation who were thoroughly evaluated at 3 and 12 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Eleven patients were still alive 15 years later. Ten of them were reached and underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological examination. Cognitive performance was evaluated and compared with individual results 15 years earlier and with an age-matched control group. The cause and time of death of the non-survivors were established.
   Results: All 10 evaluated long-term survivors lived at home and were independent in their activities of daily living. Their mean age was 72 years. In nine patients there was no change in the present neurological status compared with the status at 1 year after resuscitation, and in one patient it had improved. Five patients were cognitively intact. In four patients mild cognitive problems had emerged or slightly progressed. All but one were satisfied with their perceived quality of life. By the time of examination, the mean survival time for the 1-year survivors was 7 years, and the mean age at the time of death was 70 years.
   Conclusion: Once good outcome after cardiac arrest is achieved, it can be maintained for more than 10 years.

AB  - Purpose: Effects of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on patient outcomes during pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remain to be fully elucidated. This study investigated bystander-initiated CPR effects on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival at hospital admission in comparative pediatric population experiencing OHCA. Methods: Multicenter retrospective observational study conducted between January 2015 and December 2023 using the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry (Re<acute accent>AC) data. Pediatric patients (0-17 years) with OHCA were included. Patients who received bystander-initiated CPR were matched with those who did not using propensity score. Primary endpoints were ROSC and survival at hospital admission. Secondary endpoints were survival at D30 and favorable neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC score of 1 or 2). Results: Of 2162 eligible pediatric patients, 1289 (59.6 %) received bystander-initiated CPR. After propensity score matching (n = 645 pairs), bystander-initiated CPR (vs without CPR by a bystander) was associated with improved ROSC (31.2 % vs 23.7 %; adjusted OR [AOR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and survival at hospital admission (28.7 % vs 19.8 %; AOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2). No significant difference was observed for survival at D30 (3.7 % vs 3.9 %; AOR 0.9, 95 % CI 0.5-1.7) or favorable neurological outcomes. Conclusions: In this nationwide French cohort, bystander-initiated CPR in pediatric OHCA was associated with improved ROSC and survival at hospital admission, but not with D30 survival or favorable neurological outcomes. These findings reinforce the importance of promoting bystander CPR, while highlighting the need for additional strategies to improve long-term outcomes in pediatric OHCA.

TI  - Long Term Cognitive Function After Cardiac Arrest: A Mini-Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. With better pre- and inhospital treatment, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as an integrated part of public education and more public-access defibrillators available, OHCA survival has increased over the last decade. There are concerns, after successful resuscitation, of cerebral hypoxia and degrees of potential acquired brain injury with resulting poor cognitive functioning. Cognitive function is not routinely assessed in OHCA survivors, and there is a lack of consensus on screening methods for cognitive changes. This narrative mini-review, explores available evidence on hypoxic brain injury and long-term cognitive function in cardiac arrest survivors and highlights remaining knowledge deficits.

TI  - Long-term outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest: 30-day survival and 1-year follow-up of mortality, anoxic brain damage, nursing home admission and in-home care
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: Long-term functional outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) are scarcely studied. However, survivors are at risk of neurological impairment from anoxic brain damage which could affect quality of life and lead to need of care at home or in a nursing home. Methods: We linked data on ICHAs in Denmark with nationwide registries to report 30-day survival as well as factors associated with survival. Furthermore, among 30-day survivors we reported the one-year cumulative risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission with mortality as the competing risk. Results: In total, 517 patients (27.3%) survived to day 30 out of 1892 eligible patients; 338 (65.9%) were men and median age was 68 (interquartile range 58-76). Lower age, witnessed arrest by health care personnel, monitored arrest and presumed cardiac cause of arrest were associated with 30 day survival. Among 454 30-day survivors without prior anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission, the risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission within the first-year post-arrest was 4.6% (n = 21; 95% CI 2.7-6.6%) with a competing risk of death of 15.6% (n = 71; 95% CI 12.3-19.0%), leaving 79.7% (n = 362) alive without anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission. When adding the risk of need of in-home care among 343 30-day survivors without prior home care needs, 68.8% (n = 236) were alive without any of the composite events one-year post-arrest. Conclusion: The majority of 30-day survivors of IHCA are alive at one-year follow-up without anoxic brain damage, nursing home admission or need of in-home care.

TI  - Effect of vasopressin and methylprednisolone vs. placebo on long-term outcomes in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest a randomized clinical trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The primary results from the Vasopressin and Methylprednisolone for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (VAM-IHCA) trial have previously been reported. The objective of the current manuscript is to report long-term outcomes.
   Methods: The VAM-IHCA trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at ten hospitals in Denmark. Adult patients (age >= 18 years) were eligible for the trial if they had an in-hospital cardiac arrest and received at least one dose of epinephrine during resuscitation. The trial drugs consisted of 40 mg methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol (R), Pfizer) and 20 IU of vasopressin (Empressin (R), Amomed Pharma GmbH) given as soon as possible after the first dose of epinephrine. This manuscript report outcomes at 6 months and 1 year including survival, survival with favorable neurological outcome, and health-related quality of life.
   Results: 501 patients were included in the analysis. At 1 year, 15 patients (6.3%) in the intervention group and 22 patients (8.3%) in the placebo group were alive corresponding to a risk ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.41-1.41). A favorable neurologic outcome at 1 year, based on the Cerebral Performance Category score, was observed in 14 patients (5.9%) in the intervention group and 20 patients (7.6%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.41-1.49]. No differences existed between groups for favorable neurological outcome and health-related quality of life at either 6 months or 1 year.
   Conclusions: Administration of vasopressin and methylprednisolone, compared with placebo, in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest did not improve long-term outcomes in this trial.

TI  - Anxiety and depression among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) may experience psychological distress but the actual prevalence is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate anxiety and depression within a large cohort of OHCA-survivors.
   Methods: OHCA-survivors randomized to targeted temperature of 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C within the Target Temperature Management trial (TTM-trial) attended a follow-up after 6 months that included the questionnaire Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A control group with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) completed the same follow-up. Correlations to variables assumed to be associated with anxiety and depression in OHCA-survivors were tested.
   Results: At follow-up 278 OHCA-survivors and 119 STEMI-controls completed the HADS where 24% of OHCA-survivors (28% in 33 degrees C group/22% in 36 degrees C group, p = 0.83) and 19% of the STEMI-controls reported symptoms of anxiety (OR 1.32; 95% CI (0.78-2.25), p = 0.30). Depressive symptoms were reported by 13% of OHCA-survivors (equal in both intervention groups, p = 0.96) and 8% of STEMI-controls (OR 1.76; 95% CI (0.82-3.79), p = 0.15). Anxiety and depression among OHCA-survivors correlated to Health-Related Quality-of-Life, and subjectively reported cognitive deterioration by patient or observer. In addition, depression was associated with a poor neurological outcome.
   Conclusion: One fourth of OHCA-survivors reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depression at 6 months which was similar to STEMI-controls and previous normative data. Subjective cognitive problems were associated with an increased risk for psychological distress. Since psychological distress affects long-term prognosis of cardiac patients in general it should be addressed during follow-up of survivors with OHCA due to a cardiac cause.

TI  - Long-Term Disabilities of Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest The Hanox Study
T2  - CHEST
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of awakened survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are poorly known.
   RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the month (M) 18 outcomes of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who awakened during the first 2 weeks' post-OHCA and their poor-outcome risk factors?
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All OHCA survivors with a Glasgow Coma Scale score >= 12 during the first 2 weeks' post-OHCA were enrolled in six ICUs and followed up at M3, M6, M12, and M18. The primary outcome measure was Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at M18. Secondary outcome measures included evaluation at M18 of neurologic, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities; health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), anxiety and depression; and poor-outcome risk factors (GOS-E score <= 6).
   RESULTS: Among the 139 included patients, 98 were assessable for the primary outcome measure. At M18, 64 (65%) had full recovery or minor disabilities (GOS-E score > 6), 18 (18%) had moderate disabilities but were autonomous for daily-life activities (GOS-E score = 6), 12 (12%) had poor autonomy (GOS-E score < 6 but > 1), and four had died. Percentages of patients with GOS-E scores > 6 increased significantly over the 18-month study period. At M18, no patients had major neurologic disabilities, 20% had cognitive disabilities, 32% had anxiety symptoms, 25% had depression symptoms, and their HR-QOL was impaired compared with a sex- and age-matched population. Low-flow time, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at admission, coma duration > 3 days after cardiac arrest, and mechanical ventilation on days 3 and 7 were associated with poor functional outcome.
   INTERPRETATION: Among patients who awoke (Glasgow Coma Scale score >= 12) in the 14 days following OHCA, 35% had moderate to severe disabilities or had died at M18. Interestingly, patients improved until M18 post-OHCA. Risk factors associated with poor functional outcome were lowflow time, clinical severity at ICU admission, prolonged coma duration, and mechanical ventilation.

TI  - Long-Term Survival and Quality of Life in Non-Surgical Adult Patients Supported with Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Oxygenation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) for hemodynamic support is on the rise. Not much is known about the impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its complications on long-term survival and quality of life. Methods: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we evaluated the survival and quality of life in patients treated with VA ECMO between May 2009 and July 2019. Follow-up was conducted between November 2019 and January 2020. Results: Overall, 118 patients were evaluated in this study. Of the 37 patients who were alive at hospital discharge, 32 answered the EuroQol-5 dimensional-5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). For patients discharged alive from the hospital, mean survival was 8.1 years, 8.4 years for cardiogenic shock, and 5.0 years for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. EQ-5D-5L index value of ECMO survivors was not significantly different from the general age-matched population. Neurologic complications and major bleeding during index hospitalization limit long-term quality of life. Conclusions: Patients treated with VA ECMO have high in-hospital mortality, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cardio-pulmonary resuscitation patients being at higher risk of early death. However, once discharged from the hospital, most patients remain alive with a reasonable quality of life.

TI  - Long-term outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: Long term outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term (1-year and beyond) survival outcomes, including overall survival and survival with favorable neurological status and the quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes, among patients who survived the initial OHCA event (30 days or till hospital discharge). Methods: Embase, Medline and PubMed were searched for primary studies (randomized controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional studies) which reported the long-term survival outcomes of OHCA patients. Data abstraction and quality assessment was conducted, and survival at predetermined timepoints were assessed via single-arm meta-analyses of proportions, using generalized linear mixed models. Comparative meta-analyses were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratio (RR) estimates, using the DerSimonian and Laird model. Results: 67 studies were included, and among patients that survived to hospital discharge or 30-days, 77.3% (CI = 71.2-82.4), 69.6% (CI = 54.5- 70.3), 62.7% (CI = 54.5-70.3), 46.5% (CI = 32.0-61.6), and 20.8% (CI = 7.8-44.9) survived to 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-and 15-years respectively. Compared to Asia, the probability of 1-year survival was greater in Europe (RR = 2.1, CI = 1.8-2.3), North America (RR = 2.0, CI = 1.7-2.2) and Oceania (RR = 1.9, CI = 1.6-2.1). Males had a higher 1-year survival (RR:1.41, CI = 1.25-1.59), and patients with initial shockable rhythm had improved 1-year (RR = 3.07, CI = 1.78-5.30) and 3-year survival (RR = 1.45, CI = 1.19-1.77). OHCA occurring in residential locations had worse 1-year survival (RR = 0.42, CI = 0.25-0.73). Conclusion: Our study found that up to 20.8% of OHCA patients survived to 15-years, and survival was lower in Asia compared to the other regions. Further analysis on the dierences in survival between the regions are needed to direct future long-term treatment of OHCA patients.

TI  - Impact of Presenting Rhythm on Short- and Long-Term Neurologic Outcome in Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest Treated With Therapeutic Hypothermia
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To compare short- and long-term neurologic outcomes in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia presenting with nonshockable versus shockable initial rhythms.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: Emergency department and ICU of an academic hospital.
   Patients: One hundred twenty-three consecutive post-out-of-hospital cardiac arrest adults (57 nonshockable rhythms, 66 shockable rhythms) treated with therapeutic hypothermia between 2006 and 2012.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Data were collected from electronic health records. Neurologic outcomes were dichotomized by Cerebral Performance Category at discharge and 6- to 12-month follow-up and analyzed via multivariable logistic regressions. Groups were similar, except nonshockable rhythm patients were more likely to have a history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01), be dialysis dependent (p = 0.01), and not have bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = 0.05). At discharge, 3 of 57 patients (5%) with nonshockable rhythm versus 28 of 66 (42%) with shockable rhythm had a favorable outcome (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.3; adjusted odds ratio, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.03-0.4). At follow-up, 4 of 55 patients (7%) versus 29 of 60 (48%) with nonshockable rhythm and shockable rhythm, respectively, had a favorable Cerebral Performance Category (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.3; adjusted odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.09-0.3). Among those surviving hospitalization, favorable neurologic outcome was more likely at long-term follow-up than at hospital discharge for both groups (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.7; adjusted odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4-6.2). No significant interaction between changes in neurologic status over time and presenting rhythm was seen (p = 0.93).
   Conclusions: These data indicate an association between initial nonshockable rhythm and significantly worse short-and long-term outcomes in patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. Among survivors, neurologic status significantly improved over time for all patients and shockable rhythm patients and tended to improve over time for the small number of nonshockable rhythm patients who survived beyond hospitalization. No significant interaction between changes in neurologic status over time and presenting rhythm was seen.

TI  - Sex differences in outcome after ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Previous studies have shown that early defibrillation programs improve survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Reports also suggest that women fare worse than men do after cardiovascular events, but there is no population-based study of sex differences after an OHCA with early defibrillation. We, therefore, compared the short- and long-term survival and quality-of-life (QOL) in women and men after an OHCA.
   Methods: All patients with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) OHCA who received early defibrillation in Olmstead County, Minnesota between November 1990 and December 2000 were included. Using medical records and the cardiac arrest database, the short- and long-term survival and QOL based on a SF-36 survey of each sex were compared. Adjusted QOL scores were obtained by using age- and sex-specific norms from a sample of the general U.S. population; an adjusted score of 50 (normalized mean) was considered normal.
   Results: Thirty-seven female and 163 male patients presented with a VF OHCA and early defibrillation. Survival to hospital admission was significantly better for women than men [30 female survivors to admission (81%), 112 male (69%), p, = 0.04]. Paradoxically, survival to discharge among those admitted was worse for women [13 female survivors to discharge (43%), 66 male (61%), p = 0.04]. The average length of follow-up was 4.8 +/- 3.0 years. The 5-year expected survival was 83% in women and 78% in men (p = 0.48). There was no difference in call-to-shock time (6 +/- 2, 6 +/- 2 min, p = 0.6) or whether the arrest was witnessed (86, 82%, p = 0.64). There was no statistical difference between women and men in age (64 +/- 17, 65 +/- 14 years), ejection fraction (40 +/- 17, 40 +/- 18%), diabetes (17, 29%, p = 0.16), hypertension (23, 28%, p = 0.58) or known CAD (27, 48%, p = 0.06). Adjusted QOL scores were similar between women and men in terms of pain (52 9, 52 10) vitality (47 11, 40 9), general health (49 +/- 9, 44 +/- 7), social function (51 +/- 10, 51 +/- 8), and mental health (50 10, 49 6).
   Conclusion: Women are more likely to survive to hospital admission following an OHCA. However, admitted women less likely to survive their hospital stay. Long-term survival and QOL are equally favorable in both sexes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All fights reserved.

TI  - The impact of therapeutic hypothermia on neurological function and quality of life after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To assess the impact of therapeutic hypothermia on cognitive function and quality of life in comatose survivors of out of Hospital Cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Methods: We prospectively studied comatose survivors of OHCA consecutively admitted in a 4-year period. Therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in the last 2-year period, intervention period (n = 79), and this group was compared to patients admitted the 2 previous years, control period (n = 77). We assessed Cerebral Performance Category (CPC), Survival, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and self-rated quality of life (SF-36) 6 months after OHCA in the Subgroup with VF/VT as initial rhythm.
   Results: CPC in patients alive at hospital discharge was significantly better in the intervention period with a CPC of 1- 2 in 97% vs. 71% in the control period, p = 0.003, corresponding to an adjusted odds ratio of a favourable cerebral outcome of 17, p = 0.01. No significant differences were found in long-term Survival (57% vs. 56% alive at 30 months), MMSE, or SF-36. Therapeutic hypothermia (hazard ratio: 0.15, p = 0.007) and bystander CPR (hazard ratio 0.19, p = 0.002) were significantly related to Survival in the intervention period.
   Conclusion: CPC at discharge from hospital was significantly improved following implementation of therapeutic hypothermia in comatose patients resuscitated from OCHA with VF/VT. However, significant improvement in survival, cognitive status or quality of life could not be detected at long term follow-up. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quality of Life and Mental Health Problems in Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - Highlights What are the main findings? Out of 127 pediatric cardiac arrest (CA) patients with heart disease, 72% survived to hospital discharge, and 22 are receiving follow-up care in an outpatient clinic. Overall quality of life was comparable to healthy peers, but children with longer resuscitation time or multiple resuscitations showed lower scores in physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. A total of 21% of children showed elevated emotional and hyperactivity-related difficulties (based on parent reports), and peer problems (based on self-reports), indicating increased psychological stress. One-third of school-aged survivors attend special needs schools, highlighting potential neurodevelopmental and academic impact. What is the implication of the main finding? While survival and average quality of life appear reassuring, a substantial proportion of survivors face subtle but relevant emotional, behavioral, and academic challenges. These findings underscore the urgent need for long-term follow-up programs with routine neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological screening to support at-risk pediatric cardiac arrest survivors.Highlights What are the main findings?

These findings underscore the urgent need for long-term follow-up programs with routine neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological screening to support at-risk pediatric cardiac arrest survivors.Abstract Background: Current research is paying more attention to neurological outcomes and quality of life after life-threatening events. Children with heart disease are particularly vulnerable, especially after resuscitation events. While newer data show that adults with heart failure and a left-ventricular assist device suffer from a higher incidence of depression, mental health in pediatric heart disease patients is poorly understood. This is the first study in Germany to examine the quality of life and psychological burden in cardiac arrest survivors with congenital or acquired heart disease. Methods: This monocentric study retrospectively analyzed survival outcomes of pediatric heart disease patients who underwent in-hospital resuscitation between 2008 and 2022. The PedsQL and Strength and difficulties questionnaires were prospectively administered to survivors to assess quality of life and emotional/behavioral problems, while academic achievements were additionally documented. Results: Of 127 patients experiencing cardiac arrest, 91 (71.7%) survived to discharge. Most had complex congenital heart diseases; mean cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration was 14 min. Five patients received extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Of the 22 patients who were receiving follow-up care at the pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic at the time of the study, 14 completed questionnaires were received. Overall quality of life was comparable to healthy controls, though those with prolonged or multiple resuscitations showed lower physical, emotional, social, and school functioning scores. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire revealed no pathological scores but elevated average values for hyperactivity and emotional problems in parent reports, and emotional and peer difficulties in self-reports, indicating increased psychological burden. Conclusions: While survival rates are comparable to international data, gaps exist in structured follow-up and neuropsychological care, especially for high-risk subgroups like ECMO survivors. Routine neuropsychological screening and multidisciplinary outpatient programs are essential to improve long-term follow-up care.

TI  - LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT URGENT CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION
T2  - BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objective-To assess long term survival (>5 years) and quality of life in severely ill patients referred for urgent cardiac transplantation.
   Setting-Tertiary referral centres: before transplantation at the National Heart Hospital (late 1984 to end 1986); after transplantation at Harefield Hospital.
   Subjects-Eighteen patients (15 men; three women) who had required intensive support in hospital before cardiac transplantation and were alive at short term follow up.
   Interventions-Intravenous infusions of cardiac drugs (mean 2.2 infusions), intravenous diuretics (17 patients), and many other drugs before transplantation. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (four patients), temporary pacing (two), and rescusitation from cardiac arrest (three). Patients had specialised nursing care on a medical intensive care unit in almost every case.
   Main outcome measures-Long term survival in patients after urgent cardiac transplantation and perceived quality of life.
   Results-Of 18 patients who were alive at short term follow up (mean (range) 19.4 (10-33) months), 14 were still alive in 1992 (69 (61-83) months). Ten still worked full time, and 11 reported no restrictions in their daily activities. Three of four patients who died in the intervening period survived >5 years after transplantation. Overall, 17 of 18 patients survived at least 5 years.
   Conclusions-In severely ill patients who undergo urgent cardiac transplantation and survive in the short term, long term (5-7 year) survival and quality of life seem good.

TI  - Pulseless electrical activity and successful out-of-hospital resuscitation - long-term survival and quality of life: an observational cohort study
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients successfully resuscitated from pre-hospital cardiac arrest with initial pulseless electrical activity (PEA), because the long-term outcome of these patients is unknown. Survival, neurological status one year after cardiac arrest and self-perceived quality of life after five years were assessed.
   Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients resuscitated from PEA between August 2001 and March 2003 in three urban areas in southern Finland. A validated questionnaire was sent to patients while neurological status according to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) -classification was assessed based on medical database notes recorded during follow-up evaluations.
   Results: Out of 99 included patients in whom resuscitation was attempted, 41 (41%) were successfully resuscitated and admitted to hospital. Ten (10%) patients were discharged from hospital. Seven were alive after one year and six after five years following cardiac arrest. Five of the seven patients alive one year after resuscitation presented with the same functional level as prior to cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions: Patients with initial PEA have been considered to have poor prognosis, but in our material, half of those who survived to hospital discharge were still alive after 5 years. Their self-assessed quality of life seems to be good with only mild to moderate impairments in activities of daily life.

TI  - Neurocognitive functioning and health-related quality of life of children after pediatric intensive care admission: a systematic review
T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Objective This study systematically reviewed recent findings on neurocognitive functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children after pediatric intensive care unit admission (PICU). Data sources Electronic databases searched included Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. The search was limited to studies published in the last five years (2015-2019). Study selection Original studies assessing neurocognitive functioning or HRQoL in children who were previously admitted to the PICU were included in this systematic review. Data extraction Of the 3649 identified studies, 299 met the inclusion criteria based on title abstract screening. After full-text screening, 75 articles were included in the qualitative data reviewing: 38 on neurocognitive functioning, 33 on HRQoL, and 4 on both outcomes. Data synthesis Studies examining neurocognitive functioning found overall worse scores for general intellectual functioning, attention, processing speed, memory, and executive functioning. Studies investigating HRQoL found overall worse scores for both physical and psychosocial HRQoL. On the short term (<= 12 months), most studies reported HRQoL impairments, whereas in some long-term studies HRQoL normalized. The effectiveness of the few intervention studies during and after PICU admission on long-term outcomes varied. Conclusions PICU survivors have lower scores for neurocognitive functioning and HRQoL than children from the general population. A structured follow-up program after a PICU admission is needed to identify those children and parents who are at risk. However, more research is needed into testing interventions in randomized controlled trials aiming on preventing or improving impairments in critically ill children during and after PICU admission.

TI  - Serum neurofilament light levels are correlated to long-term neurocognitive outcome measures after cardiac arrest
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - Objective To explore associations between four methods assessing long-term neurocognitive outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and early hypoxic-ischemic neuronal brain injury assessed by the biomarker serum neurofilament light (NFL), and to compare the agreement for the outcome methods. Methods An explorative post-hoc study was conducted on survivor data from the international Target Temperature Management after Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest trial, investigating serum NFL sampled 48/72-hours post-arrest and neurocognitive outcome 6 months post-arrest. Results Among the long-term surviving participants (N = 457), serum NFL (n = 384) was associated to all outcome instruments, also when controlling for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Associations between NFL and the patient-reported Two Simple Questions (TSQ) were however attenuated when adjusting for vitality and mental health. NFL predicted results on the outcome instruments to varying degrees, with an excellent area under the curve for the clinician-report Cerebral Performance Category (CPC 1-2: 0.90). Most participants were classified as CPC 1 (79%). Outcome instrument correlations ranged from small (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]-TSQ) to strong (CPC-MMSE). Conclusions The clinician-reported CPC was mostly related to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, but with a ceiling effect. These results may be useful when selecting methods and instruments for clinical follow-up models.

TI  - A prediction survival model for out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Aims: The aims of this study were to double check old (Resuscitation Predictor Scoring [RPS], Advanced Cardiac Life Support, and Early Prediction Score [EPS]) and form new (Serbian Quality of Life immediately [SR-QOLi], Serbian Quality of Life short-term [SR-QOLs], and Serbian Quality of Life long-term [SR-QOLl]) scores for survival prediction in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OHCPR) in Serbia.
   Methods: A prospective, 2-year, multicentric study was designed. By the means of the Utstein style, OHCPR performed and its outcome were followed. In every patient, immediate (i) (Return of Spontaneus Circulation [ROSC] >20 min), short-term (s) (to hospital discharge), and long-term [1] (1 year upon) survival after the OHCPR, under the application of RPS, ASCLS, and EPS models, was evaluated. We assessed the association between survival rate and individual predictors of OHCPR using RPS, ASCLS, and EPS: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) started (>4 or <4 minutes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest), swallowing activity (present or not), the primary arrest mode (cardiac or respiratory), and initial pupillar photoreaction (present or absent). By the successive-logistic and linear-regression analysis method, the additional model of the type SR-QOL (SR-QOLi, SR-QOLs, and SR-QOLl) was created.
   Results: We found that bystander CPR, witnessed arrest, shockable rhythms, CPR within 4 minutes, pupillar photoreaction, and primary cardiac arrest mode were associated with improved survival. Cumulative survival upon OHCPR was 12.7% for immediate, 11.3% before patient's discharge, and 10% after 12 months. Applied on our sample, standard scores displayed satisfactory (RPS) and good (Advanced Cardiac Life Support and EPS) degree of survival prediction in OHCPR. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, SR-QOLi (ROC = 0.833) and SR-QOLs (ROC = 0.882) were defined as a good models and SR-QOLl (ROC = 0.913) was defined as an excellent model for prediction of outpatient CPR outcomes.
   Conclusion: In the course of the research, SR-QOL models were created for prediction of the immediate (SR-QOLi), short-term (SR-QOLs), and long-term (SR-QOLl) survival after the OHCPR, better predictions in our environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Life years saved, standardised mortality rates and causes of death after hospital discharge in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) accounts for many unexpected deaths in Europe and the survival rates in different regions vary considerably. We have previously reported excellent survival to discharge rates in the Stavanger region. We now describe the long-term outcome of OHCA victims in our region.
   Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we followed all OHCA hospital discharge survivors between 01.07.2002 and 30.06.2011 (n = 213) for a minimum of 1 year and up to 10 years. Based on the national death statistics stratified for gender and age, we could calculate the potential life years saved, standardised mortality rates (SMR) and delineate the causes of death after hospital discharge.
   Results: Of the 213 patients who were discharged from the hospital, 91% had a cardiac origin of their OHCA. The mean potential life years saved per patient was 22.8 years. The observed five-year survival rate was 76%. The overall SMR in our study cohort was 2.3 when compared to the age-and gender-matched population. Cardiac disease was a prominent cause of late deaths, with the specific SMR for cardiac disease-related deaths being as high as 42 in males and 140 in females.
   Conclusion: Resuscitation of OHCA victims lead to a significant long-term benefit with respect to life years saved. Cardiac disease was the main cause of death after hospital discharge. More studies are needed to identify the potential of therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation efforts that may further enhance the long-term outcomes in OHCA hospital discharge survivors.

TI  - The outcome of in- and out-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest in the older population: a scoping review
T2  - EUROPEAN GERIATRIC MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose We aimed to collect the available evidence on outcome regarding survival and quality of life after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following both in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the older population. Methods A scoping review was performed studying published reviews after 2008, focusing on outcome of CPR in patients aged >= 70 years following IHCA and OHCA. In addition, 11 (IHCA) and 19 (OHCA) eligible studies published after the 2 included reviews were analyzed regarding: return of spontaneous circulation, survival until hospital discharge, long-term survival, neurological outcome, discharge location or other measurements for quality of life (QoL). Results The survival until hospital discharge ranged between 11.6 and 28.5% for IHCA and 0-11.1% for OHCA, and declined with increasing age. The same trend was seen regarding 1-year survival rates with 5.7-25.0% and 0-10% following IHCA and OHCA, respectively. A good neurological outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2 was found in 11.5-23.6% (IHCA) and up to 10.5% (OHCA) of all patients. However, the proportion of CPC 1-2 among patients surviving until hospital discharge was 82-93% (IHCA) and 77-91.6% (OHCA). Few studies included other QoL measures as an outcome variable. Other risk factors aside from age were identified, including nursing home residency, comorbidity, non-shockable rhythm, non-witnessed arrest. The level of frailty was not studied as a predictor of arrest outcome in the included studies. Conclusions Hospital survival rates following IHCA and OHCA in the older population improved in the recent decade, though do not exceed 28.5% and 11.1%, respectively. The effect of age on outcome remains controversial and age should not be used as the sole decision criterium whether to initiate CPR. Future research should study frailty and resilience as an independent predictor regardless of age, and add broader, extensive QoL measures as outcome variables.

TI  - Survival and quality of life after extracorporeal life support for refractory cardiac arrest: A case series
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objectives: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is an emerging option to treat selected patients with cardiac arrest refractory to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Our primary objective was to determine the mortality at 30 days and at hospital discharge among adult patients receiving veno-arterial ECLS for refractory cardiac arrest. Our secondary objectives were to determine the 1-year survival and the health-related quality of life, and to examine factors associated with 30-day mortality.
   Methods: In a retrospective, single-center investigation within a tertiary referral center, we analyzed the prospectively collected data of 49 patients rescued from refractory cardiac arrest through emergent implantation of ECLS (E-CPR) (18.1% of our overall ECLS activity, 2005-2013), implanted in-hospital and during ongoing external cardiac massage in all cases. A prospective follow-up with administration of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire was performed.
   Results: The mean age was 47.6 +/- 1.6 years; out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurred in 12% of cases; average low-flow time was 47.2 +/- 33 minutes; causes of cardiac arrest were heart disease (61.2%), trauma (14.3%), respiratory disease (4.1%), sepsis (2%), and miscellaneous (18.4%). Primary objective: Rates of survival at E-CPR explantation and at 30 days were 42.9% and 36.7%, respectively; brain death occurred in 24.5% of cases. Secondary objectives: Increased simplified acute physiology score; higher serum lactate levels and lower body temperature at the time of implantation were associated with 30-day mortality. Bridge to heart transplantation or implantation of a long-term ventricular assist device was performed in 8.2%. No deaths occurred during the follow-up after discharge (36.7% survival; average follow-up was 15.6 +/- 19.2 months). The average Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores (SF-36 questionnaire) were, respectively, 45.2 +/- 6.8 and 48.3 +/- 7.7 among survivors.
   Conclusions: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a viable treatment for selected patients with cardiac arrest refractory to CPR. In our series, approximately one third of rescued patients were alive at 6 months and presented quality-of-life scores comparable to those previously observed in patients treated with ECLS.

TI  - Long-term trends in the epidemiology of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest precipitated by suspected drug overdose
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Little is known about the long-term trends in the incidence and outcomes of drug overdose out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA).
   Method: Between 2000 and 2017, we retrospectively reviewed drug overdose OHCAs from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry. Incidence was assessed using linear regression, and the baseline characteristics and survival outcomes were assessed using nonparametric test for trend. Arrest factors associated with survival to hospital discharge were assessed using logistic regression. The 12-month functional recovery and health related quality of life for survivors was summarised using descriptive statistics.
   Results: The incidence of emergency medical services (EMS)-attended and EMS-treated cases was 5.8 and 2.0 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, with no significant changes in trend over time. Return of spontaneous circulation increased from 23% to 34% (p for trend = 0.001), event survival increased from 23% to 30% (p for trend = 0.007), and survival to hospital discharge increased from 4% to 13% (p for trend = 0.03). Age, arrest witnessed by bystander or EMS, initial shockable rhythm or pulseless electrical activity, intubation, epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate administration were independently associated with survival. The adjusted-temporal trend for survival was not significant (per year increase; OR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.07; p = 0.244). Of the 12-month survivors, 50% of the responders reported good functional recovery, and few reported severe problems with mobility, self-care, daily activity, pain, and anxiety/depression.
   Conclusion: Although the incidence of drug overdose OHCA remained unchanged between 2000 and 2017, the rates of survival have significantly improved.

TI  - Improving Outcomes from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Young Children and Adolescents
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an unusual but devastating occurrence in a young person. Years of life-lost are substantial and long-term health care costs of survivors can be high. However, there have been noteworthy improvements in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) standards, out-of hospital care, and postcardiac arrest therapies that have resulted in a several-fold improvement in resuscitation outcomes. Recent interest and research in resuscitation of children has the promise of generating improvements in the outcomes of these patients. Integrated and coordinated care in the out-of-hospital and hospital settings are required. This article will review the epidemiology of OHCA, the 2010 CPR guidelines, and developments in public access defibrillation for children.

TI  - SURVIVAL AFTER SUDDEN CARDIAC-ARREST IN HOSPITAL
T2  - JAPANESE HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Although there are many reports on sudden cardiac arrest occurring outside the hospital, little is known about the precise prognostic factors that determine the outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Clinical information before and immediately after sudden cardiac arrest is frequently incomplete because the event occurs outside the hospital. We studied 90 consecutive patients with sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest who were resuscitated in the general ward of our hospital. Twenty-five (28%) were discharged from the hospital. Multivariate analysis revealed that the promptness of initiation of CPR, age, severity of cardiac dysfunction, time and the type of arrhythmia are of significance in relation to survival. To evaluate long-term survival after hospital cardiac arrest, we analyzed long-term follow-up data accumulated during a 16 year period. In the group of 25 patients in our study, there have been a total of 10 deaths (40%). Five of the 10 deaths resulted from recurrent cardiac arrest and 1 was a noncardiac death. There was a high rate of recurrence of cardiac arrest in the first year following resuscitation, especially among the cardiomyopathy patients.

TI  - Evaluation of interventions in prehospital and in- hospital settings and outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients meeting the termination of resuscitation rule in Japan: A nationwide database study (The JAAM-OHCA Registry)
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health burden with low survival rates. The termination of resuscitation (TOR) rule, widely adopted internationally, aims to preserve dignity, optimize resources, and protect healthcare providers. However, prehospital TOR is not implemented in Japan, presenting legal and practical challenges. This study analyzes temporal trends in prehospital and in-hospital interventions for OHCA patients with poor predicted outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (JAAM-OHCA) registry (June 2014-December 2021). Adult OHCA patients with medical causes were included if they fulfilled all the advanced life support (ALS) TOR rule criteria: unwitnessed arrest, no return of spontaneous circulation, no bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and no automated external defibrillator use or defibrillation. Prehospital and in-hospital interventions were evaluated. Results: Among 11,334 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 2,447 received all three ALS interventions (advanced airway management, intravenous access, and epinephrine administration). Over time, in-hospital interventions, including endotracheal intubation (56%) and epinephrine administration (82%), decreased, while advanced therapies, including coronary angiography, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and targeted temperature management, remained rare (<1%). The median time to TOR after hospital arrival shortened to 18 min. In contrast, prehospital epinephrine administration increased, while advanced airway management and intravenous access decreased. Conclusions: OHCA patients who met TOR rule showed a decrease in in-hospital interventions. Further efforts are warranted to avoid futile medical treatments and promote patient-centered care.

TI  - Functional outcomes and quality of life of young adults who survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background Evaluating the quality of life of young adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is important as they are likely to have a longer life expectancy than older patients. The aim of this study was to assess their functional and quality of life outcomes.
   Methodology The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry records were used to identify survivors of OHCA that occurred between 2003 and 2008 in the 18-39 year-old age group. Survivors were administered a telephone questionnaire using Short Form (SF-12), EQ-5D and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ascertained at hospital discharge from the medical record was recorded for the uncontactable survivors.
   Results Of the 106 young adult survivors, five died in the intervening years and 45 were not contactable or refused. CPC scores were obtained for 37 (74%) of those who did not take part in telephone follow-up, and 7 (19%) of these had a CPC >= 3 indicating severe cerebral disability. The median follow-up time was 5 years (range 2.7- 8.6 years) for the 56 (53%) patients included. Of these, 84% were living at home independently, 68% had returned to work, and only 11% reported marked or severe disability. The majority of patients had no problems with mobility (75%), personal care (75%), usual activities (66%) or pain/discomfort (71%). However, 61% of respondents reported either moderate (48%) or severe (13%) anxiety.
   Conclusions The majority of survivors have good functional and quality of life outcomes. Telephone follow-up is feasible in the young adult survivors of cardiac arrest; loss to follow-up is common.

TI  - Long-term outcome of bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Estonia from 1999 to 2002
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To assess the long-term outcome of bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims in Estonia by using the survival rate and quality of life assay.
   Methods: All resuscitation attempts made from 01.01.1999 to 31.12.2002 in Estonia were retrospectively screened for bystander-witnessed adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of cardiac origin. The patients who survived hospital discharge were included in the Study. Their long-term survival data were retrieved from Estonian Population Registry on March 15, 2004. Quality of life was assessed by RAND-36 questionnaire. Comparisons were made with population norms, and patients suffering from myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.
   Results: 854 bystander-witnessed resuscitation attempts were made in four years. 91 patients (10.7%) survived to hospital discharge. Their one-year survival rate was 77.0% and five-year survival rate 64.3%. 44 patients responded to quality of life questionnaire, sent 16-62 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (response rate 77.2%). Respondents rated their quality of life significantly worse than general population in five out of eight categories. The out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with known cardiovascular disease in history (n = 30) had quality of life similar to patients suffering from myocardial infarction or angina pectoris who had not required resuscitation.
   Conclusion: In Estonia majority of bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims who survive hospital discharge are alive one and also more than three years after resuscitation. Their quality of life is worse than that of general population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Physical, psychological, cognitive, social health outcomes, and health-related quality of life in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors and co-survivors: 3-month outcomes from the Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS)
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Survivors and co-survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) experience disruptions in returning to normality. There is limited understanding of OHCA-related sequelae and their impact on co-survivors. This study describes the 3-month post-discharge health outcomes among OHCA survivors and co-survivors in the Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS). Methods: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study, enrolling subjects from 1 February 2023 to 30 November 2024. Physical, psychological, cognitive, and social health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and caregiver burden were described separately for survivors and co-survivors. HRQoL of survivors and co-survivors was compared againstage-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted Singapore population norm for EQ-5D-5L. Results: 62 survivors and 36 co-survivors completed 3-month assessments. 9.7 %, 6.5 %, 3.6 % of survivors screened positive for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Survivors experienced mild cognitive impairment (43.1 %), impaired mobility (41.1 %), and weak muscle strength (39.7 %). Functional independence was high, and 73.9 % of survivors returned to employment. Survivors' HRQoL was lower compared to the general population (0.90 vs. 0.96). Co-survivors reported experiencing caregiving burden (41.7 %), with 22.2 %, 11.1 % and 6.1 % screening positive for anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. Co-survivors' HRQoL was comparable to the general population (0.94 vs. 0.94). Conclusion: A significant subset of OHCA survivors experienced limitations in physical and cognitive functioning and return to work, and lower HRQoL. Psychological distress and caregiving burden were high among co-survivors. Our findings underscore the importance of systematic assessments of multi-dimensional aspects of health and referral to multi-component rehabilitation for both survivors and co-survivors.

TI  - Long-term health-related quality of life of adult patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): An integrative review
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a rescue treatment for patients with severe pulmonary and/or cardiac dysfunction, is increasingly being used worldwide. A better understanding of long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is needed. Objective: To synthesize research on long-term (at least 6 months post-ECMO) HRQOL of adults treated with ECMO. Methods: In this integrative review, we searched 3 electronic databases and did a hand search of relevant journals for articles published 2000-2019, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Thirty-one studies, representing 913 patients treated with ECMO, were included. Long-term HRQOL was slightly better for patients treated with veno-venous ECMO than veno-arterial ECMO, and mental health outcomes tended to be better than physical ones. Survivors frequently experienced physical complications, functional limitations, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, although improvements were observed over time. Conclusions: Early identification and management of physical and mental health problems may improve HRQOL outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Survival and Long-Term Functional Outcomes for Children With Cardiac Arrest Treated With Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To identify patient-and disease-related factors related to survival and favorable outcomes for children who underwent extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation after a refractory cardiac arrest.
   Design: Retrospective observational study with prospective assessment of long-term functional outcome.
   Patients: Fifty-six consecutive children undergoing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation at our institution from 2007 to 2015. Median age at arrest was 3.5 months (interquartile range, 1-53).
   Setting: Tertiary pediatric university hospital with a referral heart center.
   Interventions: Health-related quality of life and family functioning assessment with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and the McMaster Family Assessment Device.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-eight consecutive extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation episodes were included, with 46 (79.3%) related to primary cardiac conditions. Initial cannulation site was central in 19 (32.8%) and peripheral in 39 (67.2%). Survival to decannulation was 77.6% with survival at hospital discharge and at the end of the follow-up period being 65.5% and 62.1%, respectively. Time to follow-up was 38 months (interquartile range, 19-52). Patients who survived tended to be younger (3.5 mo [1 mo to 2 yr] vs 7 mo [1.25 mo to 17 yr]; p = 0.3) with decreased extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation times (28 min [15-47 min] vs 37.5 min [28.5-55 min]; p = 0.04). Those who received therapeutic hypothermia tended to have higher hospital survival (21/28 [75%] vs 16/29 [55%]; p = 0.08). Follow-up assessments of survivors demonstrated good quality of life and family functioning (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 84 [76-89.5]; McMaster Family Assessment Device, 1.62 [1.33-1.83]).
   Conclusions: In this series, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was associated with relatively high survival rates and a good health-related quality of life and family functioning. Larger series are needed to assess whether this technique should be more broadly available in the pediatric critical care community.

TI  - Early defibrillation and circulatory support can provide better long-term outcomes through favorable neurological recovery in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac origin
T2  - CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background Early defibrillation and cardiopulmonary bypass have been postulated to be a promising intervention against out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA); however, little is known about the long-term prognosis. The effects of early recovery of circulation (ROC) on neurological recovery and the long-term outcome in patients with OHCA were examined.
   Methods and Results Functional recovery and long-term (22.0 +/- 15.3 months) outcome were examined in 100 patients with definite diagnosis of OHCA. Spontaneous circulation recovered in 79% of the patients (using onsite counter shock in 20% of the patients). Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 38 of the OHCA patients. The total survival and favorable neurological recovery rates were 40% and 25%, respectively. The patients with favorable recovery obtained early ROC (28.2 +/- 16.0 min). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that a period of less than 35 min for ROC was the optimal period for achieving a favorable recovery, with sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 73%. The patients with a prior history of heart failure or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction exhibited more frequent, exacerbated heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias.
   Conclusions Early ROC using on-site counter shock or cardiopulmonary bypass might result in better longterm outcome in patients with OHCA of cardiac origin.

TI  - Surviving cardiac arrest-what do we know about recovery & survivorship?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review There has been increasing interest in examining how cardiac arrest survivors and their families experience life after sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Understanding their experiences provides a basis to study tools and interventions to improve short- and long-term recovery and rehabilitation. Recent findings Qualitative interview and survey-style studies explored the lived experience of SCA survivors and revealed common themes (e.g., need for recovery expectations and long-term follow-up resources). A heightened awareness for the unique needs of family and loved ones of survivors led to qualitative studies focusing on these members as well. Methodology papers published portend prospective assessment and follow-up cohort studies. However, no investigations evaluating discharge processes or specific interventions directed at domain impairments common after SCA were identified in the review period. International work continues to identify patient and family-centered priorities for outcome measurement and research. In line with increased recognition of the importance for recovery and rehabilitation after SCA, there has been a commensurate increase in investigations documenting the needs of survivors and families surviving SCA. Pediatric and underserved populations continue to be understudied with regards to recovery after SCA.

TI  - Long-term survival and quality of life after cardiac resuscitation following coronary artery bypass grafting
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
CP  - 24th Annual Meeting of the European-Association-for-Cardio-Thoracic-Surgery
AB  - Objective: Follow-up studies of patients surviving emergency resternotomy, open cardiac massage, and additional emergency cardiac surgery following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain sparse and studies focusing on health-related quality of life are lacking. Our aim was to elucidate the long-term course of patients experiencing this hazardous complication. Methods: Between 1988 and 1999, 76 patients suffered sudden hemodynamic collapse following isolated CABG. All patients underwent emergency resternotomy and open cardiac massage. An emergency cardiac reoperation was performed in the 62 (82%) primary survivors. Additional 76 patients were pair-matched to the study patients on the basis of their preoperative characteristics and served as controls. Of the study patients, 41 (54%), and of the controls, 76, (100%) were discharged. In December 2009, all patients were traced with respect to mortality data and the health-related quality of life of living patients was studied using the RAND-36 Item Health Survey questionnaire. Results: Altogether 19 (73%) of the 26 study patients, and 38 (84%) of the 45 controls were available. After exclusion of the early deaths, the life expectancy was similar between the groups: neither overall (p = 0.60) nor cardiac (p = 0.64) survival differed significantly after a mean follow-up time of 15.1 +/- 3.5 years. In addition, cardiac re-interventions were equally frequently required in both the groups. The RAND-36 scores were congruent (p = ns) between the groups and the age- and sex-matched national reference population in the health-related quality-of-life dimensions describing physical, mental, and social domains. Conclusions: Patients who have survived severe hemodynamic collapse, open cardiac massage, and emergency cardiac reoperation following CABG achieve similar long-term prognosis in terms of survival and cardiac interventions as the pair-matched control patients. In addition, 15 years postoperatively, they have a good health-related quality of life, similar to that of an age- and sex-matched national reference population.

TI  - Long-term subjective memory function in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors resuscitated by early defibrillation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Brain injury after a cardiac arrest remains a major cause of morbidity. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have yielded improved survival of patients after hospital discharge following ventricular fibrillation (VF) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early defibrillation that promptly restores a circulating rhythm should decrease the hypoxic period and subsequent organ injury. Therefore this study was designed to determine if long-term memory complaints persist in VF OHCA survivors resuscitated in an early defibrillation program when compared with a healthy control population not experiencing cardiac arrest. Methods: All patients with an OHCA between November 1990 and January 2001 who received defibrillation by emergency medical services personnel in Olmsted County, MN, USA, were included. The memory function questionnaire (MFQ), a 64-item, 7-point Likert-scaled instrument to evaluate the perception of everyday memory functioning was sent to all survivors. The MFQ comprises four scales: general frequency of forgetting (rates general forgetting), retrospective functioning (compares current memory with past ability), seriousness of forgetting (rates how memory impairment impacts daily life), and mnemonics usage (measures adaptation). The MFQ is scaled so that high scores reflect less severe memory complaints. The comparison population comprised members of the Mayo Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) cohort. Quality of life was ascertained with a short form (SF)-36 survey. Results: Seventy-nine of the 200 VF OHCA patients (40%) were discharged. Twenty-two patients have died since dismissal, with an overall average length of follow-up of 4.9 +/- 3.0 years. Thirty-eight (67%) of the survivors completed the MFQ. Compared with the normal. there was a significant decrease in the general frequency of forgetting score of 144.2 +/- 37.4 versus 168.1 +/- 27.3 (P < 0.001) and the seriousness of forgetting score of 84.8 +/- 26.7 versus 95.2 +/- 19.7 (P = 0.004). The retrospective function-scale scores were not significantly different (18.4 +/- 6.8 versus 18.7 +/- 5.0 (P = 0.74)). Younger patients (lesser than 65 years of age) reported an increase in general forgetting and the seriousness of forgetting compared with older survivors. A comparison with SF-36 scores suggested an association between general forgetting and decreased vitality (P = 0.03) and the seriousness of forgetting with a decreased general health (P = 0.005), mental health (P = 0.009), physical functioning (P = 0.02), and vitality (P = 0.05). Conclusion: In a cohort of VF OHCA patients, survivors report more memory complaints in comparison with a general healthy older population. There were more long-term-memory complaints in younger patients. Patients with higher long-term quality-of-life score have fewer memory complaints. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term prognosis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: In this study we aimed to report survival beyond 6 months, including quality of life, for patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with a physician-based EMS in an urban area.
   Methods: We collected data related to OHCA prospectively during a 2-year period. Long-term survival was determined by cross-referencing our database with two Danish national registries. Patients older than 18 years who had survived for more than 6 months after OHCA were contacted, and after informed written consent was obtained, an interview was conducted in their home and a questionnaire on quality of life (SF-36) and the mini mental state examination (MMSE) were administered.
   Results: We had data on 984 cases of OHCA. In 512 cases CPR was attempted and at 6 months, a total of 63 patients were alive corresponding to 12.3% [95% Cl: 9.7-15.5%] of all who were treated. Of the 33 patients examined, the median MMSE was 29 (16-30) and two patients, corresponding to 6%, [95% Cl: 0.7-20.6%] had an MMSE below 24. Two out of eight aspects of the SF-36 were significantly worse than national norms at the same age, but none of the summary scores differed significantly.
   Conclusion: Survival beyond 6 months was found in 12.3% OHCA in a physician-based EMS. Summary scores of quality of life were not significantly different from the national norm but 2 out of 8 subscores were tower. Signs of dementia were uncommon as only 6% had an MMSE score below 24.

TI  - Long term outcomes of participants in the PARAMEDIC2 randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: We recently reported early outcomes in patients enrolled in a randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the PARAMEDIC2 (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial. The purpose of the present paper is to report long-term survival, quality of life, functional and cognitive outcomes at 3, 6 and 12-months.
   Methods: PARAMEDIC2 was a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with an economic evaluation. Patients were randomised to either adrenaline or placebo. This paper reports results on the modified Rankin Scale scores at 6-months, survival at 6 and 12-months, as well as other cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes collected at 3 and 6 months (Two Simple Questions, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline Evaluation for Cardiac Arrest, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, Short-Form 12-item Health Survey and the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L).
   Results: 8014 patients were randomised with confirmed trial drug administration. At 6-months, 78 (2.0%) of the patients in the adrenaline group and 58 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo group had a favourable neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.97]). 117 (2.9%) patients were alive at 6-months in the adrenaline group compared with 86 (2.2%) in the placebo group (1.43 [1.05, 1.96], reducing to 107 (2.7%) and 80 (2.0%) respectively at 12-months (1.38 [1.00, 1.92]). Measures of 3 and 6-month cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes were reduced, but there was no strong evidence of differences between groups.
   Conclusion: Adrenaline improved survival through to 12-months follow-up. The study did not find evidence of improvements in favourable neurological outcomes.

TI  - The prevalence of anxiety and depression in cardiac arrest survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety and depression in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors.Methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on observational studies in adult cardiac arrest survivors with psychiatric disorders from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. In the meta-analysis, we combined the prevalence quantitatively and analyzed the subgroup based on the classification indexes.Results: We identified 32 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Regarding anxiety,the pooled prevalence was 24% (95% CI, 17-31%) and 22% (95% CI, 13-26%) in short-term and long-term respectively. The subgroup analysis showed that the pooled incidence in in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) survivors was 14.0% (95%CI, 9.0-20.0%) and 28.0% (95%CI, 20.0-36.0%) for short-term anxiety.The incidence of anxiety measured by, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale(HAM-A) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was higher than other tools(P < 0.01). Regarding depression,the data analysis showed that the pooled incidence of short-term and long-term depression was 19% (95% CI, 13-26%) and 19% (95% CI, 16-25%), respectively. The subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of short-term and long-term depression was 8% (95% CI, 1-19%) and 30% (95% CI, 5-64%) for IHCA survivors, and was 18% (95% CI, 11-26%) and 17% (95% CI, 11-25%) for OHCA survivors. The incidence of depression measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Symptom check list-90(SCL-90) was higher than other assessment tools(P < 0.01).Conclusions: The meta-analysis indicated a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in CA survivors, and those symptoms persisted 1 year or more after CA. Evaluation tool is an important factor affecting the measurement results.

TI  - Health status and psychological distress among in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors in relation to gender
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To describe health status and psychological distress among in -hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors in relation to gender.
   Methods: This national register study consists of data from follow-up registration of IHCA survivors 3-6 months post cardiac arrest (CA) in Sweden. A questionnaire was sent to the survivors, including measurements of health status (EQ-5D-5L) and psychological distress (HADS).
   Results: Between 2013 and 2015, 594 IHCA survivors were included in the study. The median values for EQ-5D-5L index and EQVAS among survivors were 0.78 (ql-q3 = 0.67-0.86) and 70 (ql -q3 = 50-80) respectively. The values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in women compared to men. In addition, women reported more problems than men in all dimensions of EQ-5D-5L, except self -care. A majority of the respondents reported no problems with anxiety (85.4%) and/or symptoms of depression (87.0%). Women reported significantly more problems with anxiety (p < 0.001) and symptoms of depression (p < 0.001) compared to men. Gender was significantly associated with poorer health status and more psychological distress. No interaction effects for gender and age were found.
   Conclusions: Although the majority of survivors reported acceptable health status and no psychological distress, a substantial proportion reported severe problems. Women reported worse health status and more psychological distress compared to men. Therefore, a higher proportion of women may be in need of support. Health care professionals should make efforts to identify health problems among survivors and offer individualised support when needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying Important Gaps in Randomized Controlled Trials of Adult Cardiac Arrest Treatments A Systematic Review of the Published Literature
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
AB  - Background-Cardiac arrest is a major public health concern worldwide. The extent and types of randomized controlled trials (RCT)-our most reliable source of clinical evidence-conducted in these high-risk patients over recent years are largely unknown.
   Methods and Results-We performed a systematic review, identifying all RCTs published in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 1995 to 2014 that focused on the acute treatment of nontraumatic cardiac arrest in adults. We then extracted data on the setting of study populations, types and timing of interventions studied, risk of bias, outcomes reported, and how these factors have changed over time. Over this 20-year period, 92 RCTs were published containing 64 309 patients (median, 225.5 per trial). Of these, 81 RCTs (88.0%) involved out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whereas 4 (4.3%) involved in-hospital cardiac arrest and 7 (7.6%) included both. Eighteen RCTs (19.6%) were performed in the United States, 68 (73.9%) were performed outside the United States, and 6 (6.5%) were performed in both settings. Thirty-eight RCTs (41.3%) evaluated drug therapy, 39 (42.4%) evaluated device therapy, and 15 (16.3%) evaluated protocol improvements. Seventy-four RCTs (80.4%) examined interventions during the cardiac arrest, 15 (16.3%) examined post cardiac arrest treatment, and 3 (3.3%) studied both. Overall, reporting of the risk of bias was limited. The most common outcome reported was return of spontaneous circulation: 86 (93.5%) with only 22 (23.9%) reporting survival beyond 6 months. Fifty-three RCTs (57.6%) reported global ordinal outcomes, whereas 15 (16.3%) reported quality-of-life. RCTs in the past 5 years were more likely to be focused on protocol improvements and postcardiac arrest care.
   Conclusions-Important gaps in RCTs of cardiac arrest treatments exist, especially those examining in-hospital cardiac arrest, protocol improvement, postcardiac arrest care, and long-term or quality-of-life outcomes.

TI  - In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA): survival status and its determinants in Malaysian public healthcare
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains a significant clinical challenge despite advances in resuscitation and critical care. Enhanced inpatient monitoring and post-IHCA management have improved survival rates and better neurological outcomes at discharge. This study aims to evaluate the IHCA survival rate and analyse key determinants influencing survival status. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using retrospective secondary data from a northern referral tertiary public hospital's cardiac arrest registry, encompassing IHCA cases in patients aged 18 and above between February 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. The data included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, IHCA event timing, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival status, and post-arrest neurological outcomes. Patient survival was measured from the initiation of resuscitation to discharge or death, with survival analysis performed. Factors associated with IHCA survival were explored using logistic regression. Results: A total of 934 IHCA cases were analyzed. The mean patient age was 60.8 years, with most being male (63.9%) and of Chinese ethnicity (45.5%). IHCA commonly occurred in non-critical care areas (61.0%), with 79.6% admitted for medical conditions. Successful ROSC was achieved in 43.5% of cases, and 8.2% had a shockable first rhythm. Only 6.4% survived to discharge or 30-day, with 45% having good neurological outcomes. Conclusion: The IHCA survival rate remains low despite advances in resuscitation. Key survival factors include arrest location, shockable rhythms, and CPR-adrenaline dosage ratio. Strengthening early recognition, prompt intervention, and optimized post-arrest care may enhance IHCA outcomes, particularly in non-critical care areas.

TI  - Systematic review of quality of life and other patient-centred outcomes after cardiac arrest survival
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: In cardiac arrest patients (in hospital and pre hospital) does resuscitation produce a good Quality of Life (QoL) for survivors after discharge from the hospital?
   Methods: Embase, Medline, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Academic Search Premier, the Central Database of Controlled Trials and the American Heart Association (AHA) Resuscitation End-note Library were searched using the terms ('Cardiac Arrest' (Mesh) OR 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation' (Mesh) OR 'Heart Arrest' (Mesh)) AND ('Outcomes' OR 'Quality of Life' OR 'Depression' OR 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder' OR 'Anxiety OR 'Cognitive Function' OR 'Participation' OR 'Social Function' OR 'Health Utilities Index' OR 'SF-36' OR 'EQ-5D' as text term.
   Results: There were 9 inception (prospective) cohort studies (LOE P1), 3 follow up of untreated control groups in randomised control trials (LOE P2), 11 retrospective cohort studies (LOE P3) and 47 case series (LOE P4).46 of the studies were supportive with respect to the search question, 17 neutral and 7 negative.
   Discussion: The majority of studies concluded that QoL after cardiac arrest is good. This review demonstrated a remarkable heterogeneity of methodology amongst studies assessing QoL in cardiac arrest survivors. There is a requirement for consensus development with regard to quality of life and patient centred outcome assessment in this population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Community-based automated external defibrillator only resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Speed is the cornerstone of rescue for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. As a consequence, community participation programs have been initiated to decrease response times. Even in the very best of these programs, however, short-term survival rates hover around 10% and long-term survival rates are half that. In most locales, survival is far worse. In Piacenza, Italy, responders have been trained for more than a decade to use publicly available automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and eschew the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is known locally as "Progetto Vita."
   Methods From 2001 to 2014, we prospectively collected outcome data on all Progetto Vita-treated patients and all 3271 standard emergency medical services (EMS) patients. Progetto Vita rescuers simply accessed a public AED, turned it on, and only followed its instructions. Progetto Vita rescuers did not do CPR of any sort. If EMS arrived prior to initiation or even completion of the Progetto Vita protocol, EMS-supplanted Progetto Vita efforts and patients were not included in the Progetto Vita cohort. Follow-up was collected by each responder's data files, medical record review, and use of the Italian system death index. All cardiac arrest patients' death status was validated in 100% of patients through August 1, 2014.
   Findings Survival to hospital discharge occurred in 39 (41.4%) of the 95 patients treated by Progetto Vita and in 193 (5.9%) of the 3271 EMS patients. At 13-year follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were 31.8% when AEDs only were used and 2.4% for standard EMS/CPR response. Estimates of survival are significantly better for Progetto Vita AED-only therapy when survival was stratified by time to respond, gender, location of cardiac arrest, and shockable rhythm. Relative to the 95 EMS patients with the fastest response times, Progetto Vita intervention was associated with a more than 2-fold increased rate of survival.
   Interpretation This is the first demonstration of excellent long-term survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by promoting speed and ease of lay AED response without CPR.

TI  - Sounding the Alarm: What Clinicians Need to Know about Physical, Emotional, and Cognitive Recovery After Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation*
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE:We summarize the existing data on the occurrence of physical, emotional, and cognitive dysfunction associated with postintensive care syndrome (PICS) in adult survivors of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). DATA SOURCES:MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched. STUDY SELECTION:Peer-reviewed studies of adults receiving VA-ECMO for any reason with at least one measure of health-related quality of life outcomes or PICS at long-term follow-up of at least 6 months were included. DATA EXTRACTION:The participant demographics and baseline characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, long-term health outcomes, quality of life outcome measures, and prevalence of PICS were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS:Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria encompassing 3,271 patients who were treated with VA-ECMO. The studies were limited to single- or two-center studies. Outcomes variables and follow-up time points evaluated were widely heterogeneous which limits comprehensive analysis of PICS after VA-ECMO. In general, the longer-term PICS-related outcomes of survivors of VA-ECMO were worse than the general population, and approaching that of patients with chronic disease. Available studies identified high rates of abnormal 6-minute walk distance, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder that persisted for years. Half or fewer survivors return to work years after discharge. Only 2 of 27 studies examined cognitive outcomes and no studies evaluated cognitive dysfunction within the first year of recovery. No studies evaluated the impact of targeted interventions on these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Survivors of VA-ECMO represent a population of critically ill patients at high risk for deficits in physical, emotional, and cognitive function related to PICS. This systematic review highlights the alarming reality that PICS and in particular, neurocognitive outcomes, in survivors of VA-ECMO are understudied, underrecognized, and thus likely undertreated. These results underscore the imperative that we look beyond survival to focus on understanding the burden of survivorship with the goal of optimizing recovery and outcomes after these life-saving interventions. Future prospective, multicenter, longitudinal studies in recovery after VA-ECMO are justified.

TI  - Part 4: Systems of Care: 2025 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Improving survival and quality of life after cardiac arrest requires integrated systems of people, protocols, policies, and resources along with ongoing data acquisition and review. Such systems of care, which are highly influenced by the environment in which they operate, produce efficiency and effectiveness in responding to cardiac arrest. Part 4 of the 2025 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care focuses on systems of care, emphasizing elements that are relevant to a broad range of resuscitation situations. The chapter follows the Chain of Survival, beginning with prevention and preparedness to resuscitate, proceeding to early identification of cardiac arrest, and moving to effective resuscitation through to post-cardiac arrest care, survivorship, and recovery. This Part provides cardiac arrest systems of care guidelines on how to train specific personnel, protocols that have been demonstrated to be effective, as well as the incorporation of nonhuman resources to optimize cardiac arrest care with ongoing debriefing and quality improvement strategies. Specific to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, included are recommendations about emergency medical services team composition and transport recommendations, community initiatives to promote lay rescuer response, public access defibrillation and naloxone, and an enhanced role for emergency telecommunicators. Germane to in-hospital cardiac arrest are recommendations about cardiac arrest prevention and code team composition. Specific recommendations about extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cardiopulmonary resuscitation, transport to specialized cardiac arrest centers, organ donation, survivorship systems, and performance measurement across the continuum of resuscitation situations are also included.

TI  - Brain injury after cardiac arrest: pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is caused by initial ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion of the brain following resuscitation. In those who are admitted to intensive care unit after cardiac arrest, PCABI manifests as coma, and is the main cause of mortality and long-term disability. This review describes the mechanisms of PCABI, its treatment options, its outcomes, and the suggested strategies for outcome prediction.

TI  - Impact of age on long-term survival and quality of life following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Early defibrillation programs have improved long-term outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation. Although long-term collective quality of life and survival are favorable, there are subsets of these patients who may be predisposed to worse outcomes. In particular, elderly patients may present with more comorbid medical conditions affecting their outcome. However, the impact of age on mortality rate and quality of life after rapid defibrillation is unknown.
   Design: Observational study.
   Setting: Hospital.
   Subjects: All patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between November 1990 and January 2001 who received rapid defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients received treatment at one hospital. Interventions. Long-term outcome and quality of life were followed. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The quality of life was established by an SF-36 survey.
   Measurements and Main Results: Two hundred patients presented in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; of these, 138 (69%) survived to hospital admission, seven (4%) died in the emergency department, and 79 (39%) were discharged neurologically intact. The average age was 62 +/- 16 yrs, with 51% (n = 40) of the population greater than or equal to65. The average length of follow-up was 4.8 +/- 3.0 yrs. The 5-yr survival in patients <65 was 94% (confidence interval, 86-100%) and 66% (confidence interval, 52-84%) in patients greater than or equal to65 (p < .001). The observed survival in the younger group was not different from that expected in a U.S. age-and gender-matched population. However, in the older group, the expected survival was significantly lower compared with an age-and gender-matched U.S. population (p = .01) but similar to an age-, gender-, and disease-matched cohort of patients from Olmsted County not experiencing an arrest. In both age-dependent cohort populations, the quality of life scores crossed the norm in all categories with exception of vitality in patients >65 yrs old (42.6 +/- 7.2). In direct comparison between the two patient groups, the older cohort reported lower levels of physical functioning (p = .002), role-emotional score (p = .03), and role-physical score (p = .007). Other SF-36 scores were not different between the groups. Sixty-five percent of patients <65 yrs returned to work compared with 56% of older patients.
   Conclusions: The survival rate for ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is significantly improved by the presence of a rapid defibrillation program. In patients <65 yrs old, long-term survival is equal to that of normal individuals and quality of life is similar to the general population. The survival, although high, in older patients is less than that in age-matched healthy controls, and physical and emotional quality of life scores are decreased.

TI  - Factors associated with return to work among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of global mortality, survival rates have increased over the last decade. As such, there is an increasing need to explore long-term functional outcomes of survivors, such as return to work (RTW).
   Methodology: We analysed baseline and 12-month follow-up data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry for patients that arrested between 2010 and 2016 who were working prior to their arrest. We also conducted more detailed RTW interviews in a subset of OHCA survivors who arrested between July and September 2017. Factors associated with RTW were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 884 previously working survivors were included in the analysis, 650 (73%) of whom RTW. Male sex (AOR 1.80; 95%CI: 1.10-2.94), arrests witnessed by emergency medical services (AOR 2.72; 95%CI: 1.50-9.25), discharge directly home from hospital (AOR 4.13; 95%CI: 2.38-7.18) and favourable 12-month health-related quality of life according to the EQ-5D were associated with RTW. Increasing age (AOR 0.97; 95%CI: 0.95-0.98), traumatic arrest aetiology (AOR 0.18; 95%CI: 0.04-0.77), and labour-intensive occupations (AOR 0.44; 95%CI: 0.29-0.66) were associated with decreased odds of RTW. Of the 23 OHCA survivors that participated in the more detailed RTW telephone-interview, 87% RTW. Flexible work hours or modified duties were offered to 74% of participants. Fatigue was the most frequently reported barrier to RTW.
   Conclusion: This is the largest study to collectively examine factors associated with RTW among survivors of OHCA. Although larger qualitative studies are needed, our findings highlight which patients are at risk of not RTW and who may benefit from targeted rehabilitation strategies.

TI  - Comparison of GRACE and TIMI risk scores in the prediction of in-hospital and long-term outcomes among East Asian non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background Risk stratification in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) determines the intervention time. Limited study compared two risk scores, the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores in the current East Asian NSTEMI patients. Methods This retrospective observational study consecutively collected patients in a large academic hospital between 01/01 and 11/01/2017 and followed for 4 years. Patients were scored by TIMI and GRACE scores on hospital admission. In-hospital endpoints were defined as the in-hospital composite event, including mortality, re-infarction, heart failure, stroke, cardiac shock, or resuscitation. Long-term outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality in 4-year follow-up. Results A total of 232 patients were included (female 29.7%, median age 67 years), with a median follow-up of 3.7 years. GRACE score grouped most patients (45.7%) into high risk, while TIMI grouped the majority (61.2%) into medium risk. Further subgrouping the TIMI medium group showed that half (53.5%) of the TIMI medium risk population was GRACE high risk (>= 140). Compared to TIMI medium group + GRACE < 140 subgroup, the TIMI medium + GRACE high-risk (>= 140) subgroup had a significantly higher in-hospital events (39.5% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.05), long-term all-cause mortality (22.2% vs. 0% p < 0.001) and cardiac death (11.1% vs. 0% p = 0.045) in 4-year follow-up. GRACE risk scores showed a better predictive ability than TIMI risk scores both for in-hospital and long-term outcomes. (AUC of GRACE vs. TIMI, In-hospital: 0.82 vs. 0.62; long-term mortality: 0.89 vs. 0.68; long-term cardiac mortality: 0.91 vs. 0.67, all p < 0.05). Combined use of the two risk scores reserved both the convenience of scoring and the predictive accuracy. Conclusion GRACE showed better predictive accuracy than TIMI in East Asian NSTEMI patients in both in-hospital and long-term outcomes. The sequential use of TIMI and GRACE scores provide an easy and promising discriminative tool in predicting outcomes in NSTEMI East Asian patients.

TI  - Emergent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Resuscitated Victims of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
AB  - Long-term survival rates even after successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are dismal. Most of those initially resuscitated expired during their hospitalization. Recent reports have suggested that a more aggressive approach to postresuscitation care is the key to better outcome. Waiting for the evidence of neurological recovery before acting can result in missed opportunity to improve such recovery. Immediate induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia for all resuscitated victims who remain comatose offers the best hope for neurological recovery. Numerous reports suggest that early coronary angiography and PCI also improve outcome among those resuscitated from cardiac arrest whose postresuscitation ECG show evidence of ST elevation myocardial infarctions. Most promising is combining these two postresuscitation therapies, namely immediate induction of hypothermia and early coronary angiography and PCI. Combining these therapies has resulted in long-term survival rates of 70% with more than 80% of all such survivors neurologically functional. Even those without ST elevation on their postresuscitation ECG can greatly benefit from timely induction of hypothermia and early angiography/PCI. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Outcomes of Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CARDIOLOGY IN REVIEW
AB  - Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is increasingly used in cardiac arrest. Currently, public registries report the outcomes of cardiac arrest regardless of the setting (out-of-hospital versus in-hospital). Meanwhile, in-hospital cardiac arrest represents a more favorable setting for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation than out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Survival to discharge varies, but looks promising overall, ranging from 18.9% to 65%, with the bulk of the studies reporting survival to discharge between 30% and 50%, with about one-third to half of the patients discharged with no or minimal neurologic deficit. Based on the reported outcomes, in-hospital cardiac arrests can become a next focus for studies on successful implementation of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

TI  - Favourable outcome in survivors of CPR-related chest wall injuries
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies focusing on long -term chest function after chest wall injury due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate long -term pain, lung function, physical function, and fracture healing after manual or mechanical CPR and in patients with and without flail chest. Methods: Patients experiencing out -of -hospital cardiac arrest between 2013 and 2020 and transported to Sahlgrenska University Hospital were identified. Survivors who had undergone a computed tomography (CT) showing chest wall injury were contacted. Thirty-five patients answered a questionnaire regarding pain, physical function, and quality of life and 25 also attended a clinical examination to measure the respiratory and physical functions 3.9 (SD 1.7, min 2 -max 8) years after the CPR. In addition, 22 patients underwent an additional CT scan to evaluate fracture healing. Results: The initial CT showed bilateral rib fractures in all but one patient and sternum fracture in 69 %. At the time of the follow-up none of the patients had persistent pain, however, two patients were experiencing local discomfort in the chest wall. Lung function and thoracic expansion were significantly lower compared to reference values (FVC 14 %, FEV1 18 %, PEF 10 % and thoracic expansion 63 %) ( p < 0.05). Three of the patients had remaining unhealed injuries. Patients who had received mechanical CPR in additional to manual CPR had a lower peak expiratory flow (80 vs 98 % of predicted values) ( p =0.030) =0.030) and those having flail chest had less range of motion in the thoracic spine (84 vs 127 % of predicted) ( p = 0.019) otherwise the results were similar between the groups. Conclusion: None of the survivors had long -term pain after CPR-related chest wall injuries. Despite decreased lower lung function and thoracic expansion, most patients had no limitations in physical mobility. Only minor differences were seen after manual vs. mechanical CPR or with and without flail chest.

TI  - External validation of cardiac arrest-specific prognostication scores developed for early prognosis estimation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a Korean multicenter cohort
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We evaluated the performance of cardiac arrest-specific prognostication scores developed for outcome prediction in the early hours after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in predicting long-term outcomes using independent data. The following scores were calculated for 1,163 OHCA patients who were treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) at 21 hospitals in South Korea: OHCA, cardiac arrest hospital prognosis (CAHP), C-GRApH (named on the basis of its variables), TTM risk, 5-R, NULL-PLEASE (named on the basis of its variables), Serbian quality of life long-term (SR-QOLl), cardiac arrest survival, revised post-cardiac arrest syndrome for therapeutic hypothermia (rCAST), Polish hypothermia registry (PHR) risk, and PROgnostication using LOGistic regression model for Unselected adult cardiac arrest patients in the Early stages (PROLOGUE) scores and prediction score by Aschauer et al. Their accuracies in predicting poor outcome at 6 months after OHCA were determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration belt. In the complete-case analyses, the PROLOGUE score showed the highest AUC (0.923; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.904-0.941), whereas the SR-QOLl score had the lowest AUC (0.749; 95% CI, 0.711-0.786). The discrimination performances were similar in the analyses after multiple imputation. The PROLOGUE, TTM risk, CAHP, NULL-PLEASE, 5-R, and cardiac arrest survival scores were well calibrated. The rCAST and PHR risk scores showed acceptable overall calibration, although they showed miscalibration under the 80% CI level at extreme prediction values. The OHCA score, C-GRApH score, prediction score by Aschauer et al., and SR-QOLl score showed significant miscalibration in both complete-case (P = 0.026, 0.013, 0.005, and < 0.001, respectively) and multiple-imputation analyses (P = 0.007, 0.018, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the discrimination performances of the prognostication scores were all acceptable, but some showed significant miscalibration.

TI  - Experience with Extracorporeal Life Support for Cardiogenic Shock in the Older Population more than 70 Years of Age
T2  - ASAIO JOURNAL
AB  - The two main objectives of this single-center, retrospective study were to analyze the outcomes and to identify the independent predictors of 30 day and long-term mortality in case of cardiopulmonary resuscitation requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in the elderly patients. From October 2004 to May 2014, 163 patients with a mean age of 75.5 years (range 70-91) required veno-arterial ECLS. The main indication was postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (79.6%). Extracorporeal life support duration averaged 5.6 +/- 4.3 days. Thirty-day mortality was 72% (n = 117) and follow-up survival rate was 14.1% with a median follow-up of 23.7 months (range 1.5-102.3). Lactatemia was identified as an independent risk factor of 30 day mortality. Previous stroke, lactatemia, bilirubinemia, and ECLS implantation under cardiac massage were identified as independent risk factors for long-term mortality. Extracorporeal life support after TAVI procedure and intra-aortic balloon pump support were identified as protective factors for both 30 day and long-term survival. The 23 patients, still alive at last follow up, have a good quality of life, doing well, and self-catering. Although mortality rate at 30 days is more than 70% in elderly patients requiring circulatory support with ECLS, survivors can pretend to an acceptable long-term survival with a good quality of life. Extracorporeal life support implantation in the elderly patients should remain scarce, but should still be considered as a therapeutic option in well-selected patients.

TI  - Follow-Up of Cardiac Arrest Survivors: Why, How, and When? A Practical Approach
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors may experience cognitive, physical, or emotional problems that can affect their return to everyday activities and quality of life. To improve long-term outcomes, interventions after hospital discharge may be needed. A follow-up plan to identify CA survivors with increased risk of residual cognitive, physical, or emotional problems is important to target interventions and support. Current recommendations suggest that follow-up should include screening of potential problems, sharing information, and relevant referrals when needed. The complexity of the follow-up of CA survivors is due to the fact that several pathways of care may be offered, focusing either on the cardiovascular disease, the postintensive care syndrome, or CA-related brain injury. There is a potential to improve recovery through a more collaborative and holistic approach to follow-up. The aim of this review is to give examples of why follow-up after CA should be provided, but also how and when follow-up could be performed.

TI  - Well-being among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a cross-sectional retrospective study in Sweden
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives The psychological outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been studied more extensively in recent years. Still, not much is known about the well-being among OHCA survivors. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we aim to investigate post-OHCA well-being among patients with a good neurological outcome, 3 months after the cardiac event. To assess well-being, we analyse the frequency of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and health within this group. Further, we aim to evaluate the importance of five prognostic factors for post-OHCA well-being.
   Methods Data collection took place between 2008 and 2012, and every OHCA survivor within one region of Sweden, with a cerebral performance category (CPC) score of <= 2 at discharge, was asked to participate. Survivors were identified through the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry, and postal questionnaires were sent out 3 months after the OHCA. The survey included Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), PTSD Checklist Civilian version (PCL-C) and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 level (EQ-5D-3L).
   Results Of 298 survivors, 150 were eligible for this study and 94 responded. The mean time from OHCA to follow-up was 88 days. There was no significant difference between respondents and non-respondents in terms of sex, age, cardiac arrest circumstances or in-hospital interventions. 48 participants reported reduced well-being, and young age was the only factor significantly correlated to this outcome (p=0.02). Women reported significantly higher scores in HADS (p=0.001) and PCL-C (p<0.001). Women also reported significantly lower EQ-5D index values (p=0.002) and EQ-visual analogue scale scores (p=0.002) compared with men.
   Conclusion Reduced well-being is experienced by half of OHCA survivors with a CPC score <= 2, and young age is negatively correlated to this outcome. The frequency of anxiety and PTSD is higher among women, who also report worse health.

TI  - Post-resuscitation care of patients with return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at the emergency department
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction:Out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest (OHCA) is a major public health challenge and post-return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC) goals have shifted from just survival to survival with intact neurology. Although post-ROSC care is crucial for survival with intact neurology, there are insufficient well-established protocols for post-resuscitation care. We aimed to evaluate post-resuscitation care in the emergency department (ED) of adult (aged >= 16 years) OHCA patients with sustained ROSC and its associated neurologically intact survival.Methods:A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted for OHCA patients with sustained ROSC at the ED. Data including demographics, pre-hospital resuscitation, ED resuscitation, post-resuscitation care and eventual outcomes were analysed.Results:Among 921 OHCA patients, 85 (9.2%) had sustained ROSC at the ED. Nineteen patients (19/85, 22.4%) survived, with 13 (13/85, 15.3%) having intact neurology at discharge. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were performed in all OHCA patients, whereas computed tomography (CT) was performed inconsistently, with CT brain being most common (74/85, 87.1%), while CT pulmonary angiogram (6/85, 7.1%), abdomen and pelvis (4/85, 4.7%) and aortogram (2/85, 2.4%) were done infrequently. Only four patients (4.7%) had all five neuroprotective goals of normoxia, normocarbia, normotension, normothermia and normoglycaemia achieved in the ED. The proportion of all five neuroprotective goals being met was significantly higher (P = 0.01) among those with neurologically intact survival (3/13, 23.1%) than those without (1/72, 1.4%).Conclusion:Post-resuscitation care at the ED showed great variability, indicating gaps between recommended guidelines and clinical practice. Good quality post-resuscitation care, centred around neuroprotection goals, must be initiated promptly to achieve meaningful survival with intact neurology.

TI  - Predictors of long-term functional outcome and health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Even if a large majority of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors appear to have a good neurological recovery with no important sequellae, whether health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is altered is less explored.
   Patients and methods: HRQOL was evaluated by telephone interview using SF-36 questionnaire. Each OHCA case was age and gender-matched with 4 controls from the French general population. Association between current condition of the survivors with the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire was investigated using MANCOVA. Cluster analysis was performed to identify patterns of HRQOL among CPC1 survivors.
   Results: 255 patients discharged alive from our referral centre between 2000 and 2013 (median age of 55y [45,64], 73.7% males) were interviewed. Global physical and mental components did not differ between CPC 1 survivors and controls (47.0 vs. 47.1, p = 0.88 and 46.4 vs. 46.9, p = 0.45) but substantially differed between CPC2, CPC3 and the corresponding controls. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy at telephone interview were significantly associated with better scores in each SF-36 dimensions. Cluster analysis individualized 4 distinct subgroups of CPC1 patients characterised by progressively increased score of SF-36. Return to work and daily-life autonomy were differently distributed across these 4 groups while pre-hospital Utstein variables were not.
   Conclusion: HRQOL of CPC1 OHCA survivors appeared similar to that of the general population, but patients with CPC2 or 3 had altered HRQOL. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy were independently associated with a better HRQOL. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are associated with a high mortality. In the past survival advantages for patients could be achieved by optimizing the chain of rescue and postresuscitation treatment; however, for patients with refractory cardiac arrest, there have so far been few promising treatment options. For selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest who do not achieve return of spontaneous circulation with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), extracorporeal (e)CPR using venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an option to improve the probability of survival. This article describes the technical features, important aspects of treatment, and the current data situation on eCPR in patients with in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

This article describes the technical features, important aspects of treatment, and the current data situation on eCPR in patients with in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Management of Patients After Cardiac Arrest: Now the Real Work Begins
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Survival with a good quality of life after cardiac arrest continues to be abysmal. Coordinated resuscitative care does not end with the effective return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) din fact, quite the contrary is true. Along with identifying and appropriately treating the precipitating cause, various components of the postecardiac arrest syndrome also require diligent observation and management, including postecardiac arrest neurologic injury and myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia-reperfusion phenomenon with potential consequent multiorgan failure, and the various sequelae of critical illness. There is growing evidence that an early invasive approach to coronary reperfusion with percutaneous coronary intervention, together with active targeted temperature management and optimization of hemodynamic, ventilator, and metabolic parameters, may improve survival and neurologic outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors. Neuroprognostication is complex, as are survivorship issues and long-term rehabilitation. Our paramedics, emergency physicians, and resuscitation specialists are all to be congratulated for ever-increasing success with ROSC. but now the real work begins.

TI  - Sex differences in the quality-of-life and functional outcome of cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Although survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improving, little is known about the long-term outcome of survivors. In this study, we assess the impact of sex on 12 month functional recovery and health-related quality-of-life (HROoL) outcomes in OHCA survivors.
   Methods: Between 2010 and 2016, consecutive adult OHCA survivors were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and 12-Item Short Form (SF-12) health survey.
   Results: Of the 2300 patients discharged alive, 175 (7.6%) died during the follow-up period with the rate of death at 12 months being higher in women compared to men (10.4% vs. 6.4%; p = 0.002). Of the 2125 12 month survivors, 1752 (82.5%) participated in the interviews. Unadjusted outcomes were consistently poorer for females compared to males, with fewer women reporting good functional recovery (GOSE >= 7, 53.5% vs. 64.8%, p < 0.001) and living at home without care (60.7% vs. 76.4%, p < 0.001). After adjustment, female sex reduced the odds of good functional recovery (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88; p = 0.004), living at home without care (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.76; p < 0.001), an EQ-5D index score of 1 (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.75; p < 0.001), an SF-12 mental component summary >= 50 (AOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.78; p = 0.001) and an SF-12 physical component summary >= 50 (AOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Women report poorer functional recovery and HROoL after OHCA. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for these disparities.

TI  - CPR: cardiac phosphatase in resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with a dismal mortality rate and low long-term survival. A large pharmacological knowledge gap exists in identifying drugs that preserve neurological function and increase long-term survival after cardiac arrest. In this issue of the JCI, Li, Zhu, and colleagues report on their engineering of a 20-amino acid cell-permeable peptide (TAT-PHLPP9c) that antagonized the phosphatase PHLPP1 and prevented PHLPP1-mediated dephosphorylation and AKT inactivation. TAT-PHLPP9c administration maintained activated AKT after arrest and led to AKT-mediated beneficial effects on the heart, brain, and metabolism, resulting in increased cardiac output and cerebral blood flow and rescue of ATP levels in affected tissues. TAT-PHLPP9c improved neurological outcomes and increased survival after cardiac arrest in murine and porcine models of cardiac arrest. These findings provide proof of concept that pharmacological targeting of PHLPP1 may be a promising approach to augmenting long-term survival after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Post-Cardiopulmonary Arrest Care and Functional Outcomes in Dogs and Cats Surviving to Hospital Discharge Since Publication of the RECOVER Guidelines: 2012-2022
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Objective To describe the in-hospital postcardiac arrest (PCA) care and short- and long-term functional outcomes of dogs and cats surviving to hospital discharge after naturally occurring cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and CPR. Design Multicenter retrospective observational study. Setting Three veterinary teaching hospitals. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 25) and cats (n = 15). Measurements and Main Results Medical records of animals that underwent CPR and survived to discharge were retrospectively reviewed, and information was recorded regarding CPR event, PCA hospitalization, and short- and long-term outcomes. Ninety-two percent of CPA events occurred in hospital and were witnessed, and 8% occurred out of hospital. Eighty-five percent of events occurred during general anesthesia or sedation. CPR efforts ranged from <1 to 18 min, and animals remained hospitalized between 0.5 and 15.5 days after return of spontaneous circulation. Seventy-three percent of animals required supplemental oxygen, 13% required mechanical ventilation, and 20% required vasopressor, positive inotropic, or glucocorticoid therapy. Hyperosmolar therapies were administered to 38% of animals, anticonvulsants were given to 18%, and 8% of animals developed new-onset PCA seizures. The median (range) modified Glasgow Coma Scale score before CPA was 18 (11-18), 12 h PCA was 16 (6-18), and 72 h PCA was 17.5 (14-18). Median survival time was 455 days (range: 11-2650 days). Twenty-five percent of owners perceived a persistent disability in their pets, from behavioral changes to required nutritional and recumbent care. Nonetheless, all owners reported their pet's PCA quality of life to be good. Conclusions Good short- and long-term functional outcomes post-CPA can be achieved in dogs and cats. Functional survival remains possible in some cases of out-of-hospital CPA and after prolonged CPR, suggesting a benefit of high-quality CPR in all scenarios. Patient stabilization and neurological improvement may take 48-72 h, and early discouraging findings should not prevent continuation of PCA care.

TI  - British Cardiovascular Intervention Society Consensus Position Statement on Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest 2: Post-discharge Rehabilitation
T2  - INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY-REVIEWS RESEARCH RESOURCES
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health issue that poses significant challenges both in immediate management and longterm follow-up. Survivors of OHCA often experience a combination of complex medical, physical and psychological needs that have a significant impact on quality of life. Guidelines suggest a multi-dimensional follow-up to address both physical and non-physical domains for survivors. However, it is likely that there is substantial unwarranted variation in provision of services throughout the UK. Currently, there is no nationally agreed model for the follow-up of OHCA survivors and there is an urgent need for a set of standards and guidelines in order to ensure equal access for all. Accordingly, the British Cardiovascular Interventional Society established a multi-disciplinary working group to develop a position statement that summarises the most up-to-date evidence and provides guidance on essential and desirable services for a dedicated follow-up pathway for survivors of OHCA.

T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives:To report on 5-year survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and occupational status of patients with respiratory or cardiac failure, who were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).Design:A prospective multicenter observational cohort follow-up study.Setting:ICUs of ten ECMO centers in the Netherlands, representing more than 90% of all patients supported with ECMO in the Netherlands.Patients:Patients supported with ECMO between August 2017 and July 2019.Interventions:None.Measurements and Main Results:Survival was assessed by consulting the Dutch municipal records database. All 5-year survivors received a questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the standardized EuroQol 5D Five Levels instrument, and occupational status was assessed using the standardized Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Productivity Cost Questionnaire. Of the initial 428 participants, 230 (54%) survived the hospital admission, 213 (50%) survived the first year, and 155 (36%) survived 5 years. Five-year survival rates were 42% for patients receiving ECMO for respiratory support, 39% for cardiac support, and 25% for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The response rate to the questionnaire was 72%. HRQoL was rated satisfactory at 5 years, with a median EuroQol index of 0.82 (interquartile range, 0.73-0.98). Five-year survivors reported slight-to-moderate impairment of mobility (39%), impairment of usual activities (44%), and pain or discomfort (60%). After 5 years, the majority of patients were either employed (41%), retired (31%), or permanently declared unfit for work (26%).Conclusions:Long-term outcome in patients supported with ECMO is good. Five-year survivors reported that HRQoL was satisfactory despite some impairment in day-to-day functioning.

TI  - Quality of life in long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
CP  - Annual Swiss Cardiology Meeting
AB  - Study objective: The quality of life in Ion,-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may be a good outcome measure after resuscitation. Therefore, the psychosocial situation and quality of life in such patients after successful resuscitation was evaluated. Methods: Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a community referred to a single tertiary care centre were compared with matched controls. Quality of life was evaluated in 50 consecutive arrest cases (40 males, 10 females; 60+/-13 years) 5-68 months (mean 31.7) after resuscitation according to American Heart Association protocols. Results: The Psychological General Well-being Index questionnaire indicated no significant differences in anxiety, depression, vitality, general well-being, or self-control between patients and controls, However, the Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire demonstrated significant decreases in physical mobility (14.5+/-18.1 vs. 4.0+/-8.5, P = 0.0001), energy levels (25.3+/-31.0 vs. 2.0+/-8.0, P = 0.0001), emotional reactions (11.3+/-16.6 vs. 4.0+/-10.2, P=0.009), and sleep patterns (19.2+/-28.6 vs. 8.4+/-16.7, P=0.023) in the arrest patients. Little differences were measured with the Everyday-Life Questionnaire. 49 of the 50 arrest patients judged their situation after resuscitation worth living; no significant changes in familial, and psychosocial parameters occurred. Conclusions: The quality of life was associated with few changes in psychosocial profile after successful resuscitation. The subjective negative factors bore little impact on the quality of daily living in our patients. Thus, continued efforts to improve out-of-hospital resuscitation measures for cardiac arrest are justified since long-term survivors can expect a good quality of life after successful resuscitation.

TI  - Complete Recovery With the Chain of Survival After a Prolonged (120 Minutes) Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Due to Brugada Syndrome A Case Report
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a crucial public health problem. To improve outcomes of patients after cardiac arrest, the American Heart Association promotes the concept of the chain of survival.We report a case of a 19-year-old man with no markedly past medical history who suffered from OHCA, and he was resuscitated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, without interruption, during the rescue process for 120 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Electrocardiogram on admission showed right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in leads V1-V2, and the patient's uncle had experienced the same event and had received implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) treatment. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with Brugada syndrome. Postcardiac arrest care was performed after ROSC, including mild therapeutic hypothermia, hemodynamic monitoring and management, and ICD implantation, and then the patient completely recovered without any noticeable neurological or intellectual deficits in the follow-up examinations.Our case demonstrates that even after an OHCA with prolonged time (120 minutes) until ROSC, survival with a favorable neurological outcome is possible, provided implementation of an extremely effective rescue chain.

TI  - ENFORCER, internet-based interventions for cardiac arrest survivors: A study protocol for a randomised, parallel-group, multicentre clinical trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major health concern in Europe, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Survivors often suffer from cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression, that affect significantly their quality of life. Current post-discharge care is inconsistent and frequently overlooks subtle but disabling symptoms. The ENFORCER trial aims to significantly enhance the health and quality of life of OHCA survivors by providing a comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly internet-based lifestyle intervention. Methods: ENFORCER is a multicentre, parallel group randomized controlled trial involving OHCA survivors aged 18-80 years with cognitive impairment or anxiety/depression measured through validated instruments. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or the control group. The intervention group will receive a one-year program via a secure web application, offering cognitive, emotional, and physical rehabilitation support. The control group will receive standard care. The primary outcome is the difference in the proportion of patients without cognitive or emotional symptoms between the two groups after one year. Secondary outcomes include changes in the level of patients' cognitive and emotional symptoms, quality of life, sleep quality, sexual interest and satisfaction, and caregivers' burden, quality of life, sleep quality and emotional symptoms in the two groups. Discussion: The trial addresses the need for consistent post-discharge care, and the timely detection and treatment of cognitive and emotional problems. The internet-based approach allows to potentially reach many patients, ensuring cost-effectiveness and high adherence rates. The study results could establish a standard for post-OHCA care, improving long-term recovery and quality of life for survivors. Trial registration. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06395558).

TI  - Early prediction of long-term cognitive function, emotional distress, and health-related quality of life in cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest survivors are at risk of long-term disturbances in cognition, emotional distress, and health-related quality of life (QoL). Early prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical measures predict long-term outcomes. Methods: In a longitudinal multicenter cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26). Results: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive relation with twelve-month MoCA (beta = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94). Early HADS was associated with twelve-month HADS (beta = 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.60, p < 0.001), with age negatively associated (beta = -0.10, 95 % CI: -0.18 to -0.02, p = 0.019). No other significant relations were found. Conclusion: MoCA and HADS scores during hospitalization relate to long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes after cardiac arrest. These measures may help identify patients who could benefit from cognitive rehabilitation or psychosocial support.

AB  - After successful resuscitation, further treatment has a decisive influence regarding patient outcome. Not only overall survival, but also the neurological outcome that is crucial for patients' quality of life can be positively influenced by optimized post-cardiac arrest treatment. The management of various consequences of post-cardiac arrest syndrome is discussed in the current version of the ERC-guidelines in the chapter "post resuscitation care". A step-by-step approach based on an algorithm provides the necessary structure. The immediate treatment and stabilization of patients after ROSC is followed by the diagnosis of the triggering pathology in order to initiate adequate therapy. During the subsequent intensive care treatment, the focus is on optimizing neurological recovery.

TI  - Cognitive impairment after intensive care unit admission: a systematic review
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - There is increasing evidence that critical illness and treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) may result in significant long-term morbidity. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the current literature on long-term cognitive impairment in ICU survivors.
   PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Embase were searched from January 1980 until July 2012 for relevant articles evaluating cognitive functioning after ICU admission. Publications with an adult population and a follow-up duration of at least 2 months were eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies in cardiac surgery patients or subjects with brain injury or cardiac arrest prior to ICU admission were excluded. The main outcome measure was cognitive functioning.
   The search strategy identified 1,128 unique studies, of which 19 met the selection criteria and were included. Only one article compared neuropsychological test performance before and after ICU admission. The 19 studies that were selected reported a wide range of cognitive impairment in 4-62 % of the patients after a follow-up of 2-156 months.
   The results of most studies of the studies reviewed suggest that critical illness and ICU treatment are associated with long-term cognitive impairment. Due to the complexity of defining cognitive impairment, it is difficult to standardize definitions and to reach consensus on how to categorize neurocognitive dysfunction. Therefore, the magnitude of the problem is uncertain.

TI  - Neurological prognostication of outcome in patients in coma after cardiac arrest
T2  - LANCET NEUROLOGY
AB  - Management of coma after cardiac arrest has improved during the past decade, allowing an increasing proportion of patients to survive, thus prognostication has become an integral part of post-resuscitation care. Neurologists are increasingly confronted with raised expectations of next of kin and the necessity to provide early predictions of long-term prognosis. During the past decade, as technology and clinical evidence have evolved, post-cardiac arrest prognostication has moved towards a multimodal paradigm combining clinical examination with additional methods, consisting of electrophysiology, blood biomarkers, and brain imaging, to optimise prognostic accuracy. Prognostication should never be based on a single indicator; although some variables have very low false positive rates for poor outcome, multimodal assessment provides resassurance about the reliability of a prognostic estimate by off ering concordant evidence.

TI  - Effect of calcium vs. placebo on long-term outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The Calcium for Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest (COCA) trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of calcium for out -of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary and secondary outcomes have been reported previously. This article describes the long-term outcomes of the trial. Methods: Patients aged & GE;18 years were included if they had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during which they received adrenaline. The trial drug consisted of calcium chloride (5 mmol) or saline placebo given after the first dose of adrenaline and again after the second dose of adrenaline for a maximum of two doses. This article presents pre-specified analyses of 6-month and 1-year outcomes for survival, survival with a favorable neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale of 3 or less), and health-related quality of life. Results: A total of 391 patients were analyzed. At 1 year, 9 patients (4.7%) were alive in the calcium group while 18 (9.1%) were alive in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.51; 95% confidence interval 0.24, 1.09). At 1 year, 7 patients (3.6%) were alive with a favorable neurological outcome in the calcium group while 17 (8.6%) were alive with a favorable neurological outcome in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval 0.18, 0.97). Outcomes for health-related quality of life likewise suggested harm of calcium but results were imprecise with wide confidence intervals. Conclusions: Effect estimates remained constant over time suggesting harm of calcium but with wide confidence intervals. The results do not sup-port calcium administration during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Long-term follow-up after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - Survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest varies according to evaluation criteria. It can be estimated that in 22 to 63% of the cases, effective hemodynamic performance is restored although hospital mortality is much higher, reaching 63%. Death, frequent after prolonged cardiac arrest, is usually due to recurrent cardiac arrest or the effects of prolonged anoxia. Mortality in patients who survive the hospitalization period is approximately 20% during the year following discharge. Consequently one year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, only 5% of the patients are still alive. The quality of life varies greatly in these survivors; the course of neurological sequellae may be favorable in approximately half but leads to death in others.
   The primary factor predicting survival is the underlying pathology, highly influenced by age. Inversely, factors predicting a more favorable outcome include ventricular tachycardia as the origin of cardiac arrest, presence of other people at onset and rapid recovery of spontaneous hemodynamic activity. Loss of consciousness for more than 24 hours, defective bulbar reflexes and anomalies on the electroencephalogram are signs of gravity as are high blood glucose, major brain edema and abolition of somesthesic and auditive evoked potentials.

TI  - Quality of life and pruritus in patients with severe sepsis resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch long-term follow-up of a randomised trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: The effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) on patient-centered outcome measures have not been fully described in patients with severe sepsis. We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the occurrence of pruritus in patients with severe sepsis randomized to resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 or Ringer's acetate.
   Methods: We did post hoc analyses of the Danish survivors (n = 295) of the 6S trial using mailed questionnaires on self-perceived HRQoL (Short Form (SF) -36) and pruritus.
   Results: Median 14 months (interquartile range 10 to 18) after randomization, 182 (61%) and 185 (62%) completed questionnaires were obtained for the assessment of HRQoL and pruritus, respectively. Responders were older than nonresponders, but characteristics at randomization of the responders in the HES vs. Ringer's groups were comparable. At follow-up, the patients in the HES group had lower mental component summary scores than those in the Ringer's group (median 45 (interquartile range 36 to 55) vs. 53 (39 to 60), P = 0.01). The group differences were mainly in the scales of vitality and mental health. There was no difference in the physical component summary scores between groups, but patients in the HES group scored worse in bodily pain. Forty-nine percent of patients allocated to HES had experienced pruritus at any time after ICU discharge compared to 43% of those allocated to Ringer's (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.55, P = 0.43).
   Conclusions: At long-term follow-up patients with severe sepsis assigned to resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 had worse self-perceived HRQoL than those assigned to Ringer's acetate whereas there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of pruritus.

TI  - Outcomes and long-term quality-of-life of patients supported by extyacorpoyeal membrane oxygenation for refractory caydiogenic shock
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To assess the outcomes and long-term quality-of-life of patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for refractory cardlogenic shock.
   Design, Setting, and Patients. Refractory cardiogenic shock is almost always lethal without emergency circulatory support, e.g., ECMO. ECMO-associated morbidity and mortality plead for identification of early predictors of its failure, and detailed analyses of short- and long-term outcomes to refine patient selection and improve results. Outcomes of 81 patients given ECMO support for medical (n = 55), postcardiotomy (n = 16), or posttransplantation (n = 10) cardiogenic shock were evaluated.
   Measurements and Main Results. Thirty-four (42%) patients survived to hospital discharge; 57% suffered >= 1 major ECMO related complications. Independent predictors of intensive care unit death were: device insertion under cardiac massage (odds ratio [OR] = 20.68), 24 hr urine output <500 mL (OR = 6.52), prothrombin activity <50% (OR = 3.93), and female sex (OR = 3.89); myocarditides were associated with better outcomes (OR =.13). Sequelae and health-related quality-of-life were evaluated for 28 long-term survivors (median follow-up, 11 months), whose mean Short-Form 36 scores were significantly lower than matched healthy controls for physical role, general health, and social functioning, but higher than those reported for patients on chronic hemodialysis, with advanced heart failure, or after recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
   Conclusions. ECMO support can rescue 40% of otherwise fatal cardiogenic shock patients but its initiation under cardiac massage or after renal or hepatic failure carried higher risks of intensive care unit death, while fulminant myocarditis had a better prognosis. Despite satisfactory mental health and vitality, long-term survivors' persistent physical and social problems might benefit from tailored medical or psychosocial interventions.

TI  - The Potential Role of Erythropoietin as a Pleiotropic Agent in Post-cardiac Arrest Syndrome
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide with survival rates still remaining suboptimal. Unfortunately, most cardiac arrest patients, who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), develop a multi-faceted post-cardiac arrest syndrome, including post-cardiac arrest brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, and systemic ischemia/reperfusion response.
   Erythropoietin (EPO), the principal hematopoietic hormone regulating erythropoiesis, exhibits diverse cellular effects in non-hematopoietic tissues. Due to its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties, as well as its angiogenic action, EPO plays a role in neuroprotection and cardioprotection. In this regard, EPO represents a promising agent in the cardiac arrest setting, based on a therapeutic strategy that focuses on the post-resuscitation phase.
   This review aims to provide a comprehensive account of EPO's role in the treatment of each individual component of post-cardiac arrest syndrome.

TI  - One-year survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: In-hospital cardiac arrest is a major adverse event with an incidence of 1-6/1000 admissions. It has been poorly researched and data on survival is limited. The outcome of interest in IHCA research is predominantly survival to discharge, however recent guidelines warrant for more long-term outcomes. In this systematic review we sought to quantitatively summarize one-year survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis we performed a systematic search of all published data on one-year survival after IHCA up to March 9th, 2018. Results of the meta-analyses are presented as pooled proportions with corresponding 95% prediction intervals (95% PI). Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I-2 statistic and the DerSimonian-Laird estimator for tau(2). Subgroup analyses were performed for cardiac and non-cardiac patients.
   Results: We included 40 studies in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled one-year survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest was 13.4% (95% PI: 5.6-28.8%, I-2 = 100%). Subgroup analysis of cardiac patients revealed a one-year survival of 39.3% (16.1%-68.6%) in patients with a non-cardiac admission characteristic one-year survival was 10.7% (4.4%-23.6%). These data cover the period 1985-2018 and show a modest change in survival over that period (10-year OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.04-2.76).
   Discussion: One-year survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest is poor. Survival is higher in patients admitted to cardiac wards. The time trend between 1985-2018 has shown a modest improvement in one-year survival rates. Research into IHCA population characteristics might elicit the issue of heterogeneity and stagnated survival over the past decades.

TI  - Functional status and quality of life in long-term survivors of cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To assess long-term survival, functional status, and quality of life in patients who experienced cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery.
   Design: Prospective, observational study.
   Setting: An 18-bed, adult cardiac surgery intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching center.
   Patients: Twenty-nine cardiac surgery patients who suffered an unexpected cardiac arrest in the immediate postoperative period.
   Interventions: The New York Heart Association classification and a questionnaire based on the Nottingham Health Profile were used to evaluate functional status and quality of life 4 yrs after hospital discharge.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of the 29 patients who experienced cardiac arrest during the first 24 hrs after cardiac surgery, 27 patients (93%) were successfully resuscitated and 23 patients (79%) survived to hospital discharge. Evaluation 4 yrs postdischarge showed that, of the 29 patients, 16 patients (55%) were still alive (long-term survivors). Functional status assess-ment of long-term survivors revealed that 12 patients (75%) were grouped in New York Heart Association class I, 3 patients (19%) in class II, and 1 patient (6%) in Glass III. None of them had a neurologic deficit. They all were living independently at home, without need of any nursing care, No patient reported any abnormal emotional reactions, and six patients (38%) had mild sleep disturbances, such as early awaking. Regarding activities of daily living, 20% returned to work, 94% were able to look after their home, 96% had a social life, 63% were sexually active, 81% were involved in their hobbies, and 75% had gone on holidays.
   Conclusions: Cardiac surgery patients who experience an unexpected cardiac arrest in the immediate postoperative period have a 55% chance of being alive 4 yrs postdischarge. The majority of these long-term survivors has a good outcome with respect to functional status and quality of life.

TI  - Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors for Long-Term Cognitive Impairment After Critical Illness: A Systematic Review
T2  - MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Long-term cognitive impairment is common in survivors of critical illness. Little is known about the etiology of this serious complication. We sought to summarize current scientific knowledge about potentially modifiable risk factors during intensive care unit (ICU) treatment that may play a substantial role in the development of long-term cognitive impairment. All searches were run on October 1, 2017. The search strategy included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid CDR, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect, Scopus, and Web of Science, and included MeSH headings and keywords related to intensive care, critical care, and cognitive disorders. Searches were restricted to adult subjects. Inclusion required follow-up cognitive evaluation at least 2 months after ICU discharge. Studies assessing patients with cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and cardiac surgery history were excluded. The search strategy resulted in 3180 studies. Of these, 28 studies (.88%) met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Delirium and duration of delirium were associated with long-term cognitive impairment after ICU admission in 6 of 9 studies in which this factor was analyzed. Weaker and more inconsistent associations have been reported with hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, fluctuations in serum glucose levels, and in-hospital acute stress symptoms. Instead, most of the studies did not find significant associations between long-term cognitive impairment and mechanical ventilation; use of sedatives, vasopressors, or analgesic medications; enteral feeding; hypoxia; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; systolic blood pressure; pulse rate; or length of ICU stay. Prolonged delirium may be a risk factor for long-term cognitive impairment after critical illness, though this association has not been entirely consistent across studies. Other potentially preventable factors have not been shown to have strong or consistent associations with long-term cognitive dysfunction in survivors of critical illness.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Neuromonitoring Modalities in Children Beyond Neonatal Period After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Postresuscitation care in children focuses on preventing secondary neurologic injury and attempts to provide (precise) prognostication for both caregivers and the medical team. This systematic review provides an overview of neuromonitoring modalities and their potential role in neuroprognostication in post-cardiac arrest children.
   Data Resources: Databases EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane, MEDLINE Ovid, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO Ovid were searched in February 2019.
   Study Selection: Enrollment of children after in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between 1 month and 18 years and presence of a neuromonitoring method obtained within the first 2 weeks post cardiac arrest. Two reviewers independently selected appropriate studies based on the citations.
   Data Extraction: Data collected included study characteristics and methodologic quality, populations enrolled, neuromonitoring modalities, outcome, and limitations. Evidence tables per neuromonitoring method were constructed using a standardized data extraction form. Each included study was graded according to the Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine scoring system.
   Data Synthesis: Of 1,195 citations, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 16 retrospective studies, nine observational prospective studies, one observational exploratory study, and one pilot randomized controlled trial. Neuromonitoring methods included neurologic examination, routine electroencephalography and continuous electroencephalography, transcranial Doppler, MRI, head CT, plasma biomarkers, somatosensory evoked potentials, and brainstem auditory evoked potential. All evidence was graded 2B-2C.
   Conclusions: The appropriate application and precise interpretation of available modalities still need to be determined in relation to the individual patient. International collaboration in standardized data collection during the (acute) clinical course together with detailed long-term outcome measurements (including functional outcome, neuropsychologic assessment, and health-related quality of life) are the first steps toward more precise, patient-specific neuroprognostication after pediatric cardiac arrest.

TI  - Neuroprognostication, withdrawal of care and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of reviewSurvivors of cardiac arrest often have increased long-term risks of mortality and disability that are primarily associated with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). This review aims to examine health-related long-term outcomes after cardiac arrest.Recent findingsA notable portion of cardiac arrest survivors face a decline in their quality of life, encountering persistent physical, cognitive, and mental health challenges emerging years after the initial event. Within the first-year postarrest, survivors are at elevated risk for stroke, epilepsy, and psychiatric conditions, along with a heightened susceptibility to developing dementia. Addressing these challenges necessitates establishing comprehensive, multidisciplinary care systems tailored to the needs of these individuals.SummaryHIBI remains the leading cause of disability among cardiac arrest survivors. No single strategy is likely to improve long term outcomes after cardiac arrest. A multimodal neuroprognostication approach (clinical examination, imaging, neurophysiology, and biomarkers) is recommended by guidelines, but fails to predict long-term outcomes. Cardiac arrest survivors often experience long-term disabilities that negatively impact their quality of life. The likelihood of such outcomes implements a multidisciplinary care an integral part of long-term recovery.

TI  - Fournier's gangrene: a review of predictive scoring systems and practical guide for patient management
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - This article aims to provide a practical guide for patient management and an overview of the predictive scorings for Fournier's gangrene (FG) that are available to aid clinicians. A literature was performed reviewing currently used scoring systems for FG and presenting a practical guide for its management based on the available evidence. There are four specific scoring systems available for the assessment of FG although few other non-specific and generic tools also exist. These specific tools include Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis, Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index, Uludag Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index, and Simplified Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index and help calculate expected mortality. Our proposed algorithm covers primary assessment, resuscitative interventions, initial investigations, urgent care, post-operative care, and long-term follow-up. The management of the FG patient can be divided into initial resuscitation, surgical debridement, ongoing ward management with antibiotic therapy, wound reconstruction, and long-term follow-up. Each facet of care is vital and requires multidisciplinary team expertise for optimal outcomes. Whilst mortality continues to improve, it remains significant, reflecting the severe and life-threatening nature of FG. More research is certainly needed into how this care is individualised, and to ensure that long-term outcomes in FG include quality of life measures after discharge.

TI  - Health-related quality of life assessment instruments for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors: A scoping review
T2  - PERFUSION-UK
AB  - Background and Objective Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been successfully and widely used in adult patients for the past 5 years. About 50% of these patients can survive and are discharged from hospitals. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is crucial for evaluating survived ECMO patients. This scoping review aims to identify instruments commonly used to measure HRQOL of ECMO survivors and give pertinent instrument characteristics.Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE (OVID), MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, and three Chinese databases from January 2012 to December 2021. Two reviewers independently reviewed publication selection and data extraction.Results Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (93%) were cross-sectional, and the median (or average) follow-up time ranged from 3 months to 9 years. Two prospective studies (7%) followed patients longitudinally until 1 year after discharge. ECMO survivors had poorer long-term HRQOL than the general population. However, it is comparable to or better than patients with other critical or chronic illnesses. Identified HRQOL assessment instruments show four generic HRQOL instruments, one disease-specific HRQOL instrument, and nineteen single-dimensional instruments. Seven instruments were used in more than three articles. SF-36 (86.2%), IES/IES-R (41.4%), and HADS (37.9%) were the most frequently used instruments.Conclusion The timing, frequency, and tools for HRQOL assessment of ECMO survivors are variable. No ECMO-specific HRQOL instrument was developed and validated. Further studies on assessment instruments are warranted. Research is also needed to identify interventions that may enhance HRQOL in ECMO survivors.

TI  - Key components of a community response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with substantial geographical, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in outcome. Successful resuscitation efforts depend on the 'chain of survival', which includes immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system, early bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with an emphasis on chest compressions, rapid defibrillation, basic and advanced emergency medical services and integrated post-cardiac arrest care. Well-orchestrated telecommunicator CPR programmes can improve rates of bystander CPR - a critical link in the chain of survival. High-performance CPR by emergency medical service providers includes minimizing interruptions in chest compressions and ensuring adequate depth of compressions. Developing local, regional and statewide systems with dedicated high-performing cardiac resuscitation centres for post-resuscitation care can substantially improve survival after OHCA. Innovative digital tools for recognizing cardiac arrest where and when it occurs, notifying potential citizen rescuers and providing automated external defibrillators at the scene hold the promise of improving survival after OHCA. Improved implementation of the chain of survival can save thousands of lives each year.

AB  - Peto, a biostatistician, and colleagues have given reasons why more clinical trials are needed with simple outcome measures and large numbers of patients.24 The first step in resuscitation research may be an example of where this dictum is appropriate. Once we have demonstrated the beneficial effects of some treatments on survival and awakening, we will need to address questions related to quality of life among those who awaken. Costly long-term follow-up studies with detailed and comprehensive measures of impairments and disabilities then will become necessary.

TI  - Short-term predictors and long-term outcome after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
CP  - 71st Annual Meeting of the Southeastern-Surgical-Congress
AB  - Few data exist in regard to long-term and functional outcome after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) repair. The present study provides such follow-up and defines the impact of variables used to grade resuscitation efforts [base deficit (BD) and core temperature (cT)]. One hundred forty-seven patients presenting with rAAA were retrospectively reviewed. Overall perioperative mortality was 35 per cent (51/147) and mean age was 72 years. Survival data were available for 99 per cent of patients with a mean and median follow-up of 45 months. Life table analysis revealed one-, 2-, and 5-year survival to be 81, 75, and 58 per cent, respectively. Eighty-three per cent of patients reported a quality of life equal to that of their preoperative status. Both initial cT (P = 0.02) and BD (P = 0.03) were significantly associated with perioperative mortality. Using a logistic regression model cT remained a significant factor (P = 0.006) associated with survival. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mode of transportation, and surgeon's training were not significant. Despite the advanced age of the present cohort, acceptable perioperative mortality and long-term survival rates were attained. The majority of patients resumed a lifestyle comparable to that of their preoperative state; therefore, long-term longitudinal follow-up suggests that aggressive management with rapid correction of BD and cT results in excellent functional outcome.

TI  - Association between previous health condition and outcome after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Overall survival of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains low, even in those with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In addition to usual prognostic characteristics, patients' medical history may also influence their outcome. This study aimed to investigate the role of pre-arrest comorbidities on hospital survival, neurological outcome and mode of death in OHCA patients with successful ROSC. Methods: From Jan 2012 to Sep 2017, all consecutive non-traumatic OHCA adults, admitted with a stable ROSC were included. Utstein characteristics, circumstances of arrest and interventions were prospectively recorded. Prior comorbidities were measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and the population was divided into 3 groups (CCI 0, CCI 1-3 and CCI > 4). The association of CCI with early and long-term mortality was assessed using logistic regression and association with withdrawal-of-life sustaining treatments (WLST) or another cause of death using multinomial regression. Results: During the study period, 777 patients were analyzed and 483 (62%) died before hospital discharge, with death rate of 49%, 60% and 70% in CCI 0, CCI 1-3 and CCI > 4 respectively. After adjustment, an increase CCI was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.47 [1.35 -4.52], p = 0.001 for CCI 1-3; OR = 2.82 [1.49-5.33], p = 0.003 for CCI > 4; ref = CCI 0). Other independent predictors were non-shockable rhythm (OR = 3.23 [2.08-5]), lack of bystander CPR (OR = 1.96 [1.22-3.13]), epinephrine dose > 2 mg (OR = 5.56 [3.70-8.33]), CA to CPR > 5 min (OR = 1.96 [1.28 -3.03]) and CPR to ROSC > 20 min (OR = 2.13 [1.39-3.23]). Using multinomial regression, an increase in CCI was associated with all modes of in-hospital death, particularly with WLST-related death (RRadj = 2.48 [1.26-4.90], p = 0.01 for CCI = 1-3 and 3.75 [1.85-8.7.58], p < 0.001 for CCI > 4, reference CCI = 0). Conclusion: Alteration of chronic health status, as assessed by an elevated CCI, was associated with a higher mortality and a worse neurological outcome in OHCA patients. Presence and burden of comorbidities should be considered in the evaluation of the prognosis in patients admitted in hospital after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Quality of life 6-months after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Evaluation of outcome after cardiac arrest focuses mainly on survival. Survivors of cardiac arrest end up in different states of health and survival alone may not be a sensitive measure for successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Objectives: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of cardiac arrest survivors with EQ-5D, a generic instrument developed by the EuroQol group. Patients and methods: From April 1997 to December 2000, all cardiac arrest adult patients admitted to an eight-bed medical/surgical (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. At 6-months after ICU discharge survivors attended a follow-up interview and answered EQ-5D questionnaire. A match-control group was created choosing for each survivor of cardiac arrest two controls, with similar age range ( 5 years) and similar Apache 11 ( 3 Apache 11 units), that were randomly selected among other ICU patients. Results: From a total of 1106 patients, 97 (9%) patients were admitted after cardiac arrest. Forty-seven patients (48%) were discharged from ICU. Of these, I I patients died in the ward. Thirty-six (37%) patients were discharged from hospital. Twelve patients died after hospital discharge but before 6-month evaluation. Five patients were not evaluated, three because they were living in distant locations and two for unknown reasons. Nineteen patients attended the follow-up consultation. Eight of these patients were actively working and six of them had managed to return to their previous activity. Eleven patients were retired and seven of these managed to return to their previous level of activity while four patients presented with anoxic encephalopathy: one with mild and one with moderate neurological dysfunction, two with severe anoxic neurological dysfunction. Although a higher percentage of cardiac arrest survivors reported more extreme problems in some dimensions than other ICU patients, no significant differences were found on HR-QOL, when evaluated by EQ-5D. Conclusions: When evaluated with EQ-5D at 6-months after ICU discharge, survivors of cardiac arrest exhibit a HR-QOL similar to other ICU survivors. These results agree with previous reports stating that CPR is frequently unsuccessful but if survival is achieved a fairly good quality of life can be expected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Long-term follow-up study of uncertainty and psychosocial adjustment among implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES
AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac death is an international health issue. Implantable defibrillators have been effective in the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death and are increasingly being utilized for primary prevention in individuals without a prior history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Although it has been well documented that some recipients experience psychological distress and have difficulty in adjusting to the device, long-term data on psychological outcomes are limited.
   Objectives: The aims of this study were to determine: (a) if there is a long-term relationship between uncertainty and psychosocial adjustment among implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients; and (b) if changes in uncertainty and/or adjustment occur over time.
   Design: A longitudinal, descriptive, correlational design was used for this long-term follow-up study (M=9.4 years, SD=23).
   Setting and participants: Ninety-four patients from 4 major teaching hospitals in New England who had participated in an investigation of uncertainty and adjustment at 1 and 8 weeks following an initial ICD implant between 1996 and 1997 were solicited. From the original sample, 41 patients had expired (44%) and 5 had heart transplants (5%). Two individuals chose not to participate. Twenty-five persons (27%) were not found despite numerous attempts to locate them. The final sample included 21 subjects (22%).
   Methods: Following university institutional review board approval, a mail survey was administered using the Dillman method. Instruments included a demographic data questionnaire, the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report and the 2-factor version of the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale.
   Results: The final sample primarily included educated, married, white males. Uncertainty and adjustment levels did not change significantly over time. Early adjustment explained 40% of the variance in overall adjustment at long-term follow-up (P=.010). Men experienced significantly more uncertainty overall [t(19)=2.925, P=.009] and complexity related to living with the device [t(19)=3.62, P=.002].
   Conclusions: Patients should be screened for psychological distress prior to device implantation so early intervention can be provided. Qualitative research is recommended to determine whether gender specific needs related to living with an ICD exist. More quantitative, long-term longitudinal data are also needed.

TI  - Outcome measures utilized in clinical trials of interventions for post-cardiac arrest syndrome: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The post-cardiac arrest syndrome (period of critical illness following return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC]) is a promising window of opportunity for clinical trials of therapeutic interventions to improve outcome from cardiac arrest. However, the methodological rigor of post-ROSC trials and the ability to compare or pool data on treatment effects across Studies requires consistent and appropriate outcome measures. We aimed to determine the Current degree of uniformity of outcome measures in clinical trials of post-ROSC interventions.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, conference proceedings, and clinical trial registrations using a comprehensive strategy. We identified experimental or quasi-experimental trials testing post-ROSC interventions in adults. Four authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standardized instruments.
   Results: The search yielded 33 potential studies, of which 13 randomized controlled trials (n = 1937) were included in the final analysis. Seven trials tested pharmacologic therapies and six tested non-pharmacologic therapies. Our main finding is that heterogeneity in the selection and reporting of outcomes limited comparability of results across studies. No two trials used exactly the same primary Outcome, and timing of measurement varied widely. We found only two commonalities: (1) indices of functional survival were used rather than Survival alone, and (2) ordinal scales of neurological function were collapsed into clinically meaningful groups ("good" versus "bad" outcome).
   Conclusion: Currently there is a lack of uniformity in selection and reporting of outcome measures among trials of post-ROSC interventions. Achieving consensus Would be an important advance for resuscitation science. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial cardiac rhythm of asystole or pulseless electrical activity in Victoria, Australia
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: While internationally reported survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improving, much of the increase is being observed in patients presenting to emergency medical services (EMS) in shockable rhythms. The purpose of this study was to assess survival and 12-month functional recovery in patients presenting to EMS in asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA).
   Methods: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry was searched for adult OHCA patients presenting in non-shockable rhythms in Victoria, Australia between 1st July 2003 and 30th June 2013. We excluded patients defibrillated prior to EMS arrival and arrests witnessed by EMS. Twelve-month quality-of-life interviews were conducted on survivors who arrested between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2012. The main outcome measures were survival to hospital discharge and 12-month functional recovery measured by the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE).
   Results: A total of 38,378 non-shockable OHCA attended by EMS were included, of which 88.0% were asystole and 11.6% were PEA. Of the patients receiving resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge was 1.1% for asystole and 5.9% for PEA (p< 0.001), with no significant improvement observed over the 10 year study period. In survivors with 12-month follow-up data, the combined rate of death, vegetative state or lower severe disability was 66.7% (95% CI 41.0-80.0%) for asystole and 44.7% (95% CI 30.2-59.9%) for PEA.
   Conclusion: Survival outcomes following OHCA with initial rhythms of asystole or PEA did not improve over the 10-year study period. Our findings indicate high rates of death within 12 months, and unfavourable functional recovery for survivors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Representativity and co-morbidity: Two factors of importance when reporting health status among survivors of cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Reports on differences between respondents and non-respondents of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors are sparse. This study compares respondents with non-respondents in a follow-up study of a consecutive sample of OHCA survivors and describes the relation between respondents' self-reported morbidity and health.
   Methods/design: Questionnaires were administered within 12 months after the OHCA. The study population was adult patients who had survived an OHCA during 2008 to 2011, with a cerebral performance score of <= 2 at discharge. The patients were identified through the Swedish registry of OHCA. The Self-administered comorbidity questionnaire and EQ VAS (Euroqol questionnaire visual analogue scale) was used to measure morbidity and health status.
   Results: Of 298 survivors, 224 were eligible for the study and 127 responded. Mean time from cardiac arrest (CA) to follow up was 178 days. Comparing the 127 respondents with the 97 lost to follow-up and non-respondents, no significant differences were found in terms of age, sex, factors at resuscitation and in-hospital interventions. The EQ VAS median was 75 (25th, 75th percentile 60,80)). Self-rated health differed between respondents reporting 0-2 conditions (n = 68) and respondents reporting more than two (n = 43), median EQ VAS 78 (68,90) and 65 (50,80)), respectively; p-value 0.0001.
   Conclusions: Despite a limited response rate, representativeness in terms of patient characteristics among survivors of OHCA with an acceptable cerebral function is achievable. A considerable proportion of the survivors lived with the burden of multi-morbidity which worsened health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Provider Perceptions of Outcomes in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
AB  - In the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU), predicting the complications and long-term impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is influenced by the providers' perceptions. Little is understood about such perceptions as they relate to provider role and experience. A multi-disciplinary group in the PCICU of a single center was surveyed regarding two patient scenarios: (1) ECMO after cardiac surgery, and (2) cardiac arrest with need for CPR. Respondents indicated their risk tolerance for potential complications of these interventions, and the impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Responses were compared based on providers' role and experience. 101 providers were surveyed and were willing to tolerate a 50% risk of death with ECMO or continued CPR but had less tolerance for the risk of other long-term morbidities. For most potential complications, nurses had the lowest risk tolerance and attending physicians the highest. Provider experience had no impact on risk tolerance. All providers underestimated HRQoL scores compared to previously published scores of patients who survived the surveyed scenarios. This survey is one of the first to explore providers' perceptions of ECMO and CPR. PCICU providers are more willing to accept the risk of death than other morbid complications, and poorly predict HRQoL outcomes. Team members have varied risk tolerance for complications and predict their impact differently. Understanding the variability of and influences on perceptions of patient outcomes could help improve communication with patients and families, team dynamics, and decision-making in the PCICU.

TI  - Long-term survivors of cardiac arrest: A narrative inquiry
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: Despite extensive knowledge and research in cardiac health there is limited understanding in how a cardiac arrest influences the life of long-term survivors. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how long-term survivors of a cardiac arrest adjusted to their new reality, expressed in their re-storied narratives. Methods: Seven individuals surviving a cardiac arrest 5-26 years ago were interviewed through in-depth conversations over a six-month period. These interviews were analysed using Clandinin and Connelly's framework of narrative inquiry. Results: Seven threads were found: Disbelief, Surveillance of their body, Loss of control and desire for normality, Keeping fit and informing others, Gratefulness, Spirituality - luck and fate, and Fragility of life and dying. Conclusions: All seven long-term survivors of cardiac arrest expressed a positive attitude. Despite the nature of the cardiac arrest and the hurdles that followed, they have a heightened appreciation for life. This indicates that after the adaptation to their new reality of being a cardiac arrest survivor life returns to a new normality.

TI  - Comprehensive pre- and in-hospital near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring after return of spontaneous circulation predicts neurological outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a prospective observational study and literature review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background An increase in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels during advanced life support in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and can predict neurological outcome. Data from the post-ROSC phase are scarce but may predict clinical outcomes as well.Methods For this prospective observational study, we measured rSO2 via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients after ROSC following OHCA in both the pre- and in-hospital setting for up to 72 h. Patients were followed up for their post-ROSC treatment and outcomes. NIRS values were then compared between patients with favorable and non-favorable neurological outcomes, and cutoff values were assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analyses. In addition, a narrative review on the topic was performed.Results Of the 27 included patients, 37% survived hospital discharge, and 26% showed favorable neurological outcomes (CPC 1 or 2). RSO2 was significantly higher in individuals with CPC 1/2 (67 [60-69] % vs. 59 [50-70] %; p = 0.049). This was even more pronounced for initial (= a mean of the first 5 min) NIRS values (70 [65-77] % vs. 57 [49-68] %; p = 0.025) and NIRS values rising in the first 10 min (43% vs. 5% of patients; p = 0.042). A ROC analysis for initial rSO2 showed a significant discriminatory power to predict CPC 1/2 (AUC = 0.789, p = 0.025), and both ROC and CART analyses suggested an optimal cutoff of approximately 62% rSO2.Conclusion We identified a potential RSO2 cutoff measured via NIRS in the post-ROSC phase after OHCA to predict favorable neurological outcomes. Initial values and rising trends may be more useful for prognostication than prolonged ICU measurements. These findings are consistent with previous literature and should prompt both larger clinical trials and consideration of this technology by resuscitation societies.

TI  - Association Between Prompt Defibrillation and Epinephrine Treatment With Long-Term Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have reported higher in-hospital survival with prompt defibrillation and epinephrine treatment in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Whether this survival benefit persists after discharge is unknown.
   METHODS: We linked data from a national IHCA registry with Medicare files and identified 36 961 patients >= 65 years of age with an IHCA at 517 hospitals between 2000 and 2011. Patients with IHCA caused by pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were stratified by prompt (<= 2 minutes) versus delayed (>2 minutes) defibrillation, whereas patients with IHCA caused by asystole or pulseless electric activity were stratified by prompt (<= 5 minutes) versus delayed (>5 minutes) epinephrine treatment. The association between prompt treatment and long-term survival for each rhythm type was assessed with multivariable hierarchical modified Poisson regression models.
   RESULTS: Of 8119 patients with an IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, the rate of 1-year survival was higher in those treated with prompt defibrillation than with delayed defibrillation (25.7% [1466 of 5714] versus 15.5% [373 of 2405]; adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.69; P< 0.0001). This survival advantage persisted at 3 years (19.1% versus 11.0%; adjusted RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23-1.69; P< 0.0001) and at 5 years (14.7% versus 7.9%; adjusted RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.22-1.83; P< 0.0001). Of 28 842 patients with an IHCA caused by asystole/pulseless electric activity, the rate of 1-year survival with prompt epinephrine treatment was higher than with delayed treatment (5.4% [1341 of 24 885] versus 4.3% [168 of 3957]; adjusted RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41; P=0.02), but this survival benefit was no longer present at 3 years (3.5% versus 2.9%; adjusted RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.95-1.45; P= 0.15) and at 5 years (2.3% versus 1.9%; adjusted RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.88-1.58; P= 0.27).
   CONCLUSIONS: Prompt defibrillation for IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was associated with higher rates of long-term survival throughout 5 years of follow-up, whereas prompt epinephrine treatment for asystole/pulseless electric activity was associated with greater survival at 1 year but not at 3 or 5 years. By quantifying the greater survival associated with timely defibrillation and epinephrine administration, these findings provide important insights into the durability of survival benefits for 2 process-of-care measures in current resuscitation guidelines.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major global health concern with high mortality despite advances in resuscitation techniques. Achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) represents merely the initial step in the extensive rehabilitation journey. This review highlights the critical role of structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation following ROSC, emphasizing the necessity of integrated physiotherapy, neurocognitive therapy, and psychosocial support to enhance quality of life and societal reintegration in survivors. Methods: This narrative review analyzed peer-reviewed literature from 2020-2025, sourced from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Emphasis was on clinical trials, expert guidelines (e.g., European Resuscitation Council 2021, American Heart Association 2020), and high-impact journals, with systematic thematic analysis across rehabilitation phases. Results: The review confirms rehabilitation as essential in addressing Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness, cognitive impairment, and post-intensive care syndrome. Early rehabilitation (0-7 days post-ROSC), focusing on parameter-guided mobilization and cognitive stimulation, significantly improves functional outcomes. Structured interdisciplinary interventions encompassing cardiopulmonary, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains effectively mitigate long-term disability, facilitating return to daily activities and employment. However, access disparities and insufficient randomized controlled trials limit evidence-based standardization. Discussion: Optimal recovery after SCA necessitates early and continuous interdisciplinary engagement, tailored to individual physiological and cognitive profiles. Persistent cognitive fatigue, executive dysfunction, and emotional instability remain significant barriers, underscoring the need for holistic and sustained rehabilitative approaches. Conclusions: Comprehensive, individualized rehabilitation following cardiac arrest is not supplementary but fundamental to meaningful recovery. Emphasizing early mobilization, neurocognitive therapy, family involvement, and structured social reintegration pathways is crucial. Addressing healthcare disparities and investing in rigorous randomized trials are imperative to achieving standardized, equitable, and outcome-oriented rehabilitation services globally.

TI  - Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and tau: predictors of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background The purpose was to evaluate glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and total-tau in plasma as predictors of poor neurological outcome after out-of-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), including comparisons with neurofilament light (NFL) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE).Methods Retrospective multicentre observational study of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in three hospitals in Sweden 2014-2018. Blood samples were collected at ICU admission, 12 h, and 48 h post-cardiac arrest. Poor neurological outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3-5 at 2-6 months after cardiac arrest. Plasma samples were retrospectively analysed for GFAP, tau, and NFL. Serum NSE was analysed in clinical care. Prognostic performances were tested with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).Results Of the 428 included patients, 328 were OHCA, and 100 were IHCA. At ICU admission, 12 h and 48 h post-cardiac arrest, GFAP predicted neurological outcome after OHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.76 (0.70-0.82), 0.86 (0.81-0.90) and 0.91 (0.87-0.96), and after IHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.77 (0.66-0.87), 0.83 (0.74-0.92) and 0.83 (0.71-0.95). At the same time points, tau predicted outcome after OHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.72 (0.66-0.79), 0.75 (0.69-0.81), and 0.93 (0.89-0.96) and after IHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.61 (0.49-0.74), 0.68 (0.56-0.79), and 0.77 (0.65-0.90). Adding the change in biomarker levels between time points did not improve predictive accuracy compared to the last time point. In a subset of patients, GFAP at 12 h and 48 h, as well as tau at 48 h, offered similar predictive value as NSE at 48 h (the earliest time point NSE is recommended in guidelines) after both OHCA and IHCA. The predictive performance of NFL was similar or superior to GFAP and tau at all time points after OHCA and IHCA.Conclusion GFAP and tau are promising biomarkers for neuroprognostication, with the highest predictive performance at 48 h after OHCA, but not superior to NFL. The predictive ability of GFAP may be sufficiently high for clinical use at 12 h after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Respiratory and vascular outcomes
T2  - REVUE DES MALADIES RESPIRATOIRES
AB  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening anomaly associated with a variable degree of pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Despite remarkable advances in neonatal resuscitation and intensive care, and new postnatal treatment strategies, the rates of mortality and morbidity in the newborn with CDH remain high as the result of severe respiratory failure secondary to PH and PPH. Later, lung function assessments show obstructive and restrictive impairments due to altered lung structure and lung damage due to prolonged ventilatory support. The long-term consequences of pulmonary hypertension are unknown. Other problems include chronic pulmonary aspiration caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux and respiratory manifestations of allergy such as asthma or rhinitis. Finally, failure to thrive may be caused by increased caloric requirements due to pulmonary morbidity. Follow-up studies that systematically assess long-term sequelae are needed. Based on such studies, a more focused approach for routine multidisciplinary follow-up programs could be established. It is the goal of the French Collaborative Network to promote exchange of knowledge, future research and development of treatment protocols.

TI  - Long-term Outcome After Survival of a Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR
AB  - Background. A cardiac arrest can lead to hypoxic brain injury, which can affect all levels of functioning. Objective. To investigate 1-year outcome and the pattern of recovery after surviving a cardiac arrest. Methods. This was a multicenter, prospective longitudinal cohort study with 1 year of follow-up (measurements 2 weeks, 3 months, 1 year). On function level, physical/cardiac function (New York Heart Association Classification), cognition (Cognitive Log [Cog-log], Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), emotional functioning (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) were assessed. In addition, level of activities (Frenchay Activities Index, FAI), participation (Community Integration Questionnaire [CIQ] and return to work), and quality of life (EuroQol 5D, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36, Quality of Life after Brain Injury) were measured. Results. In this cohort, 141 cardiac arrest survivors were included. At 1 year, 14 (13%) survivors scored below cutoff on the Cog-log. Both anxiety and depression were present in 16 (15%) survivors, 29 (28%) experienced posttraumatic stress symptoms and 55 (52%), severe fatigue. Scores on the FAI and the CIQ were, on average, respectively 96% and 92% of the prearrest scores. Of those previously working, 41 (72%) had returned to work. Most recovery of cognitive function and quality of life occurred within the first 3 months, with further improvement on some domains of quality of life up to 12 months. Conclusions. Overall, long-term outcome in terms of activities, participation, and quality of life after cardiac arrest is reassuring. Nevertheless, fatigue is common; problems with cognition and emotions occur; and return to work can be at risk.

TI  - Long-term cardiac arrest survivors of the Vienna emergency medical service
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the life of survivors after successful resuscitation and to see if there was an association with the type of emergency cardiac care. The 'Utstein-style' data of patients surviving non-traumatic cardiac arrest 24 (14-32) months were prospectively collected. The everyday activities and psychological concerns of patients with a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 and 2 using a questionnaire were analyzed. The chi(2)-square test was used for statistical analysis. The questionnaires of 92 patients (median age 59, IQR 51-68; females 36) were evaluated. Patients enjoy life (84%; n = 73), have depression (36%; n = 31), consider their survival a 'second chance' (84%; n = 73) and fear that they may suffer cardiac arrest again (56%; n = 45). The average quality of life is 7 on a scale from 0 (worst) to IO (perfect). The majority of cardiac arrest survivors have a satisfactory life. No significant correlation between the type of emergency cardiac care and post cardiac arrest life was found. The fact that there was no association with the type of emergency cardiac care may be due to the narrow selection of patients (CPC 1 and 2), the small number of patients or factors contributing to post cardiac arrest life other than emergency treatment.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after a drowning incident as a child
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: To describe health-related quality of life (HRQoL), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and school performance in subjects having received either bystander or emergency medical service personnel initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a drowning incident in childhood.
   Materials and methods: 64 children admitted to pediatric intensive care (PICU) after successful CPR between 1985 and 2007. Eleven died in the PICU, 9 other within 6 months. In 2009 all long-term survivors, except for two, lived at home. Of the 40 patients eligible for the study, 29(73%) responded to a questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed with the generic 15D, or its versions for adolescents (16D) or children (17D), and compared to that of general population. These HRQoL scores, age-specific survival probabilities, and HRQoL scores of the general population were used in a Markov model to estimate the number of QALYs gained.
   Results: Median age of the respondents was 17.3 (range: 3.0-28.4) years and 62% were male. At the time of drowning their median age had been 3.0 (range: 1.2-15.7) years. The drowning incident was associated with a significant loss in HRQoL in the oldest age group (total HRQoL total score 0.881 compared to 0.971 in the general population, P < 0.01) but not in children (HRQoL score 0.944 vs. 0.938). When submersion time exceeded 10 min mean HRQoL score was significantly lower than in patients with a shorter submersion (0.844 vs. 0.938, P = 0.032). The mean undiscounted and discounted (at 3%) number of QALYs gained by treatment were 40.8 and 17.0, respectively.
   Conclusions: A good HRQoL will be achieved in the majority of patients surviving long-term after a drowning incident in childhood, although HRQoL is affected by the submersion time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temperature Management and Health-Related Quality of Life in Children 3 Years After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic hypothermia minimizes neuronal injury in animal models of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with greater effect when used sooner after the insult. Clinical trials generally showed limited benefit but are difficult to perform in a timely manner. In this clinical study, we evaluated the association between the use of hypothermia (or not) and health-related quality of life among survivors of pediatric cardiac arrest as well as overall mortality. DESIGN: Single-center, retrospectively identified cohort with prospective assessment of health-related quality of life. SETTING: PICU of a pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Children with either out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest from January 2012 to December 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned into two groups: those who received therapeutic hypothermia at less than or equal to 35 degrees C and those who did not receive therapeutic hypothermia but who had normothermia targeted (36-36.5 degrees C). The primary outcome was health-related quality of life assessment and the secondary outcome was PICU mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied 239 children, 112 (47%) in the therapeutic hypothermia group. The median (interquartile range) of lowest temperature reached in the 48 hours post cardiac arrest in the therapeutic hypothermia group was 33 degrees C (32.6-33.6 degrees C) compared with 35.4 degrees C (34.7-36.2 degrees C) in the no therapeutic hypothermia group (p < 0.001). At follow-up, 152 (64%) were alive and health-related quality of life assessments were completed in 128. Use of therapeutic hypothermia was associated with higher lactate and lower pH at baseline. After regression adjustment, therapeutic hypothermia (as opposed to no therapeutic hypothermia) was associated with higher physical (mean difference, 15.8; 95% CI, 3.5-27.9) and psychosocial scores (13.6 [5.8-21.5]). These observations remained even when patients with a temperature greater than 37.5 degrees C were excluded. We failed to find an association between therapeutic hypothermia and lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest treated with therapeutic hypothermia was associated with higher health-related quality of life scores despite having association with higher lactate and lower pH after resuscitation. We failed to identify an association between use of therapeutic hypothermia and lower mortality.

TI  - An open window: the crucial role of the gut-brain axis in neurodevelopmental outcomes post-neurocritical illness
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Among patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, approximately 10% are discharged with a new functional morbidity. For those who were admitted with a neurocritical illness, the number can be as high as 60%. The most common diagnoses for a neurocritical illness admission include traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, post-cardiac arrest, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, meningo/encephalitis, and stroke. The gut-brain axis is crucial to childhood development, particularly neurodevelopment. Alterations on either side of the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis have been shown to alter typical development and have been associated with autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and learning disabilities, among others. For those patients who have experienced a direct neurologic insult, subsequent interventions may contribute to dysbiosis, which could compound injury to the brain. Increasing data suggests the existence of a critical window for both gut microbiome plasticity and neurodevelopment in which interventions could help or could harm and warrant further investigation.

TI  - Management and health status in the first year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF LONDON
AB  - The one-year survival, functional and cerebral capacity and patient management following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were examined in a followup study of 143 prospectively identified patients discharged from a West Yorkshire hospital between January 1987 and July 1993. One-year survival was 87%; 13 of the 18 deaths were cardiac related; 89% of survivors had no further cardiac related admissions; 98% of patients surviving to one year were capable of independent daily activities. There was low utilisation of simple drug therapy: 23% of patients were discharged taking beta-blockers and 52% aspirin; 50% of patients discharged after a primary arrhythmic event were taking antiarrhythmic therapy or were given an implantable defibrillator. Irrespective of the availability of invasive cardiac facilities, there was underutilisation of investigations: only 39% of patients were seen by a cardiologist and 54% were not evaluated for ischaemic risk. Significant improvements in patient management could probably be achieved quickly without substantial increases in resources.

TI  - Quality of life and posttraumatic stress disorder after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN
AB  - Background. Survival rate after out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is increasing. However, there is a lack of data concerning long-term quality of life of affected patients.
   Objectives. This study aims to investigate the psychological effects of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Methods. All patients who were admitted to our hospital after OHCA between 01 January 2008 and 30 June 2015 and could be discharged in good neurological condition were asked to fill out the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). For statistical analysis, the mean, standard deviation and student's t-test were used (level of significance p < 0.05).
   Results. Of 280 OHCA survivors, 56 patients (20.0%) were discharged from the hospital in good neurological condition. Of those, 20 patients (35.7%) were willing to participate in this study, among them 11 women and 9 men. Compared to the cohort of the German normative data, the results of the SF-36 questionnaire of OHCA survivors showed significantly lower values in all SF-36 subscales and also for the summary scores. There was no significant difference compared to patients with myocardial infarction. Average values of the IES-R subscales for intrusion and avoidance were 9.9 +/- 9.3 and 9.7 +/- 7.7, respectively, and 11.3 +/- 7.4 for hyperarousal. Calculations indicated the suspected diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder in 2 of the 20 patients (10%).
   Discussion. Even in patients who could be discharged from the hospital after OHCA in good neurological condition, the quality of life is significantly lower compared to the standard population but not compared to patients with myocardial infarction. The data also suggest that a relevant number of patients after OHCA is affected by posttraumatic stress disorder. Further research efforts on optimization of post-resuscitation care should not only focus on survival rates but also on improving quality of life.

TI  - CARDIAC-ARREST - PROGNOSTIC FACTORS AND OUTCOME AT ONE YEAR
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - This study was designed to determine by multivariate statistical methods the influence of 38 variables on outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and to assess neuropsychological status in long-term survivors. The charts of 181 consecutive patients resuscitated in a 1100-bed University Hospital over a 2-year period were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 181 resuscitated patients, 23 (13%) could be discharged. Outcome was significantly affected by the following variables: presence of shock or renal failure before cardiac arrest (CA) (odds ratio = 10.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.3-85.8 and odds ratio = 13.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-109.2, respectively), administration of epinephrine (odds ratio = 11.2; 95% confidence interval = 3.2-39.2) or prolonged CPR (> 15 min) (odds ratio = 4.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-13.7). By contrast, when CA occurred in uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction a significantly better prognosis could be demonstrated (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.0-0.6). The 10 long-term survivors investigated lead an independent life and all returned to former occupation. The most common complaint was moderate memory disturbance (five patients). The conclusion is that this study confirms the critical influence of cellular anoxia on prognosis and allows the improved delineation of the situations in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation appears to be hopeless or likely to be successful. The follow up in a small number of survivors has shown a good quality of life and minor neuropsychological sequellae.

TI  - Out of hospital cardiac arrest: Past, present, and future
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Advances in resuscitation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) provide an opportunity to improve public health. This review reflects on past developments, present status, and future possibilities using the science-education-implementation framework of the Utstein Formula and the clinical framework of the links in the chain of survival. With the discovery of CPR and defibrillation in the mid 20th century, resuscitation developed a scientific construct for progress. Systems of emergency community response provided operational efficiency to treat OHCA. Contemporary resuscitation involves integrated interventions in the chain of survival: early recognition, early CPR, early defibrillation, expert and timely advanced life support and hospital care, and multidimensional rehabilitation. Implementation of scientific advances is especially challenging given the unexpected nature of OHCA, the need for time-sensitive interventions, and the substantial collective of stakeholders involved in the chain of survival. Systematic measurement provides the foundation to evaluate performance and guide implementation initiatives. For many systems, telecommunicator CPR and high-performance CPR by emergency professionals are accessible, near-term programs to improve OHCA outcome. Smart technologies that activate, coordinate, and/or coach community "volunteers" to accelerate early CPR and defibrillation have conceptual promise, though robust implementation has been achieved by only a handful of systems. Longer-term strategies may leverage technology to develop a high-fidelity "life detector" or engineer and disseminate a specialized consumer defibrillator designed to bridge care until arrival of professional response.

TI  - Health-related quality of life one year after refractory cardiac arrest treated with conventional or extracorporeal CPR; a secondary analysis of the INCEPTION-trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Prospective, trial-based data comparing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) through extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) or conventional CPR (CCPR) are scarce. We aimed to determine HRQoL during 1-year after refractory OHCA in patients treated with ECPR and CCPR. Methods: We present a secondary analysis of the multicenter INCEPTION-trial, which studied the effectiveness of ECPR versus CCPR in patients with refractory OHCA. HRQoL was prospectively assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Poor HRQoL was pragmatically defined as an EQ-5D-5L health utility index (HUI) > 1 SD below the age-adjusted norm. We used mixed linear models to assess the difference in HRQoL over time and univariable analyses to assess factors potentially associated with poor HRQoL. Results: A total of 134 patients were enrolled, and hospital survival was 20% (27 patients). EQ-5D-5L data were available for 25 patients (5 ECPR and 20 CCPR). One year after OHCA, the estimated mean HUI was 0.73 (0.05) in all patients, 0.84 (0.12) in ECPR survivors, and 0.71 (0.05) in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.31). Eight (32%) survivors had a poor HRQoL. HRQoL was good in 17 (68%) patients, with 100% in ECPR survivors versus 60% in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.14). Conclusion: One year after refractory OHCA, 68% of the survivors had a good HRQoL. We found no statistically significant difference in HRQoL one year after OHCA in patients treated with ECPR compared to CCPR. However, numerical differences may be clinically relevant in favor of ECPR.

TI  - The utilization of automated external defibrillators in Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FORMOSAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background: Increasing attention to care of patient succumbed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and evidence for improved survival have resulted in many countries to encourage the use automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by legislation. In Taiwan, the amendment of the Emergency Medical Services Act mandated the installation of AEDs in designated areas in 2013. Since then, 6151 AEDs have been installed and registered in mandated and non-mandated locations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utilization of AEDs at mandated and non-mandated locations.
   Methods: This paper analyzed 217 cases in whom AEDs was used between July 11, 2013 and July 31, 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.
   Results: The highest frequency of AEDs used was in long-term care facilities, accounting for 34 (15.7%) cases. The second and third highest was in schools and commuting stations. The highest utilization rate of registered AED was in long-term care facilities (73.9%), the second was in residential areas, and the third was in hot spring areas. Employees at the designated locations or medical personnel operated the AED in 143 cases (84.6%), and bystanders, relatives, friends or others operated the AEDs in 26 cases (15.4%). On-site Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) after applying AEDs occurred in 76 cases (45.8%).
   Conclusion: Long-term care facilities had the highest utilization of AEDs and government should pay more attention to enforce the installing of AEDs in these places. The government also needs to promote the education public on how to search the AEDs locations. Copyright (C) 2018, Formosan Medical Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

TI  - Dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease-related genes and proteins following cardiac arrest
T2  - FOLIA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB  - Cardiac arrest, usually occurring in the aged population, is the most important cause of high morbidity and death in developed countries. Commonly, attention, depression, cognitive impairment, spatial memory, short- and long-term memory, executive functions, decreased quality of life and social participation are disturbed following circulation arrest. Deficits in cognitive function, similar to prodromal Alzheimer's disease dementia, following cardiac arrest remain an area of concern. Recent research has focused on the post-resuscitation period to identify mechanisms of long-term brain damage and cognitive impairment. As more patients survive longer periods after cardiac arrest, attention is focused on interventions that may enhance cognitive and psychosocial perceptions. Here, we review the new data influencing the cognitive and functional outcome in the post-resuscitation period.

TI  - Outcome predictors in cardiopulmonary resuscitation facilitated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
T2  - CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Cardiac arrest is the major cause of sudden death in developed countries. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) employs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) by conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Aim of the current study was to assess short- and long-term outcome in patients treated with ECPR in our tertiary center and to identify predictors of outcome.
   We retrospectively collected data of all patients treated with ECPR at our institution from 2002 to 2013. Outcome was assessed according to patient records; good neurological outcome was defined as cerebral performance category 1 or 2. Quality of life data was collected using EQ-5 questionnaire. Uni- and multivariate analysis was applied to identify predictors of outcome.
   One-hundred and seventeen patients were included into the study. Weaning from ECMO was successful in 61 (52 %) patients. Thirty-day survival endpoint was achieved by 27 (23 %) patients. Good neurological outcome was present in 17 (15 %) patients. Multivariate analysis revealed baseline serum lactate as the strongest predictor of outcome, whereas age and out-of-hospital CPR did not predict outcome. The optimal lactate cut-off to discriminate outcome was determined at 4.6 mmol/l [HR 3.55 (2.29-5.49), p < 0.001, log-rank test].
   ECPR represents a treatment option in patients without ROSC after conventional CPR rescuing 15 % of patients with good neurological outcome. Serum lactate may play a crucial role in patient selection for ECPR.

TI  - The second year of a second chance: Long-term psychosocial outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors and their family
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Cardiac arrest (CA) survival has diverse psychosocial outcomes for both survivors and their close family, with little known regarding long-term adjustment and recovery experiences. We explored the psychological adjustment and experiential perspectives of survivors and families in the second year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: A prospective, mixed-methods study of adult OHCA survivors in Victoria, Australia was conducted. Eighteen survivors and 12 family members completed semi-structured interviews 14-19 months post-arrest. Survivors' cognition, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured using a battery of psychological assessments. A thematic content analysis approach was applied to qualitative interview data by two independent investigators, with data coded and categorised into themes and sub-themes. Results: Survivors' cognition, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were not clinically elevated in the second year post-arrest. Subjective cognitive failures were associated with increased anxiety but not with mental state. Depression was significantly correlated with post traumatic symptoms. Six primary themes emerged from survivors' recovery stories, focused on: awakening and realisation, barriers to adjustment, psychosocial difficulties, integration, protective factors and unmet needs. Family perspectives revealed four primary themes focused on trauma exposure, survivor adjustment problems, family impact, and areas for service improvement. Conclusion: Survivors and their family members describe complex recovery journeys characterised by a range of psychosocial adjustment challenges, which are not adequately captured by common psychological measures. Post-arrest care systems are perceived by survivors and their families as inadequate due to a lack of accurate information regarding post-arrest sequalae, limited follow-up and inconsistent access to allied health care.

TI  - A Comparison between Conventional and Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - There is limited evidence comparing the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) to CPR in the management of refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare survival and neurologic outcomes associated with ECPR versus CPR in the management of OHCA. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus to identify observational studies and randomized controlled trials comparing ECPR and CPR. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool to assess studies' quality. We used random-effects models to compare outcomes between the pooled populations and moderator analysis to identify sources of heterogeneity and perform subgroup analysis. We identified 2088 articles and included 13, with 18,620 patients with OHCA. A total of 16,701 received CPR and 1919 received ECPR. Compared with CPR, ECPR was associated with higher odds of achieving favorable neurologic outcomes at 3 (OR 5, 95% CI 1.90-13.1, p < 0.01) and 6 months (OR 4.44, 95% CI 2.3-8.5, p < 0.01). We did not find a significant survival benefit or impact on neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge or 1 month following arrest. ECPR is a promising but resource-intensive intervention with the potential to improve long-term outcomes among patients with OHCA.

TI  - Long-term prognosis and clinical course of choking-induced cardiac arrest in patients without the return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival: a population-based community study from the Shizuoka Kokuho Database
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background The risk of choking increases with aging, and the number of cases of choking-induced cardiac arrest is increasing. However, few studies have examined the prognosis of choking-induced cardiac arrest. The aim of this study was to reveal the rates of survival and dependence on devices in the long term after choking-induced cardiac arrest. Methods We analyzed data from the Shizuoka Kokuho Database, which consists of claims data of approximately 2.2 million people, from April 2012 to September 2018. We selected patients with choking-induced cardiac arrest who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the hospital. Patients were excluded if they were less than 20 years old, had an upper airway tumor, received ventilation assistance, or received enteral nutrition in the month prior to cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was death, and the secondary outcomes were the rates of survival at 3-months and independence on devices. Descriptive statistics are presented and compared among age groups (20-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, 85 years and older), and survival time analysis (Kaplan-Meier method) was performed. Results In total, 268 patients were analyzed, including 26 patients in the 20-64 age group, 33 patients in the 65-74 age group, 70 patients in the 75-84 age group, and 139 patients in the >= 85 age group. The overall 3-month survival rate was 5.6% (15/268). The 3-month survival rates were 3.8% (1/26) in the 20-64 age group, 15.2% (5/33) in the 65-74 age group, 8.6% (6/70) in the 75-84 age group, and 2.2% (3/139) in the >= 85 age group. The overall 12-month survival rate was 2.6% (7/268). Of the 7 patients who survived for 12 months, 3 received ventilation management and 5 received tube or intravenous feedings at 3 months. These survivors were still receiving ventilation assistance and tube feedings in the hospital and had not been discharged at 12 months. Conclusions The prognosis of choking-induced cardiac arrest was extremely poor when patients were not resuscitated before hospital arrival. Those who survived were mostly dependent on assistive devices. Additionally, none of the survivors dependent on assistive devices had discontinued the use of the devices at the long-term follow-up.

TI  - Quality of Life and 1-Year Survival in Patients With Early Septic Shock: Long-Term Follow-Up of the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation Trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To examine long-term survival and quality of life of patients with early septic shock. Design: Prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial. Setting: Fifty-one hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Hong Kong, and the Republic of Ireland. Patients: One-thousand five-hundred ninety-one patients who presented to the emergency department with early septic shock between October 2008 and April 2014, and were enrolled in the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation trial. Interventions: Early goal-directed therapy versus usual care. Measurements and Main Results: Long-term survival was measured up to 12 months postrandomization. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQoL-5D-3L, Short Form 36 and Assessment of Quality of Life 4D at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months following randomization. Mortality data were available for 1,548 patients (97.3%) and 1,515 patients (95.2%) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Health-related quality of life data were available for 85.1% of survivors at 12 months. There were no significant differences in mortality between groups at either 6 months (early goal-directed therapy 21.8% vs usual care 22.6%; p = 0.70) or 12 months (early goal-directed therapy 26.4% vs usual care 27.9%; p = 0.50). There were no group differences in healthrelated quality of life at either 6 or 12 months (EuroQoL-5D-3L utility scores at 12 mo early goal-directed therapy 0.65 +/- 0.33 vs usual care 0.64 +/- 0.34; p = 0.50), with the health-related quality of life of both groups being significantly lower than population norms. Conclusions: In patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock, early goal-directed therapy compared with usual care did not reduce mortality nor improve health-related quality of life at either 6 or 12 months.

TI  - Short-term Gains with Long-term Consequences The Evolving Story of Sepsis Survivorship
T2  - CLINICS IN CHEST MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis is an acute, life-threatening condition that afflicts millions of patients annually. Advances in care and heightened awareness have led to substantial declines in short-term mortality. An expanding body of literature describes the long-term impact of sepsis, revealing long-term cognitive and functional impairments, sustained inflammation and immune dysfunction, increased healthcare resource use, reduced health-related quality of life, and increased mortality. The evidence challenges the notion that sepsis is an acute, transient illness, revealing rather that sepsis is an acute illness with lingering consequences. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of the emerging literature of the long-term consequences of sepsis.

TI  - Vasopressin, steroids, and epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest-a protocol for a randomized controlled trial (OHCA REVIVES trial)
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Objective: Several clinical trials have shown promising results for the vasopressin-steroid-epinephrine (VSE) triple therapy in patients experiencing in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA); however, this treatment strategy has not yet been studied in the prehospital setting. The OHCA REVIVES (A Randomized Clinical Trial of Patient Outcomes Following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Receiving Epinephrine Versus In-together Vasopressin, Epinephrine, and Steroid) trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the VSE combined therapy in improving clinical outcomes inpatients with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: The OHCA REVIVES trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, superiority cluster randomized controlled trial. Adult non-traumatic patients with OHCA treated by six participating advanced ambulance teams in Taipei and New Taipei City, Taiwan will be included. Biweekly randomized clusters of participating advanced ambulance teams were assigned to administer either VSE combined therapy or standard care during cardiac arrest. The primary outcome is sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC >= 2 h), and key secondary outcomes include prehospital ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favorable neurologic outcomes (cerebral performance category score <= 2) at hospital discharge. A total of 1344 patients will be included. Conclusion: The OHCA REVIVES trial is expected to provide new insights into pharmacological strategies for the treatment of OHCA.

TI  - Life after cardiac arrest; A retrospective study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: We decided to evaluate the life situation of the survivors after out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Method: CPR survivors who were 75 years or younger at the time and who were discharged alive from the hospital were identified consecutively. Average follow-up time was 25.5 months, and at follow-up 24% were deceased and 9% were lost. A questionnaire was completed by 93% and 71% were positive to an interview. Results: Cognitive functions were reduced as well as capacity to perform activities in daily living. This resulted in dependence on other persons for living (nursing homes) and a low return to work. Social isolation was a common complaint. The survivors also reported lower pain awareness than the reference population. As far as other aspects of health-related quality of life, this small group show many similarities with previously evaluated post-infarction patients. Conclusion: Lower pain awareness should be taken into consideration when the CPR patients have ischemic heart disease. If possible, try to prevent social isolation.

TI  - Factors Affecting Short-Term and Long-Term Outcomes After Bilioenteric Reconstruction for Post-cholecystectomy Bile Duct Injury: Experience at a Tertiary Care Centre
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Bile duct injury following cholecystectomy is an iatrogenic catastrophe associated with significant perioperative morbidity, reduced long-term survival and quality of life. There has been little literature on the long-term outcomes after surgical reconstruction and factors affecting it. The aim of this study was to study factors affecting long-term outcomes following surgical repair of iatrogenic bile duct injury being referred to a tertiary care centre. Between January 2005 to December 2011, 138 patients with bile duct injury were treated in a single surgical unit in a tertiary care referral hospital. Preoperative details were recorded. After initial resuscitation, any intra-abdominal collection was drained and an imaging of biliary anatomy was done. Once the general condition of the patient improved, patients were taken up for a side-to-side extended left duct hepaticojejunostomy. The post-operative outcomes were recorded and a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan and liver function tests were done, and then the patients were followed up at regular intervals. Clinical outcome was evaluated according to clinical grades described by Terblanche and Worthley (Surgery 108: 828-834, 1990). The variables were compared using chi-square, unpaired Student's t test and Fisher's exact test. A two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant. One hundred thirty-eight patients, 106 (76.8 %) females and 32 (23.2 %) males with an age range of 2063 years (median 40.8 +/- SD) with bile duct injury following open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were operated during this period. Majority of the patients [83 (60.1 %)] had a delayed presentation of more than 3 months. Based on imaging, Strasburg type E1 was seen in 17 (12.5 %), type E2 in 30 (21.7 %), type E3 in 85 (61.5 %) and type E4 in 6 (4.3 %). On multivariate analysis, only level of injury, longer duration of referral and associated vascular injury were independently associated with an overall poor long-term outcome. This study demonstrates level of injury at or above the confluence; associated vascular injury and delay in referral were associated with poorer outcomes in long-term follow-up; however, almost all patients had excellent outcome in long-term follow-up.

TI  - OUTCOME OF INTENSIVE-CARE OF THE OLDEST-OLD CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective:  To determine the short-term and long-term outcome of critically ill "oldest-old" (greater-than-or-equal-to 85 yrs) patients.
   Design:  Retrospective chart review and follow-up telephone interview.
   Setting:  ICUs at a tertiary care hospital.
   Methods:  The medical records of all patients greater-than-or-equal-to 85 yrs of age admitted to the ICUs during 1988 were reviewed.  Demographic information, severity of illness, major interventions, mortality rate, and hospital charges were examined.  A follow-up telephone interview was conducted to determine the quality of life and mortality rate after discharge.
   Results:  Of 34 patients greater-than-or-equal-to 85 yrs of age admitted to the ICU, 21 (62%) survived to discharge from the hospital, and 13 (62%) of these 21 patients were discharge to home.  Mean +/- SD hospital charges were $34,738 +/- 34,366.  Seventeen of the 21 patients were contacted for long-term follow-up, and ten of these patients were alive at a mean follow-up time of 18 +/- 10 months (range 1 to 32).  Eight of the ten patients described their quality of life as fair or good.
   Conclusion:  These findings suggest that age alone may be an inappropriate criterion for allocation of ICU resources.

T2  - SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY
AB  - This review article will discuss the indications for and outcomes of neonates with congenital heart disease who receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Most commonly, ECMO is used as a perioperative bridge to recovery or temporary support for those after cardiac arrest or near arrest in patients with congenital or acquired heart disease. What had historically been considered a contraindication to ECMO, is evolving and more of the sickest and most complicated babies are cared for on ECMO. Given that, it is imperative for aggressive survellience for long-term morbidity in survivors, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND Quality-of-life (QoL) instruments evaluate various aspects of physical, mental, and emotional health, but how these psychosocial characteristics impact Long-term outcome after cardiac arrest and ventricular tachycardia (VT) is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retationship of baseline QoL scores with Long-term survival of patients enrolled in the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial.
   METHODS Formal QoL measures included SF-36 mental and physical components, Patient Concerns Checklist, and Ferrans and Powers Quality-of-Life Index-Cardiac Version. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess the association of survival and these measures, adjusting for index arrhythmia type, gender, race, age, ejection fraction, history of congestive heart failure; antiarrhythmic therapy, and beta-blocker use.
   RESULTS During mean follow-up of 546 +/- 356 days, 129 deaths occurred among 740 patients. Higher baseline SF-36 physical summary scores (P <.001), higher baseline QoL Index summary scores (P =.015), and lower baseline Patient Concerns Checklist summary scores (P =.047) were associated with longer survival, even after adjustment for clinical variables. When Col. measures were examined simultaneously, only the SF-36 physical summary score remained significant (P =.002).
   CONCLUSION During recovery after sustained VT or cardiac arrest, formal baseline QoL assessment provides important prognostic information independent of traditional clinical data.

TI  - Qualitative Study of Long-Term Cardiac Arrest Survivors' Challenges and Recommendations for Improving Survivorship
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background Cardiac arrest survivorship refers to the lived experience of long-term survivors of cardiac arrest and the many postdischarge challenges they experience. We aimed to gather a nuanced understanding of these challenges and of survivors' perceptions of ways to improve the recovery process. Methods and Results We conducted 15 semistructured, one-on-one interviews with cardiac arrest survivor members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation; the interviews were conducted by telephone and recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis, informed by the Framework Method, to identify underlying themes regarding cardiac arrest survivorship challenges and recommendations to improve cardiac arrest survivorship. Regarding challenges, the overarching theme was a feeling of unpreparedness to confront postarrest challenges because of lack of resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Regarding recommendations, we uncovered 3 overarching themes including systemic recommendations (eg, providing appropriate resources and expectations, educating providers about survivorship, following up with survivors, including caregivers in treatment planning), social recommendations (eg, attending peer support groups, spending time with loved ones, providing support resources for family members), and individual coping recommendations (eg, acceptance, resilience, regaining control, seeking treatment, focusing on meaning and purpose). Conclusions We described common challenges that survivors of cardiac arrest face, such as lacking resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Additionally, we identified promising pathways that may improve cardiac arrest survivorship at systemic, social, and individual coping levels. Future studies could use our findings as targets for interventions to support and improve survivorship.

TI  - Hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia: trial-based quality of life at 6-7 years
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB  - Objective To assess the impact of hypothermic neural rescue at birth on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in middle childhood.
   Design Six-year to 7-year follow-up of surviving children from the Total Body Hypothermia for Neonatal Encephalopathy (TOBY) Trial.
   Setting Community study including a single parental questionnaire to collect information on children's HRQL.
   Patients 145 children (70 in the control group, 75 in the hypothermia group) whose parents consented and returned the questionnaire.
   Interventions Intensive care with cooling of the body to 33.5 degrees C for 72 hours or intensive care alone.
   Main outcome measures HRQL attributes and utility scores using the Health Utilities Index (HUI).
   Results At 6-7 years, speech appeared disproportionately affected when compared with other aspects of HRQL but levels of normal emotional functioning were similar in both groups. The mean (SE) HUI3 HRQL scores were 0.73 (0.05) in the hypothermia group and 0.62 (0.06) in the control group; mean difference (95% CI) 0.11 (-0.04 to 0.26).
   Conclusions Findings of non-significant differences were not unexpected; the study used data from long-term survivors in a neonatal trial and was underpowered. However, results favoured moderate hypothermia and so complement the clinical results of the TOBY Children study. The work provides further insight into the long-term HRQL impact of perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy and provides previously unavailable utility data with which to contemplate the longer term cost-effectiveness of hypothermic neural rescue.

TI  - Outcomes of adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest after implementation of the 2010 resuscitation guidelines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The 2015 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are based on an update of the 2010 guidelines with minor revisions. It is important to assess the 2010 guidelines to ensure their efficacy, which may help promote widespread adoption of the 2015 guidelines.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in a single center that evaluated patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) between 2006 and 2014. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between independent variables and outcomes.
   Results: A total of 1525 patientswere included. For patientswith initial non-shockable rhythms, the elapsed time to first adrenaline injection was significantly shorter for patients who received CPR according to the 2010 guidelines (2010-CPR) than for those who were treated according to the 2005 guidelines (2005-CPR). During post-cardiac arrest care, the percentage of patients with feverwas significantly lower and the implementation of critical interventions was significantly higher in patients who received 2010-CPR than in those who received 2005-CPR. After adjusting for the effects of confounding factors, patients who received 2010-CPR had improved neurological outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.93; p = 0.03) and survival (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.06-2.12; p = 0.02) at hospital discharge than patients who received 2005-CPR.
   Conclusions: Hospital adoption of the 2010 guidelinesmay improve the neurological and survival outcomes for IHCA patients. This improvement might result from an emphasis on the importance of high-quality CPR, post-cardiac arrest care, and teamwork in the 2010 guidelines. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Post-resuscitation care
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, the challenge is to institute measures that ensure a higher likelihood of neurologically intact survival. Regardless of the cause of collapse, multiple organ systems may be affected secondary to post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Interventions required for post-ROSC care are bundled into a care regimen: prompt identification and treatment of the cause of cardiac arrest; and treatment of electrolyte abnormalities. It is also essential to establish definitive airway management to maintain normocapnic ventilation, prevent hyperoxia, and optimise haemodynamic management via judicious intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs. Targeted temperature management after ROSC confers neuroprotection and leads to improved neurological outcomes. Glycaemic control of blood glucose levels at 6-10 mmol/L, adequate seizure management and measures to optimise neurological functions should be integrated into the care bundle. The interventions outlined can potentially lead to more patients being discharged from hospital alive with good neurological function.

TI  - Clinical review: Beyond immediate survival from resuscitation long-term outcome considerations after cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - A substantial body of literature concerning resuscitation from cardiac arrest now exists. However, not surprisingly, the greater part concerns the cardiac arrest event itself and optimising survival and outcome at relatively proximal time points. The aim of this review is to present the evidence base for interventions and therapeutic strategies that might be offered to patients surviving the immediate aftermath of a cardiac arrest, excluding components of resuscitation itself that may lead to benefits in long-term survival. In addition, this paper reviews the data on long-term impact, physical and neuropsychological, on patients and their families, revealing a burden that is often underestimated and underappreciated. As greater numbers of patients survive cardiac arrest, outcome measures more sophisticated than simple survival are required.

TI  - Neurocognitive long term follow-up study on drowned children
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: Report cognitive and neurological outcome later in life of surviving drowned children who had received CPR either from bystanders or from emergency medical services (EMS) units.
   Methods: Forty children who had drowned and admitted to pediatric intensive care unit after successful CPR between 1985 and 2007, were eligible for the study. Of those 21 gave a consent for neurological and neuropsychological examinations. All data are expressed as median (interquartile range). Mann-Whitley U, Wilcoxon signed ranks and Chi square tests were used.
   Results: The median age of the 21 patients at drowning was 2.4 (1.8, 5.5) years and 12.5 (8.6, 19.4) years at the time of neurological and neuropsychological examination. The median interval between the drowning accident and examinations was 8.1 (5.4, 14.4) years. Twelve patients (57.1%) had either signs of minor (6/21) or major neurological dysfunction (6/21). Eight subjects (40.0%) had full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) of less than 80 (range 20-78). The median estimated submersion time of the subjects with normal FIQ was 3.5 (2.0, 7.5) min, which was significantly shorter than for those with FIQ < 80, 12.5 (5.0, 22.5) min (p = 0.0013). Cognitive or neurologic deficits were detected in 17 of the 21 subjects, although 11 of them were reported to have a full recovery at the hospital discharge.
   Conclusions: This study showed that 57% of the drowned and resuscitated children had neurological dysfunction and 40% a low FIQ. Neurological and neuropsychological long term follow-up in drowned children is highly recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mid-term (30-to 90-day) neurological changes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: A nationwide retrospective study (the JAAM-OHCA registry)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Few studies have focused on mid/long-term neurological changes in out-of- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Some studies suggest that there is still a slow, small, progressive improvement in cognitive function and quality of life for this population, even in the mid/long term. However, clinical data focused on mid/longterm outcomes for OHCA patients are still lacking. This study aimed to assess mid-term neurological changes in OHCA patients. We summarized patients' improved or worsened neurological changes between 30 and 90 days. Then we identified the relationship between clinical variables and 30- to 90-day neurological improvement. Methods: A retrospective review of data (Jun 2014 - Dec 2017) from a Japanese nationwide OHCA registry was conducted. Inclusion criteria were OHCA patients >= 18 years old. Exclusion criteria were death within 30 days and missing Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 30 and 90 days. We described the distributions of 30-day and 90-day CPC scores as well as the number and portion of patients whose CPC scores improved and worsened between 30 and 90 days. Additionally, factors affecting improved neurological changes over the time period were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of the registry's 34,745 patients, 1868 were analyzed. Favorable neurological outcomes (CPC scores of 1 and 2) were seen in 1020/1868 patients at 90 days. CPC scores at 90 days were: CPC 1: 866 (46%), CPC 2: 154 (8.2%), CPC 3: 224 (12%), and CPC 4: 392 (20%), respectively. A total of 232 patients (CPC 5: 12%) died between 30 and 90 days. In 133 patients (7%), 90-day CPC scores improved compared to their 30-day scores. In 260 patients (14%), 90-day CPC scores worsened compared with their 30-day scores. Application of target temperature management was an independent factor for 30- to 90-day neurological improvement (adjusted odds ratio: 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.68). Conclusions: In our nationwide registry, 7% of resuscitated patients had improved neurological changes in the 30to 90-day period; most of the improvements were CPC scores improving from 2 to 1. Target temperature management was an independent factor associated with CPC improvement over the 30- to 90-day period. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survivorship: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Cardiac arrest systems of care are successfully coordinating community, emergency medical services, and hospital efforts to improve the process of care for patients who have had a cardiac arrest. As a result, the number of people surviving sudden cardiac arrest is increasing. However, physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving cardiac arrest may linger for months or years. Systematic recommendations stop short of addressing partnerships needed to care for patients and caregivers after medical stabilization. This document expands the cardiac arrest resuscitation system of care to include patients, caregivers, and rehabilitative healthcare partnerships, which are central to cardiac arrest survivorship.

TI  - To Survive Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Search for Meaning and Coherence
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - The primary responsibility of prehospital emergency personnel at out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) is to provide lifesaving care. Ethical considerations, decisions, and actions should be based in the patient's beliefs about health and well-being. In this article, we describe patients' experiences of surviving OHCA. By using a phenomenological approach, we focus on how OHCA influences patients' well-being over time. Nine survivors were interviewed. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is described as a sudden and elusive threat, an awakening in perplexity, and the memory gap as a loss of coherence. Survival means a search for coherence with distressing and joyful understanding, as well as existential insecurity exposed by feelings of vulnerability. Well-being is found through a sense of coherence and meaning in life. The study findings show survivors' emotional needs and a potential for prehospital emergency personnel to support them as they try to make sense of what has happened to them.

TI  - Community Socioeconomic Status and Dispatcher-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Patients with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Few studies have investigated the association between dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) performance and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) among communities with different socioeconomic statuses (SES). A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an Utstein-style population OHCA database in Tainan, Taiwan, between January 2014 and December 2015. SES was defined based on real estate prices. The outcome measures included the achievement of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the performance of DA-CPR. Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05. A total of 2928 OHCA cases were enrolled in the high SES (n = 1656, 56.6%), middle SES (n = 1025, 35.0%), and low SES (n = 247, 8.4%) groups. The high SES group had a significantly higher prehospital ROSC rate, ever ROSC rate, and sustained ROSC rate and good neurologic outcomes at discharge (all p < 0.005). The low SES group, compared to the high and middle SES groups, had a significantly longer dispatcher recognition time (p = 0.004) and lower early (<= 60 s) recognition rate (p = 0.029). The high SES group, but none of the DA-CPR measures, had significant associations with sustained ROSC in the multivariate regression model. The low SES group was associated with a longer time to dispatcher recognition of cardiac arrest and worse outcomes of OHCA. Strategies to promote public awareness of cardiac arrest could be tailored to neighborhood SES.

TI  - Health related quality of life after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in refractory cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Recent data identifies extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) as a potential addendum of conventional cardiopulmonary-resuscitation (cCPR) in highly specified circumstances and selected patients. However, consented criteria indicating eCPR are lacking. Therefore we provide first insights into the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes of patients treated with eCPR in a real world setting.
   Methods: Retrospective single-center experience of 60 consecutive patients treated with eCPR between 01/2014 and 06/2016 providing 1-year survival- and HRQoL data obtained through the Short-Form 36 Survey (SF-36) after refractory out-of-hospital- (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) of presumed cardiac etiology.
   Results: Resuscitation efforts until initiation of eCPR averaged 66 +/- 35 min and 63.3% of the patients suffered from OHCA. Fifty-five (91.7%) of the overall events were witnessed and bystander-CPR was performed in 73.3% (n = 44) of cases. Cause of arrest was dominated by acute myocardial infarction (AMI, 66.7%) and initial rhythm slightly outbalanced by ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT 53.3%). 12-month survival was 31%. Survivors experienced more often bystander-CPR (p = .001) and a shorter duration of cCPR (p = .002). While mid-term survivors' perceived HRQoL was compromised compared to controls (p <=. 0001 for PF, RP, RE and BP; p = .007 for GH; p = .016 for SF; p = .030 for MH; p = .108 for VT), scores however resembled HRQoL of subjects on hemodialysis, following cardiogenic shock or pulmonary failure treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
   Conclusions: While HRQoL scores of our survivors ranged markedly below controls, compared to patients on chronic hemodialysis, following ECMO for cardiogenic shock or pulmonary failure most of the discrepancies ameliorated. Thus, successfull eCPR in properly selected patients does translate into an encouraging HRQoL approximating chronic renal failure.

TI  - Temporal recovery and delayed decline of cognitive functions in patients with hypoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest
T2  - NEUROLOGY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Neuropsychological recovery is important for survivors' quality of life after cardiac arrest. However, most studies on cognitive symptoms after cardiac arrest examined cognitive functions within one year after onset.
   Aim: To investigate long-term changes in cognitive functions in individuals with hypoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest.
   Methods: We retrospectively recruited survivors of cardiac arrest who demonstrated cognitive dysfunction at the chronic stage. The inclusion criteria were follow-up period of more than 3 years with multiple neuropsychological examinations and brain MRI/CT within 1 year after onset.
   Results: Five patients showed various cognitive dysfunctions 1 year after onset, and the follow-up periods were 3 to 13 years. Four patients showed temporal recovery of cognitive functions over a period of a few years followed by gradual deterioration afterward. The youngest patient, 48 years of age at the final assessment, demonstrated gradual improvement without clear evidence of deterioration for 4 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintense areas at the acute stage in 2 patients, and mild cortical atrophy and cerebral hypoperfusion were observed in 3 patients. Delayed cognitive decline in our cases differs in length of the course from that in previously reported "delayed" postanoxic encephalopathy, which appears several days to weeks after onset.
   Conclusions: Cognitive functions in survivors of cardiac arrest recovered for a few years and then gradually deteriorated, which suggests hypoxic changes induce long-term impact on cerebral functions.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for postcardiotomy shock
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a widely used technique for treating postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS); however, no study has compared the long-term outcomes of patients who receive ECMO support for PCS with those of the general population post cardiac surgery.
   Methods: A total of 1141 patients who received ECMO after cardiac surgery between 2000 and 2011 were identified by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. For each patient, we matched 5 non-ECMO patients who had undergone cardiac surgery by using propensity scores calculated for age, sex, 12 comorbid diseases, Charlson score, hospital level, type of cardiac surgery, and year of index hospitalization. The outcomes included all-cause mortality, readmission for any cause, and medical expenditure.
   Results: The incidence of ECMO use after cardiac surgery in Taiwan was 1.91%. The ECMO group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality than did the non-ECMO group (61.7% vs 6.8%, odds ratio 22.34, 95% confidence interval 19.06-26.18). The risks of all-cause mortality and first readmission for any cause were greater in the ECMO group than that in the control group (P<.001, P<.001) in the first year, whereas no difference was observed after the first year of follow-up (P = .209, P = .474). Similar results were observed regarding the medical expenditure of admission after index admission discharge.
   Conclusions: Patients receiving ECMO for PCS had similar outcomes to those of the non-ECMO group after the first year of follow-up despite significantly poor outcomes during the in-hospital course.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewWe discuss indications, contraindications, and outcomes, while addressing unique considerations for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in pediatric patients with cardiac disease.Recent FindingsIncreasing clinical experience and research in ECMO utilization for pediatric patients with cardiac disease have led to better understanding of the role of timing of postoperative cannulation, strategies for single ventricle anatomy, left heart decompression, management of anticoagulation, the role of venovenous ECMO, and long-term outcomes and follow-up in this patient population.The use of ECMO for congenital and acquired heart disease has increased over time, with improving survival to hospital discharge. As more patients are cannulated onto ECMO, focus must shift towards optimizing management to further improve morbidity and mortality. Increased survival to discharge also requires that patients have structured follow-up to help maximize long term neurodevelopmental outcomes and quality of life post-critical illness with ECMO support.

TI  - Pediatric Post-Cardiac Arrest Care: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest results in a post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which can evolve in the days to weeks after return of sustained circulation. The components of post-cardiac arrest syndrome are brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia/reperfusion response, and persistent precipitating pathophysiology. Pediatric post-cardiac arrest care focuses on anticipating, identifying, and treating this complex physiology to improve survival and neurological outcomes. This scientific statement on post-cardiac arrest care is the result of a consensus process that included pediatric and adult emergency medicine, critical care, cardiac critical care, cardiology, neurology, and nursing specialists who analyzed the past 20 years of pediatric cardiac arrest, adult cardiac arrest, and pediatric critical illness peer-reviewed published literature. The statement summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and prognostication after return of sustained circulation after cardiac arrest, and it provides consensus on the current evidence supporting elements of pediatric post-cardiac arrest care.

TI  - Neurological and functional status following cardiac arrest: Method and tool utility
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Assessing the neurological and disability status of cardiac arrest (CA) survivors is important for evaluating the outcomes of resuscitation interventions. The Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) - the standard outcome measurement after CA - has been criticized for its poorly defined, subjective criteria, tack of information regarding its psychometric properties, and poor relationships with long-term measures of disability and quality of life (QOL). This study examined the relationships among the CPC and measures of global disability and QOL at discharge from the hospital and at 1 month after CA.
   Methods: Twenty-one CA survivors participated in the study. A medical chart review was conducted at the time of discharge to determine CPC and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, while 1-month in-person interview was conducted to collect mRS and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) scores. Data collected during the interview were used to determine follow-up CPC scores.
   Results: The strength of relationships among measures at discharge and 1 month ranged between fair to good. An examination of scatter plots revealed substantial variability and a wide distribution of chart review and 1-month mRS and HUI3 scores within each CPC category. CPC scores obtained through chart review were significantly better than the CPC 1-month scores, thus overestimating the participants' cognitive and disability status 1 month later.
   Conclusion: When compared to disability and quality of life measures, it is apparent that the CPC has limited ability to discriminate between mild and moderate brain injury. The validity of using the chart review method for obtaining scores is questionable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Emerging Evidence in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest-A Critical Appraisal of the Cardiac Arrest Center
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The morbidity and mortality of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to presumed cardiac causes have remained unwaveringly high over the last few decades. Less than 10% of patients survive until hospital discharge. Treatment of OHCA patients has traditionally relied on expert opinions. However, there is growing evidence on managing OHCA patients favorably during the prehospital phase, coronary and intensive care, and even beyond hospital discharge. To improve outcomes in OHCA, experts have proposed the establishment of cardiac arrest centers (CACs) as pivotal elements. CACs are expert facilities that pool resources and staff, provide infrastructure, treatment pathways, and networks to deliver comprehensive and guideline-recommended post-cardiac arrest care, as well as promote research. This review aims to address knowledge gaps in the 2020 consensus on CACs of major European medical associations, considering novel evidence on critical issues in both pre- and in-hospital OHCA management, such as the timing of coronary angiography and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR). The goal is to harmonize new evidence with the concept of CACs.

TI  - Factors predicting quality of life and societal participation after survival of a cardiac arrest: A prognostic longitudinal cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: For those patients who suffer unfavourable outcome after survival of cardiac arrest, it is important to know whether this can be predicted at an early stage. Support can subsequently be provided. This study aimed to identify early prognostic factors of quality of life (QOL) and societal participation at one year post-cardiac arrest.
   Methods: The design was a prospective longitudinal cohort study following cardiac arrest survivors up to one year. Prognostic personal, injury-related, function-related and subjective outcome factors were selected and entered into a hierarchical regression model to assess whether they were predictive of QOL and societal participation at one year post-cardiac arrest.
   Results: Hundred and ten cardiac arrest survivors were included. Not having a partner, more functional limitations (at two weeks) and cognitive complaints were significantly predictive of lower physical QOL, while higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms (at three months) were significant predictors of mental QOL. A neurological history and higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly predictive of lower brain injury-specific QOL. Societal participation was only predicted by premorbid functioning.
   Conclusion: This study identified prognostic factors of QOL and societal participation one year after survival of cardiac arrest. Screening of these factors in early stages can identify those survivors with possibly unfavourable QOL at one year post cardiac arrest. For those survivors, preventive and targeted interventions may be offered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cardiac arrest: long-term cognitive and imaging analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Neurological and cognitive sequelae resulting from cardiac arrest (CA), despite their potential personal and social impact, are usually not considered as major outcome measures in long-term analysis of survivors. The aim of this study is to analyze the contribution of neuropsychological testing and cerebral imaging to the development of a long-term classification of neurological impairment. Patients and methods: A total of 19 patients admitted over a 3 years period in an eight-bed intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital with a diagnosis of CA were alive and attended a 6-month follow-up consultation. Eleven of these patients agreed to participate in this study carried out between I and 3 years after CA. Patients were classified using the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC), neurological examination, detailed cognitive testing and computerized tomography (CT) scan with qualitative and quantitative imaging analysis. Results: Six of the 11 patients had good cerebral performance. Verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory scores were associated with CPC. All patients with at least moderate cerebral disability had abnormal verbal memory test results compared with only one survivor with CPC 1; visuo-spatial short-term memory was abnormal in four moderately affected survivors and normal in those with CPC 1. The bicaudate ratio evaluated in the CT scan was correlated with the verbal memory score while the III ventricle diameter correlated with the executive functions score, suggesting involvement of different brain areas in these functions. Conclusions: Neuropsychological and CT scan measurements are proxy measures of long-term impairment of CA survivors, providing a dichotomized global evaluation of CA survivors in close agreement with CPC.

TI  - One-Year Follow-Up of Patients Admitted for Emergency Coronary Angiography after Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - (1) Background: Despite the improvement of the in-hospital survival rate after aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD), cerebral anoxia may have severe neurologic consequences and may impair long-term outcome and quality of life of surviving patients. The aim of this study was to assess neurological outcomes at one year after resuscitated cardiac arrest; (2) Methods: This prospective, observational, and multicentre study included patients >18 yo admitted in the catheterisation laboratory for coronary angiography after aborted SCD between 1 May 2018 and 31 May 2020. Only patients who were discharged alive from hospital were evaluated. The primary endpoint was survival without neurological sequelae at one-year follow-up defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) of one or two. Secondary end points included all-cause mortality, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, neurologic evaluation at discharge, three-month and one-year follow-up using the CPC scale, and quality of life at 1 year using the Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) questionnaire; (3) Results: Among 143 patients admitted for SCD within the study period, 61 (42.7%) were discharged alive from hospital, among whom 55 (90.1%) completed the one-year follow-up. No flow and low flow times were 1.9 +/- 2.4 min and 16.5 +/- 10.4 min, respectively. For 93.4% of the surviving patients, an initial shockable rhythm (n = 57) was observed and acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed in 75.4% of them (n = 46). At 1 year, survival rate without neurologic sequelae was 87.2% (n = 48). Patients with poor outcome were older (69.3 vs. 57.4 yo; p = 0.04) and had lower body mass index (22.4 vs. 26.7; p = 0.013) and a lower initial Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) (32.1% vs. 40.3%; p = 0.046). During follow-up, neurological status improved in 36.8% of patients presenting sequelae at discharge, and overall quality of life was satisfying for 66.7% of patients according to the QOLIBRI questionnaire; (4) Conclusions: Among patients admitted to the catheterisation laboratory for aborted SCD, mainly related to Acute Coronary Syndrom (ACS), less than a half of them were alive at discharge. However, the one-year survival rate without neurological sequelae was high and overall quality of life was good.

TI  - Predicting survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients undergoing targeted temperature management: The Polish Hypothermia Registry Risk Score
T2  - CARDIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Prompt reperfusion and post-resuscitation care, including targeted temperature management (TTM), improve survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. To predict inhospital mortality in OHCA patients treated with TTM, the Polish Hypothermia Registry Risk Score (PHR-RS) was developed. The use of dedicated risk stratification tools may support treatment decisions.
   Methods: Three hundred seventy-six OHCA patients who underwent TTM between 2012 and 2016 were retrospectively analysed and whose data were collected in the Polish Hypothermia Registry. A multivariate logistic regression model identified a set of predictors of in-hospital mortality that were used to develop a dedicated risk prediction model, which was tested for accuracy.
   Results: The mean age of the studied population was 59.2 +/- 12.9 years. 80% of patients were male, 73.8% had shockable rhythms, and mean time from cardiac arrest (CA) to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was 7.2 +/- 8.6 min. The inputs for PHR-RS were patient age and score according to the Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia (MTH) Scale. Criteria for the MTH score consisted of time from CA to CPR above 10 min, time from CA to the return of spontaneous circulation above 20 min, in-hospital CA, unwitnessed CA, and non-shockable rhythm, each counted as 1 point. The predictive value of PHR-RS was expressed as an area under the curve of 0.74.
   Conclusions: PHR-RS is one of the simplest and easiest models to use and enables a reliable prediction of in-hospital mortality in OHCA patients treated with TTM.

TI  - Immature/total granulocyte ratio: A promising tool to assess the severity and the outcome of post-cardiac arrest syndrome
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The immature/total granulocyte (I/T-G) ratio increases during severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This study evaluated the I/T-G ratio as a predictor of poor outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Methods: We conducted a pilot prospective cohort study of patients who were admitted in our intensive care unit (ICU) during a one-year period after post-OHCA resuscitation. I/T-G ratio measurements were obtained from blood samples collected on admission using flow cytometry and the outcomes were ICU mortality and post-cardiac arrest syndrome.
   Results: Among the 130 patients (76% male, median age 54 [46-67] years), the median I/T-G ratio was 0.85 [0.42-1.98]%. The I/T-G ratio was poorly correlated with the SOFA score and lactate level on day 1 (r = 0.25, p = 0.005 and r = 0.5, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with high I/T-G ratios were more likely to develop post-resuscitation shock (37% vs. 58%, p = 0.02). Patients dying from post-resuscitation shock had a higher I/T-G ratio than patients dying from neurological causes (2 [1-4]% vs. 1.2 [0.6-1.2]%, p = 0.02). The area under the ROC curve based on the I/T-G ratio was 0.82 for predicting ICU mortality.
   Conclusion: The I/T-G ratio appears to be an accurate predictor of poor outcome. However, the added clinical value of this marker and the possible involvement of immature granulocytes in the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest syndrome remain to be investigated.

TI  - Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in the 1990s: Resource utilization, long-term survival, and quality of life after repair
T2  - VASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) is a lethal disease. The aim of this study was to assess resource use, long-term outcome, and functional status of patients surviving repair of RAAAs. A retrospective review was made over a 42-month period. Functional status was assessed by use of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36) at a mean follow-up time of 29 months. Fifty-seven patients with an RAAA underwent surgical repair. The overall in-hospital mortality rate after surgical repair was 39%. Risk factors predictive for a poor hospital outcome were preoperative systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hematocrit less than 25%, transfusion requirements greater than 15 units, renal failure, and need for perioperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Total hospital costs were significantly higher for survivors compared with nonsurvivors. Hospital cost per survivor was $86,977. Intensive Care Unit, laboratory, and blood bank costs accounted for 50% of total hospital costs. Based on the eight domains of the MOS SF-36, no significant difference was found between the functional status of those patients surviving emergent repair of RAAAs and that of the general population of a similar age.

TI  - "Please. Don't. Die." A Grounded Theory Study of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an important determinant of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), yet rates of bystander CPR are highly variable. In an effort to promote bystander CPR, the procedure has been streamlined, and ultrashort teaching modalities have been introduced. CPR has been increasingly reconceptualized as simple, safe, and easy to perform; however, current methods of CPR instruction may not adequately prepare lay rescuers for the various logistical, conceptual, and emotional challenges of resuscitating a victim of cardiac arrest.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: We adopted a constructivist grounded theory methodology to qualitatively explore bystander CPR and invited lay rescuers who had recently (ie, within 1 week) intervened in an OHCA to participate in semistructured interviews and focus groups. We used constant comparative analysis until theoretical saturation to derive a midrange explanatory theory of bystander CPR. We constructed a 3-stage theoretical model describing a common experiential process for lay rescuer intervention in OHCA: Being called to act is disturbing, causing panic, shock, and disbelief that must ultimately be overcome. Taking action to save the victim is complicated by several misconceptions about cardiac arrest, where victims are mistakenly believed to be choking, and agonal respirations are misinterpreted to mean the victim is alive. Making sense of the experience is challenging, at least in the short term, where lay rescuers have to contend with self-doubt, unanswered questions, and uncomfortable emotional reactions to a traumatic event.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that current CPR training programs may not adequately prepare lay rescuers for the reality of an OHCA and identifies several key knowledge gaps that should be addressed. The long-term psychological consequences of bystander intervention in OHCA remain poorly understood and warrant further study.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes of Pediatric Cardiac Patients Supported by Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an important form of short-term mechanical support in children with cardiac disease, but information on long-term outcomes and quality of life is limited. The primary objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcomes of children previously supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiac etiologies.
   Design: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with cardiac disease managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2012, at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Survivors completed patient- and parent-reported verbal and written surveys, and univariate analyses assessed risk factors for long-term outcomes.
   Setting: Tertiary-care children's hospital.
   Patients: Patients with cardiac disease managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Over 18 years, 396 patients were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with 43% survival to discharge. The median age at cannulation was 78 days. The majority had congenital heart disease (86%), surgery prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (71%), and cardiopulmonary arrest as the primary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indication (53%). With 6-year median follow-up, 66% are known to be deceased, including 38 deaths after hospital discharge. Among survivors at discharge, 65 (38%) completed the phone survey, and 33 (19%) completed the written survey. Negative clinical outcomes, defined as having at least significant physical limitations or "fair" or "poor" health, were present in 18% of patients. No patient-or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related variables were associated with negative outcomes in univariate analyses. There were significantly lower self-reported and parent-reported written Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory quality of life scores in children compared with healthy individual normative data but no differences in adolescents.
   Conclusions: In this series of pediatric cardiac patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, mortality was 66% with 6-year median follow-up. The majority reported positive outcomes with respect to health and physical limitations, but children reported lower quality of life compared with healthy individuals.

TI  - VA-ECMO-assisted resuscitation for refractory cardiac arrest
T2  - DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is an invasive medical intervention using mechanical circulatory support for treating cardiac arrest beyond the limits of conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). ECPR uses veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) to maintain organ perfusion while treating reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Commonly applied criteria to select suitable patients include witnessed cardiac arrest, early bystander CPR, and a time frame of less than 60 minutes from collapse to ECPR initiation. A meta-analysis by Low et al. (2023), which included 11 studies with 4,595 ECPR and 4,597 CCPR patients, demonstrated that ECPR was not only associated with higher survival rates, but also better long-term neurological outcomes. Additionally, a higher number of ECPR procedures per center was linked to reduced mortality rates. A 2024 updated meta-analysis confirmed these findings and demonstrated further that ECPR significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Further insights on this topic can be gained from the individual studies on ECPR for treatment of OHCA: In general, there are several different modalities of how ECPR can be deployed, ranging from implantation at the site of the index event vs. implantation in the hospital, and even the place of implantation in the hospital varies. However, it seems that the actual pathway of how the VA-ECMO is implanted is of lower importance, and highly depends on the local infrastructure of a given hospital (rural area vs. municipal area), while achieving the lowest possible low-flow time should be the primary goal. The available data also shows that, despite all the advances, ECPR is still a high-risk intervention which is very demanding on the personnel and requires an abundance of resources. Overall, ECPR is a promising therapy for patients with OHCA to improve survival with good neurological outcome, but only if applied in a highly structured and standardized way, and in carefully selected patients.

TI  - The epidemiology of out-of-hospital 'sudden' cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - It is difficult to assemble data from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest since there is often lack of objective information. The true incidence of sudden cardiac death out-of-hospital is not known since far from all of these patients are attended by emergency medical services. The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest increases with age and is more common among men. Among patients who die, the probability of having a fatal event outside hospital decreases with age: i. e. younger patients tend to more often die unexpectedly and outside hospital. Among the different initial arrhythmias, ventricular Fibrillation is the most common among patients with cardiac aetiology. The true distribution of initial arrhythmias is not known since several minutes most often elapse between collapse and rhythm assessment. Most patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a cardiac aetiology. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests most frequently Occur in the patient's home, but the prognosis is shown to be better when they occur in a public place. Witnessed arrest. ventricular fibrillation as initial arrhythmia and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are important predictors for immediate survival. In the long-term perspective. cardiac arrest in connection with acute myocardial infarction. high left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate age. absence of other heart failure signs and no history of myocardial infarction promotes better prognosis. Still there is much to learn about time trends. the influence of patient characteristics, comorbidity and hospital treatment among patients with prehospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Comparison of health-related quality of life and functional recovery measurement tools in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Although a number of validated health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) instruments exist for critical care populations, a standardised approach to assessing the HR-QOL of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors has not been developed. We sought to compare the responses of 12-month OHCA survivors to three HR-QOL and functional recovery instruments, and assess instrument validity.
   Methods: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry invited 12-month OHCA survivors to participate in telephone follow-up between January 2011 and December 2015. Responders provided answers to the 12 Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Three-Level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). The SF-12 was also used to derive the SF-6D. Responses were used to assess the interpretability and construct validity of the instruments.
   Results: A total of 1188 patients and proxies responded. Large ceiling effects were observed for the EQ-5D-3L (patients = 46%, proxies = 23%). Substantial variability was also observed in SF-6D responses for patients who reported full health according to the EQ-5D-3L. For patient responders, the strongest correlations were observed between the EQ-5D-3L index score and SF-6D (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001), and between the SF-6D and SF-12 physical component (rho=0.69, p < 0.001). The distribution of the SF-6D and EQ-5D-3L differed significantly for patients reporting a lower or upper moderate GOSE outcome and lower or upper good recovery (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).
   Conclusions: The EQ-5D-3L demonstrated limited interpretability due to the presence of ceiling effects. However, the measurement properties of the SF-12, SF-6D and GOSE suggest that these may be useful measures of HR-QOL and functional recovery in OHCA survivors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Recommended guidelines for reviewing, reporting, and conducting research on post-resuscitation care: The Utstein style
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The aim of this report is to establish recommendations for reviewing, reporting, and conducting research during the post-resuscitation period in hospital. It defines data that are needed for research and more specialised registries and therefore supplements the recently updated Utstein template for resuscitation registries. The updated Utstein template and the out-of-hospital "Chain of Survival" describe factors of importance for successful resuscitation up until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
   Several factors in the in-hospital phase after ROSC are also likely to affect the ultimate outcome of the patient. Large differences in survival to hospital discharge for patients admitted alive are reported between hospitals. Therapeutic hypothermia has been demonstrated to improve the outcome, and other factors such as blood glucose, haemodynamics, ventilatory support, etc., might also influence the result. No generally accepted, scientifically based protocol exists for the post-resuscitation period in hospital, other than general brain-oriented intensive care. There is little published information on this in-hospital phase.
   This statement is the result of a scientific consensus development process started as a symposium by a task force at the Utstein Abbey, Norway, in September 2003. Suggested data are defined as core and supplementary and include the following categories: pre-arrest co-morbidity and functional status, cause of death, patients' quality of life, in-hospital system factors, investigations and treatment, and physiological data at various time points during the first three days after admission.
   It is hoped that the publication of these recommendations will encourage research into the in-hospital post-resuscitation phase, which we propose should be included in the chain-of-survival as a fifth ring. Following these recommendations should enable better understanding of the impact of different in-hospital treatment strategies on outcome. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Health care costs, long-term survival, and quality of life following intensive care unit admission after cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction The purpose of this study was to investigate the costs and health status outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients who present after sudden cardiac arrest with in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Methods Five-year survival, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 questionnaire, SF-36), ICU costs, hospital costs and post-hospital health care costs per survivor, costs per life year gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life year gained of patients admitted to a single ICU were assessed.
   Results One hundred ten of 354 patients (31%) were alive 5 years after hospital discharge. The mean health status index of 5-year survivors was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.85). Women rated their health-related quality of life significantly better than men did (0.87 versus 0.74; P < 0.05). Costs per hospital discharge survivor were 49,952 n. Including the costs of post-hospital discharge health care incurred during their remaining life span, the total costs per life year gained were 10,107 n. Considering 5-year survivors only, the costs per life year gained were calculated as 9,816 n or 14,487 n per quality-adjusted life year gained. Including seven patients with severe neurological sequelae, costs per life year gained in 5-year survivors increased by 18% to 11,566 n.
   Conclusion Patients who leave the hospital following cardiac arrest without severe neurological disabilities may expect a reasonable quality of life compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Quality-adjusted costs for this patient group appear to be within ranges considered reasonable for other groups of patients.

TI  - THE OPTIMUM TIMING OF RESUSCITATIVE THORACOTOMY FOR NONTRAUMATIC OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a promising method for non-traumatic cardiac arrest. In this preliminary study, we investigated the optimum timing of thoracotomy which brings high rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and keeps the incidence of unnecessary thoracotomy minimal. Ninety-five adult patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were analyzed. Of those, 26 patients were treated by the open-chest CPR in a prospective consecutive fashion. In this group, the ROSC rate was investigated in connection with the interval from hospital arrival, or ambulance call, to thoracotomy. Another 69 patients were treated by standard CPR. In this uncontrolled group, the interval from arrival at hospital to ROSC was investigated to define the 'natural hospital course' by the conventional treatment. Patient characteristics in the open-chest CPR group and the standard CPR group were similar. In the open-chest CPR group, 15 patients obtained ROSC. There was a tendency that the ROSC rate was highest in the patients with thoracotomy within 5 min of hospital arrival and declined as the timing of thoracotomy was delayed. Similar tendency was noted when the timing of thoracotomy was counted from the ambulance call. In the standard CPR group, only two patients obtained ROSC during the initial 5 min of hospital course. These results suggest that thoracotomy within 5 min of hospital arrival brings the highest ROSC Tate while keeps the incidence of unnecessary thoracotomy acceptable.

TI  - Hospital survival and long term quality of life after emergency institution of venoarterial ECMO for refractory circulatory collapse
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - Background. Thanks to significant technical improvements, VA-ECMO is increasingly used to reverse circulatory collapse refractory to standard treatments.
   Methods. We studied patients who underwent VA-ECMO due to primary cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest between January 2008 and June 2011 at our institution. Variables related to hospital survival were analyzed. Long-term survival and health-related quality of life were checked.
   Results. VA-ECMO was instituted in 23 patients: 17 outpatients and 6 inpatients. Seven of the outpatients were admitted to hospital under ongoing CPR. In these pts, time to CPR was 7 min (6-8) and time to ECMO 93 min (74-107); after 20 hours (16-22), all these pts died. Among remaining 16 pts, 6 were bridged to heart transplant and 4 to heart recovery; 8 survived to hospital discharge and 7 were alive with high health-related quality of life after 46 months (36-54). Ongoing CPR, inotropic score and lactates at cannulation did not differ between survivors and non-survivors; duration of shock, SOFA score and serum creatinine at ECMO institution, and lactates and fluid balance after 36 hours were higher in non-survivors. Patients could be kept on spontaneous breathing for >30% of time while on VA-ECMO.
   Conclusion. Emergency VA-ECMO institution can reverse refractory acute cardiovascular collapse, provided it is carried out before significant organ dysfunction occurs. Light sedation and spontaneous breathing while on VA-ECMO can be well tolerated by patients, but related clinical benefits should be proved. Patients successfully bridged to heart recovery or transplant are candidates for long-term good quality of life.

TI  - PREDICTING LONG-TERM COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN SURVIVORS AFTER CARDIAC ARREST: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: International guidelines recommend early screening for identification of patients who are at risk of long-term cognitive impairments after cardiac arrest. However, information about predictors is not provided. A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify early predictors of long-term cognitive outcome after cardiac arrest. Methods: Scopus and PubMed were systematically searched to identify studies on early predictors of long-term cognitive outcome in patients after cardiac arrest. The population included adult cardiac arrest survivors and potential early predictors were demographics, early cognitive screening scores, imaging measures, electroencephalographic measures, and levels of blood biomarkers. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results: Five articles were included. Risk of bias was assessed as low or moderate. Most detected longterm cognitive impairments were in the domain of memory. Coma duration (2 studies), early cognitive impairments by the self-developed clinical Bedside Neuropsychological Test Battery (BNTB) screener (2 studies), and high S-100B levels on day 3 (2 studies) were the most prominent identified determinants of cognitive impairment on the group level. On the individual patient level, a score on the BNTB of <= 94.5 predicted cognitive impairments at 6 months after cardiac arrest (1 study without external validation). Studies on brain imaging and electroencephalography are lacking. contribute to prediction of long-term cognitive impairment after cardiac arrest. Evidence is scarce for S-100B levels and coma duration and absent for measures derived from brain imaging and electroencephalography.

TI  - Thrombolysis before venoarterial ECMO for high-risk pulmonary embolism: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - PurposeDespite systemic thrombolysis, a few patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) remain hemodynamically unstable. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a considerable lifesaving therapy but systemic thrombolysis before cannulation could carry a high risk of hemorrhage and alter the prognosis.MethodsBetween June 2012 and June 2023, we retrospectively analyzed from three intensive care units in Sorbonne University, ECMO-related complications and 90-day mortality for high-risk PE patients who received ECMO without previous systemic thrombolysis compared to those cannulated after systemic thrombolysis failure. Hospital discharge survivors were assessed for long-term health-related quality of life and echocardiographic evaluations.Results72 high-risk PE patients [median age 48 (37-61) years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) 74 (60-85)] were placed on VA-ECMO for 5 (5-7) days. 31 (43%) patients underwent pre-ECMO thrombolysis (thrombolysis ECMO group, T +) compared to 41 patients (57%, no thrombolysis ECMO group, T-). There was more pre-ECMO cardiac arrest in the thrombolysis ECMO group (94% vs. 67%, p = 0.02). Ninety-day survival was not different between groups (39% vs 46%, log-rank test, p = 0.31). There was no difference in severe hemorrhages (61% vs 59%, p = 1). Twenty-five over 28 patients attended follow-up at a median time of 69 (52-95) months. Long-term quality of life was acceptable and none of them experienced chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.ConclusionsNinety-day survival and bleeding events rates did not differ in patients treated with VA-ECMO after systemic thrombolysis compared to those who were not. Recent systemic thrombolysis, as a single parameter, should not be considered as a contraindication for VA-ECMO in high-risk PE.

TI  - Application of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices and their value in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A retrospective analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Cardiac arrest is an event with a limited prognosis which has not substantially changed since the first description of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in 1960. A promising new treatment approach may be mechanical CPR devices (mechanical CPR).
   Methods
   In a retrospective analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry between 2007-2014, we examined the outcome after using mechanical CPR on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We compared mechanical CPR to manual CPR. According to preclinical risk factors, we calculated the predicted ROSC-after-cardiac-arrest (RACA) score for each group and compared it to the rate of ROSC observed. Using multivariate analysis, we adjusted the influence of the devices' application on ROSC for epidemiological factors and therapeutic measures.
   Results
   We included 19,609 patients in the study. ROSC was achieved in 51.5% of the mechanical CPR group (95%-CI 48.2-54.8%, ROSC expected 42.5%) and in 41.2% in the manual CPR group (95%-CI 40.4-41.9%, ROSC expected 39.2%). After multivariate adjustment, mechanical CPR was found to be an independent predictor of ROSC (OR 1.77; 95%-CI 1.48-2.12). Duration of CPR is a key determinant for achieving ROSC.
   Conclusions
   Mechanical CPR was associated with an increased rate of ROSC and when adjusted for risk factors appeared advantageous over manual CPR. Mechanical CPR devices may increase survival and should be considered in particular circumstances according to a physicians' decision, especially during prolonged resuscitation.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and propensity score-matched
T2  - ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB  - Background In selected patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation represents a promising approach when conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation fails to achieve return of spontaneous circulation. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to November 28, 2021, for randomized trials and observational studies reporting propensity score-matched data and comparing adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation with those treated with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary outcome was survival with favorable neurological outcome at the longest follow-up available. Secondary outcomes were survival at the longest follow-up available and survival at hospital discharge/30 days. Results We included six studies, two randomized and four propensity score-matched studies. Patients treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation had higher rates of survival with favorable neurological outcome (81/584 [14%] vs. 46/593 [7.8%]; OR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.41-3.15; p < 0.001, number needed to treat 16) and of survival (131/584 [22%] vs. 102/593 [17%]; OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.87; p = 0.02) at the longest follow-up available compared with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Survival at hospital discharge/30 days was similar between the two groups (142/584 [24%] vs. 122/593 [21%]; OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 0.95-1.66; p = 0.10). Conclusions Evidence from randomized trials and propensity score-matched studies suggests increased survival and favorable neurological outcome in patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Large, multicentre randomized studies are still ongoing to confirm these findings.

TI  - Near death experiences, cognitive function and psychological outcomes of surviving cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Cardiac arrest is associated with a number of cognitive processes as well as long term psychological outcomes. Recent studies have indicated that approximately 10-20% of cardiac arrest survivors report cognitive processes, including the ability to recall specific details of their resuscitation from the period of cardiac arrest. In addition it has been demonstrated that these cognitive processes are consistent with the previously described near death experience and that those who have these experiences are left with long term positive life enhancing effects. There have also been numerous studies that have indicated that although the quality of life for cardiac arrest survivors is generally good, some are left with long term cognitive impairments as welt as psychological sequelae such as post-traumatic stress disorder. This paper will review near death experiences, cognitive function and psychological outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quality of Life Following Urgent LVAD Implantation for ECMO Therapy in Cardiogenic Shock: A Long-Term Follow-Up
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Over the past decade, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has developed into a mainstream treatment for refractory cardiogenic shock (CS) to maximal conservative management. Successful weaning of VA-ECMO may not be possible, and bridging with further mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as urgent implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), may represent the only means to sustain the patient haemodynamically. In the recovery phase, many survivors are not suitably prepared physically or psychologically for the novel issues encountered during daily life with an LVAD. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of our institutional database between 2012 and 2019 was performed to identify patients treated with VA-ECMO for CS who underwent urgent LVAD implantation whilst on MCS. Post-cardiotomy cases were excluded. QoL was assessed prospectively during a routine follow-up visit using the EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 level (EQ-5D-5L) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys. Results: Among 126 in-hospital survivors of VA-ECMO therapy due to cardiogenic shock without prior cardiac surgery, 31 (24.6%) urgent LVAD recipients were identified. In 11 (36.7%) cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed (median 10, range 1-60 min) before initiation of VA-ECMO, and in 5 (16.7%) cases, MCS was established under CPR. Mean age at LVAD implantation was 51.7 (+/-14) years and surgery was performed after a mean 12.1 (+/-8) days of VA-ECMO support. During follow-up of 46.9 (+/-25.5) months, there were 10 deaths after 20.4 (+/-12.1) months of LVAD support. Analysis of QoL questionnaires returned a mean EQ-5D-5L score of 66% (+/-21) of societal valuation for Germany and a mean PHQ-9 score of 5.7 (+/-5) corresponding to mild depression severity. When compared with 49 elective LVAD recipients without prior VA-ECMO therapy, there was no significant difference in QoL results. Conclusions: Patients requiring urgent LVAD implantation under VA-ECMO support due to CS are associated with comparable quality of life without a significant difference from elective LVAD recipients. Close follow-up is required to oversee patient rehabilitation after successful initial treatment.

TI  - Long-Term Functional Outcome and Quality of Life Following In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest-A Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the functional outcome and health-related quality of life of in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors at 6 and 12 months. Design: A longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Seven metropolitan hospitals in Australia. Patients: Data were collected for hospitalized adults (>= 18 yr) who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest, defined as "a period of unresponsiveness, with no observed respiratory effort and the commencement of external cardiac compressions." Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Prior to hospital discharge, patients were approached for consent to participate in 6-month and 12-month telephone interviews. Outcomes included the modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Euro-Quality of Life 5 Dimension 5 Level, return to work and hospital readmissions. Forty-eight patients (80%) consented to follow-up interviews. The mean age of participants was 67.2 (+/- 15.3) years, and 33 of 48 (68.8%) were male. Good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score <= 3) was reported by 31 of 37 participants (83.8%) at 6 months and 30 of 33 (90.9%) at 12 months. The median Euro-Quality of Life-5D index value was 0.73 (0.33-0.84) at 6 months and 0.76 (0.47-0.88) at 12 months. The median Euro-Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale score at 6 months was 70 (55-80) and 75 (50-87.5) at 12 months. Problems in all Euro-Quality of Life-5D-5 L dimension were reported frequently at both time points. Hospital readmission was reported by 23 of 37 patients (62.2%) at 6 months and 16 of 33 (48.5%) at 12 months. Less than half of previously working participants had returned to work by 12 months. Conclusions: The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors had a good functional outcome and health-related quality of life at 6 months, and this was largely unchanged at 12 months. Despite this, many reported problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression. Return to work rates was low, and hospital readmissions were common.

TI  - Application of Refill, Recoil, Rebound (3R) as a Novel Chest Compression Tech-nique in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Report of Two Cases
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remains controversial with dismal outcomes for cardiac arrest (CA) victims. Inadequate organ perfusion and frequent CPR-related trauma most likely occur due to inappropriate adaptation to hemostatic conditions, electrophysiology, cardiotorsal anatomy, and thoracic biomechanics. Alternatively, we propose a new technique compromising chest compressions through the 5th intercostal space while placing the victim in the left lateral decubitus position with wrapped abdomen and raised legs, allowing to: bypass the sternal barrier, refill the heart, and then recoil-rebound the chest (3R/CPR), within the axis of the cylindrical ribcage. Our goal is to evaluate the technique following its necessary application on two drowning victims. It seems that, 3R/CPR adapts the pathophysiological conditions of CA victims promoting a less traumatic return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), making it worthy of further investigation and study.

TI  - How Do You Feel? Subjective Perception of Recovery as a Reliable Surrogate of Cognitive and Functional Outcome in Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To show that subjective estimate of patient's condition is related to objective cognitive and functional outcome in cardiac arrest survivors.
   Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
   Setting: ICU and Neuropsychology Service in two hospitals in Switzerland.
   Patients: Fifty survivors included from a prospective cohort of 138 patients admitted at the ICU for cardiopulmonary arrest.
   Interventions: Comprehensive cognitive and functional evaluation at 6 months follow-up.
   Measurements and Main Results: Subjectively, 70% of survivors reported satisfactory recovery and 29% reported no complaints. Objectively, 76% were classified as good neurologic outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 1), 26% as having no symptoms (modified Rankin Scale 0), and 38% as upper good recovery (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended 1). Cognitive assessment detected substantial cognitive impairment in 26%, primarily concerning processing speed, language, long-term memory, and executive functions. Subjective complaints severity correlated significantly with objective cognitive impairment (r(S) = 0.64; p < 0.001). Finally, patients reporting unsatisfactory recovery displayed lower functional scores than those reporting satisfactory recovery (e.g., quality of life satisfaction: 64% vs 81%; Z = 2.18; p = 0.03) and more cognitive impairment (three vs one cognitive domains impaired; Z = -3.21; p < 0.001), concerning in particular learning and long-term verbal and visual memory.
   Conclusions: Long-term subjective and objective outcome appears good in the majority of cardiac arrest survivors. Specific functional and cognitive impairments were found in patients reporting unsatisfactory recovery. Subjective recovery was strongly correlated with objective assessment.

TI  - Return to Work in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors A Nationwide Register-Based Follow-Up Study
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Data on long-term function of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors are sparse. We examined return to work as a proxy of preserved function without major neurologic deficits in survivors.
   Methods and Results-In Denmark, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests have been systematically reported to the Danish Cardiac Arrest Register since 2001. During 2001-2011, we identified 4354 patients employed before arrest among 12 332 working-age patients (18-65 years), of whom 796 survived to day 30. Among 796 survivors (median age, 53 years [quartile 1-3, 46-59 years]; 81.5% men), 610 (76.6%) returned to work in a median time of 4 months [quartile 1-3, 1-19 months], with a median time of 3 years spent back at work. A total of 74.6% (N=455) remained employed without using sick leave during the first 6 months after returning to work. This latter proportion of survivors returning to work increased over time (66.1% in 2001-2005 versus 78.1% in 2006-2011; P=0.002). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, factors associated with return to work with >= 6 months of sustainable employment were as follows: (1) arrest during 2006-2011 versus 2001-2005, hazard ratio (HR), 1.38 (95% CI, 1.05-1.82); (2) male sex, HR, 1.48 (95% CI, 1.06-2.07); (3) age of 18 to 49 versus 50 to 65 years, HR, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.02-1.68); (4) bystander-witnessed arrest, HR, 1.79 (95% CI, 1.17-2.76); and (5) bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, HR, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.02-1.87).
   Conclusions-Of 30-day survivors employed before arrest, 76.6% returned to work. The percentage of survivors returning to work increased significantly, along with improved survival during 2001-2011, suggesting an increase in the proportion of survivors with preserved function over time.

TI  - Gender disparities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: implications for public health and bystander interventions in Zhengzhou
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a critical public health crisis in China, with survival rates below 1%, notably lower than those reported in developed nations (10%-12%). Gender disparities have emerged as crucial determinants of OHCA outcomes; however, China-specific evidence remains limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 3,272 adult non-traumatic OHCA patients treated at the Zhengzhou Emergency Medical Rescue Center between 2017 and 2020. Patient characteristics and interventions were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to assess their associations with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Results: Among 3,272 OHCA patients, women accounted for 27.6% (n = 902), and were significantly older than men (70.1 vs. 61.1 years, p < 0.001). Compared with men, women experienced lower rates of witnessed arrest (51.2% vs. 64.0%, p < 0.001), CPR from bystanders (4.8% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.01), AED use (8.9% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.005), and shockable initial rhythm (6.7% vs. 16.1%, p < 0.001). In addition, women were less likely to experience an OHCA in a public location (13.7% vs. 26.4%, p < 0.001). The female sex remained independently associated with a significantly lower prehospital ROSC rate (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.13-0.53, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Significant gender disparities were identified in prehospital outcomes of OHCA patients in Zhengzhou. Compared with men, women were older and less likely to experience a cardiac arrest in public locations, have the event witnessed, receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from a bystander, present with a shockable rhythm, or require an automated external defibrillator (AED). These factors collectively contributed to substantially lowered prehospital ROSC rates among women. Targeted public health strategies-such as expanding inclusive CPR training, promoting gender-sensitive AED use, enhancing community awareness of female resuscitation, and optimizing emergency medical service protocols-are urgently required to reduce these disparities.

TI  - Dependence of early cerebral reperfusion and long-term outcome on resuscitation efficiency after cardiac arrest in rats
T2  - STROKE
AB  - Background and Purpose-While it is well known that longer duration of cardiac arrest (CA) is often associated with poorer long-term outcome, the influence of resuscitation efficacy on postischemia recovery is less clear. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether an inadequate and prolonged resuscitation after a shorter CA can lead to worse long-term outcomes than an effective resuscitation after a longer CA, provided that the total time from the onset of CA to the return of spontaneous circulation is comparable.
   Methods-Thirty-eight rats were randomized into 2 groups with nominal 9 minutes (group 1) and 15 minutes (group 2) of normothermic asphyxial CA. Each group was further divided into 2 subgroups on the basis of the duration of resuscitation efforts (labeled as S and L for short and long, respectively). Thus, the asphyxia and nominal resuscitation times were 8 and 1 minute, respectively, for group 1S, 5 and 4 minutes for group 1L, 14 and 1 minute for group 2S, and 11 and 4 minutes for group 2L. Cerebral perfusion was measured continuously at the dorsal hippocampus level before, during, and after the CA, with the use of the arterial spin labeling MRI technique. The survival time, histological damage, and neurological deficit were evaluated 5 days after resuscitation.
   Results-Groups IS and IL had nearly the same duration of CA (9.02 +/- 0.17 minutes, n = 6 versus 8.58 +/- 0.80 minutes, n = 6). The same is true for groups 2S and 2L (15.51 +/- 0.59 minutes, n = 11 versus 15.65 +/- 1.25 minutes, n = 15). Despite longer asphyxia, shorter and more effective resuscitation was associated with significantly improved long-term outcomes and higher cerebral perfusion at the early stage of reperfusion.
   Conclusions-Effective resuscitation increased early reperfusion and improved survival after CA. The clinical implication is that inadequate and prolonged resuscitation may have detrimental effects on the recovery of CA patients.

TI  - Stability of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders Among Long-term Nursing Home Residents
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
AB  - Background: High-quality care for long-term nursing home residents should include discussions and follow-up on patients' end-of-life care wishes. Yet, recent changes to the Minimum Data Set data collection exclude this information from routine assessment of patients mandated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, making the provision of high-quality end-of-life care less likely. We examined the stability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders to offer guidance to policy and care practice developments.
   Methods: We examined changes in DNR status of a national long-term care nursing home cohort, following them for 5 years after admission. A competing risk model was estimated to identify covariates predicting changes from CPR to DNR status and vice versa.
   Results: About half the cohort chose DNR at admission and did not change its status. Of those who entered with CPR status, 40% changed to DNR. The most important factors influencing change were hospitalizations and nursing home transfers, followed by race and ethnicity with black race (relative to white) in particular having the largest effect on change. Other individual and nursing home characteristics influenced the likelihood of changing from CPR to DNR as well.
   Conclusions: Long-term nursing home patients who enter with full-code CPR have a high probability of changing their status to DNR during their stay. High-quality care should offer them the opportunity to revisit their choice periodically, documenting changes in end-of-life choices when they occur, thus ensuring that care will match patients' wishes. As the Minimum Data Set plays a prominent role in patients' care, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should consider reinstating information about advance directive in it.

TI  - Post-Cardiac Arrest: Mechanisms, Management, and Future Perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiac arrest is an important public health issue, with a survival rate of approximately 15 to 22%. A great proportion of these deaths occur after resuscitation due to post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which is characterized by the ischemia-reperfusion injury that affects the role body. Understanding physiopathology is mandatory to discover new treatment strategies and obtain better results. Besides improvements in cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers, the great increase in survival rates observed in recent decades is due to new approaches to post-cardiac arrest care. In this review, we will discuss physiopathology, etiologies, and post-resuscitation care, emphasizing targeted temperature management, early coronary angiography, and rehabilitation.

TI  - Long-term quality of life of caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and the impact of witnessing a cardiac event of a close relative
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The incidence of cardiac arrest is high, with a poor survival rate of 8-14%. Currently, only limited evidence is available about long-term consequences of cardiac arrest on quality of life of caregivers. Aims: First, to determine the level of daily functioning and quality of life in caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors two years after the cardiac arrest. Second, to study the long-term impact of witnessing the event of a cardiac arrest.
   Methods: A longitudinal cohort study including caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors. Participants received a questionnaire at home. Outcome variables were instrumental daily activities(FAI), emotional functioning (HADS), fatigue(FSS), caregiver strain(CSI), impact of event(IES), and quality of life(SF36).
   Results: 57 caregivers (89% female, age 56,9 +/- 12 years) participated. Two years after the cardiac arrest, quality of life of caregivers equals that of the general population, although almost 30% still scored high on the Impact of Events Scale. Mean IES-, FSS-, CSI and FAI-scores were increased as compared to the general population (P < 0.001). Two years after the cardiac arrest, caregivers that witnessed the resuscitation (IES = 23.6 +/- 14.9) still experienced significantly more trauma related stress than caregivers that did not witness the resuscitation (11.9 +/- 12.5; p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Two years after the cardiac arrest, quality of life of caregivers is quite good, but almost one third of the caregivers still experience a high level of trauma-related stress, especially in those that witnessed the resuscitation. Future research will have to focus on the effectiveness of support programs for caregivers of survivors of cardiac arrest.

TI  - Neurological outcomes and quality of life in post-cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation supported by ECMO: A retrospective case series
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury constitutes a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, leading to cognitive impairment and subsequent disability. Individuals within this patient cohort grapple with uncertainty regarding the potential advantages of extracorporeal life support (ECMO) cannulation. This study elucidates the neurological outcomes and quality of life of post-cardiac arrest patients who attained spontaneous circulation and underwent ECMO cannulation. This is a retrospective case study within a local context, the research involved 32 patients who received ECMO support following an intrahospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An additional 32 patients experienced cardiac arrest with ROSC before undergoing cannulation. The average age was 41 years, with the primary causes of cardiac arrest identified as acute coronary syndrome (46.8%), pulmonary thromboembolism (21.88%), and hypoxemia (18.7%). The most prevalent arrest rhythm was asystole (37.5%), followed by ventricular fibrillation (34.4%). The mean SOFA score was 7 points (IQR 6.5-9), APACHE II score was 12 (IQR 9-16), RESP score was -1 (IQR -1 to -4) in cases of respiratory ECMO, and SAVE score was -3 (IQR -5 to 2) in cases of cardiac ECMO. Overall survival was 71%, and at 6 months, the Barthel score was 75 points, modified Rankin score was 2, cerebral performance categories score was 1, and the SF-12 had an average score of 30. Notably, there were no significant associations between the time, cause, or rhythm of cardiac arrest and neurological outcomes. Importantly, cardiac arrest is not a contraindication for ECMO cannulation. A meticulous assessment of candidates who have achieved spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, considering the absence of early signs of poor neurological prognosis, is crucial in patient selection. Larger prospective studies are warranted to validate and extend these findings.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory cardiogenic shock: patient survival and health-related quality of life
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES Our goal was to study the outcome of patients with cardiogenic shock who were treated with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), including the subsequent long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
   METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of 133 consecutive patients treated in a single centre from 2007 to 2016. The HRQoL was studied using the EuroQuol-5 dimensions-3 level questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey at a minimum of 1year after VA ECMO.
   RESULTS Of all patients, 66 (49.6%) were weaned from VA ECMO and 16 (12.0%) patients were bridged directly to a transplant, 15 (11.3%) to a ventricular assist device and 1 (0.8%) to a total artificial heart. Survival to discharge was 63.9% and to 1year, 60.9%. A higher in-hospital mortality rate was independently associated with lower HCO3 at VA ECMO implantation [odds ratio (OR) 1.2/decrease of 1mmol/l in HCO3 (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.3, P < 0.001)] and with increased need of red blood cells transfused during intensive care [OR 1.9/unit of red blood cells needed/day (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6, P < 0.001)]. HRQoL measured with the EuroQuol-5 dimensions-3 level questionnaire was equal to the HRQoL of the general population. In the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire, patients reported better emotional well-being and equal energy, pain and general health perception compared to the general population. Limitations were experienced only in physical health. In total, 56% of the patients 60years had returned to work.
   CONCLUSIONS VA ECMO can provide acceptable long-term survival with good HRQoL for selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. Timing of patient assessment and of VA ECMO implantation is essential because deeper acidosis is associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate.

TI  - One-year outcome of patients admitted after cardiac arrest compared to other causes of ICU admission. An ancillary analysis of the observational prospective and multicentric FROG-ICU study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: While cardiac arrest (CA) patients discharged alive from intensive care unit (ICU) are considered to have good one-year survival but potential neurological impairment, comparisons with other ICU sub-populations non-admitted for CA purpose are still lacking. This study aimed to compare long-term outcome and health-related quality of life (HROOL) between CA patients and patients admitted to ICU for all other causes.
   Methods: In 1635 patients discharged alive from 21 European ICUs in an ancillary analysis of a prospective multicentric cohort, we compared CA causes of ICU admission to all other causes of ICU admissions (named non-CAs). The primary endpoint was one-year survival rate after ICU discharge. Secondary endpoints included HROOL at 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge using the outcome survey short form-36 (SF36). Propensity score matching was used to consider the probability of having CA.
   Results: Of the 1635 patients, 1561 were included in this study comprised of 1447 non-CAs and 114 CAs. At one-year in the non-matched population, survival rate was greater in the CA group 89% versus the non-CA group 78%(log rank p = 0.0056). In the matched population, this difference persisted between CAs and non-CAs (log rank p = 0.049). The physical component summary of the SF36 scale was higher in the CA group than in the non-CA group at all time points in both non-matched and matched populations.
   Conclusions: CA patients discharged alive from ICU have a better one-year survival and a better HROOL specifically on physical functions than patients admitted to ICU for other causes.

AB  - Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) seems a promising alternative to epinephrine for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cardiac arrest victims,mediating a pronounced blood flow shift toward vital organs. We evaluated the Effects of small-dose dopamine on splanchnic blood flow and renal function after successful resuscitation with this potent vasoconstrictor in an established porcine CPR model. After 4 min of cardiac arrest, and 3 min of CPR, animals received 0.4 U/kg vasopressin and were continuously infused with either dopamine 4 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) (n = 6),or saline placebo (n = 6). Defibrillation was performed 5 min after drug administration; all animals were observed for 6 h after return of spontaneous circulation. During the postresuscitation phase, average mean rt SD superior mesenteric artery blood flow was significantly (P = 0.002) higher in the dopamine group compared with the placebo group (1185 +/- 130 vs 740 +/- 235 mL/min), whereas renal blood flow was comparable between groups (255 +/- 40 vs 250 +/- 85 mL/min). The median calculated glomerular filtration rate had higher values in the dopamine group (70-120 mL/min) than in the placebo group (40-70 mL/min; P = 0.1 at 0 min and P = 0.08 at 360 min), We conclude that small-dose dopamine administration may be useful in improving superior mesenteric artery blood flow and renal function after successful resuscitation with vasopressin. Implications: Long-term survival after cardiac arrest may be determined by the ability to ensure adequate organ perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in the postresuscitation phase. Ln this regard, small-dose dopamine improved postresuscitation blood flow to the mesenteric bed when vasopressin was used as an alternative vasopressor in an animal model of cardiac arrest.

TI  - Long-term follow-up of neuropsychological complications in neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
AB  - BackgroundExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been widely used in severe neonatal diseases for approximately 50 years, while few studies have concentrated on the long-term follow-up of its neuropsychological development.ObjectiveTo assess the long-term neuropsychological complications in children who underwent ECMO in infancy.MethodsThe PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched for retrieving studies published in the recent 10 years (until June 10, 2022). All studies were eligible that concentrated on the long-term follow-up of neuropsychological complications in neonates undergoing ECMO. Excluding animal studies, neonates with congenital craniocerebral dysplasia and studies with data from the same center performed at different times. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata/SE 12.0 software. A random-effects model was used to report results. The sensitivity analysis was utilized to identify sources of heterogeneity.ResultsThe meta-analysis of 10 studies that enrolled 1199 patients was conducted, showing the pooled morbidity of intelligence (pooled morbidity: 20.3%, 95% CI: 0.16-0.25, I2: 9.5%, P=0.33), motor activity (pooled morbidity: 10.3%, 95%CI: 0.07-0.14, I2: 43.5%, P=0.15), learning (pooled morbidity: 9.0%, 95%CI: -0.03-0.21, I2: 63.2%, P=0.10), hearing (pooled morbidity: 15.7%, 95%CI: 0.02-0.29, I2: 94.2%, P=0.00), vision (pooled morbidity: 18.5%, 95%CI: 0.12-0.25, I2: 0%, P=0.46), cognition (pooled morbidity: 26.3%, 95%CI: 0.19-0.34, I2: 0%, P=0.32), attention (pooled morbidity: 7.4%, 95%CI: 0.02-0.13, I2: 38.9%, P=0.20), speed in attention (pooled morbidity: 69.9%, 95%CI: 0.62-0.78), and accuracy in attention (pooled morbidity: 39.0%, 95%CI: 0.30-0.48) in neonates undergoing ECMO. The results of the Begg's test and sensitivity analysis indicated that the heterogeneity was originated from factors other than sample size.ConclusionThis systematic review and meta-analysis showed that neonates undergoing ECMO were associated with various neuropsychological complications. Additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a larger sample size and a higher quality are needed.

TI  - Prognostic Factor in Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Refractory In- and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is used to improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest (CA) refractory to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR); however, ECPR carries several risks including futility and high cost. Although ECPR requires proper and rapid decision-making, the immediately available prognostic factors remain unclear. Objectives: This study evaluated the prognostic factors available during CCPR among patients with in-hospital CA (IHCA) and out-of-hospital CA (OHCA), respectively. Methods: This single-center retrospective study included consecutive ECPR recipients at our institution from January 2013 to September 2024. Uni-and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of 30-day mortality. Results: Of the 204 patients (age, 63 f 14 years; male, 77%; OHCA, 45%; out-of-hours ECPR, 52%; initial shockable rhythm, 52%) included in this study, the overall 30-day survival rate was 24%. Patients with IHCA had a significantly better survival rate than those with OHCA (30% vs. 15%, p = 0.013). The optimal lactate cutoff values for discriminating outcomes were 9.2 mmol/L for IHCA and 14.3 mmol/L for OHCA. Among patients with IHCA, serum lactate levels, and initial shockable rhythm were significantly associated with 30-day mortality, whereas among patients with OHCA, serum lactate levels, out-of-hours ECPR, and bystander CPR were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: Determining serum lactate levels before ECPR is potentially useful for prompt and accurate decision-making among patients with IHCA or OHCA. However, greater discretion may be required for out-of-hours ECPR in patients with OHCA. Larger studies validating these observations are needed to identify optimal candidates for ECPR.

TI  - Critical Illness Factors Associated With Long-Term Mortality and Health-Related Quality of Life Morbidity Following Community-Acquired Pediatric Septic Shock*
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives:
   A companion article reports the trajectory of long-term mortality and significant health-related quality of life disability among children encountering septic shock. In this article, the investigators examine critical illness factors associated with these adverse outcomes.
   Design:
   Prospective, cohort-outcome study, conducted 2013-2017.
   Setting:
   Twelve United States academic PICUs.
   Patients:
   Critically ill children, 1 month to 18 years, with community-acquired septic shock requiring vasoactive-inotropic support.
   Interventions:
   Illness severity, organ dysfunction, and resource utilization data were collected during PICU admission. Change from baseline health-related quality of life at the month 3 follow-up was assessed by parent proxy-report employing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory or the Stein-Jessop Functional Status Scale.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   In univariable modeling, critical illness variables associated with death and/or persistent, serious health-related quality of life deterioration were candidates for multivariable modeling using Bayesian information criterion. The most clinically relevant multivariable models were selected among models with near-optimal statistical fit. Three months following septic shock, 346 of 389 subjects (88.9%) were alive and 43 of 389 had died (11.1%); 203 of 389 (52.2%) had completed paired health-related quality of life surveys. Pediatric Risk of Mortality, cumulative Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores, PICU and hospital durations of stay, maximum and cumulative vasoactive-inotropic scores, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal life support or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and appearance of pathologic neurologic signs were associated with adverse outcomes in univariable models. In multivariable regression analysis (odds ratio [95% CI]), summation of daily Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores, 1.01/per point (1.01-1.02), p < 0.001; highest vasoactive-inotropic score, 1.02/per point (1.00-1.04), p = 0.003; and any acute pathologic neurologic sign/event, 5.04 (2.15-12.01), p < 0.001 were independently associated with death or persistent, serious deterioration of health-related quality of life at month 3.
   Conclusions and Relevance:
   Biologically plausible factors related to sepsis-associated critical illness organ dysfunction and its treatment were associated with poor outcomes at month 3 follow-up among children encountering septic shock.

TI  - Trend of Outcome Metrics in Recent Out-of-Hospital-Cardiac-Arrest Research: A Narrative Review of Clinical Trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) research traditionally focuses on survival. In 2018, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) proposed more patient-centered outcomes. Our narrative review assessed clinical trials after 2018 to identify the trends of outcome metrics in the field OHCA research. We performed a search of the PubMed database from 1 January 2019 to 22 September 2023. Prospective clinical trials involving adult humans were eligible. Studies that did not report any patient-related outcomes or were not available in full-text or English language were excluded. The articles were assessed for demographic information and primary and secondary outcomes. We included 89 studies for analysis. For the primary outcome, 31 (35%) studies assessed neurocognitive functions, and 27 (30%) used survival. For secondary outcomes, neurocognitive function was present in 20 (22%) studies, and survival was present in 10 (11%) studies. Twenty-six (29%) studies used both survival and neurocognitive function. Since the publication of the COSCA guidelines in 2018, there has been an increased focus on neurologic outcomes. Although survival outcomes are used frequently, we observed a trend toward fewer studies with ROSC as a primary outcome. There were no quality-of-life assessments, suggesting a need for more studies with patient-centered outcomes that can inform the guidelines for cardiac-arrest management.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest: A Markov decision model
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for in-hospital cardiac arrest treatment.
   Methods: A decision tree and Markov model were constructed based on current literature. The model was conditional on age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and sex. Three treatment strategies were considered: ECPR for patients with an Age-Combined Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) below different thresholds (2-4), ECPR for everyone (EALL), and ECPR for no one (NE). Cost-effectiveness was assessed with costs per quality-of-life adjusted life years (QALY).
   Measurements and main results: Treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 2 points costs 8394 (95% CI: 4922-14,911) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 3 costs 8825 (95% CI: 5192-15,777) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 4 costs 9311 (95% CI: 5478-16,690) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating every eligible patient with ECPR costs 10,818 (95% CI: 6357-19,400) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient. For WTP thresholds of 0-9500 euro, NE has the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. For WTP thresholds between 9500 and 12,500, treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 4 has the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. For WTP thresholds of 12,500 or higher, EALL was found to have the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy.
   Conclusions: Given that conventional WTP thresholds in Europe and North-America lie between 50,000-100,000 euro or U.S. dollars, ECPR can be considered a cost-effective treatment after in-hospital cardiac arrest from a healthcare perspective. More research is necessary to validate the effectiveness of ECPR, with a focus on the long-term effects of complications of ECPR.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of patients who received extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) following in-hospital cardiac arrest: Analysis of EXCEL registry data
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To describe the six-month functional outcomes of patients who received extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Australia.<br /> Design: Secondary analysis of EXCEL registry data.<br /> Setting: EXCEL is a high-quality, prospective, binational registry including adult patients who receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in Australia and New Zealand.<br /> Participants: Patients reported to the EXCEL registry who received ECPR following IHCA and had the sixmonth outcome data available were included.<br /> Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was functional outcome at six months measured using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The secondary outcomes included mortality, disability, health status, and complications.<br /> Results: Between 15th February 2019 and 31st August 2022, 113/1251 (9.0%) patients in the registry received ECPR following IHCA (mean age 50.7 +/- 13.7 years; 79/113 (69.9%) male; 74/113 (65.5%) nonshockable rhythm). At 6 months, 37/113 (32.7%) patients were alive, most (27/34 [79.4%]) with a good functional outcome (mRS 0-3). Patients had increased disability [WHODAS % Score 25.58 +/- 23.39% vs 6.45 +/- 12.32%; mean difference (MD) [95% (confidence interval) CI] -19.13 (-28.49 to -9.77); p < 0.001] and worse health status [EuroQol five-dimension, five-level (EQ-5D-5L) index value 0.73 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.14; MD (95% CI) 0.17 (0.07 to 0.26); p = 0.003] at six months compared with the baseline. The patients reported a median of 4.5 (2-6) complications at six-month follow-up. Conclusion: One in three patients who received ECPR following IHCA were alive at six months and most had a good functional outcome. However, survivors reported higher levels of disability and a worse health status at six months compared with the baseline and ongoing complications were common.<br /> (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Long-Term Functional and Psychosocial Outcomes After Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury: A Case-Controlled Comparison to Traumatic Brain Injury
T2  - PM&R
AB  - Background: Despite the increasing rate of survival from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI), there is a paucity of evidence on the long-term functional outcomes after inpatient rehabilitation among these nontrauma patients compared to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   Objectives: To compare functional and psychosocial outcomes of patients with HIBI to those of case-matched patients with TBI 4-11 years after brain insult.
   Design: Retrospective, matched case-controlled study.
   Methods: Data at the time of rehabilitation admission and discharge were collected as part of a larger acquired brain injury (ABI) database at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) between 1999 and 2009. This study consisted of 11 patients with HIBI and 11 patients with TBI that attended the neuro-rehabilitation day program at TRI during a similar time frame and were matched on age, admission Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores, and acute care length of stay (ALOS). At 4-11 years following brain insult, patients were reassessed using the FIM, Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9), and the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory 4 (MPAI-4).
   Results: At follow-up, patients with HIBI had significantly lower FIM motor and cognitive scores than patients with TBI (75.3 +/- 20.6 versus 88.1 +/- 4.78, P < .05, and 25.5 +/- 5.80 versus 32.7 +/- 2.54, P <. 05, respectively) despite having a similar time frame postinsult (ie, 4-11 years). In addition, there were significant differences in motor and total FIM change from admission to follow-up between HIBI and TBI patients (P < .05). Patients with HIBI also had significantly lower scores on the DRS, PHQ-9, and total MPAI-4 at follow-up (P < .05).
   Conclusions: The study results suggest that patients with HIBI achieve less long-term functional improvements compared to patients with TBI. Further research is warranted to compare the components of inpatient rehabilitation while adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics between these 2 groups of patients.

TI  - Prediction of outcomes after cardiac arrest by a generative artificial intelligence model
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aims: To investigate the prognostic accuracy of a non -medical generative artificial intelligence model (Chat Generative Pre -Trained Transformer 4ChatGPT-4) as a novel aspect in predicting death and poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge based on real -life data from cardiac arrest patients. Methods: This prospective cohort study investigates the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 to predict outcomes at hospital discharge of adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care at a large Swiss tertiary academic medical center (COMMUNICATE/PROPHETIC cohort study). We prompted ChatGPT-4 with sixteen prognostic parameters derived from established post -cardiac arrest scores for each patient. We compared the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 regarding the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios of three cardiac arrest scores (Out -of -Hospital Cardiac Arrest [OHCA], Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis [CAHP], and PROgnostication using LOGistic regression model for Unselected adult cardiac arrest patients in the Early stages [PROLOGUE score]) for in -hospital mortality and poor neurological outcome. Results: Mortality at hospital discharge was 43% (n = 309/713), 54% of patients (n = 387/713) had a poor neurological outcome. ChatGPT-4 showed good discrimination regarding in -hospital mortality with an AUC of 0.85, similar to the OHCA, CAHP, and PROLOGUE (AUCs of 0.82, 0.83, and 0.84, respectively) scores. For poor neurological outcome, ChatGPT-4 showed a similar prediction to the post -cardiac arrest scores (AUC 0.83). Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 showed a similar performance in predicting mortality and poor neurological outcome compared to validated post -cardiac arrest scores. However, more research is needed regarding illogical answers for potential incorporation of an LLM in the multimodal outcome prognostication after cardiac arrest.

TI  - The resuscitation outcome - Revisit the story of the stony heart
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Postresuscitation syndrome is a state of myocardial dysfunction after the restoration of circulation by successful resuscitation. Despite several advances in the field of resuscitation, the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is still suboptimal. The high fatality rate shortly, after successful resuscitation is mainly related to postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. Postresuscitation myocardial stunning is reversible, while stony heart is irreversible due to prolonged unsuccessful resuscitation. This article reviews most of the published articles concerning the causes, mechanism, pathophysiology, and the updated trials for management of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. Further studies are warranted to highlight postresuscitation disease and its hemodynamic sequences and then to intervene according to the different phases of cardiac arrest. By modifying the conventional modalities of resuscitation together with new promising agents, the rescuers will be able to salvage the jeopardized postresuscitation myocardium and prevent its progression to the dismal stony heart. Community awareness and staff education are crucial to shorten resuscitation time and improve short-term and long-term outcomes. There is an urgent need to revise the guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in community setting, but how? It is a matter of where and when it is of enough value to be efficacious and cost-effective.

TI  - RETRACTED: Evaluation of Vertebral Function and Long-Term Quality of Life after Percutaneous Minimally Invasive Surgery in Patients with Thoracolumbar Spine Fractures (Retracted Article)
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective. To investigate the changes in vertebral function after minimally invasive surgery in patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures and investigate the impact of percutaneous minimally invasive surgery on patients' quality of life by following up the patients in the long term. Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed to select 80 patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures treated in our hospital from April 2013 to October 2018, and the patients were divided into a study group and a control group according to the difference in their choice of procedure. The two groups were compared in terms of perioperative wound pain, serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the two groups were followed up for 2 years to compare the changes in anterior vertebral body height and Cobb's angle during the follow-up period and to compare the differences in quality of life between the two groups. Results. (1) The pain level of patients in the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group at the 1st and 3rd postoperative days (p < 0.05). (2) The CK activity and CPR level of patients in the study group were significantly lower than that of the control group at the 1st and 3rd postoperative days (p < 0.05). (3) Compared with the preoperative period, the height of the anterior border of the vertebral body and the Cobb's angle in both groups showed significant changes at 7 d, 6 months, one year, and two years after surgery (p < 0.05), suggesting that both procedures can significantly restore the height of the injured vertebra and improve the function of the vertebral body. (4) The somatic, physical, and psychological functions of patients in the study group were significantly greater than those in the control group at 6 months postoperatively (p > 0.05). Conclusion. Compared to traditional open surgery, minimally invasive percutaneous surgery for thoracolumbar fractures can significantly reduce perioperative pain and improve perioperative stress in patients, while achieving better surgical outcomes and a significantly improved quality of life in patients at long-term follow-up.

TI  - Radiomics for Predicting the Development of Brain Edema from Normal-Appearing Early Brain-CT After Cardiac Arrest and Return of Spontaneous Circulation
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Background: Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is a feared complication post-cardiac arrest (CA). The timing of brain imaging remains a topic of ongoing debate. Early computed tomography (CT) scans can reveal acute intracranial pathologies but may have limited predictive value due to delayed manifestation of HIBI-related changes. Radiomics analyses present a promising approach to identifying subtle imaging markers, potentially aiding early HIBI detection. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed post-CA patients between 2016 and 2023 who received immediate brain CTs. Patients without acute intracranial pathology on initial scans and who underwent follow-up brain CTs within 14 days post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were included. Image segmentation involved manual basalganglia segmentation and automated whole-brain segmentation. Radiomics features were calculated using Pyradiomics (v3.0.1) in 3DSlicer (v5.2.2). Feature selection involved reproducibility analysis via ICC and LASSO regression, retaining five features per segmentation method. A logistic regression model for each segmentation method underwent 5-fold cross-validation. Results were summarized with ROC analyses and average sensitivity and specificity. Results: A total of 83 patients (average age: 65 +/- 13.3 years, 19 women) with CA and ROSC were included. Follow-up CT scans after 5.2 +/- 2.9 days revealed brain edema in 47 patients. The model using manual segmentation achieved an average AUC of 0.76, sensitivity of 0.59, and specificity of 0.78. The automated segmentation model showed an average AUC of 0.66, sensitivity of 0.49, and specificity of 0.68. Conclusions: Radiomics, particularly focused on the basalganglia area in normal-appearing brain CTs after CA and ROSC, may enhance predictive insights for HIBI and the development of brain edema.

TI  - Survival and long-term outcomes following in-hospital cardiac arrest in a Swiss university hospital: a prospective observational study
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest is reported to be 0.8 to 4.6 per 1,000 patient admissions. Patient survival to hospital discharge with favourable functional and neurological status is around 21-30%. The Bern University Hospital is a tertiary medical centre in Switzerland with a cardiac arrest team that is available 24 h per day, 7 days per week. Due to lack of central documentation of cardiac arrest team interventions, the incidence, outcomes and survival rates of cardiac arrests in the hospital are unknown. Our aim was to record all cardiac arrest team interventions over 1 year, and to analyse the outcome and survival rates of adult patients after in-hospital cardiac arrests. Methods We conducted a prospective single-centre observational study that recorded all adult in-hospital cardiac arrest team interventions over 1 year, using an Utstein-style case report form. The primary outcome was 30-day survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation, neurological status (after return of spontaneous circulation, after 24 h, after 30 days, after 1 and 5 years), according to the Glasgow Outcomes Scale, and functional status at 30 days and 1 year, according to the Short-form-12 Health Survey. Results The cardiac arrest team had 146 interventions over the study year, which included 60 non-life-threatening alarms (41.1%). The remaining 86 (58.9%) acute life-threatening situations included 68 (79.1%) as patients with cardiac arrest. The mean age of these cardiac arrest patients was 68 +/- 13 years, with a male predominance (51/68; 75.0%). Return of spontaneous circulation was recorded in 49 patients (72.1%). Over one-third of the cardiac arrest patients (27/68) were alive after 30 days with favourable neurological outcome. The patients who survived the first year lived also to 5 years after the event with favourable neurological and functional status. Conclusions The in-hospital cardiac arrest incidence on a large tertiary Swiss university hospital was 1.56 per 1000 patient admissions. After a cardiac arrest, about a third of the patients survived to 5 years with favourable neurological and functional status. Alarms unrelated to life-threatening situations are common and need to be taken into count within a low-threshold alarming system. Trial Registration: The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02746640).

TI  - Cognitive Impairment among Cardiac Arrest Survivors in the ICU: A Retrospective Study
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background. Recent studies have presented the effects of cardiac arrest on long-term cognitive function and quality of life. However, no study has evaluated cognitive function in the early stage after regaining consciousness. Purpose. The objectives of this study were to analyse the incidence, clinical course, and associated factors of cognitive impairment of cardiac arrest survivors in intensive care unit (ICU). Patients and methods. We administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to cardiac arrest survivors who were treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) immediately after regaining consciousness. Patients whose MMSE scores indicated impaired cognitive function (MMSE < 24) were retested before ICU discharge. Results. In 92 patients, the median MMSE score was 21.0 (interquartile range (IQR), 16.0-24.0), and cognitive impairment was found in 64 patients. Fifty-three patients completed follow-up MMSEs, and the median scores were 20.0 (IQR, 13.5-23.0) for the first and 25.0 (IQR, 21.5-28.0) for the last test. Of the specific domains, recall (0.0 (IQR, 0.0-1.0) to 2.0 (IQR, 1.0-3.0)) and attention/calculation (3.0 (IQR, 1.0-4.0) to 4.0 (IQR, 2.0-5.0)) were the most affected domains until ICU discharge. The factors that were correlated with cognitive impairment on the last MMSE were older age (OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14), p=0.016), increased time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (OR, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15), p=0.012), and length of hospital stay (OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.14), p=0.044). Conclusions. Cognitive impairments were common immediately after patients regained consciousness but recovered substantially before ICU discharge. Recall and attention/calculation still were impaired until ICU discharge, and older age, increased time to ROSC, and LOS were associated with this cognitive decline.

TI  - Route of drug administration in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A protocol for a randomised controlled trial (PARAMEDIC-3)
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aims: The PARAMEDIC -3 trial evaluates the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an intraosseous first strategy, compared with an intravenous first strategy, for drug administration in adults who have sustained an out -of -hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: PARAMEDIC -3 is a pragmatic, allocation concealed, open -label, multi -centre, superiority randomised controlled trial. It will recruit 15,000 patients across English and Welsh ambulance services. Adults who have sustained an out -of -hospital cardiac arrest are individually randomised to an intraosseous access first strategy or intravenous access first strategy in a 1:1 ratio through an opaque, sealed envelope system. The randomised allocation determines the route used for the first two attempts at vascular access. Participants are initially enrolled under a deferred consent model. The primary clinical -effectiveness outcome is survival at 30 -days. Secondary outcomes include return of spontaneous circulation, neurological functional outcome, and health -related quality of life. Participants are followed -up to six -months following cardiac arrest. The primary health economic outcome is incremental cost per quality -adjusted life year gained. Conclusion: The PARAMEDIC -3 trial will provide key information on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of drug route in out -of -hospital cardiac arrest. Trial

TI  - The effect of thermoelectric craniocerebral cooling device on protecting brain functions in post-cardiac arrest syndrome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Aim This study aimed to protect brain functions in patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest through the application of local cerebral hypothermia. By utilizing a specialized thermal hypothermia device, this approach sought to mitigate ischemic brain injury associated with post-cardiac arrest syndrome, enhance survival rates, and improve neurological outcomes as measured by standardized scales.Methods A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted involving patients aged >= 18 years who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest and achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Patients were cooled using a hypothermia helmet to achieve a target temperature of 32 degrees C-34 degrees C, maintained for 36-72 h, followed by controlled rewarming and normothermia for 72 h. Neurological recovery was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale, where CPC 1-2 denotes good recovery and CPC 3-5 indicates poor outcomes. Body temperature, hemodynamic parameters, biochemical changes, and survival data were meticulously recorded and analyzed. Statistical analysis included paired t-tests to compare pre- and post-treatment data.Results Of 116 cardiac arrest cases, 30 (25.86%) were in-hospital, and 16 (53.33%) of these achieved ROSC. Among the patients, 62.5% underwent emergency coronary angiography due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The mean time to hypothermia initiation was 32.9 +/- 13.5 min, with hypothermia maintained for 58 +/- 6.4 h. Neurological outcomes were favorable, with 62.5% of patients achieving CPC scores of 1 or 2, indicating functional recovery and independence. In contrast, CPC scores of 3 or higher were observed in 37.5% of patients, reflecting varying degrees of disability. Biochemical analysis revealed significant decreases in sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels, alongside increased urea and creatinine concentrations. Hemodynamic improvements included elevated systolic blood pressure and heart rate, while left ventricular ejection fraction remained stable. Overall survival was 75%, and the majority (62.5%) of survivors were discharged without significant neurological deficits.Conclusion The findings suggest that early and targeted application of craniocerebral thermal hypothermia has the potential to improve survival and preserve neurological function in post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The high rates of favorable outcomes, as reflected by CPC scores, underscore the neuroprotective effects of localized hypothermia. Further large-scale, multicenter trials are recommended to validate these promising results and refine protocols for optimal clinical application.

TI  - Evaluation of Telephone Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Performance in Current Practice in Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SAUDI HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objectives: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health problem with a low survival rate. Telephone cardiopulmonary resuscitation (T-CPR) guidance by emergency medical services (EMS) dispatchers can improve CPR performance and, consequently, survival rates. Accordingly, the American Heart Association (AHA) has released performance standards for T-CPR in current practice to improve its quality. However, no study has examined T-CPR performance in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate T-CPR performance in the Saudi Arabian EMS system.
   Methods: A retrospective observation of OHCA calls in current practice was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OHCA calls were reviewed to identify those that met the selection criteria. Variables collected included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), OHCA recognition rate, time from EMS call receipt to location acquisition, to OHCA recognition and to commencement of CPR.
   Results: A total of 308 OHCA cases were reviewed, and 100 calls were included. ROSC was identified in 10% of the included calls. OHCA was correctly recognized in 62% of the calls. The time to OHCA identification and CPR performance from EMS call receipt were found to be 303 s and 367 s, respectively.
   Conclusion: T-CPR performance in Saudi Arabia is below AHA standards. However, this is similar to what has been reported in the literature. Avoiding any unnecessary call transfer during OHCA calls and prompt identification of callers ' locations could improve T-CPR performance.

TI  - The long-term burden of severe sepsis and septic shock: Sepsis recidivism and organ dysfunction
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Severe sepsis and septic shock mortality has improved; however, rates of persistent (28-90 days) and long-term (>90 day) organ dysfunction in sepsis survivors are unknown.
   METHODS Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of adult emergency department patients with severe sepsis.
   RESULTS Of 110 sepsis admissions, we obtained follow-up on 51 of 78 survivors of whom 41% (21 of 51) had persistent organ dysfunction: pulmonary, 18% (9 of 51); renal, 22% (11 of 51); coagulopathy, 10% (5 of 51); cardiovascular, 6% (3 of 51); hepatic, 2% (1 of 51); and neurologic, 3% (3 of 51). We obtained follow-up on 40 of 73 survivors at more than 90 days of whom 38% (15 of 40) had long-term organ dysfunction: pulmonary, 13% (5 of 40); renal, 18% (7 of 40); coagulopathy, 3% (1 of 40); cardiovascular, 5% (2 of 40); hepatic, 0%; and neurologic, 5% (2 of 40). Readmission rate within 90 days was 32% (25 of 78), and recurrent sepsis was the cause of readmission in 52% (13 of 25). Baseline SOFA scores from the index sepsis admission were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and were significantly different in participants with organ dysfunction versus those without organ dysfunction at less than 90 days (z, -2.51; p = 0.01).
   CONCLUSION Readmission with recurrent sepsis and organ dysfunction occurs frequently in sepsis survivors. Baseline SOFA score may be predictive of sepsis recidivism and persistent or recurrent organ dysfunction.

TI  - Moving from physical survival to psychologic recovery: a qualitative study of survivor perspectives on long-term outcome after sudden cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Over 400,000 adults suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) each year in North America. Despite a very high mortality rate, even 10% survival means that a minimum of 3500 people return to their lives and their families. However, their experience of living and their health-related quality of life after such a life-changing event are quite variable, much more complex than just having lived or died, and should not be reduced to crude measures of neurological functioning.
   Methods: We conducted 32 in-depth qualitative interviews with survivor/family member dyads at various stages of survival. The interviews focused on the recovery journey, long-term issues most important to them and how measuring such concepts could help. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative thematic analysis techniques.
   Results: During in-depth interviews with more than 30 survivors and caregivers we have heard that despite being a relatively high functioning group, their lives have been deeply affected by their cardiac arrest experience. They speak about the importance of both psychologic and physical recovery, the impact of return to work or changes in work identity and the necessity of support from family members in the recovery process. Spouses/family members also mentioned differences in perspective on their loved one's recovery and how they manage the fear of recurrence.
   Conclusions: This work purposively brings a unique lens to the concept of cardiac arrest outcomes by placing priority on what is important to survivors and their families and what we may be missing in standard outcomes measures. There is a clear need for a more patient-centred outcome set for this population and our work indicates that psychologic assessment, return to work status and family input are key domains to be considered.

TI  - The EXACT protocol: A multi-centre, single-blind, randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial to determine whether early oxygen titration improves survival to hospital discharge in adult OHCA patients
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Experimental and observational research suggests hyperoxia following resuscitation from cardiac arrest is associated with neurological injury and worse clinical outcomes. This paper describes the rationale and design of the EXACT trial. EXACT aims to determine whether reducing oxygen in the acute phase of post-resuscitation care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) improves survival.
   Methods: EXACT is a multi-centre, randomised (1: 1), single-blind, parallel trial. Presumed cardiac OHCA cases who achieve a return of spontaneous circulation will be eligible if they are comatose, with an advanced airway and have an oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) >95% on >10 L/min (or 100% oxygen). Paramedics will randomise 1416 eligible cases to receive oxygen therapy targeting an SpO(2) of 90-94% (intervention) or 98-100% (control). Study treatment will continue until admission to an intensive care unit or hospital ward. The primary outcome is survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes include 12-month survival and quality of life.
   Results: The study has commenced in the Australian states of Victoria and South Australia, and has enrolled 167 eligible cases to date (80 intervention and 87 control). Further sites are due to commence in 2019, recruitment is expected to take three years.
   Conclusion: This study will determine if early reduction of oxygen leads to improved outcomes in OHCA. Such a finding may potentially change clinical practice with implications on future OHCA survival outcomes.

TI  - RUPTURED ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM - FACTORS AFFECTING SURVIVAL AND LONG-TERM RESULTS
T2  - VASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Although elective resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is now a safe operation, the mortality related to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) remains significant. To evaluate factors affecting survival and the long-term results after rAAA, a ten-year review of 47 patients was performed.
   The operative mortality rate was 43% (20/47) compared with 2.6% for 147 elective AAA patients during this period. Factors adversely affecting survival were blood pressure < 90 mmHg on arrival to the hospital, perioperative cardiac arrest, delay in time from diagnosis to treatment > six hours, age > seventy-five years, massive transfusion, and free intraperitoneal rupture.
   In follow-up extending to five years the survivors of rAAA at one (92%) and five (53%) years had no discernible differences in quality of life or long-term survival compared with age- and sex-matched patients who had elective AAA resection during the same time interval.
   When an rAAA occurs and any three of the adverse variables noted above are present, the mortality rate exceeds 90%. These patients remained ventilator dependent and in the ICU from one to sixty-seven days, accumulating hospital charges from $7,000 to $214,000. It appears that the most effective means of reducing mortality statistics in this inordinately low-salvage, yet high-cost subgroup of patients, is to prevent rupture of an AAA by elective resection.

TI  - Dual-dispatch protocols and return of spontaneous circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide observational study
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective The Korean National Fire Agency conducted a pilot project examining Advanced Life Support (ALS) protocols, including epinephrine administration, to improve survival among patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the Korean National Fire Agency ALS protocol on prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with OHCA. Methods This study included patients with adult-presumed cardiac arrest between January and December 2020. The main factor of interest was ambulance type according to ALS protocol, which was divided into dedicated ALS ambulance (DA), smartphone-based ALS ambulance (SALS), and non-DA, and the main analysis factor was prehospital ROSC. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results During the study period, a total of 18,031 adult patients with OHCA was treated by the emergency medical services, including 7,520 DAs (41.71%), 2,622 SALSs (14.54%), and 7,889 non-DAs (43.75%). The prehospital ROSC rate of the DA group (13.19%) was higher than those of the non-DA group (7.91%) and the SALS group (11.17%, P<0.01). Compared with that of the DA group, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for prehospital ROSC were 0.97 (0.82-1.15) in the SALS group and 0.57 (0.50-0.65) in the non-DA group. Conclusion ALS protocol intervention was associated with prehospital ROSC rates. Therefore, continuous efforts to promote systemic implementation of the ALS protocol to improve OHCA outcomes are necessary.

TI  - Continuous deep sedation versus minimal sedation after cardiac arrest and resuscitation (SED-CARE): A protocol for a randomized clinical trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background: Sedation is often provided to resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients to tolerate post-cardiac arrest care, including temperature management. However, the evidence of benefit or harm from routinely administered deep sedation after cardiac arrest is limited. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of continuous deep sedation compared to minimal sedation on patient-important outcomes in resuscitated OHCA patients in a large clinical trial. Methods: The SED-CARE trial is part of the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation (STEPCARE) trial, a randomized international, multicentre, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, superiority trial with three simultaneous intervention arms. In the SED-CARE trial, adults with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) who are comatose following resuscitation from OHCA will be randomized within 4 hours to continuous deep sedation (Richmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS) -4/-5) (intervention) or minimal sedation (RASS 0 to -2) (comparator), for 36 h after ROSC. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at 6 months after randomization. The two other components of the STEPCARE trial evaluate sedation and temperature control strategies. Apart from the STEPCARE trial interventions, all other aspects of general intensive care will be according to the local practices of the participating site. Neurological prognostication will be performed according to European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines by a physician blinded to the allocation group. To detect an absolute risk reduction of 5.6% with an alpha of 0.05, 90% power, 3500 participants will be enrolled. The secondary outcomes will be the proportion of participants with poor functional outcomes 6 months after randomization, serious adverse events in the intensive care unit, and patient-reported overall health status 6 months after randomization. Conclusion: The SED-CARE trial will investigate if continuous deep sedation (RASS -4/-5) for 36 h confers a mortality benefit compared to minimal sedation (RASS 0 to -2) after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Resting state EEG relates to short- and long-term cognitive functioning after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Approximately half of cardiac arrest survivors have persistent cognitive impairment. Guidelines recommend early screening to identify patients at risk for cognitive impairment, but there is no consensus on the best screening method. We aimed to identify quantitative EEG measures relating with short- and long-term cognitive function after cardiac arrest for potential to cognitive outcome prediction. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study designed to develop a prediction model for cognitive outcome after cardiac arrest. For the current analysis, we used twenty-minute EEG registrations from 80 patients around one week after cardiac arrest. We calculated power spectral density, normalized alpha-to-theta ratio (nATR), peak frequency, and center of gravity (CoG) of this peak frequency. We related these with global cognitive functioning (scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) at one week, three and twelve months follow-up with multivariate mixed effect models, and with performance on standard neuropsychological examination at twelve months using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: Each individual EEG parameter related to MoCA at one week (beta(nATR) = 7.36; P < 0.01; beta(peak) frequency = 1.73, P < 0.01; beta(CoG) = -9.88, P < 0.01). The nATR also related with the MoCA at three months ((beta(nATR) = 2.49; P 0.01). No EEG metrics significantly related to the MoCA score at twelve months. nATR and peak frequency related with memory performance at twelve months. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Early resting-state EEG parameters relate with short-term global cognitive functioning and with memory function at one year after cardiac arrest. Additional predictive values in multimodal prediction models need further study.

TI  - Long term functioning with poor neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Around six percent of comatose patients after cardiac arrest have a Cerebral Performance Categories score of three (CPC3) at six months after the arrest, classified as severe neurological disability. There is limited knowledge regarding the likelihood of further recovery in the cognitive, emotional, and quality of life domains. We aimed to estimate the probability of recovery towards independency. Methods: From a prospective Registry on comatose cardiac arrest patients admitted between 2013 and 2017 in two Dutch hospitals, we included patients with a CPC3 at six months after cardiac arrest. We followed patients up to November 2023. The primary outcome measure was the CPC score at time of follow up. Secondary outcomes were scores on questionnaires on cognition, mood, and quality of life according to the minimal dataResults: In our cohort of 667 patients, 29 (4.3%) had a CPC3 score at six months (median age 68 years, 83% male). At a median time of eight years after cardiac arrest, sixteen patients had died. Twelve of thirteen alive patients still had a CPC3 score (92%) and one a CPC2 (8%). Seven patients agreed with further interviewing, one showed independency in activities of daily living (14%). Six patients (86%) reported limitations due to physical and one (14%) due to emotional problems. All had severe cognitive impairment. Six (86%) missed cognitive rehabilitation. Conclusion: Our study shows that while the probability of recovery towards independence for patients with severe neurological disability at six months after cardiac arrest is limited, most long-term survivors are satisfied with their quality of life.

TI  - Outcomes of children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after the return of spontaneous circulation: A multi-center retrospective study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to explore the epidemiological features and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) among children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and to determine the factors associated with the thirty-day survival (TDS) rate. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2016 and December 2022 at two French PICUs and included patients under 18 years old hospitalized with ROSC after OHCA. ResultsDuring the study period, 53 patients were included, 27 (51%) were males the median age was 4 years old. Drowning (n = 15, 28%) and other causes of respiratory failure (n = 9, 17%) were the most common causes of cardiac arrest. The TDS rate was 38% (n = 20), and 15 patients (75%) of the survivals were considered to have good cognitive function discharged from the PICU. Neurological dysfunction was the most common cause of death including brain death in 19 patients (35%) and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy due to poor neurological prognosis. Witnessed cardiac arrest and length of low flow < 20 min increased the chances of survival by 4.2-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively. Asystole as the initial rhythm, epinephrine use, severe acidosis, bilateral areflexic mydriasis on admission, liver, and renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were associated with a lower TDS rate, whereas shockable rhythms were associated with a higher TDS rate. Conclusion: In our study, TDS rate of children hospitalized in the PICU after OHCA with ROSC was 38%. Among most of the survivors the neurological prognosis was good. Further, the data implies that primary prevention and optimal early response remain the key strategies to improve survival after OHCA. In addition, neurological dysfunction was the most common cause of death after ROSC, highlighting the opportunity to increase organ donation for transplantation. What is Known: center dot Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children. center dot Survival rates for pediatric OHCA are low and influenced by age, cause of arrest, bystander CPR, and promptness of advanced life support. What is New: center dot Survival after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following OHCA in pediatric patients is being reported for the first time in France. While the survival rate is low, the neurological prognosis of most survivors is good. center dot Primary prevention and optimal early response are key strategies to improve survival. The high occurrence of brain death among nonsurvivors highlights a potential opportunity for organ donation, which appears to be underutilized.

TI  - Intermediate-term outcomes after paediatric cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation - what is known (and unknown)
T2  - CARDIOLOGY IN THE YOUNG
AB  - The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in infants and children with cardiac disease who develop refractory cardiogenic shock, cyanosis, or cardiac arrest is increasing. Early mortality in children with cardiac disease who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains an important issue, as only 40% of cannulated patients survive to discharge from the hospital. However, it is encouraging that 90% children who are discharged alive from the hospital after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are still alive at intermediate-term follow-up. Surviving patients are at risk for long-term dysfunction of multiple organ systems related to their underlying cardiac disease, non-cardiac comorbidities, treatment-related complications, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Among the most important acute complications related to support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is injury to the central nervous system, which may contribute to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. All of these factors, in turn, influence quality of life. Many survivors remain medically complex related to their underlying cardiac disease, comorbidities, and sequelae of complications acquired over their lifetime. Neurological morbidity clearly plays an important role in approximately one-third of survivors, with significant deficits in approximately 10%. The limited data about quality of life data that are available for survivors of cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation suggests that approximately 15-30% of survivors have at least moderately decreased quality of life. Overall, published data support the ongoing use of support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children with acute cardiac failure, most of whom would die without it. However, programmatic efforts to improve the selection of patients and the preservation of the function of end organs during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are clearly needed in order to improve long-term outcomes.

TI  - Targeted Temperature Management in Postresuscitation Care After Incorporating Results of the TTM2 Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Cardiac arrest still accounts for a substantial proportion of cardiovascular related deaths and is associated with a tremendous risk of neurological injury and, among the few survivors, poor quality of life. Critical determinants of survival and long-term functional status after cardiac arrest are timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of an external defibrillator for patients with a shockable rhythm. Outcomes are still far from satisfactory, despite ongoing efforts to improve cardiac arrest response systems, as well as elaborate postresuscitation algorithms. Targeted temperature management at the wide range between 32 degrees C and 36 degrees C has been one of the main therapeutic strategies to improve neurological outcome in postresuscitation care. This recommendation has been mainly based on 2 small randomized trials that were published 20 years ago. Most recent data derived from the TTM2 (Targeted Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial, which included 1861 patients, challenge this strategy. It showed no benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33 degrees C over normothermia at 36 degrees C to 37.5 degrees C with fever prevention. Because temperature management at lower temperatures also correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any benefit in the TTM2 trial, a modification of the guidelines with harmonizing temperature management to normothermia might be necessary.

TI  - The effects of nitroglycerin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The outcome for both in-hospital and out-of hospital cardiac arrest remains dismal. Vasopressors are used to increase coronary perfusion pressure and thus facilitate return of spontaneous circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, they are associated with a number of potential adverse effects and may decrease endocarclial and cerebral organ blood flow. Nitroglycerin has a favourable haemodynamic profile which promotes forward blood flow. Several studies suggest that combined use of nitroglycerin with vasopressors during resuscitation, is associated with increased rates of resuscitation and improved post-resuscitation outcome. This article reviews the effects of nitroglycerin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and postresuscitation period, as well as the beneficial outcomes of a combination regimen consisting of a vasopressor and a vasodilator, such as nitroglycerin.

TI  - The Association Between Days Alive and Out of Hospital and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Sepsis
T2  - CHEST CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: The number of days alive and out of hospital (DAOH) is being used as a primary outcome in clinical trials. Limited data support the contention that it is a patient-important outcome. Research Question: The primary objective was to assess the association between DAOH and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months, as well as to assess the construct validity of DAOH as an outcome measure. Study Design and Methods: Using data from the Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients With Septic Shock, Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation, and Crystalloid vs Hydroxyethyl Starch trials, we calculated the number of DOAH at day 90 (DAOH-90). HRQoL was estimated with the EQ-5D utility index score (range, -0.59 to 1) and the EQ-5D visual analog scale (range, 0-100) at 6 months. The association between DAOH and HRQoL was assessed using linear models, nonlinear models, and nonparametric measures of association. Results: Six thousand two hundred thirteen trial participants included. The median index hospital length of stay was 16 days (interquartile range [IQR], 8-30), and mortality for the index hospitalization was 1,402 of 6,213 (22.6%). The median number of DAOH-90 was 60 days (IQR, 0-77 days). Each additional DAOH-90 was associated with an estimated increase in the 6-month EQ-5D utility index (range, 0-1) of 0.01 (95% CI, 0.01-0.011; P < .001). Adjusted analysis showed that each additional DAOH-90 was associated with an increase of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.04; P < .001) in the EQ-5D visual analog scale (range, 0-100). Trial participants at higher risk of adverse outcomes showed fewer DAOH-90. Interpretation: We found a small positive incremental association between the number of DAOH-90 and HRQoL at 6 months and a negative association between the number of DAOH-90 and risk factors for adverse outcomes. These data provide some support for the use of DAOH-90 as an outcome measure in clinical trials of patients with sepsis.

TI  - Should Doctors Know Their Patients' Attachment Style? A Psychological Perspective and its Impact on Cardiac Surgery Outcomes
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: To increase our understanding of the psychological attachment styles in order to develop a preventative strategy that could potentially improve patients' perioperative outcomes.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed utilizing major electronic databases. The search was done from inception to January 2019. All of the relevant papers have been extracted and critically appraised in this review.
   Results: Understanding the psychological aspects of patients is crucial for a satisfactory postoperative outcome. Depression and anxiety have been shown to increase both mortality and morbidity after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, independently of medical factors, although the behavioural and biological mechanisms are poorly understood. Psychosocial assessment is an important part of the pre-transplant evaluation process. The majority of individuals undergoing a transplant have significant psychosocial problems and can either be deferred or denied the transplant until these psychosocial issues are approached and managed. Psychological distress has been shown to affect long-term prognosis of cardiac patients and as a result, it should be addressed during follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors due to cardiac cause. Several studies have considered different approaches and analyses of different psychological attachments, and the understanding of such parameters perioperatively could possibly minimise perioperatively complications.
   Conclusion: Since psychological distress affects long-term prognosis of cardiac surgery patients, it should be addressed during follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors due to cardiac cause.

TI  - How stepwise interventions in pre-hospital emergency care enhance out-of-hospital cardiac arrest management in a Megacity in China
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: A series of improvements have been formulated and implemented to prompt the inadequate pre-hospital care capacity for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) management in China. The aim of this study is to investigate the combined association of those stepwise interventions with OHCA management in Shenzhen, as a representative city in China. Methods: This registry-based retrospective study included emergency medical services (EMS)-treated adult OHCA patients with presumed cardiac etiology in Shenzhen, China, covering the period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2022. During this period, three key interventions were implemented sequentially: a public access defibrillation (PAD) program on October 1, 2017, a civilian cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training program on July 1, 2020, and telecommunicator cardiopulmonary resuscitation (T-CPR) on November 23, 2021. The outcomes of bystander CPR and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were compared with pre-intervention controls. Results: A total of 6,571 EMS-treated presumed cardiac etiology adult OHCA patients were included, among which were 623 cases with bystander-witnessed OHCA and a shockable rhythm. Across four periods, the rates of both bystander CPR (8.55 vs. 12.60 vs. 18.31 vs. 23.10%) and ROSC (6.01 vs. 5.29 vs. 9.59 vs. 8.33%) showed an increasing trend. For the rate of bystander CPR, the likelihood was significantly increased after implementation of the PAD program (OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.21-2.23]) and civilian CPR training program (OR 2.12 [95% CI: 1.52-2.95]), and after the addition of the T-CPR application (OR 3.06 [95% CI: 2.14-4.39]), compared with the pre-period. Similarly, cumulative interventions were associated with a higher ROSC (OR 0.84 [95% CI: 0.62-1.14], OR 1.52 [95% CI: 1.07-1.89], OR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.07-1.89]) when compared with the pre-period. In subgroup analysis, cumulative interventions significantly improved the rate of bystander CPR in cases where OHCA occurred in public locations, and ROSC in cases where the time from symptom onset to calling 120 was within 10 min. Conclusion: Stepwise interventions in pre-hospital emergency care increased likelihood of bystander CPR and ROSC following pre-hospital resuscitation significantly. This improvement is attributed to the coordination and cumulative effect of multiple positive interventions for OHCA management.

TI  - Air Pollution and Cardiac Arrest: A More Significant Intermediate Role of COPD than Cardiac Events
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - No prior studies have linked long-term air pollution exposure to incident sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or its possible development trajectories. We aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and SCA, as well as possible intermediate diseases. Based on the UK Biobank cohort, Cox proportional hazard model was applied to explore associations between air pollutants and SCA. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were selected as intermediate conditions, and multistate model was fitted for trajectory analysis. During a median follow-up of 13.7 years, 2884 participants developed SCA among 458 237 individuals. The hazard ratios (HRs) for SCA were 1.04-1.12 per interquartile range increment in concentrations of fine particulate matter, inhalable particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Most prominently, air pollutants could induce SCA through promoting transitions from baseline health to COPD (HRs: 1.06-1.24) and then to SCA (HRs: 1.16-1.27). Less importantly, SCA could be developed through transitions from baseline health to MACE (HRs: 1.02-1.07) and further to SCA (HRs: 1.12-1.16). This study provides novel and compelling evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution could promote the development of SCA, with COPD serving as a more important intermediate condition than MACE.

TI  - Prompt dispatcher-initiated tele-CPR and facilitation of bystander's CPR to improve out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes: A prospective cohort study from Finland
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: This study focused on the first link of the chain of survival by examining the dispatcher's ability to early recognition of the OHCA patient and assessing patient outcomes. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that included patients who suffered OHCA in Pirkanmaa Finland in 2022. Two researchers listened to all calls separately determining key-time events of the call. All patients with confirmed recognisable OHCA during the call who had background data and audio recordings available were included. Results: We received 451 recordings, 246 of which met the inclusion criteria, and 217 (88 %) were recognised as OHCA. The beginning of tele-CPR guidance (1 min 20 sec vs 1 min 55 sec, p = 0.002) and initiation of bystander CPR (2 min 48 sec vs 3 min 50 sec, p = 0.012) were faster in cases with shockable rhythm on EMS arrival. Every minute of delay in the dispatcher initiating tele-CPR guidance decreased the probability of shockable initial rhythm by 23 % (OR 0.76 [0.61;0.95], p = 0.018). Shockable initial rhythm was more common among patients who were alive at three months after OHCA (83 % vs 21 %, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, shockable initial rhythm favoured 3-month survival (OR 16.67 [5.41;52.63], p < 0.001). Overall survival at three months was 12 % (29/246), of which 90 % (26/29) had a Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2. Conclusion: Quick tele-CPR guidance may be related to/ associated with improving the chances for shockable initial rhythm, thus further improving the chances for long-term survival.

TI  - A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF 15 PATIENTS WITH ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA
T2  - BRITISH HEART JOURNAL
AB  - The clinical course in 15 patients with features consistent with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is described. At referral seven patients had abnormal physical findings, nine had abnormal electrocardiograms with non-specific right-sided abnormalities, and seven patients had increased heart size or prominent right ventricles on chest x ray. During long term follow up (mean 8.8 years, range 1.5 to 28 years) 11 patients had abnormal physical findings, 11 had electrocardiographic changes, and nine had increased heart size. Recurrent sustained right ventricular tachycardia was the most common arrhythmia (10 patients). Two patients experienced ventricular fibrillation. Seven patients suffered from over 10 episodes of ventricular tachycardia, nine required cardioversions, and 10 patients had associated serious symptoms such as syncope, severe hypotension, or cardiac arrest. Four patients required operation to correct the arrhythmia and three patients developed right heart failure. Two out of three deaths were sudden. These data suggest that in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia right ventricular abnormalities may be progressive and that the condition may affect the left ventricle. The course of the ventricular arrhythmias was highly variable and could not be predicted in individual patients. The potential for lethal ventricular arrhythmias is evident and warrants intensive diagnostic efforts to identify patients with adverse prognostic features.

TI  - Acute Lung Injury after Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Narrative Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) includes lifesaving maneuvers, it might be associated with a wide spectrum of iatrogenic injuries. Among these, acute lung injury (ALI) is frequent and yields significant challenges to post-cardiac arrest recovery. Understanding the relationship between CPR and ALI is determinant for refining resuscitation techniques and improving patient outcomes. This review aims to analyze the existing literature on ALI following CPR, emphasizing prevalence, clinical implications, and contributing factors. The review seeks to elucidate the pathogenesis of ALI in the context of CPR, assess the efficacy of CPR techniques and ventilation strategies, and explore their impact on post-cardiac arrest outcomes. CPR-related injuries, ranging from skeletal fractures to severe internal organ damage, underscore the complexity of managing post-cardiac arrest patients. Chest compression, particularly when prolonged and vigorous, i.e., mechanical compression, appears to be a crucial factor contributing to ALI, with the concept of cardiopulmonary resuscitation-associated lung edema (CRALE) gaining prominence. Ventilation strategies during CPR and post-cardiac arrest syndrome also play pivotal roles in ALI development. The recognition of CPR-related lung injuries, especially CRALE and ALI, highlights the need for research on optimizing CPR techniques and tailoring ventilation strategies during and after resuscitation.

TI  - A 27-Year Follow-Up for a Patient With 100% Total Body Surface Area Burn
T2  - JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
AB  - Patients suffering from severe 100% TBSA burns are particularly vulnerable to infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, being on high risks of poor outcomes. Treatment of these patients remains to be a great challenge for burn physicians, and survivors of 100% TBSA burns generally have poor quality of life after burn. Since, to our knowledge, this is the first case report on the long-term follow-up of a 100% TBSA burn survivor, the authors are presenting the initial injury, treatment, and follow-up of this female patient during 27 years. She had received good first aid, successful fluid resuscitation, and effective antibiotic therapy. The wounds healed after 8 sessions of skin grafting by postburn day 108, and she was dismissed after 121 days. To promote her recovery, a structured rehabilitation plan was initiated immediately after the admission and conducted consistently throughout her postburn life. The authors evaluated her quality of life after 27 years' follow-up using adapted Chinese version of the Burn Specific Health Scale-brief version and Chinese translation version of the Short Form-36, the results of which suggest that the patient is satisfied with her life in psychologic perspectives despite lower scores in physical aspects.

TI  - Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis and meta-regression analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Establishing vascular access during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is essential for delivering guideline-recommended medications. This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical effectiveness of initial vascular access attempts through the intraosseous route to the intravenous route in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science, up to March 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score-matched (PSM) observational studies comparing initial attempt intraosseous access with initial intravenous access in patients with OHCA. R Studio version 4.4.2 was used to perform statistical analysis applying a random-effect model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to determine the robustness of findings and estimate required information size (RIS). Four RCTs and four PSM studies involving 28 632 patients with OHCA were identified. The analysis revealed no significant differences between initial vascular access attempts via the intraosseous route compared with the intravenous route regarding survival to hospital discharge [odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-1.13, P = 0.49], sustained return of spontaneous circulation (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74-1.02, P = 0.09) or survival with favorable neurological outcomes (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54-1.03, P = 0.08). Meta-regression identified initial shockable rhythm as a significant modifier of survival to hospital discharge (P = 0.012). TSA demonstrated the Z curve failed to reach the RIS, indicating that further studies are needed for conclusive evidence. In adults with OHCA, establishing vascular access through the intraosseous route demonstrates comparable effects to intravenous access in terms of survival and neurological outcomes. Further RCTs are needed to strengthen the evidence base and should assess long-term effects, promote protocol standardization, and enhance paramedic training.

TI  - Influences on the duration and success of out-of-hospital resuscitation of geriatric patients over 80 years of age - a retrospective evaluation
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Society is experiencing an increasing shift in the age distribution and accordingly, increased resuscitation rates of patients over 80 years and older. In 2022, more than 34% of people resuscitated in Germany were older than 80 years, although older age is considered a poor predictor for the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Professional societies provide ethical recommendations on when resuscitation may be considered futile and should be terminated. However, the extent to which these recommendations are implemented is unclear. Methods Retrospective evaluation of pre-hospital documentation of out-of-hospital resuscitations in patients >= 80 years of age in the period 01/01/2014-12/31/2022 in one German county combined with data of the German Resuscitation Registry. For statistical testing, the significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results In total 578 cases were analyzed. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC): 26% (n = 148). Survival to discharge: 6.1% (n = 35). Median CPR duration: 17 min (10-28 min). The older the patients were, the worse the survival rate (p = 0.05) and the shorter the time to termination (p < 0.0001). No patient over 90 years of age was discharged alive. Resuscitation was also significantly shorter until termination with poorer ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score (p < 0.001). Residents resuscitated significantly longer than specialists (p = 0.02). In surviving patients, there was a significant correlation between short CPR duration and good cerebral performance category (CPC) value: Median CPC1/2 = 5 min [3-10 min] vs. CPC 3/4 = 18 min [10-21 min]; p = 0.01. Interpretation Old age and poor health status is associated with shorter CPR duration until termination and older age is associated with poorer prognosis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) concerning the possibility of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival. A short resuscitation time is associated with a better CPC value. Therefore, when resuscitating patients over 80 years of age, even greater care should be taken to ensure that reversible causes are quickly corrected in order to achieve a ROSC and a good neurological outcome. Alternatively, resuscitation should be terminated promptly, as good survival can no longer be guaranteed. Resuscitation lasting more than 20 min should be avoided in any case, in line with the termination of resuscitation (ToR) criteria.

TI  - Outcome of survivors of accidental deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest treated with extracorporeal blood warming
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - Background Cardiopulmonary bypass has been used to rewarm victims of accidental deep hypothermia. Unlike other rewarming techniques, it restores organ perfusion immediately in patients with inadequate circulation. This study evaluated the long-term outcome of survivors of accidental deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest who had been rewarmed with cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Methods Deep hypothermia (core temperature, <28 degrees C) with circulatory arrest was found in 46 of 234 patients with accidental hypothermia. In 32 of the 46 patients, rewarming with cardiopulmonary bypass was attempted, resulting in 15 long-term survivors. In most of these patients, deep hypothermia developed after mountaineering accidents or suicide attempts. After an average (+/-SD) of 6.7+/-4.0 years of follow-up, we obtained the patients' medical histories and performed neurologic and neuropsychological examinations, neurovascular ultrasound studies, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.
   Results The average age of the patients was 25.2+/-9.9 years; seven were female and eight were male. The mean interval from discovery of the pa tient to rewarming with cardiopulmonary bypass was 141+/-50 minutes (range, 30 to 240). At follow-up there were no hypothermia-related sequelae that impaired quality of life. Neurologic and neuropsychological deficits observed in the early period after rewarming had fully or almost completely disappeared. One patient had cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging with mild clinical signs, a condition that may have been caused by hypothermia. Other clinical abnormalities were either preexisting or due to injuries not related to hypothermia.
   Conclusions This clinical experience demonstrates that young, otherwise healthy people can survive accidental deep hypothermia with no or minimal cerebral impairment, even with prolonged circulatory arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass appears to be an efficacious rewarming technique. (C) 1997, Massachusetts Medical Society.

TI  - The Role of Inflammatory Cytokines in Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is characterized by systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury, anoxic brain injury, and post-arrest myocardial dysfunction superimposed on a precipitating pathology. The role of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac arrest remains unclear. Aims: We aimed to describe, with an emphasis on clinical applications, what is known about the role of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac arrest. Data Sources: A PubMed literature review was performed for relevant articles. Only articles in English that studied cytokines in patients with cardiac arrest were included. Results: Cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PCAS. Following cardiac arrest, the large release of circulating cytokines mediates the ischemia/reperfusion injury, brain dysfunction, and myocardial dysfunction seen. Interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and matrix metalloproteinases all play a unique prognostic role in PCAS. High levels of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with mortality and/or poor neurologic outcomes. Interventions to modify the systemic inflammation seen in PCAS continue to be heavily studied. Currently, the only approved medical intervention for comatose patients following cardiac arrest is targeted temperature management. Medical agents, including minocycline and sodium sulfide, have demonstrated promise in animal models. Conclusions: The role of inflammatory cytokines for both short- and long-term outcomes is an important area for future investigation.

TI  - Adverse events following implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation: a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERVENTIONAL CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) prevent sudden cardiac death, but patients need to be counseled about potential harms. We summarized the evidence on adverse events from ICDs with a focus on ICD use for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.
   Methods We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 2002 through 2012 for reports of adverse events from ICDs implanted for primary prevention or mixed indications (primary and secondary prevention). Studies had to have >= 500 patients and specify patient numerators and denominators.
   Results Data from 35 independent cohorts reported in 53 articles were included. Reports from one registry provided high quality evidence on adverse events during hospitalization for ICD implantation. Adverse events ranged from 2.8 to 3.6 %. Serious adverse events ranged from 1.2 to 1.4 %. The most frequent serious adverse events were pneumothorax (0.4-0.5 %) and cardiac arrest (0.3 %). The quality of the evidence for long-term adverse events was low. Frequency of adverse events post-hospitalization was variable, as was follow-up: device-related complications <0.1-6.4 % (2-49 months), lead-related complications <0.1-3.9 % (1.5-40 months), infection 0.2-3.7 % (1.5-49 months), and thrombosis 0.2-2.9 % (1.5-49 months). Evidence for inappropriate shock was of moderate quality with 3-21 % of patients experiencing at least one inappropriate shock during 1 to 5 years of follow-up. Limitations The limitation of the evidence reviewed in this study is low quality evidence for adverse events post-hospitalization. Evidence is predominantly from mixed primary and secondary prevention populations.
   Conclusions In-hospital adverse events after ICD implantation are infrequent. The estimates for long-term adverse events are uncertain. Up to one-fifth of patients receive inappropriate shocks.

TI  - A national analysis of the relationship between hospital factors and post-cardiac arrest mortality
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - We sought to generate national estimates for post-cardiac arrest mortality, to assess trends, and to identify hospital factors associated with survival.
   We used a national sample of US hospitals to identify patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest from 2000 to 2004 to describe the association between hospital factors (teaching status, location, size) and mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges. Analyses were performed using logistic regression.
   A total of 109,739 patients were identified. In-hospital mortality was 70.6%. A 2% decrease in unadjusted mortality from 71.6% in 2000 to 69.6% in 2004 (OR 0.96, P < 0.001) was observed. Mortality was lower at teaching hospitals (OR 0.58, P = 0.001), urban hospitals (OR 0.63, P = 0.004), and large hospitals (OR 0.55, P < 0.001).
   Mortality after in-hospital cardiac arrest decreased over 5 years. Mortality was lower at urban, teaching, and large hospitals. There are implications for dissemination of best practices or regionalization of post-cardiac arrest care.

TI  - Long-term outcomes after event-free cardioverter defibrillator implantation: comparison between patients discharged within 24 h and routinely hospitalized patients in the German DEVICE registry
T2  - EUROPACE
AB  - Aims To analyse the long-term safety of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients discharged within 24 h or after 2- 5-day hospitalization, respectively, after complication-free implantation, in circumstances of actual care.
   Methods and results Patients in the multicentre, nationwide German DEVICE registry were contacted 12-15 months after their first ICD implantation or device replacement. Data were collected on complications, potential arrhythmic events, syncope, resuscitation, ablation procedures, cardiac events, hospitalizations, heart failure status, change of medication, and quality of life. Of 2356 patients from 43 centres, 527 patients were discharged within 24 h and 1829 were hospitalized routinely for >24 h after complication-free implantations. The disease profiles and rates of co-morbidities were similar at baseline for both cohorts. During between 384 and 543 days of follow-up, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of complications, hospitalizations, or quality of life. One-year rates of death were 4.5% in patients discharged early compared with 7.2% in hospitalized patients (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.02; P = 0.052). Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events or defibrillator events were not higher in patients discharged after 24 h. In both groups, a high rate of patients declared that they would opt for the procedure again in the same situation.
   Conclusion Data from a large-scale registry reflecting current day-to-day practice in Germany suggest that most patients can be discharged safely within 24 h of successful ICD implantation if there are no procedure-related events. Follow-up data up to 1.5 years after implantation did not raise long-term safety concerns.

TI  - Optimal timing to measure optic nerve sheath diameter as a prognostic predictor in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: We evaluated the optimal timing of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement to predict neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with target temperature management (TTM).
   Methods: This was a prospective single-centre observational study from April 2018 to March 2019. Good outcome was defined as the Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance categories (CPC) 1 or 2, and poor outcome as a CPC between 3 and 5. ONSD was measured initially after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (ONSDinitial), at 24 h (ONSD24), 48 h (ONSD48), and 72 h (ONSD72) using ultrasonography. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and DeLong method were used to compare the values for predicting neurologic outcomes.
   Results: Out of the 36 patients enrolled, 18 had a good outcome. ONSD24, ONSD48 nd ONSD72 were higher in the poor outcome group. The area under ROC curve of ONSD24 was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.77-0.98) in predicting poor neurologic outcomes. With a cut off value of 4.90 mm, ONSD24 had a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 94.4% in predicting poor neurologic outcomes.
   Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate ONSD24 as a valuable tool to predict the neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with TTM. Therefore, we recommend performing ONSD measurement using ultrasonography at 24 h after ROSC, rather than immediately after ROSC, to predict neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with TTM.

TI  - FIRST RUSSIAN EXPERIENCE IN LIVER AND KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION FROM DONORS WITH OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST: 3 YEARS' RESULTS
T2  - VESTNIK TRANSPLANTOLOGII I ISKUSSTVENNYH ORGANOV
AB  - Introduction. In megacities, the use of organs obtained from those who died as a result of sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) for transplantation is one of the promising ways of addressing the problem of organ donor shortage. In St. Petersburg, the model of transition from life support via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) of patients after OHCA to ECMO life support for organs of potential donors was tested for the first time. Materials and methods. In order to implement the program, round-the-clock ECMO and transplantation teams were organized at the inpatient emergency ward of Pavlov First St. Petersburg State Medical University. Interaction with the St. Petersburg City Emergency Station, St. Petersburg was established. The protocol of work with potential donors brought to the hospital after a sudden circulatory arrest was developed, approved by the ethics committee, and implemented in clinical practice. This was the first in Russia and in international practice. Between 2017 and 2020, 67 patients with sudden OHCA were brought to the inpatient emergency ward. In 4 (5.97%) cases, advanced cardiovascular life support was successful, and 11 (16.42%) patients became effective donors. Mortality among this group of patients without subsequent postmortem donation was 77.61% (52 patients). Results. Liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) whose blood circulation was restored by ECMO (ECMO NHBD) was performed in 5 recipients who were in severe condition against the background of liver failure. In 1 (20%) case, there was severe liver allograft dysfunction for 33 days with subsequent complete restoration of function. Kidney transplantation was performed in 22 patients. Immediate graft function occurred in 10 (45.45%), while delayed function occurred in 12 (54.55%) patients. Kidney graft survival was 86.4%, kidney graft recipient survival was 95.5%, liver graft recipient survival was 80%, and the follow-up period was 24.1 +/- 7.15 months. Conclusion. The use of ECMO to save the lives of patients with sudden OHCA can be implemented in conditions of a high degree of organization and synchronization of the work of the city emergency medical station and the emergency department of a multidisciplinary hospital. If cardiopulmonary resuscitation with ECMO (ECMO CPR) fails, it is possible to launch the ECMO NHBD donor program. Long-term outcomes of liver and kidney transplantation from ECMO NHBD are consistent with those using organs from brain-dead donors. Widespread implementation of the new organ donation model will increase the availability of transplant care.Y

TI  - Detailed analysis of health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To describe the detailed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivors from the TTM-trial and to investigate potential differences related to sex and age.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study originating from a large prospective international, multicentre trial, including 442 respondents who answered the Short Form-36 item Questionnaire Health Survey version 2 (R) (SF-36v2 (R)) at a structured follow-up 6 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Statistical analysis between independent groups were performed with Mann-Whitney U or Chi-square. Age was analysed primarily as a dichotomised variable.
   Results: Although overall physical and mental health were within the normal range, a substantial proportion of respondents had impaired function at domain-specific levels, particularly in Role-Physical (50%) and Role-Emotional (35%). Females scored significantly lower than males in; Physical Functioning (41.7 vs. 47.9, p < 0.001), Role-Physical (40.4 vs. 44.3, p = 0.02), General Health (47.0 vs. 50.5, p = 0.02), Vitality (47.2 vs. 52.7, p < 0.001), and Role-Emotional (41.5 vs. 46.2, p = 0.009). Those <= 65 years scored significantly better in Physical Functioning (47.9 vs. 44.1 p < 0.001), while those > 65 years scored significantly better in Vitality (50.8 vs. 53.7, p = 0.006) and Mental Health (50.3 vs. 52.6, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Many OHCA survivors demonstrated impaired function in HRQoL at a domain level, despite most patients reporting an acceptable general HRQoL. Females reported worse HRQoL than males. Older age was associated with a worse Physical Functioning but better Vitality and Mental Health. Role-Physical and Role-Emotional aspects of health were especially affected, even when effects of age and sex where accounted for.

TI  - Quality of survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be poor, in terms of life expectancy and quality of life.
   Objectives: To determine the impact of patient characteristics before, during, and after CPR on these outcomes, and to compare results of the quality-of-life assessment with published studies.
   Methods: In a cohort study, we assessed by formal instruments the quality of life, cognitive functioning, depression, and level of dependence of survivors after in-hospital CPR. Follow-up was at least 3 months after discharge from the hospital (tertiary care center).
   Results: Of 827 resuscitated patients, 12% (n = 101) survived to follow-up. Of the survivors, 89% participated in the study. Most survivors were independent in daily life (75%), 17% were cognitively impaired, and 16% had depressive symptoms. Multivariate regression analysis showed that quality of life and cognitive function were determined by 2 factors known before CPR-the reason for admission and age. Factors during and after resuscitation, such as prolonged cardiac arrest and coma, did not significantly determine the quality of life or cognitive functioning of survivors. The quality of life of our CPR survivors was worse compared with a reference group of elderly individuals, but better than that of a reference group of patients with stroke. The quality of life did not importantly differ between the compared studies of CPR survivors.
   Conclusions: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is frequently unsuccessful, but if survival is achieved, a relatively good quality of life can be expected. Quality of life after CPR is mostly determined by factors known before CPR. These findings may be helpful in informing patients about the outcomes of CPR.

TI  - Cognitive Recovery After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Insights Into Improvement Over 6 Months and the Role of Arrest Duration
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although resuscitation advancements have increased survival, many survivors suffer cognitive impairments that affect their quality of life. Most research has focused on neurological outcomes, whereas little attention has been paid to cognitive function. The aim is to investigate the proportion of cognitive impairment in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest and to investigate the association between the duration of cardiac arrest and level of cognitive function.Methods In this prospective cohort study, 184 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening tool. Duration of cardiac arrest was defined by no flow, low flow, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. Multiple logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) and CI.Results Of 184 survivors assessed, 26% had normal cognitive function at discharge, increasing to 67% at 6 months (n=149). Median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score improved from 23 (Q25-Q75: 20-26) to 26 (Q25-Q75: 24-28). At 6 months, adjusted ORs per minute were 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for low flow and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for time to return of spontaneous circulation, whereas associations at discharge were near null (aOR approximate to 0.99). No significant association was found either at discharge or follow-up.Conclusions Cognitive function improved considerably within 6 months following cardiac arrest, with the proportion of patients exhibiting normal cognitive function increasing from 26% to 67%. This study found no association between the duration of cardiac arrest and cognitive function.

TI  - Proteomics-Based Serum Alterations of the Human Protein Expression after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Pilot Study for Prognostication of Survivors vs. Non-Survivors at Day 1 after Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Targeted temperature management (TTM) is considered standard therapy for patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). To date, valid protein markers do not exist to prognosticate survivors and non-survivors before the end of TTM. The aim of this study is to identify specific protein patterns/arrays, which are useful for prediction in the very early phase after ROSC. Material and Methods: A total of 20 adult patients with ROSC (19 male, 1 female; 69.9 +/- 9.5 years) were included and dichotomized in two groups (survivors and non-survivors at day 30). Serum samples were drawn at day 1 after ROSC (during TTM). Three panels (organ failure, metabolic, neurology, inflammation; OLINK, Uppsala, Sweden) were utilised. A total of four proteins were found to be differentially regulated (>2- or t-test). Bioinformatic platforms were utilised to analyse pathways and identify signalling cascades and to screen for potential biomarkers. Results: A total of 276 proteins were analysed and revealed only 11 statistically significant protein alterations (Siglec-9, LAYN, SKR3, JAM-B, N2DL-2, TNF-B, BAMBI, NUCB2, STX8, PTK7, and PVLAB). Following the Bonferroni correction, no proteins were found to be regulated as statistically significant. Concerning the protein fold change for clinical significance, four proteins (IL-1 alpha, N-CDase, IL5, CRH) were found to be regulated in a clinically relevant context. Conclusions: Early analysis at 1 day after ROSC was not sufficiently possible during TTM to prognosticate survival or non-survival after OHCA. Future studies should evaluate protein expression later in the course after ROSC to identify promising protein candidates.

TI  - Post-cardiac arrest syndrome: definition, pathophysiology, and management
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - The post-cardiac arrest syndrome is a delicate, critical and complex condition that involves most patients resuscitated by a cardiac arrest. The main pathophysiological mechanism of this syndrome is a widespread ischemia-reperfusion damage, then there are other pathological alterations involving various organs which, if untreated, can evolve into multiorgan dysfunction. For this reason, a series of diagnostic-therapeutic actions (bundles) are necessary to ensure a correct management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome: adequate oxygenation and ventilation, hemodynamic stabilization, temperature control, early prediction of neurological outcome, optimization of metabolic aspects, indication and timing of coronary angiography. The management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the fifth link in the chain of survival, consists of a set of early, complex and multidisciplinary interventions, which must be promptly started, immediately after a return of spontaneous circulation, regardless of the location of cardiac arrest presentation, and it aims to obtain a good hemodynamic and neurological recovery. In this review, we will address the most recent scientific recommendations in the various areas of management of post-cardiac arrest syndrome that have led in recent years to a change in the practical approach to the comatose patient after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Association of health insurance with post-resuscitation care and neurological outcomes after return of spontaneous circulation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in Korea
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: We investigated the association of health insurance status with post-resuscitation care and neurological recovery in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and whether the effects changed with age or gender.
   Methods: Adult OHCAs with presumed cardiac etiology who had sustained ROSC from 2013 to 2016 were enrolled from the nationwide OHCA registry of Korea. Insurance status was categorized into 2 groups: National Health Insurance (NHI) and Medical Aid (MA). The endpoints were post-resuscitation coronary reperfusion therapy (CRT), targeted temperature management (TTM), and good neurological recovery (cerebral performance category of 1 or 2). Multivariable logistic regression models and interaction analyses (insurance x age and insurance x gender) were conducted for adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: Of a total of 19,865 eligible OHCA patients, 18,119 (91.2%) were covered by NHI and 1746 (8.8%) by MA. The MA group was less likely to receive post-resuscitation CRT and TTM (aOR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.59-0.96) for CRT; 0.71 (0.57-0.89) for TTM) and had worse neurological outcomes (0.71 (0.57-0.89)) compared with the NHI group. In the interaction analyses, MA was associated with less CRT and good neurological recovery in the 4564 year old group (0.54 (0.37-0.77) for CRT; 0.70 (0.51-0.95) for neurological outcome) and in the male group (0.69 (0.52-0.91) for CRT; 0.77 (0.61-0.97) for TTM; 0.70 (0.53-0.92)) for neurological outcome).
   Conclusions: There were disparities in post-resuscitation care and substantial neurological recovery by health insurance status, and the disparities were prominent in middle-aged adults and males. Increasing health insurance coverage for post-resuscitation care should be considered.

TI  - DETERMINANTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN SURVIVORS OF CARDIAC ARREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To study factors related to quality of life after a hypoxic period due to cardiac arrest. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Subjects: Eighty-eight survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, admitted to a Dutch academic hospital between 2001 and 2006.
   Methods: Patients received a set of questionnaires at home. The main outcome measures were physical and mental quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-36). Potential determinants were cognitive complaints, emotional problems (depression/anxiety), post-traumatic stress, fatigue, daily functioning and participation in society. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed with physical and mental quality of life as dependent variables.
   Results: Sixty-three (72%) patients responded. Mean time since cardiac arrest was 36 months (standard deviation (SD) 19). Backward regression analyses showed that physical quality of life was significantly (p<0.001, adjusted R(2)=0.531) related to cognitive complaints (beta=-0.378), instrumental daily life activities (beta=0.262), post-traumatic stress (beta=-0.246) and fatigue (beta=-0.226). Mental quality of life was significantly (p<0.001, adjusted R(2)=0.664) explained by anxiety/depression (beta=-0.609), fatigue (beta=-0.177) and cognitive complaints (beta=-0.175).
   Conclusion: Quality of life is related to cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety/depression, post-traumatic stress and difficulties in daily activities in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Rehabilitation programmes for this group should specifically address these topics.

TI  - Prophylactic lidocaine for post resuscitation care of patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Antiarrhythmic drugs like lidocaine are usually given to promote return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during ongoing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) from ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT). Whether administering such drugs prophylactically for post-resuscitation care after ROSC prevents re-arrest and improves outcome is unstudied.
   Methods: We evaluated a cohort of 1721 patients with witnessed VF/VT OHCA who did (1296) or did not receive prophylactic lidocaine (425) at first ROSC. Study endpoints included re-arrest, hospital admission and survival.
   Results: Prophylacic lidocaine recipients and non-recipients were comparable, except for shorter time to first ROSC and higher systolic blood pressure at ROSC in those receiving lidocaine. After initial ROSC, arrest from VF/VT recurred in 16.7% and from non-shockable arrhythmias in 3.2% of prophylactic lidocaine recipients, 93.5% of whom were admitted to hospital and 62.4% discharged alive, as compared with 37.4%, 7.8%, 84.9% and 44.5%, of corresponding non-recipients (all p < 0.0001). Adjusted for pertinent covariates, prophylactic lidocaine was independently associated with reduced odds of re-arrest from VF/VT, odds ratio, (95% confidence interval) 0.34 (0.26-0.44) and from nonshockable arrhythmias (0.47 (0.29-0.78)); a higher hospital admission rate (1.88, (1.28-2.76)) and improved survival to discharge (1.49 (1.15-1.95)). However in a propensity score-matched sensitivity analysis, lidocaine's only beneficial association with outcome was in a lower incidence of recurrent VF/VT arrest.
   Conclusions: Administration of prophylactic lidocaine upon ROSC after OHCA was consistently associated with less recurrent VF/VT arrest, and therapeutic equipoise for other measures. The prospect of a promising association between lidocaine prophylaxis and outcome, without evidence of harm, warrants further investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mechanical devices for cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of the review For over 40 years, manual chest compressions have been the foundation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and recent studies have clearly reconfirmed the hemodynamic significance of delivering consistent, high-quality, infrequently-interrupted chest compressions. However, there remain multiple inadequacies in the actual delivery of manual chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One potential solution is use of adjunct mechanical devices
   Recent findings Two different methods of accessory chest compression techniques recently have demonstrated enhanced short-term survival. The active compression-decompression device is a hand-held, manually operated suction device applied to the center of the chest wall. In tandem with an impedance threshold (airway) device active compression-decompression has shown a 65% improvement in 23-hour survival rates (compared with standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in a randomized out-of-hospital clinical trial (n = 210). The second device, called Auto-Pulse CPR is an automated machine that uses a load-distributing, broad compression band that is applied across the enrire anterior chest. A recent out-of-hospital retrospective case-control study (n = 162) also revealed improved short-term survival.
   Summary High quality chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are critical elements in effecting successful resuscitation following a cardiac arrest. Recent studies utilizing adjunct mechanical devices have not only revealed significant increases in the effectivness of chest compressions, including improved hemodynamics in both animal models and human studies, but also improvements in short-term human survival in the clinical setting. It is hoped that these promising findings will eventually be corroborated in terms of improved neurologically intact, long-term patient survival. Clinical trials are currently underway to validate such efficacy.

TI  - Pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by left coronary-artery agenesis with primary shockable rhythm
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: To illustrate a rare cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children, its differential diagnoses, emergency and subsequent treatment at various steps in the rescue chain, and potential outcomes.& para;& para;Case presentation: A 4-year-old boy with unknown agenesis of the left coronary ostium sustained out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Bystander cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was initiated and defibrillation was performed via an automated external defibrillator (AED) shortly after paramedics arrived at the scene, restoring sinus rhythm and spontaneous circulation. After admission to the intensive care unit the child was intubated for airway and seizure control. Further diagnostic work-up by angiography revealed agenesis of the left coronary artery. After initial seizures, the boy's neurological recovery was complete. He subsequently underwent successful internal mammary artery in-situ bypass surgery to the trunk of the left coronary artery. One year after cardiac arrest, the patient had completely recovered with no physical or intellectual sequelae. A catheter examination proved excellent growth of the bypass and good cardiac function.& para;& para;Conclusions: This case illustrates the long term outcome after agenesis of the LCA while reiterating that prompt access to pediatric defibrillation may be lifesaving-albeit in a minority of pediatric OHCA.

TI  - Effect of video laryngoscopy for non-trauma out-of-hospital cardiac arrest on clinical outcome: A registry-based analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Videolaryngoscopy (VL) is a promising tool to provide a safe airway during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and to ensure early reoxygenation. Using data from the German Resuscitation Registry, we investigated the outcome of non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with VL versus direct laryngoscopy (DL) for airway management.Methods: We analysed retrospective data of 14,387 patients from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2021 (VL group, n = 2201; DL group, n = 12186). Primary endpoint was discharge with cerebral performance categories one and two (CPC1/2). Secondary endpoints were the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), hospital admission, hospital admission with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 30-day survival/ hospital discharge and airway management complications. We used multivariate binary logistic regression analysis to identify the effects on outcome of known influencing variables and of VL vs DL.Results: The multivariate regression model revealed that VL was an independent predictor of CPC1/2 survival (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.12-1.61, p = 0.002) and of hospital discharge/30-day survival (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.08-1.47, p = 0,004).Conclusion: VL for endotracheal intubation (ETI) at OHCA was associated with better neurological outcome in patients with ROSC. Therefore, the use of VL for OHCA offers a promising perspective. Further prospective studies are required.

TI  - Variation in Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Within a Regional EMS System
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objective: Within Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) regional systems, there may be significant differences in the approach to patient care despite efforts to promote standardization. Identifying hospital-level factors that contribute to variations in care can provide opportunities to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate variation in post-cardiac arrest care within a large EMS system and explore the contribution of hospital-level factors. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis from a regional cardiac system serving over 10 million persons. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are transported to 36 cardiac arrest centers with 24/7 emergent coronary angiography (CAG) capabilities and targeted temperature management (TTM) policies based on regional guidelines. We included adult patients >= 18 years with non-traumatic OHCA from 2016-2018. Patients with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order and those who died in the emergency department (ED) were excluded. For the TTM analysis, we also excluded patients who were alert in the ED. The primary outcome was receiving CAG or TTM after cardiac arrest. The secondary outcome was neurologic recovery (dichotomized to define a "good" outcome as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2). We used generalized estimating equations including patient-level factors (age, sex, witnessed arrest, initial rhythm) and hospital-level factors (academic status, hospital size based on licensed beds, annual OHCA patient volume) to estimate the odds ratios associated with these variables. Results: There were 7831 patients with OHCA during the study period; 4694 were analyzed for CAG and 3903 for TTM. The median and range for treatment with CAG and TTM after OHCA was 23% (12-49%) and 58% (17-92%) respectively. Hospital size was associated with increased likelihood of CAG, adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.05-2.86, p = 0.03. Academic status approached significance in its association with TTM, adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 0.98-2.91, p = 0.06. Overall, 28% of patients survived with good neurologic outcome, ranging from 17 to 43% across hospitals. Conclusion: Within this regional cardiac system, there was significant variation in use of CAG and TTM after OHCA, which was not fully explained by patient-level factors. Hospital size was associated with increased CAG.

TI  - Health-related quality of life is better for cardiac arrest survivors who received citizen cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background - This study evaluated the prehospital factors associated with better health-related quality of life for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods and Results - This prospective, 20-community, cohort study involved consecutive, adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who survived to 1 year. Patients were contacted by telephone and evaluated for the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3), which describes health as a utility score on a scale from 0 ( dead) to 1.0 ( perfect health). The 8091 cardiac arrest patients had overall survival rates of 5.2% to hospital discharge and 4.0% to 1 year. We successfully contacted and evaluated 268 of 316 (84.8%) of known 1-year survivors. The median HUI3 score was 0.80 (interquartile range, 0.50 to 0.97), which compares well with age-adjusted values for the general population (0.83). Logistic regression identified 2 factors independently associated with very good quality of life ( HUI3 > 0.90) and their odds ratios (95% CIs), as follows: age 80 years or older, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.84), and citizen-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 2.0 (1.2 to 3.4) ( Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, 0.74).
   Conclusions - This study is the largest ever conducted for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, clearly shows that these patients have good quality of life, and is the first to demonstrate that citizen-initiated CPR is strongly and independently associated with better quality of life. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing community citizen CPR readiness. Given the low rate of citizen-initiated CPR in many communities, we believe that local and national initiatives should vigorously promote the practice of bystander CPR.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation among mechanically ventilated patients
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - To evaluate the outcomes, including long-term survival, after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in mechanically ventilated patients.
   We analyzed Medicare data from 1994 to 2005 to identify beneficiaries who underwent in-hospital CPR. We then identified a subgroup receiving CPR one or more days after mechanical ventilation was initiated [defined by ICD-9 procedure code for intubation (96.04) or mechanical ventilation (96.7x) one or more days prior to procedure code for CPR (99.60 or 99.63)].
   We identified 471,962 patients who received in-hospital CPR with an overall survival to hospital discharge of 18.4 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 18.3-18.5 %]. Of those, 42,163 received CPR one or more days after mechanical ventilation initiation. Survival to hospital discharge after CPR in ventilated patients was 10.1 % (95 % CI 9.8-10.4 %), compared to 19.2 % (95 % CI 19.1-19.3 %) in non-ventilated patients (p < 0.001). Among this group, older age, race other than white, higher burden of chronic illness, and admission from a nursing facility were associated with decreased survival in multivariable analyses. Among all CPR recipients, those who were ventilated had 52 % lower odds of survival (OR 0.48, 95 % CI 0.46-0.49, p < 0.001). Median long-term survival in ventilated patients receiving CPR who survived to hospital discharge was 6.0 months (95 % CI 5.3-6.8 months), compared to 19.0 months (95 % CI 18.6-19.5 months) among the non-ventilated survivors (p < 0.001 by logrank test). Of all patients receiving CPR while ventilated, only 4.1 % were alive at 1 year.
   Survival after in-hospital CPR is decreased among ventilated patients compared to those who are not ventilated. This information is important for clinicians, patients, and family members when discussing CPR in critically ill patients.

TI  - Inverse Association Between Bystander Use of Audiovisual Feedback From an Automated External Defibrillator and Return of Spontaneous Circulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background Treatment with an automated external defibrillator (AED) improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Audiovisual feedback from an AED may assist bystanders achieve higher quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the association between audiovisual feedback and clinical outcomes is not well assessed in real-life OHCA. The aim of this study was to assess the association between audiovisual feedback from an AED used in bystander resuscitation with rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day survival in a real-life cohort of patients with OHCA. Methods and Results We included 325 patients treated with bystander AED use before arrival of emergency medical services during 2016 to 2019 from the Capital Region of Denmark. Patients were divided into a "feedback" and a "nonfeedback" group, depending on presence of audiovisual feedback from the AED. Audiovisual feedback was defined as voice prompts with continuous feedback to ongoing resuscitation. Rates of ROSC upon hospital admission and 30-day survival were assessed, and univariate and multivariable models were applied to decide the association to audiovisual feedback. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, primary heart rhythm, and location of OHCA. A total of 155 (48%) patients had a bystander AED applied with audiovisual feedback and 170 (52%) without audiovisual feedback. A lower rate of ROSC was found in the feedback group compared with the nonfeedback group (33% [n=51] versus 45% [n=76]; P=0.03). No association was observed between AV feedback and 30-day survival (feedback=27% [n=42] and nonfeedback=31% [n=53]; P=0.49). In the unadjusted logistic regression model, audiovisual feedback was associated with a decreased chance of ROSC (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95; P=0.03), which remained significant after adjusted analysis (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.97; P=0.04), whereas we found no significant association between audiovisual feedback and 30-day survival in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Conclusions Audiovisual feedback from an AED used by bystanders was associated with a lower chance of ROSC at hospital admission, but we found no significant difference in 30-day survival. Focus on early and correct bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and AED use remain key for OHCA survival.

TI  - Outcomes Following Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Children With Cardiac Disease
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a commonly used form of mechanical circulatory support in children with congenital or acquired heart disease and cardiac failure refractory to conventional medical therapies. In children with heart disease who suffer cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been successfully used to provide cardiopulmonary support when conventional resuscitation has failed to establish return of spontaneous circulation. Survival to hospital discharge for children with heart disease support is approximately 40% but varies widely based on age, indication for support, and underlying cardiac disease. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is lifesaving in many instances, it is associated with many complications and is expensive. Thus, a clear understanding of survival to discharge and long-term functional and neurologic outcomes are essential to guide the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation now and in the future. This review, part of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society/Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Joint Statement on Mechanical Circulatory Support, summarizes current knowledge on short- and long-term outcomes for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation used to support children with cardiac disease.

TI  - Pediatric cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation: an overview and future directions
T2  - CRITICAL CARE CLINICS
AB  - During the past 40 years, the principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have remained fundamentally unchanged. Few advanced life-support interventions unequivocally improve long-term intact neurologic survival following cardiac arrest. As efforts to improve neurologic outcome following cardiac arrest continue, many promising basic science-based interventions are under investigation to convert simple CPR to cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation. This article summarizes the scientific basis for selected pediatric resuscitation interventions and highlights promising strategies to improve outcomes in the future.

TI  - Epinephrine for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis*
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating epinephrine for adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation. Data Sources: The search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine, clinical trial registries, and bibliographies. Study Selection: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers. Data Extraction: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers. Data Synthesis: A total of 17 trials (21,510 patients) were included; seven were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, pooled results from two trials showed that standard dose of epinephrine increased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.82-3.89), survival to hospital admission (risk ratio, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.68-3.72), and survival to discharge (risk ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.86). The largest placebo-controlled trial showed that standard dose of epinephrine also improved survival at 30 days and 3 months but not neurologic outcomes, standard dose of epinephrine decreased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98) and survival to admission (risk ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99) when compared with high dose epinephrine. There were no differences in outcomes between standard dose of epinephrine and vasopressin alone or in combination with epinephrine. Conclusions: Largely based on one randomized controlled trial, standard dose of epinephrine improved overall survival but not neurologic outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients compared with placebo. There is a paucity of trials with meaningful patient outcomes; future epinephrine trials should evaluate dose and method of delivery on long-term survival, neurologic function, and quality of life after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Morbidity of cardiac arrest in the very elderly
T2  - ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess mortality and morbidity after cardiac arrest in hospital inpatients aged 80 years or older, in an Australian tertiary hospital. We studied patients aged 80 years or older who suffered an in-hospital cardiac arrest from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016. The main outcome measures were one-year survival and narrative morbidity. Two hundred and eighty-five patients were identified. Absolute one-year survival after cardiac arrest was, at best, 12.6%. Narrative descriptions of morbidity demonstrate high healthcare utilisation, dependency or residential care, and significant impairments of physical and social function. In conclusion, one-year survival after cardiac arrest in the very elderly is poor. In those who survive, significant morbidity is present.

TI  - Prompt use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the MECCA study report
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - INTRODUCTION Early use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) may improve survival outcomes. Current evidence for such devices uses outcomes from an intention-to-treat (ITT) perspective. We aimed to determine whether early use of mechanical CPR using a LUCAS 2 device results in better outcomes.
   METHODS A prospective, randomised, multicentre study was conducted over one year with LUCAS 2 devices in 14 ambulances and manual CPR in 32 ambulances to manage OHCA. The primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes were survival at 24 hours, discharge from hospital and 30 days.
   RESULTS Of the 1,274 patients recruited, 1,191 were eligible for analysis. 889 had manual CPR and 302 had LUCAS CPR. From an ITT perspective, outcomes for manual and LUCAS CPR were: ROSC 29.2% and 31.1% (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.45; p = 0.537); 24-hour survival 11.2% and 13.2% (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81-1.78; p = 0.352); survival to discharge 3.6% and 4.3% (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.62-2.33; p = 0.579); and 30-day survival 3.0% and 4.0% (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66-2.64; p = 0.430), respectively. By as-treated analysis, outcomes for manual, early LUCAS and late LUCAS CPR were: ROSC 28.0%, 36.9% and 24.5%; 24-hour survival 10.6%, 15.5% and 8.2%; survival to discharge 2.9%, 5.8% and 2.0%; and 30-day survival 2.4%, 5.8% and 0.0%, respectively. Adjusted OR for survival with early LUCAS vs. manual CPR was 1.47 after adjustment for other variables (p = 0.026).
   CONCLUSION This study showed a survival benefit with LUCAS CPR as compared to manual CPR only, when the device was applied early on-site.

TI  - Cost effectiveness and quality of life analysis of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for refractory cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory cardiac arrest (ECPR) has increased exponentially. ECPR is a resource intensive service and its cost effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. We sought to complete a cost analysis with modelling of cost effectiveness and quality of life outcomes. We sought to complete a cost analysis with modelling of cost effectiveness and quality of life outcomes of patients who have undergone ECPR.
   Methods: Using data on all extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) patients at two ECMO centres in Sydney, Australia; we completed a costing analysis of ECPR patients. A Markov model of cost, quality of life and survival outcomes was developed to examine cost per QALY estimates and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was completed to assess the probability of cost effectiveness for base case and variations.
   Results: Sixty-two consecutive ECPR patients were analysed; mean age of 51.9 +/- 13.6 years, 38 (61%) were in hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). Twenty-five patients (40%) survived to hospital discharge; all with a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2. The mean cost per ECPR patient was AUD 75,165 ((sic)50,535; +/- AUD 75,737). Over 10 years ECPR was estimated to add a mean gain of 3.0 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) per patient with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD 25,212 ((sic)16,890) per QALY, increasing to 4.0 QALYs and an ICER of AUD 18,829 ((sic)12,614) over a 15-year survival scenario. Mean cost per QALY did not differ significantly by OHCA or IHCA.
   Conclusions: ECMO support for refractory cardiac arrests is cost effective and compares favourably to accepted cost effectiveness thresholds.

TI  - Prospective study of nesidioblastosis in newborns and infants: Hypoglycemic seizures, epileptogenesis and the significance of the C-peptide suppression test in pancreatectomy
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA JAPONICA
AB  - The long-term follow-up of chronic hyperinsulinemic seizures, epileptogenesis and other neurological complications in five patients who were treated with conservative therapy followed by pancreatectomy during the neonatal period and infancy, who were confirmed to have diffuse nesidioblastosis are described. The reaction pattern of the C-peptide (CPR) suppression test and its relation to the final extent of pancreatectomy was examined in four patients. The chronological change in electro-encephalography (EEG) and its epileptogenesis was also examined in each patient during hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, and during normoglycemia in a long-term post-pancreatectomy follow-up. All patients demonstrated several types of hypoglycemic seizures, ranging from apnea, erratic seizures, partial seizures evolving to generalized/unilateral tonic-clonic or tonic seizures, myoclonic seizures and EEG abnormalities. Four of five patients still suffered from epilepsy at the age of 4-22 years. The reaction pattern of the CPR suppression test showed dichotomy, with a hyper-reactive pattern in two patients who required total pancreatectomy to control hypoglycemia, and a suppression pattern in two other patients treated with 90-95% pancreatectomy.
   Neonatal onset and subsequent myoclonic seizures were ominous signs of epileptogenesis to various types of intractable epilepsy and other neurological sequelae. A prompt diagnosis and pancreatectomy of a sufficient extent at the first operation are essential. The CPR suppression test may be useful for a prompt diagnosis and selection of the extent of pancreatectomy.

TI  - Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Cardiogenic Shock and Cardiac Arrest: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on survival and complication rates in adults with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
   Design: Meta-analysis.
   Setting: University hospitals.
   Participants: One thousand one hundred ninety-nine patients from 22 observational studies.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Observational studies published from the year 2000 onwards, examining at least 10 adult patients who received ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest were included. Pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated based on the Freeman-Tukey double-arcsine transformation and DerSimonian-Laird random-effect model. Survival to discharge was 40.2% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 33.9-46.7), while survival at 3, 6, and 12 months was 55.9% (95% CI, 41.5-69.8), 47.6% (95% CI, 25.4-70.2), and 54.4% (95% CI, 36.6-71.7), respectively. Survival up to 30 days was higher in cardiogenic shock patients (52.5%, 95% CI, 43.7%-61.2%) compared to cardiac arrest (36.2%, 95% CI, 23.1%-50.4%). Concurrently, complication rates were particularly substantial for neurologic deficits (13.3%, 95% CI, 8.3-19.3), infection (25.1%, 95% CI, 15.9-35.5), and renal impairment (47.4%, 95% CI, 30.2-64.9). Significant heterogeneity was detected, although its levels were similar to previous meta-analyses that only examined short-term survival to discharge.
   Conclusions: Venoarterial ECMO can improve short-term survival in adults with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. It also may provide favorable long-term survival at up to 3 years postdischarge. However, ECMO also is associated with significant complication rates, which must be incorporated into the risk-benefit analysis when considering treatment. These findings require confirmation by large, adequately controlled and standardized trials with long-term follow-up. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characteristics, Outcomes and Mortality Risk Factors of Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Western China: A Retrospective Study Using Utstein Style
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - Background: Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains a critical health challenge with high mortality rates. Limited data from Western China prompted this study to investigate the characteristics of IHCA using the Utstein style. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 456 pediatric patients with IHCA (2018-2022) at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University assessed demographics, arrest characteristics, outcomes and mortality risk factors. The primary outcome was survival to discharge; the secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) > 20 min, 24 h survival, and favorable neurological outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify the mortality risk factors. Results: ROSC > 20 min was achieved in 78.07% of cases, with 37.94% surviving to discharge (86.13% of survivors had favorable neurological outcomes). Etiological stratification identified general medical conditions (52.63%) as the predominant diagnoses, with surgical cardiac patients demonstrating superior resuscitation outcomes (ROSC > 20 min: 86.84%, discharge survival: 64.04%). Initial arrest rhythms predominantly featured non-shockable patterns, specifically bradycardia with poor perfusion (79.39%), whereas shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia) constituted only 4.17% of cases. Multivariable regression analysis identified five independent risk factors: vasoactive infusion before arrest (OR = 7.69), CPR > 35 min (OR = 13.92), emergency intubation (OR = 5.17), administration of >2 epinephrine doses (OR = 3.12), and rearrest (OR = 8.48). Notably, prolonged CPR (>35 min) correlated with higher mortality (8.96% survival vs. 48.54% for 1-15 min), yet all six survivors with CPR > 35 min had favorable neurological outcomes. Conclusions: These findings underscore the persistent challenges in pediatric IHCA management while challenging the conventional CPR duration thresholds for futility. The identified mortality risk factors inform resuscitation decision making and future studies.

TI  - Outcome, quality of life and direct costs after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in an urban region of Switzerland
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundConsidering the significant morbidity and mortality of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, only little data on survival or quality of life after successful resuscitation is available in Europe. Additionally, economic aspects of such events are poorly studied. The purpose of this study is to provide data for survival, quality of life and costs directly related to the cardiac arrest for a region of Switzerland served by one emergency medical service (EMS).MethodsEighty eight patients older than 18years of age that were resuscitated by the EMS Winterthur in the year 2013 were included and retrospective analysis of EMS-protocols was performed. For patients alive at follow-up, 2years after the event, a structured interview with quality of life questionnaires was conducted. This study was accepted by the local Ethics Committee.ResultsThirty five percent (n=31) of resuscitated patients were admitted alive to the hospital following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This incidence was as high as 60%, if the patients had a shockable rhythm as first rhythm. Survival to follow-up was 16% (n=14). These patients had an excellent quality of life overall, with little to no limitations in daily life. There was no significant difference in survival for patients in outlying regions with comparatively longer timespans until arrival of EMS. Median EMS-costs for deceased patients were CHF 1731 (inter-quartile range 346), for survivors CHF 2169 (inter-quartile range CHF 444) and median hospital-costs were CHF 27707 (inter-quartile range CHF 62 ' 783). ConclusionQuality of care for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the region of Winterthur is high, including patients in outlying regions. The associated costs are similar to other European countries.Trial registration This trial was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov under NCT02625883.

TI  - Prognosis of cardiac arrest in home care clients and nursing home residents: A population-level retrospective cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the prognosis of 30-day survival post-cardiac arrest among patients receiving home care and nursing home residents.Methods: We conducted a population-level retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults (>= 18 years) who received cardiac arrest care at a hospital in Ontario, Canada, between 2006 to 2018. We linked population-based health datasets using the Home Care Dataset to identify patients receiving home care and the Continuing Care Reporting System to identify nursing home residents. We included both out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrests. We determined unadjusted and adjusted associations using logistic regression after adjusting for age and sex. We converted relative measures to absolute risks.Results: Our cohort contained 86,836 individuals. Most arrests (55.5 %) occurred out-of-hospital, with 9,316 patients enrolled in home care and 2,394 residing in a nursing home. When compared to those receiving no support services, the likelihood of survival to 30-days was lower for those receiving home care (RD =-6.5; 95 %CI =-7.5 --5.0), with similar results found within sub-groups of out-of-hospital (RD =-6.7; 95 %CI =-7.6 --5.7) and in-hospital arrests (RD =-8.7; 95 %CI =-10.6 --7.3). The likelihood of 30-day survival was lower for nursing home residents (RD =-7.2; 95 %CI =-9.3 --5.3)with similar results found within sub-groups of out-of-hospital (RD =-8.6; 95 %CI =-10.6 --5.7) and in -hospital arrests (RD =-5.0; 95 %CI =-7.8 --2.1).Conclusion: Patients receiving home care and nursing home residents had worse overall prognoses of survival post-cardiac arrest compared to those receiving no pre-arrest support, highlighting two medically-complex groups likely to benefit from advance care planning.

TI  - Experimental paper Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 exerts neuroprotection effects after cardiac arrest in mice: A randomized controlled study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background : Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is the leading cause of death in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA). Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM-3) is a water -soluble exogenous carbon monoxide that has been shown to have neuroprotection benefits in several neurological disease models. However, the effects of CORM-3 on PCABI is still unclear. Methods : A mice model combined asystole with hemorrhage was used. Mice were anesthetized and randomized into 4 groups (n = 12/group) and underwent either 9.5 min CA followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or sham surgery. CORM-3 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (normal saline) were administered at 1 h after return of spontaneous circulation or sham surgery. Survival, neurologic deficits, alterations in the permeability of the brainblood barrier and cerebral blood flow, changes of oxidative stress level, level of neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration, and the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway were measured. Results : In CORM-3 treated mice that underwent CA/CPR, significantly improved survival (75.00% vs. 58.33%, P = 0.0146 (24 h) and 66.67% vs. 16.67%, P < 0.0001 (72 h)) and neurological function were observed at 24 h and 72 h after ROSC ( P < 0.05 for each). Additionally, increased cerebral blood flow, expression of tight junctions, and reduced reactive oxygen species generation at 24 h after ROSC were observed ( P < 0.05 for each). CORM-3 treated mice had less neuron death and alleviated neuroinflammation at 72 h after ROSC ( P < 0.05 for each). Notably, the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was significantly activated in mice subjected to CA/CPR with CORM-3 treatment. Conclusions : CORM-3 could improve survival and exert neuroprotection after CA/CPR in mice. CORM-3 may be a novel and promising pharmacological therapy for PCABI.

TI  - Prediction of neurological outcomes following the return of spontaneous circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Retrospective fast-and-frugal tree analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Although various quantitative methods have been developed for predicting neurological prognosis in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), they are too complex for use in clinical practice. We aimed to develop a simple decision rule for predicting neurological outcomes following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with OHCA using fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) analysis.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data archived in a multi-centre registry. Good neurological outcomes were defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) values of 1 or 2 at 28 day. Variables used for FFT analysis included age, sex, witnessed cardiac arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initial shockable rhythm, prehospital defibrillation, prehospital ROSC, no flow time, low flow time, cause of arrest (cardiac or non-cardiac), pupillary light reflex, and Glasgow Coma Scale score after ROSC.
   Results: Among the 456 patients enrolled, 86 (18.9%) experienced good neurological outcomes. Prehospital ROSC (true = good), prompt or sluggish light reflex response after ROSC (true = good), and presumed cardiac cause (true = good, false = poor) were selected as nodes for the decision tree. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the decision tree for predicting good neurological outcomes were 100% (42/42), 64.0% (119/186), 38.5% (42/109), and 100% (119/119) in the training set and 95.5% (42/44), 57.6% (106/184), 35.0% (42/120), and 98.1% (106/108) in the test set, respectively.
   Conclusion: A simple decision rule developed via FFT analysis can aid clinicians in predicting neurological outcomes following ROSC in patients with OHCA.

TI  - Survival After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Relation to Age and Early Identification of Patients With Minimal Chance of Long-Term Survival
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has increased during the last decade in Denmark. We aimed to study the impact of age on changes in survival and whether it was possible to identify patients with minimal chance of 30-day survival.
   Methods and Results-Using data from the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry (2001 -2011), we identified 21 480 patients >= 18 years old with a presumed cardiac-caused out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for which resuscitation was attempted. Patients were divided into 3 preselected age-groups: working-age patients 18 to 65 years of age (33.7%), early senior patients 66 to 80 years of age (41.5%), and late senior patients >80 years of age (24.8%). Characteristics in working-age patients, early senior patients, and late senior patients were as follows: witnessed arrest in 53.8%, 51.1%, and 52.1%; bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 44.7%, 30.3%, and 23.4%; and prehospital shock from a defibrillator in 54.7%, 45.0%, and 33.8% (all P<0.05). Between 2001 and 2011, return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival increased: working-age patients, from 12.1% to 34.6%; early senior patients, from 6.4% to 21.5%; and late senior patients, from 4.0% to 15.0% (all P<0.001). Furthermore, 30-day survival increased: working-age patients, 5.8% to 22.0% (P<0.001); and early senior patients, 2.7% to 8.4% (P<0.001), whereas late senior patients experienced only a minor increase (1.5% to 2.0%; P=0.01). Overall, 3 of 9499 patients achieved 30-day survival if they met 2 criteria: had not achieved return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival and had not received a prehospital shock from a defibrillator.
   Conclusions-All age groups experienced a large temporal increase in survival on hospital arrival, but the increase in 30-day survival was most prominent in the young. With the use of only 2 criteria, it was possible to identify patients with a minimal chance of 30-day survival.

TI  - Therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation in modulating immune responses post-cardiac arrest: a narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundMitochondrial transplantation (MTx) has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy, particularly effective in diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. This review synthesizes current knowledge on MTx, focusing on its role in modulating immune responses and explores its potential in treating post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS).MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive narrative review of animal and human studies that have investigated the effects of MTx in the context of immunomodulation. This included a review of the immune responses following critical condition such as ischemia reperfusion injury, the impact of MTx on these responses, and the therapeutic potential of MTx in various conditions.ResultsRecent studies indicate that MTx can modulate complex immune responses and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury post-CA, suggesting MTx as a novel, potentially more effective approach. The review highlights the role of MTx in immune modulation, its potential synergistic effects with existing treatments such as therapeutic hypothermia, and the need for further research to optimize its application in PCAS. The safety and efficacy of autologous versus allogeneic MTx, particularly in the context of immune reactions, are critical areas for future investigation.ConclusionMTx represents a promising frontier in the treatment of PCAS, offering a novel approach to modulate immune responses and restore cellular energetics. Future research should focus on long-term effects, combination therapies, and personalized medicine approaches to fully harness the potential of MTx in improving patient outcomes in PCAS.

TI  - Magnetically targeted drug delivery during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the post-resuscitation period
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Treatment with pharmacological agents is frequently required during cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts and almost always during the post-resuscitation period. However, the lack of scientific evidence, the potent side effects and the association of resuscitation drugs with poor outcome act as a disincentive for their use. The use of magnetic nanoparticles in medicine has great potential. Magnetically targeted drug delivery may be an ideal method of pharmaceutical treatment during the resuscitation efforts and post-resuscitation period. In addition, there is evidence that magnetic nanotechnology may be used in the detection of post-cardiac arrest brain injury. In the light of poor survival of cardiac arrest victims, research in cardiopulmonary resuscitation should focus on this promising technology as soon as possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Calcium during cardiac arrest: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To perform a systematic review of administration of calcium compared to no calcium during cardiac arrest.Methods: The search included Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus and was conducted on September 30, 2022. The population included adults and children in any setting with cardiac arrest. The outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation, sur-vival, survival with favourable neurologic outcome to hospital discharge and 30 days or longer, and quality of life outcome. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and ROBINS-I were performed to assess risk of bias for controlled and observational studies, respectively.Results: The systematic review identified 4 studies on 3 randomised controlled trials on 554 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, 8 observational studies on 2,731 adult cardiac arrest patients, and 3 observational studies on 17,449 paediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) patients. The randomised controlled and observational studies showed that routine calcium administration during cardiac arrest did not improve the outcome of adult OHCA or IHCA or paediatric IHCA. The risk of bias for the adult trials was low for one recent trial and high for two earlier trials, with randomization as the primary source of bias. The risk of bias for the individual observational studies was assessed to be critical due to con-founding. The certainty of evidence was assessed to be moderate for adult OHCA and low for adult and paediatric IHCA. Heterogeneity across stud-ies precluded any meaningful meta-analyses. Conclusions: This systematic review found no evidence that routine calcium administration improves the outcomes of cardiac arrest in adults or children.

TI  - Life after survival: long-term daily life functioning and quality of life of patients with hypoxic brain injury as a result of a cardiac arrest
T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
AB  - Objectives: To determine the level of daily functioning and quality of life of patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest and to investigate the predictive value of the duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia in long-term functioning.
   Design: A retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: A Dutch rehabilitation centre.
   Subjects: Thirty-two patients with hypoxic brain injury caused by a cardiac arrest 2-7 years ago, who were admitted to a brain injury rehabilitation programme.
   Main outcome measures: Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Quality of Life after Brain Injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI). Data on duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia were retrieved from medical files.
   Results: A significant association was found between duration of coma, complaints of cognitive functioning (r=0.57, P < 0.05) and quality of life after brain injury (r=-0.70, P < 0.01). Duration of post-traumatic amnesia was associated with both daily functioning (r=-0.70, P < 0.01) and quality of life (r=-0.70, P < 0.01). Furthermore complaints of cognitive functioning were associated with both the level of participation in society (r=0.76, P < 0.01) and quality of life (r=0.77,P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Long-term outcome of patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest shows that this group is limited in cognitive and daily functioning, participation and quality of life. Based on the duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia, an estimation of daily life functioning and quality of life 2-7 years after a cardiac arrest can be made.

TI  - Effect of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta in nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue worldwide and is associated with low survival rates and poor neurological outcomes. The generation of optimal coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) via high-quality chest compressions is a key factor in enhancing survival rates. However, it is often challenging to provide adequate CPP in real-world cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) scenarios. Based on animal studies and human trials on improving CPP in patients with nontraumatic OHCA, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is a promising technique in these cases. This study aims to investigate the benefits of REBOA adjunct to CPR compared with conventional CPR for the clinical management of nontraumatic OHCA.MethodsThis is a parallel-group, randomized, controlled, multinational trial that will be conducted at two urban academic tertiary hospitals in Korea and Taiwan. Patients aged 20-80 years presenting with witnessed OHCA will be enrolled in this study. Eligible participants must fulfill the inclusion criteria, and written informed consent should be collected from their legal representatives. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention (REBOA-CPR) or control (conventional CPR) group. The intervention group will receive REBOA and standard advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS). Meanwhile, the control group will receive ACLS based on the 2020 American Heart Association guidelines. The primary outcome is the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The secondary outcomes include sustained ROSC, survival to admission, survival to discharge, neurological outcome, and hemodynamic changes.DiscussionOur upcoming trial can provide essential evidence regarding the efficacy of REBOA, a mechanical method for enhancing CPP, in OHCA resuscitation. Our study aims to determine whether REBOA can improve treatment strategies for patients with nontraumatic OHCA based on clinical outcomes, thereby potentially providing valuable insights and guiding further advancements in this critical public health area.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT06031623.

TI  - Associations between comorbidity and health- related quality of life among in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors-A cross-sectional nationwide registry study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to explore associations between comorbidities and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors.Methods: This registry study is based on data from the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (SRCR) collected during 2014-2017. HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure.Results: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1 -q3) = 70 (50-80). Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 4-8% of the total vari-ance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Since IHCA survivors with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous stroke.

TI  - Methods and preliminary results for a data linkage project to determine long-term survival after intensive care unit admission
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To describe a local data linkage project to match hospital data with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Death Index (NDI) to assess long-term outcomes of intensive care unit patients.
   Methods: Data were obtained from hospital intensive care and cardiac surgery databases on all patients aged 18 years and over admitted to either of two intensive care units at a tertiary-referral hospital between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2005. Date of death was obtained from the AIHW NDI by probabilistic software matching, in addition to manual checking through hospital databases and other sources. Survival was calculated from time of ICU admission, with a censoring date of 14 February 2007. Data for patients with multiple hospital admissions requiring intensive care were analysed only from the first admission. Summary and descriptive statistics were used for preliminary data analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to analyse factors determining long-term survival.
   Results: During the study period, 21 415 unique patients had 22 552 hospital admissions that included an ICU admission; 19 058 surgical procedures were performed with a total of 20 092 ICU admissions. There were 4936 deaths. Median follow-up was 6.2 years, totalling 134 203 patient years. The casemix was predominantly cardiac surgery (80%), followed by cardiac medical (6%), and other medical (4%). The unadjusted survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 97%, 84% and 70%, respectively. The 1-year survival ranged from 97% for cardiac surgery to 36% for cardiac arrest. An APACHE II score was available for 16 877 patients. In those discharged alive from hospital, the 1, 5 and 10-year survival varied with discharge location.
   Conclusions: ICU-based linkage projects are feasible to determine long-term outcomes of ICU patients.

TI  - RELEVANCE OF COGNITION TO HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN GOOD-OUTCOME SURVIVORS OF OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: For survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with good outcomes, it is not known whether and how health-related quality of life is affected by the cognitive impairments frequently observed in these patients. This study explores how neuropsychological tests of memory, executive and psychomotor functioning relate to the physical and mental aspects of health-related quality of life in functionally independent and community dwelling OHCA survivors discharged early from hospital.
   Methods: The study included 42 adult survivors (mean age 62 years, 38 males). Health-related quality of life was measured approximately 3 months post-OHCA with the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). Cognition was measured with established neuropsychological tests. Regression analyses were used to examine associations between neuropsychological domains and physical and mental health-related quality of life, respectively, when controlling for age, education and length of coma.
   Results: The physical, but not the mental, component of the SF-36 was significantly worse than Norwegian population data. Neuropsychological tests showed frequent impairments most often in the memory domain. Worse psychomotor functioning was associated with worse physical health-related quality of life, whereas worse memory performance was associated with worse mental health-related quality of life.
   Conclusion: The cognitive impairments frequently reported in OHCA survivors with good outcomes may compromise health-related quality of life. Cognitive functioning should be addressed even in survivors with rapid recovery.

TI  - Cognitive Deficits after Cerebral Ischemia and Underlying Dysfunctional Plasticity: Potential Targets for Recovery of Cognition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Cerebral ischemia affects millions of people worldwide and survivors suffer from long-term functional and cognitive deficits. While stroke and cardiac arrest are typically considered when discussing ischemic brain injuries, there is much evidence that smaller ischemic insults underlie neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The "regenerative" capacity of the brain relies on several aspects of plasticity that are crucial for normal functioning; less affected brain areas may take over function previously performed by irreversibly damaged tissue. To harness the endogenous plasticity mechanisms of the brain to provide recovery of cognitive function, we must first understand how these mechanisms are altered after damage, such as cerebral ischemia. In this review, we discuss the long-term cognitive changes that result after cerebral ischemia and how ischemia alters several plasticity processes. We conclude with a discussion of how current and prospective therapies may restore brain plasticity and allow for recovery of cognitive function, which may be applicable to several disorders that have a disruption of cognitive processing, including traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Psychological wellbeing in survivors of cardiac arrest, and its relationship to neurocognitive function
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To characterise psychological wellbeing in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and examine its relationship to cognitive function.
   Patients: Forty-one highly functioning cardiac arrest survivors were drawn from the follow-up cohort of a randomised controlled trial of initial airway management in OHCA (ISRCTN: 18528625).
   Design: Psychological wellbeing was assessed with a self-report questionnaire (the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; DASS) and cognitive function was examined using the Delayed Matching to Samples (DMS) test from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).
   Results: Mean anxiety levels were significantly higher in this patient group than normative data drawn from the general population (p = 0.046). Multiple regression analyses showed that cognitive function, measured by the DMS, did not predict any of the DASS scales.
   Conclusions: Anxiety plays an important role in determining perceived QoL in high functioning survivors, but psychological wellbeing is unrelated to cognitive function in this group. To achieve a comprehensive assessment of wellbeing, resuscitation research should consider outcomes beyond neurological function alone. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Early ADL ability assessment and cognitive screening as markers of post-discharge outcomes after surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A prospective cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background Assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive screening are widely used in the care of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Evidence linking them to post-discharge outcomes is limited, but could support targeted rehabilitation efforts. Aim To assess whether ADL ability measures and cognitive screening at hospital discharge were associated with post-discharge ADL ability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and return to work. Methods This prospective cohort study included 200 OHCA survivors admitted to Aarhus University Hospital. Self-reported ADL ability was measured using the Activities of Daily Living Interview (ADL-I). Observed ADL ability was measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), dichotomised into age-matched or below-ability. Cognitive function was assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariable regressions, with multiple imputation, analysed associations between variables and outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Adjusted analyses showed significant associations between personal ADL-I ((3adjusted = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2;0.5) and AMPS ((3adjusted = 0.6, 95%CI:-1.2;-0.03) at discharge and self-reported ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest. Baseline AMPS was statistically significantly associated with age-matched ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest (ORadjusted 5.5, 95%CI: 1.5;10.0), and personal ADL-I (VAS: (3adjusted = 3.00, 95%CI: 1.3;4.6/index score: (3adjusted = 0.03, 95%CI 0.01;0.05) and MoCA (index: (3adjusted = 0.09, 95%CI: 0.2;-0.02) with HRQoL. The association between MoCA and return to work one-year after cardiac arrest showed an OR of 3.0 (95%CI: 0.5;9.0), although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions Decreased ADL ability at hospital discharge was associated with poorer post-discharge outcomes in OHCA survivors, while cognitive screening was also associated with certain aspects of recovery.

TI  - Translating Guidelines into Practice: A Multicentre Audit of the Implementation of ERC Survivorship and Follow-Up Recommendations After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest frequently experience long-lasting problems with fatigue, cognition and mood. European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines recommend functional assessment of physical/non-physical issues prior to discharge, and systematic review within three months covering at least cognition, mood, fatigue, and support for patients and their families. How these recommendations are implemented and what barriers are encountered in routine care remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a multicentric, prospective 6-month audit across four tertiary cardiac-arrest centres in England where temporarily funded follow-up pathways were in place. Five operational criteria were developed based on ERC guidelines. Adherence was quantified, and reasons for non-completion were collected and mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify behavioural and contextual factors influencing implementation. Results: A total of 143 OHCA survivors were discharged alive. Pre-discharge assessments were offered to 116/143 patients (81%) but only completed in 81 (57%). Reasons for non-completion included early discharge, severe cognitive impairment and, less frequently, patient refusal. Of 132 survivors eligible for follow-up, 108 (82%) were contacted and 87 (66%) attended. Only 25% of follow-ups occurred within the recommended 3-month period (median 185 days, IQR 81-225). Among those seen, assessments were completed for cognition (44%), mood (52%), and fatigue (51%). Reasons for omission included patient refusal, clinical discretion, and time constraints. Survivors' family members were invited in all cases, but only 45% attended. Conclusions: Adherence to guideline-recommended assessments was variable and dependent on local practices, resource limitations, and patient/clinician-related factors. Key barriers mapped to the TDF domains of 'Environmental context and resources', 'Beliefs about consequences' and 'Social influences'. Structural policies excluding out-of-area and non-ICU patients, together with clinician judgement and patient engagement, were major determinants of implementation. These findings can guide targeted service development and support sustainable post-resuscitation care pathways.

TI  - Effects of a single-dose hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch on cerebral blood flow, long-term outcome, neurogenesis, and neuronal survival after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rats
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: The beneficial effects of hypertonic saline on neuronal survival and on cerebral blood flow have been shown in several animal models of global and focal brain ischemia. Because of the potential benefits of hypertonic solutions, it is hypothesized that hydroxyethyl starch enhances cerebral blood flow and improves long-term outcome after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an animal model.
   Design: Laboratory animal study.
   Setting: University animal research laboratory.
   Subjects: Fifty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Interventions: Rats were randomized to receive either 7.2% saline/6% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch (4 mLkg) or vehicle (NaCl 0.9 %) after 9 mins of asphyxic cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Local cerebral blood flow and physiologic parameters were evaluated during arrest and early restoration of spontaneous circulation. Survival and neurologic assessment were evaluated over a 7-day observation period. Animals received 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine for 6 days. Neuronal injury and neurogeneration (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine positive neurons) were quantified on day 7 after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Measurements and Main Results: Hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch treatment resulted in an accentuated local cerebral blood flow during early reperfusion, compared to the vehicle group. Animal survival and neurologic outcome were not altered between groups. Neurohistopathological injury was present in hippocampal CA1 and neocortex with no effects of hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch on neuronal survival. Increased neurogeneration was found in the dentate gyrus after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which was not influenced by hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch administration.
   Conclusions: Despite promising results in other models of brain injury, hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch failed to improve the outcome when administered after asphyxic cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rats. One major difference between the cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation model and other models of brain ischemia is that the effects of asphyxic cardiac arrest involve the whole organism (post-cardiac arrest syndrome) and not exclusively the brain leading to a more severe injury. This might explain why hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch has failed to improve outcome in the present model. (Crit Care Med 2012;40:2149-2156)

TI  - Psychological Distress After Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Its Impact on Recovery
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review To summarize the prevalence, correlates, and health consequences of poor mental health in the increasingly sizable population of survivors of Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) and to describe current intervention research in this area.
   Recent Findings After CA many patients report high psychological distress, including depression, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. Emerging evidence suggests that distressed patients' attention may narrow such that anxious awareness of afferent cardiac signals e.g., changes in heart rate or blood pressure, becomes predominant and a cause for concerned, constant monitoring. This cardiac-specific anxiety followed by behavioral avoidance and physiological hyperreactivity may increase patients' already high risk of secondary cardiovascular disease and undermine their health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
   Summary Unlike other cardiovascular diseases, no clinical practice guidelines exist for assessing or treating psychological sequelae of CA. Future research should identify modifiable psychological targets to reduce secondary cardiovascular disease risk and improve HRQoL.

TI  - Survival in cancer patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
AB  - The survival of cancer patients who undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after in-hospital cardiac arrest is poor. The survival of cancer patients who undergo CPR after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is unknown. We sought to determine survival rates in such patients and to identify phrases in patient charts that might have prompted end-of-life discussions.
   We performed a retrospective review of patients who had CPR in our Emergency Center after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2000-2002, including an in-depth chart review of outpatient clinic visits by these patients in the 3 months preceding cardiac arrest.
   Of the 41 patients who had CPR in the Emergency Center, 18 (43%) had return of spontaneous circulation and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Seven patients were subsequently discharged alive to another facility. Only two (4.9%) of the 41 patients in our series were discharged alive to their home. More than half of the study patients had at least one clinic note that mentioned "disease progression" (n = 23), 44% mentioned "poor prognosis" (n = 18), and 27% mentioned "poor response" (n = 11).
   Survival of cancer patients who underwent CPR after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was poor. Medical providers should consider discussing end-of-life issues, including out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate orders, in the outpatient clinic setting with cancer patients nearing the end of life.

TI  - Outcomes of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest in the emergency department of a tertiary referral hospital in Tanzania: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure performed to restore heart function to minimize anoxic injury to the brain following cardiac arrest.Despite the establishment of emergency department and training on Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) the outcomes of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest have not been documented. We ought to determine the outcomes and factors associated with 24-h survival after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests at MNH in Tanzania.BackgroundCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure performed to restore heart function to minimize anoxic injury to the brain following cardiac arrest.Despite the establishment of emergency department and training on Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) the outcomes of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest have not been documented. We ought to determine the outcomes and factors associated with 24-h survival after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests at MNH in Tanzania.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of all patients aged 1 month to 18 years who had in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) prompting CPR in the Emergency Medicine Department (EMD) at MNH, Tanzania from January 2016 to December 2019. Data was collected from electronic medical record (Wellsoft) system using a standardized and pretested data collection form that recorded clinical baseline, pre-arrest, arrest, and post-arrest parameters. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of each factor on 24-h survival.ResultsA total of 11,951 critically ill patients were screened, and 257 (2.1%) had cardiac arrest at EMD. Among 136 patients enrolled, the median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range: 0.5-3 years) years, and the majority 108 (79.4%) aged <= 5 years, and 101 (74.3%) had been referred from peripheral hospitals. Overall stained return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 70 (51.5%) patients, 24-h survival was attained in 43 (31.3%) of patients, and only 7 patients (5.2%) survived to hospital discharge. Factors independently associated with 24-h survival were CPR event during the day/evening (p = 0.033), duration of CPR <= 20 min (p = 0.000), reversible causes of cardiac arrest being identified (p = 0.001), and having assisted/mechanical ventilation after CPR (p = 0.002).ConclusionIn our cohort of children with cardiac arrest, survival to hospital discharge was only 5%. Factors associated with 24-h survival were CPR events during the daytime, short duration of CPR, recognition of reversible causes of cardiac arrest, and receiving mechanical ventilation. Future studies should explore the detection of decompensation, the quality of CPR, and post-cardiac arrest care on the outcomes of IHCA.

TI  - Caregiver burden and health-related quality of life amongst caregivers of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To describe burden and health-related quality of life amongst caregivers of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors and explore the potential association with cognitive function of the survivors. Caregivers of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were used as controls.
   Methods: Data were collected from the cognitive substudy of the Targeted Temperature Management-trial. Caregiver burden was assessed with the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview, with scores <20 considered as no burden. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF-36v2 (R), with T scores 47-53 representing the norm. Cardiac arrest survivors were categorized based on the results from cognitive assessments as having "no cognitive impairment" or "cognitive impairment".
   Results: Follow-up 6 months post event was performed for caregivers of 272 cardiac arrest survivors and 108 matched myocardial infarction controls, included at an intended ratio of 2:1. In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and controls reported similar caregiver burden. The overall scores for quality of life were within normative levels and similar for caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and control patients. Compared to those with no cognitive impairment, caregivers of cognitively impaired cardiac arrest survivors (n = 126) reported higher levels of burden (median 18 versus 8, p < 0.001) and worse quality of life in five of eight domains, particularly "Role-Emotional" (mean 45.7 versus 49.5, p = 0.002).
   Conclusions: In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and myocardial infarction controls reported similar levels of burden and quality of life. Cognitive outcome and functional dependency of the cardiac arrest survivor impact burden and quality of life of the caregiver.

TI  - Long-Term Neuropsychiatric, Neurocognitive, and Functional Outcomes of Patients Receiving ECMO
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and ObjectivesDespite the common occurrence of neurologic complications during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, data on long-term neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive, and functional outcomes are sparse. We aimed to determine the prevalence of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms, neurocognitive and functional impairment, and favorable neurologic outcomes in adult patients who receive ECMO.MethodsPubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for text related to ECMO and neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive, and functional outcomes from inception to May 3, 2023. Our primary outcome was the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (pain/discomfort, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and sleep disturbance) at long-term (>= 6 months) follow-up. Our secondary outcomes were the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment (memory, attention, and reasoning), functional impairment (daily activities, physical activity/mobility, and personal/self-care), and favorable neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category <= 2, modified Rankin scale <= 3, or Glasgow Outcome Scale >= 4). This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420565).ResultsWe included 59 studies with 3,280 patients (median age 54 years, 69% male). The cohort consisted of 86% venoarterial (VA)-ECMO (n = 2,819) and 14% venovenous (VV)-ECMO (n = 461) patients. More than 10 tools were used to assess neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive outcomes, indicating a lack of standardization in assessment methodologies. The overall prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was 41% (95% CI 33%-49%): pain/discomfort (52%, 95% CI 42%-63%), sleep disturbance (37%, 95% CI 0%-98%), anxiety (36%, 95% CI 27%-46%), depression (31%, 95% CI 22%-40%), and PTSD (18%, 95% CI 9%-29%). The prevalence of neurocognitive impairment was 38% (95% CI 13%-65%). The prevalence of functional impairment was 52% (95% CI 40%-64%): daily activities (54%, 95% CI 41%-66%), mobility (41%, 95% CI 28%-54%), and self-care (21%, 95% CI 13%-31%). The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in VV-ECMO patients was higher than that in VA-ECMO patients (55% [95% CI 34%-75%] vs 32% [95% CI 23%-41%], p = 0.01), though the prevalence of neurocognitive and functional impairment was not different between the groups. The prevalence of favorable neurologic outcomes was not different at various follow-ups: 3 months (23%, 95% CI 12%-36%), 6 months (25%, 95% CI 16%-35%), and >= 1 year (28%, 95% CI 21%-36%, p = 0.68).DiscussionA substantial proportion of ECMO patients seemed to experience neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive and functional impairments at long-term follow-up. Considerable heterogeneity in methodology for gauging these outcomes exists, warranting the need for standardization. Multicenter prospective observational studies are indicated to further investigate risk factors for these outcomes in ECMO-supported patients.

TI  - Ghrelin for neuroprotection in post-cardiac arrest coma: a 1-year follow-up of cognitive and psychosocial outcomes
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims: Effective treatments to improve brain recovery after cardiac arrest are needed. Ghrelin showed efficacy in experimental models and was associated with lower neuron-specific enolase levels in the clinical Ghrelin in Coma (GRECO) trial. Here, we present cognitive and psychosocial outcomes at 1-year follow-up. Methods and results: GRECO was a Phase 2 multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. The intervention was intravenous acyl-ghrelin 600 mu g twice daily or placebo for 1 week, starting within 12 h after the arrest. Patients were assessed after 1 year using cognitive tests and questionnaires measuring participation, health-related quality of life, mood, and caregiver strain. Composite z-scores of the cognitive tests were computed by comparing the scores with those of a norm population and averaging the tests for memory, attention, and executive functioning separately. Groups were compared based on composite z-scores and cut-off scores for psychosocial outcomes. Of the 160 participants originally included, 66 of the 85 participants who survived to 1 year after OHCA completed the psychosocial and cognitive follow-up. The intervention group scored numerically higher across the cognitive domains compared with the control group, but the differences were not statistically significant (memory median = -0.850 vs. -1.385, U = 424.5, P = 0.587; attention median = -0.733 vs. -0.717, U = 420.5, P = 0.548; and executive functioning median = -0.311 vs. -0.482, U = 408.5, P = 0.323). There were significantly fewer signs of depression in the intervention group (U = 322.5, P = 0.014). Conclusion: This predefined secondary analysis found that ghrelin treatment was associated with non-significantly but consistently better cognitive outcomes and significantly fewer signs of depression. This is in line with the primary outcomes.

AB  - Sudden cardiac events during sports competition are rare but tragic occurrences that require a timely, comprehensive response by well-prepared athletic trainers and medical providers. This sequence should prioritize prompt emergency medical system activation, immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), automated early defibrillation (AED), and comprehensive advanced life support efforts. Exercise-induced cardiac remodeling, referred to as the "athlete's heart," refers to a host of adaptive changes that increase cardiac chamber size and wall thickness to allow for greater pressures and volumes during exercise. This remodeling phenotype may overlap with other inherited cardiomyopathies and cardiac abnormalities, which can complicate clinical care. The long-term implications of this electrical and structural remodeling on cardiac function are unknown. Although the best screening strategies to optimize primary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest is an evolving topic, the effectiveness of CPR and early defibrillation use in treating out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest has been well-established, despite their reported underuse.

TI  - Mechanical support with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO-VA): Short-term and long-term prognosis after a successful weaning
T2  - MEDICINA INTENSIVA
AB  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) affords mechanical circulatory assistance associated to high mortality. However, weaning from such mechanical support may not imply improved short- or long-term survival. This study describes the characteristics and evolution of patients with refractory cardiogenic shock (RCS) subjected to venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) in a hospital with a heart transplant program.
   Design: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was carried out.
   Setting: The cardiovascular ICU of a tertiary hospital.
   Patients: Forty-six patients consecutively subjected to VA-ECMO over 6 years.
   Interventions: Hospital mortality after weaning from ECMO and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.
   Results: Fifteen patients (33%) died with VA-ECMO and 31 (67%) were weaned after 8 days of support (IQR: 5-15). Fourteen patients under went transplantation. Hospital mortality in these patients was 32% (10/31), and was associated to age (P = .001), SAPS II score (P = .009), cannulation bleeding (P = .01) and post-acute myocardial infarction RCS (P = .001). After a median follow-up of 27 months (IQR: 11-49), 91% of the patients discharged from hospital were still alive. Overall survival after weaning from assistance was associated to the type of cardiac disease (P = .002). Patients with RCS after acute myocardial infarction had a poorer prognosis.
   Conclusions: In our experience, VA-ECMO can be used as mechanical assistance in the management of RCS. The technique is associated to high early mortality, though the long-term survival rate after hospital discharge is good. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving Outcomes After Post-Cardiac Arrest Brain Injury: A Scientific Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - This scientific statement presents a conceptual framework for the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest brain injury, explores reasons for previous failure to translate preclinical data to clinical practice, and outlines potential paths forward. Post-cardiac arrest brain injury is characterized by 4 distinct but overlapping phases: ischemic depolarization, reperfusion repolarization, dysregulation, and recovery and repair. Previous research has been challenging because of the limitations of laboratory models; heterogeneity in the patient populations enrolled; overoptimistic estimation of treatment effects leading to suboptimal sample sizes; timing and route of intervention delivery; limited or absent evidence that the intervention has engaged the mechanistic target; and heterogeneity in postresuscitation care, prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Future trials must tailor their interventions to the subset of patients most likely to benefit and deliver this intervention at the appropriate time, through the appropriate route, and at the appropriate dose. The complexity of post-cardiac arrest brain injury suggests that monotherapies are unlikely to be as successful as multimodal neuroprotective therapies. Biomarkers should be developed to identify patients with the targeted mechanism of injury, to quantify its severity, and to measure the response to therapy. Studies need to be adequately powered to detect effect sizes that are realistic and meaningful to patients, their families, and clinicians. Study designs should be optimized to accelerate the evaluation of the most promising interventions. Multidisciplinary and international collaboration will be essential to realize the goal of developing effective therapies for post-cardiac arrest brain injury.

TI  - Functional connectivity in resting-state networks relates to short-term global cognitive functioning in cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB  - Long-term cognitive impairment is common in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening to identify patients at risk is recommended. Functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) holds potential to contribute to prediction of cognitive outcomes. In this study, we investigated the possible value of early changes in resting-state networks for predicting short and long-term cognitive functioning of cardiac arrest survivors. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in cardiac arrest survivors in three Dutch hospitals. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired within a month after cardiac arrest. We primarily focused on functional connectivity within the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), and additionally explored functional connectivity in seven other networks. Cognitive outcome was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during hospital admission and at 3 and 12 months, and by neuropsychological examination (NPE) at 12 months. We tested mixed effects models to evaluate the value of connectivity within the networks for predicting global cognitive outcomes at the three time points, and long-term cognitive outcomes in the memory, attention, and executive functioning domains. We included 80 patients (age 60 +/- 11 years, 72 (90%) male). MoCA scores increased significantly between hospital admission and 3 months (Delta MoCAhospital-3M = 2.89, p < 0.01), but not between 3 and 12 months (Delta MoCA3M-12M = 0.38, p = 0.52). Connectivity within the DMN, SN, and dorsal attention network (DAN) was positively related to global cognitive functioning during hospital admission (beta DMN = 0.85, p = 0.03; beta SN = 1.48, p < 0.01; beta DAN = 0.96, p = 0.01), but not at 3 and 12 months. Network connectivity was also unrelated to long-term memory, attention, or executive functioning. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN, SN, and DAN measured in the first month after cardiac arrest is related to short-term global, but not long-term global or domain-specific cognitive performance of survivors. These results do not support the value of functional connectivity within these RSNs for prediction of long-term cognitive performance after cardiac arrest.

TI  - The First Golden Minutes of the Extremely-Low-Gestational-Age Neonate: A Gentle Approach
T2  - NEONATOLOGY
AB  - An increasing body of evidence has revealed that interventions performed during resuscitation of extremely-low-gestational-age neonates (ELGANs) may have a direct influence on the immediate survival and also on long-term morbidity. It has been proposed that interventions in the delivery room and/or hypothermia could trigger changes constitutive of chronic lung disease. New approaches in the first minutes of life using more gentle parameters of intervention are being studied. Thus, titrating inspiratory fraction of oxygen, the use of non-invasive ventilation to reduce trauma to the lung, the use of polyethylene/polyurethane wrapping to avoid hypothermia and delaying cord clamping altogether constitute promising initiatives. The first minutes of life are a valuable window for intervention. However, whilst these practice changes make sense and there are emerging data to support them, further evidence including long-term follow up is needed to definitively change resuscitation procedures in ELGANs.

TI  - International survey of neuromonitoring and neurodevelopmental outcome in children and adults supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Europe
T2  - PERFUSION-UK
AB  - Background: Adverse neurological events during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are common and may be associated with devastating consequences. Close monitoring, early identification and prompt intervention can mitigate early and late neurological morbidity. Neuromonitoring and neurocognitive/neurodevelopmental follow-up are critically important to optimize outcomes in both adults and children. Objective: To assess current practice of neuromonitoring during ECMO and neurocognitive/neurodevelopmental follow-up after ECMO across Europe and to inform the development of neuromonitoring and follow-up guidelines. Methods: The EuroELSO Neurological Monitoring and Outcome Working Group conducted an electronic, web-based, multi-institutional, multinational survey in Europe. Results: Of the 211 European ECMO centres (including non-ELSO centres) identified and approached in 23 countries, 133 (63%) responded. Of these, 43% reported routine neuromonitoring during ECMO for all patients, 35% indicated selective use, and 22% practiced bedside clinical examination alone. The reported neuromonitoring modalities were NIRS (n = 88, 66.2%), electroencephalography (n = 52, 39.1%), transcranial Doppler (n = 38, 28.5%) and brain injury biomarkers (n = 33, 24.8%). Paediatric centres (67%) reported using cranial ultrasound, though the frequency of monitoring varied widely. Before hospital discharge following ECMO, 50 (37.6%) reported routine neurological assessment and 22 (16.5%) routinely performed neuroimaging with more paediatric centres offering neurological assessment (65%) as compared to adult centres (20%). Only 15 (11.2%) had a structured longitudinal follow-up pathway (defined followup at regular intervals), while 99 (74.4%) had no follow-up programme. The majority (n = 96, 72.2%) agreed that there should be a longitudinal structured follow-up for ECMO survivors. Conclusions: This survey demonstrated significant variability in the use of different neuromonitoring modalities during and after ECMO. The perceived importance of neuromonitoring and follow-up was noted to be very high with agreement for a longitudinal structured follow-up programme, particularly in paediatric patients. Scientific society endorsed guidelines and minimum standards should be developed to inform local protocols.

TI  - Surgical repair for postinfarction left ventricular free-wall rupture: 25-year single-centre experience†
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES Postinfarction left ventricular free-wall rupture (LVFWR) is a rare, unpredictable and often fatal complication of acute myocardial infarction. We reviewed our surgical experience with postinfarction LVFWR over 25 years to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality.METHODS Seventy-two consecutive patients with LVFWR who underwent surgical repair between 1994 and 2023 were retrospectively analysed. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality. The mean follow-up period was 3.9 +/- 5.4 years (maximum 25 years, 283 patient-years).RESULTS Thirty-five patients (49%) were directly transported to our centre, whereas 37 (51%) were initially taken to a local hospital. Prior to surgery, 30 (42%) developed out-of-hospital (n = 8, 11%) or in-hospital (n = 22, 31%) cardiac arrest. Upon entry to the operating room, 45 (63%) presented hypotensive shock, while 27 (38%) suffered cardiac arrest. LVFWR was oozing type in 42 patients (58%) and blow-out type in 30 patients (42%), for which sutureless repair (n = 27, 38%) or sutured repair (n = 45, 62%) was performed. The in-hospital mortality rate was 35%, in association with haemodynamic condition before surgery: 19% in patients without cardiac arrest, and 55% with in-hospital and 63% with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Patient age [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.2 per 10-year period, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-4.9, P = 0.044], out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.4-66, P = 0.020), in-hospital cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 6.6, 95% CI 1.6-33, P = 0.010) and initial ambulance transport to a local hospital (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.2-17, P = 0.020) were identified as independent risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The overall 5-year survival rate was 50%, while that for in-hospital survivors was 77%. When the present study period is split into 2 eras (1994-2010 and 2011-2023), the in-hospital mortality rate was comparable between them (41% vs 31%, P = 0.408). Notably, the in-hospital mortality of patients with a blow-out type left ventricular rupture was significantly lower in that latter study period (86% vs 39%, P = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS In surgically treated patients with LVFWR, the early mortality rate was high, while the long-term prognosis for in-hospital survivors was acceptable. These findings highlight the need for early diagnosis and prompt management of haemodynamic instability at a tertiary centre to improve outcomes.
   Mechanical complications following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may involve the interventricular septum, ventricular free wall or papillary muscles.

TI  - Cognitive impairments and subjective cognitive complaints after survival of cardiac arrest: A prospective longitudinal cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest can lead to hypoxic brain injury, which can affect cognitive functioning.
   Objective: To investigate the course of objective and subjective cognitive functioning and their association during the first year after cardiac arrest.
   Methods: A multi-centre prospective longitudinal cohort study with one year follow-up (measurements at two weeks, three months and one year). Cognitive functioning was measured with a neuropsychological test battery and subjective cognitive functioning with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire.
   Results: 141 cardiac arrest survivors participated. Two weeks post cardiac arrest 16% to 29% of survivors were cognitively impaired varying on the different tests, at three months between 9% and 23% and at one year 10%-22% remained impaired with executive functioning being affected most. Significant reduction of cognitive impairments was seen for all tests, with most recovery during the first three months after cardiac arrest. Subjective cognitive complaints were present at two weeks after cardiac arrest in 11%, 12% at three months and 14% at one year. There were no significant associations between cognitive impairments and cognitive complaints at any time point.
   Conclusions: Cognitive impairments are common in cardiac arrest survivors with executive functioning being mostly affected. Most recovery is seen in the first three months after cardiac arrest. After one year, a substantial number of patients remain impaired, especially in executive functioning. Because of absence of associations between impairments and complaints, cognitive testing using a sensitive test battery is important and should be part of routine follow-up after a cardiac arrest.

TI  - Pediatric extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: single-center study
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/aim: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is defined as the venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support in a patient who experienced a sudden pulsdess condition attributable to cessation of cardiac mechanical activity and circulation. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of our ECPR experience in a pediatric patient population.
   Materials and methods: Between September 2014 and November 2017, 15 children were supported with ECPR following in-hospital cardiac arrest (INCA) in our hospitals. VA-ECMO setting was established for all patients. Pediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) scales and long-term neurological prognosis of the survivors were assessed.
   Results: The median age of the study population was 60 (4-156) months. The median weight was 18 (4.8-145) kg, height was 115 (63-172) cm, and body surface area was 0.73 (0.27-2.49) m(2). The cause of cardiac arrest was a cardiac and circulatory failure in 12 patients (80%) and noncardiac causes in 20%. Dysrhythmia was present in 46%, septic shock in 13%, bleeding in 6%, low cardiac output syndrome in 13%, and airway disease in 6% of the study population. Median low-flow time was 95 (range 20-320) min. Central VA-ECMO cannulation was placed in only 2 (13.3%) cases. However, the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained in 10 (66.6%) patients, and 5 (50%) of them survived. Overall, 5 patients were discharged from the hospital. Finally, survival following ECPR was 33.3%, and all survivors were neurologically intact at hospital-discharge.
   Conclusion: ECPR can be a life-saving therapeutic strategy using a promising technology in the pediatric IHCA population. Early initiation and a well-coordinated, skilled, and dedicated ECMO team are the mainstay for better survival rates.

TI  - Long-lasting cognitive injury in rats with apparent full gross neurological recovery after short-term cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The long-term behavioral effects of mild global ischemia have not been well described. We used short (5 min) asphyxic-cardiac arrest that resulted in no apparent gross neurological deficits to study the long-term effects of mild hypoxic ischemia on the neurobehavioral status of rats.
   Methods: Fifteen adult, mate Wistar rats were studied. One group was given asphyxic-cardiac arrest (CA) for 5 min (n = 10) and the other group had Sham procedure (n = 5). Neurobehavioral testing was performed before and 2 weeks after CA. The neurobehavioral evaluations were: neurological deficit score (NDS), Y Maze, open field, pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle reflex (ASR), wire hanging, and inclined screen.
   Results: At 24h post-CA, all of the rats regained normal neurological function as measured by NDS, an integral score for consciousness, brainstem reflexes, sensorimotor function and simple behavioral reflex tests. However, 1 week after CA, the rats exhibited significant activity reductions in the open field and in spontaneous alternation in the Y maze. The CA rats also showed a significant decrease in startle reaction amplitude and startle inhibition in the PPI tests. Two weeks after CA, the changes in motor activity and deficits in PPI remained significant, but the spontaneous alternation recovered. The muscle strength test of wire hanging and inclined screen tests did not exhibit significant change.
   Conclusion: We present a rodent model of mild CA that, despite apparent full recovery of global neurological function at 24h post-resuscitation, exhibited long-term cognitive injury lasting for at least 2 weeks after CA. This model may help understand better the injury associated with CA and develop management strategies for mild brain injury. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Management of non-severe burn wounds in children and adolescents: optimising outcomes through all stages of the patient journey
T2  - LANCET CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Paediatric burn injuries are common, especially in children younger than 5 years, and can lead to poor physical and psychosocial outcomes in the long term. In this Review, we aim to summarise the key factors and interventions before hospital admission and following discharge that can improve the long-term outcomes of paediatric burns. Care can be optimised through first aid treatment, correct initial assessment of burn severity, and appropriate patient referral to a burns centre. Scar prevention or treatment and patient follow-up after discharge are also essential. As most burn injuries in children are comparatively small and readily survivable, this Review does not cover the perioperative management associated with severe burns that require fluid resuscitation, or inhalational injury. Burns disproportionately affect children from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those living in low-income and middle-income countries, with ample evidence to suggest that there remains scope for low-cost interventions to improve care for those patients with the greatest burden of burn injury. Current knowledge gaps and future research directions are discussed.

TI  - What is the outcome of cardiac arrest survivors?
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - In spite of recent advances, cardiac arrest remains a serious illness for which survival rote stays very low.
   If prehospital death remains the major problem, in-hospital death is also important. Two thirds of deaths in intensive core ore the result of initial brain damage.
   After discharge, risk of recurrence for victims of sudden death is important and requires specific care and sometimes the implant of a cardiac defibrillator.
   In survivors, medium and long-term survival is satisfactory and close to that of patients with similar age and comorbidities that hove not suffered cardiac arrest.
   The "minor" cerebral sequels remain unknown and their impact on quality of life needs further attention.

TI  - Reproductive, obstetric, and long-term health outcome after uterus transplantation: results of the first clinical trial
T2  - FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB  - Objective: To evaluate reproductive, obstetric, and long-term health of the first completed study of uterus transplantation (UTx).
   Design: Prospective.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Patient(s): Nine live donor UTx procedures were conducted and seven were successful. Donors, recipients, and children born were observed.
   Intervention(s): In vitro fertilization was performed with embryo transfer (Fr) of day 2 or day 5 embryos in natural cycles. Pregnancies and growth trajectory of the children born were observed. Health-related quality of life, psychosocial outcome, and medical health of donors and recipients were evaluated by questionnaires.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The results of in vitro fertilization, pregnancies, growth of children, and long-term health of patients were reported.
   Result(s): Six women delivered nine infants, with three women giving birth twice (cumulative birth rates of 86% and 67% in surgically successful and performed transplants, respectively). The overall clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR) per ET were 32.6% and 19.6%, respectively. For day 2 embryos, the CPR and LBR per ET were 12.5% and 8.6%, respectively. For day 5 embryos, the CPR and LBR per ET were 81.8% and 45.4%, respectively. Fetal growth and blood flow were normal in all pregnancies. Time of delivery (median in full pregnancy weeks + days (ranges]) by cesarean section and weight deviations was 35 + 3 (31 + 6 to 38 + 0) and -1% (-13% to 23%), respectively. Three women developed preeclampsia and four neonates acquired respiratory distress syndrome. All children were healthy and followed a normal growth trajectory. Measures of long-term health in both donors and recipients were noted to be favorable. When UTx resulted in a birth, scores for anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction were reassuring for both the donors and recipients.
   Conclusion(s): The results of this first complete UTx trial show that this is an effective infertility treatment, resulting in births of healthy children and associated with only minor psychological and medical long-term effects for donors and recipients.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB  - Aggressive early treatment of meningococcal disease can reduce mortality. This relies on prompt recognition and treatment of the complications of septicaemia and meningitis, appropriate ongoing intensive care where necessary, and adequate management of multiple organ failure. Most children with meningococcal disease survive intact, but long term sequelae are increasingly recognised and make follow up essential. New treatments continue to be evaluated, but none has so far proven to be effective in further reducing morbidity or mortality. Simple, timely therapeutic manoeuvres may greatly improve the prospects for survival.

TI  - CHANGES IN FIELD TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION AND SURVIVAL RATES AFTER AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE ON SCENE RESUSCITATION FOR OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Emergency medical services (EMS) agencies with higher field termination-of-resuscitation (TOR) rates tend to have higher survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Whether EMS agencies can improve survival rates through efforts to focus on resuscitation on scene and optimize TOR rates is unknown. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine if an EMS agency's efforts to enhance on-scene resuscitation were associated with increased TOR and OHCA survival with favorable neurologic outcome. Methods: A single-city, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected 2017 quality assurance data was conducted. Patient demographics, process, and outcome measures were compared before and after an educational intervention to increase field TOR. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurologic status. Results: There were 320 cases that met inclusion criteria. No differences in age, gender, location, witnessed arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initial shockable rhythm, or presumed cardiac etiology were found. After the intervention, overall TOR rate increased from 39.6% to 51.1% (p = 0.06). Among subjects transported without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), average time on scene increased from 26.4 to 34.2 min (p = 0.02). Rates of sustained ROSC and survival to hospital admission were similar between periods. After intervention, there was a trend toward increased survival to hospital discharge rate (relative risk [RR] 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-5.91) and an increase in survival with favorable neurologic status rate (RR 5.96; 95% CI 0.80-44.47). Conclusion: This study described the association between an educational intervention focusing on optimization of resuscitation on scene and OHCA process and outcome measures. Field termination has the potential to serve as a surrogate marker for aggressively treating OHCA patients on scene. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Efficacy of Citicoline as a Neuroprotector in children with post cardiac arrest: a randomized controlled clinical trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Brain hypoxia after cardiac arrest leads to damage of the neuronal cell membrane. Citicoline is necessary for the synthesis of cell membrane. We planned to assess the neuroprotective effect of citicoline in children after cardiac arrest. This randomized controlled trial was carried out at pediatric intensive care units (PICU) and surgical ICU at Tanta university hospital on 80 consecutive children surviving in-hospital cardiac arrest who were subdivided into two groups. Group I (citicoline group) included 40 children with post-cardiac arrest who received citicoline 10 mg /kg /12 h IV for 6 weeks plus other supportive measures and group II (control group) included 40 children with post-cardiac arrest who were managed with only supportive measures. All patients were evaluated for Glasgow coma score (GCS), modified Rankin scale (mRS) for children, seizures frequency, type and duration, and serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) before and 3 months after the treatment. GCS and mRS significantly improved in citicholine group compared to the control group. Seizure frequency and duration, mortality, PICU and hospital stay significantly decreased in citicholine group compared to the control group. Serum NSE levels significantly decreased in citicholine group only. No side effects were recorded.
   Conclusion: Citicoline is a promising neuroprotective drug in children with post-cardiac arrest. Trial Registration: The study was registered at Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) with trial number PACTR201907742119058.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF HELLENIC MEDICINE
AB  - E-health services have a variety of applications in the case of both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Every aspect of telemedicine belongs to the field of e-health services. Several technological means are applied in OHCA, Including the use of smartphones with focused applications, video services, and drones. Health care professionals can derive a variety of benefits from telemedicine services, including an electronic form of early warning system, telemetry, telemedicine consultation, for treating cardiac arrest. The education and training of both health professionals and citizens are crucial for the optimal exploitation of these new technologies. E-health services promote participation and accessibility for all, enhance the role and performance of health professionals, and ultimately improve the quality of health care provision.

TI  - A Narrative Review of Drug Therapy in Adult and Pediatric Cardiac Arrest
T2  - REVIEWS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Drugs are used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in association with chest compressions and ventilation. The main purpose of drugs during resuscitation is either to improve coronary perfusion pressure and myocardial perfusion in order to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The aim of this up-to-date review is to provide an overview of the main drugs used during cardiac arrest (CA), highlighting their historical context, pharmacology, and the data to support them. Epinephrine remains the only recommended vasopressor. Regardless of the controversy about optimal dosage and interval between doses in recent papers, epinephrine should be administered as early as possible to be the most effective in non-shockable rhythms. Despite inconsistent survival outcomes, amiodarone and lidocaine are the only two recommended antiarrhythmics to treat shockable rhythms after defibrillation. Beta-blockers have also been recently evaluated as antiarrhythmic drugs and show promising results but further evaluation is needed. Calcium, sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium are still widely used during resuscitation but have shown no benefit. Available data may even suggest a harmful effect and they are no longer recommended during routine CPR. In experimental studies, sodium nitroprusside showed an increase in survival and favorable neurological outcome when combined with enhanced CPR, but as of today, no clinical data is available. Finally, we review drug administration in pediatric CA. Epinephrine is recommended in pediatric CA and, although they have not shown any improvement in survival or neurological outcome, antiarrhythmic drugs have a 2b recommendation in the current guidelines for shockable rhythms.

TI  - V-CARE (Virtual Care After REsuscitation): Protocol for a Randomized Feasibility Study of a Virtual Psychoeducational Intervention After Cardiac Arrest-A STEPCARE Sub-Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors and their relatives may face challenges following hospital discharge, relating to mood, cognition, and returning to normal day-to-day activities. Identified research gaps include a lack of knowledge around what type of intervention is needed to best navigate recovery. In this study, we investigate the feasibility and patient acceptability of a new virtual psychoeducational group intervention for OHCA survivors and their relatives and compare it to a control group receiving a digital information booklet. Methods: V-CARE is a comparative, single-blind randomized pilot trial including participants at selected sites of the STEPCARE trial, in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Inclusion criteria are a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <= 3 at 30-day follow-up; no diagnosis of dementia; and not experiencing an acute psychiatric episode. One caregiver per patient is invited to participate optionally. The intervention group in V-CARE receives four semi-structured, one-hour-long, psychoeducational sessions delivered remotely via video call by a trained clinician once a week, 2-3 months after hospital discharge. The sessions cover understanding cardiac arrest; coping with fatigue and memory problems; managing low mood and anxiety; and returning to daily life. The control group receives an information booklet focused on fatigue, memory/cognitive problems, mental health, and practical coping strategies. Results: Primary: feasibility (number of patients consented) and acceptability (retention rate); secondary: satisfaction with care (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 item), self-management skills (Self-Management Assessment Scale) and, where available, health-related outcomes assessed in the STEPCARE Extended Follow-up sub-study including cognition, fatigue, mood, quality of life, and return to work. Conclusions: If preliminary insights from the V-CARE trial suggest the intervention to be feasible and acceptable, the results will be used to design a larger trial aimed at informing future interventions to support OHCA recovery.

TI  - Drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Drug therapy continues to be recommended as part of cardiac arrest management. There has been increasing transparency about the lack of evidence to support such drug therapy, and the gaps identified in our knowledge have stimulated ongoing research. This review aims to highlight recently published articles that relate to the use of drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Recent findings
   Definitive studies have now been performed in human cardiac arrests, randomly comparing drugs with neutral controls. These publications have confirmed the short-term benefits of the standard drugs used in advanced life support (including epinephrine) when compared with no drugs. There are still many gaps in our knowledge, but a number of new approaches offer promise, including the use of intravenous lipid emulsions (in cardiac arrests due to local anesthetic toxicity), erythropoietin and even stem cells.
   Summary
   The use of some drugs (e. g. epinephrine) can be recommended in cardiac arrest, but only on the basis of short-term benefits. These short-term benefits need to be converted into long-term outcomes by optimizing management in the postarrest period. Potential drug strategies need to be evaluated in settings in which the drug is administered in a timely fashion, good CPR is provided, and postresuscitation care has been optimized.

TI  - Cardiovascular Etiologies and Risk Factors of Survival Outcomes After Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Data From the KoCARC Registry
T2  - KOREAN CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background and Objectives: The outcomes and characteristics of out-of-hospital arrest (OHCA) vary across geographic regions. The etiologies and prognoses of OHCA Asian populations remain less established. This study aimed to investigate the etiologies and clinical characteristics of patients successfully resuscitated after OHCA and predictors of survival outcomes. Methods: Data were extracted from a South Korean multicenter prospective registry that included 64 tertiary hospitals from 2015 to 2018 (n=7,577). The primary outcome hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was a Cerebral Performance Category score of grade 1 at discharge. Results: Of the 7,577 patients, 2,066 achieved return of spontaneous circulation and were hospitalized. A total of 915 (44.2%) presented with ventricular arrhythmia as their initial rhythm or on admission. The leading cause was obstructive coronary disease (n=413; 20.0%). Sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) accounted for 67.5% survivors and was significantly less common in patients with VA (82.7% vs. 48.3%, p<0.001). VA was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.774; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.633-0.946; p=0.012) and the grade-1 CPC score at discharge (odds ratio, 2.822; 95% CI, 1.909-4.172; p<0.001). Other predictors of in-hospital mortality included age, diabetes mellitus, witnessed cardiac arrest, ROSC on arrival, total arrest time, alertness on admission, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, targeted temperature management, and coronary reperfusion. Conclusions: SUDS was common in patients with ROSC after OHCA. VA was independently associated with favorable survival outcomes at discharge. Prompt clinical intervention may improve clinical outcomes in patients with OHCA, particularly those with VA.

TI  - Risk factors for neurological disability outcomes in patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiac arrest: An observational study
T2  - INTENSIVE AND CRITICAL CARE NURSING
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify factors associated with neurological and disability outcomes in patients who underwent ECMO following cardiac arrest. Methods: This retrospective, single-center, observational study included adult patients who received ECMO treatment for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between February 2016 and March 2020. Factors associated with neurological and disability outcomes in these patients who underwent ECMO were assessed. Setting: Hamad General Hospital, Qatar. Main outcome measures: Neurological disability outcomes were assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale. Results: Among the 48 patients included, 37 (77 %) experienced OHCA, and 11 (23 %) had IHCA. The 28-day survival rate was 14 (29.2 %). Of the survivors, 9 (64.3 %) achieved a good neurological outcome, while 5 (35.7 %) experienced poor neurological outcomes. Regarding disability, 5 (35.7 %) of survivors had no disability, while 9 (64.3 %) had some form of disability. The results showed significantly shorter median time intervals in minutes, including collapse to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (3 vs. 6, P = 0.001), CPR duration (12 vs. 35, P = 0.001), CPR to extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) (20 vs. 40, P = 0.001), and collapse-toECPR (23 vs. 45, P = 0.001), in the good outcome group compared to the poor outcome group. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of minimizing the time between collapse and CPR/ECMO initiation to improve neurological outcomes and reduce disability in cardiac arrest patients. However, no significant associations were found between outcomes and other demographic or clinical variables in this study. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to validate these findings. Implications for clinical practice: The study underscores the significance of reducing the time between collapse and the initiation of CPR and ECMO. Shorter time intervals were associated with improved neurological outcomes and reduced disability in cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Coronary angiography and percutaneous intervention after resuscitation
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) presents a great challenge for the health care systems even in the highly developed countries. For several decades, our greatest efforts have been directed toward the improvement of the prehospital management, including promotion of lay resuscitation and deployment of public access automated defibrillators. Recently, the importance of the hospital phase of the OHCA-management has been also emphasized. Attention has been paid to targeted temperature management and also to early coronary intervention. For those patients who present with ST-elevation on their post-resuscitation ECG, our approach is straightforward: urgent coronary angiography is indicated. The optimal management of those survivors of OHCA who present without ST-elevation is, however, still debated. Although up to 30% of these subjects also suffer from acute occlusive epicardial coronary disease, the clear benefit of urgent coronary angiography for the whole group is yet to be documented. Several largescale randomized studies are under way to resolve this question. In our present review we detail the above controversies and outline the future directions.

TI  - Epidemiology, prognostic data of cardiac arrest in 2014
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - Epidemiological data on the incidence, the survival and the prognostic factors of cardiac arrest (CA) are often heterogeneous. However, recent advances in methodology and research have improved the knowledge on that topic.
   The prognosis of victims CA depends on the initial patient's characteristics, the circumstances of the CA and the quality of the management.
   As a result, the subsequent outcome of these patients relies on the efficiency of the chain of survival: prompt alert, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation, the advanced care life support provided by the emergency medical services and the integration of in-hospital core.
   Other parameters are also likely to influence the prognosis (such as the system of care or the environment) though their assessment remains incomplete. More important, factors potentially affecting the long-term outcome are currently very less investigated.
   Finally, despite the potential improvements in the management of these patients for some years now, the temporal trends of the overall survival appear fairly stable. The transition in the profile of patients could portly explain the absence of clear effect on survival.

TI  - Exercise-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Victoria, Australia
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Characteristics and outcomes of exercise-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) are not well described in Australia.
   Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of non-exercise-related aetiology and exercise-related OHCAs from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry between 2008 and 2016, including 12-month quality of life data from 2010 to 2016. Exercise-related OHCA was defined as taking place during or within 1 h of at least moderate intensity exercise. Descriptive statistics and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Results: During the study period there were 482 exercise-related and 33,358 non-exercise-related OHCAs. Jogging/running were the most frequent precipitating sports. The incidence rate of exercise-related OHCA was low (<1 per 100,000 person-years). Compared to non-exercise-related aetiology, exercise-related OHCAs were younger (mean 54 versus 70 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to present in an initial shockable rhythm (85% versus 18%, p < 0.001). Bystander CPR, and bystander or EMS defibrillation at any time, were more common among exercise-related arrests (93% versus 38%, p < 0.001 and 91% versus 24%, p < 0.001, respectively). A public access defibrillator was used in 24% of shockable exercise-related OHCAs compared with 4% of non-exercise-related OHCAs (p < 0.001). After adjustment for arrest characteristics, exercise-related OHCAs were more likely to survive to hospital discharge (50% versus 14%, p < 0.001; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.96, p < 0.001) and survive to 12-months with good functional recovery (72% versus 62%, p = 0.012; AOR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.08-2.28, p = 0.018).
   Conclusions: Exercise-related OHCAs were associated with better short-and long-term prognoses compared to non-exercise-related OHCAs. The underlying factors associated with this survival benefit warrant further investigation.

TI  - Antiphospholipid syndrome and valvular heart disease, a complex scenario of thrombotic events, a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare coagulation disorder associated with thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and valvular heart disease. During valvular replacement surgery, the high risk of thrombosis combined with the operative risks in these specific groups of patients poses a challenge to the medical team.Case presentationWe present a case of a female patient with APS and mixed aortic valve disease. During surgery, she suddenly developed complete cardiac arrest. Three months later, after she recovered, and while she was still on close follow up, a thrombotic event caused myocardial infarction. After prompt and precise treatment, the patient successfully recovered; one year after surgery patient is doing well.ConclusionAdequate surgical technique along with optimal anticoagulation strategies and long term follow up are of paramount importance to ensure an uneventful recovery. A multidisciplinary team is required to manage these complex scenarios and high-risk patients.

TI  - Randomized trial of the i-gel supraglottic airway device versus tracheal intubation during out of hospital cardiac arrest (AIRWAYS-2): Patient outcomes at three and six months
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The AIRWAYS-2 cluster randomised controlled trial compared the i-gel supraglottic airway device (SGA) with tracheal intubation (TI) as the first advanced airway management (AAM) strategy used by Emergency Medical Service clinicians (paramedics) treating adult patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). It showed no difference between the two groups in the primary outcome of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 30 days/hospital discharge. This paper reports outcomes to 6 months. Methods: Paramedics from four ambulance services in England were randomised 1:1 to use an i-gel SGA (759 paramedics) or TI (764 paramedics) as their initial approach to AAM. Adults who had a non-traumatic OHCA and were attended by a participating paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent. Survivors were invited to complete questionnaires at three and six months after OHCA. Outcomes were analysed using regression methods. Results: 767/9296 (8.3%) enrolled patients survived to 30 days/hospital discharge and 317/767 survivors (41.3%) consented and were followed-up to six months. No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups in the primary outcome measure (mRS score: 3 months: odds ratio (OR) for good recovery (i-gel/TI, OR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.69-1.14; 6 months OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71-1.16). EQ-5D-5L scores were also similar between groups and sensitivity analyses did not alter the findings. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between the TI and i-gel groups at three and six months. We therefore conclude that the initially reported finding of no significant difference between groups at 30 days/hospital discharge was sustained when the period of follow-up was extended to six months.

TI  - DECIDING ABOUT CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION - THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DECISION-ANALYSIS
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Patients have the right to decide whether to authorize cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Physicians should provide adequate information and help clarify preferences.
   Methods: The usefulness of decision analysis was investigated in two convenience samples: 20 healthy outpatient volunteers and 35 audience members at medical ethics grand rounds. Subjects quantified their relative preferences (utilities) for the outcomes of cardiac arrest. First, they rated them on a linear scale. Second, they participated in hypothetical gambles in which they indicated how much they would risk to avoid each outcome. The investigator then calculated the overall expected utilities of the CPR and no-CPR strategies.
   Results: Subjects were able to complete both the gambles ods differed greatly. Subjects had strong aversions to an outcome of severe long-term brain damage and widely varying ratings of an outcome of a short period of intensive care followed by death (intensive care unit death). Because intensive care unit death is far more likely than long-term brain damage, its utility was the prime determinant of whether CPR or no-CPR had the higher calculated expected utility.
   Conclusions: The methods of decision analysis showed promise as a means not only of informing patients about CPR but of helping them make rational choices. They also revealed the inadequacy of current data on the key outcome of intensive care unit death.

TI  - Dyadic effects of type D personality and perceived control on health-related quality of life in cardiac arrest survivors and their spouses using the actor-partner interdependence model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: There is a lack of knowledge about factors associated with health-related quality of life in cardiac arrest survivors and their spouses. In addition, survivors and spouses are likely to affect each other's health-related quality of life. Aims: The aim was to investigate if a distressed personality and perceived control among cardiac arrest survivors and their spouses were associated with their own and their partner's health-related quality of life. Methods: This dyadic cross-sectional study used the actor-partner interdependence model to analyse associations between a distressed personality (type D personality), perceived control (control attitudes scale), and health-related quality of life (EQ index and EQ visual analogue scale). Results: In total, 126 dyads were included in the study. Type D personality and perceived control in cardiac arrest survivors were associated with their own health-related quality of life. In their spouses, a significant association was found for type D personality but not for perceived control. In addition, type D personality and perceived control in survivors were associated with health-related quality of life in their spouses. Conclusions: Type D personality and perceived control are factors that might be considered during post cardiac arrest, because of the associations with health-related quality of life in survivors and spouses. More research is needed to test psychosocial interventions in the cardiac arrest population in order to improve health-related quality of life.

TI  - Unveiling Breakthroughs in Post-resuscitation Supportive Care for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors: A Narrative Review
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) experience significant mortality rates and neurological impairment, potentially attributed to the hypoxic-ischemic injury sustained amid the cardiac arrest episode. Post-resuscitation care plays a crucial role in determining outcomes for survivors of OHCA. Supportive therapies have proven to be influential in shaping these outcomes. However, targeting higher blood pressure or oxygen levels during the post-resuscitative phase has not been shown to offer any mortality or neurological benefits. In terms of maintaining hemodynamic instability after resuscitation, it is recommended to use norepinephrine rather than epinephrine. While extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation has shown promising results, targeted temperature management has been found ineffective in improving outcomes despite its previous potential. This review also investigates various challenges and barriers associated with the practical implementation of these supportive therapies in clinical settings. The review also highlights areas ripe for future research and proposes potential directions to further enhance post-resuscitation supportive care for OHCA survivors.

TI  - The incidence of "load&go" out-of-hospital cardiac arrest candidates for emergency department utilization of emergency extracorporeal life support: A one-year review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The outcome of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is poor and gets worse after prolonged resuscitation. Recently introduced attempts like an early installed emergency extracorporeal life support (E-ECLS) in patients with persisting cardiac arrest at the emergency department (ED) are tried. The "Vienna Cardiac Arrest Registry" (VICAR) was introduced August 2013 to collect Utstein-style data. The aim of this observational study was to identify the incidence of patients which fulfil "load&go"-criteria for E-ECLS at the ED.
   Methods: VICAR was retrospectively analyzed for following criteria: age < 75 years; witnessed OHCA; basic life support; ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia; no return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC) within 15 min of advanced-life-support, which were supposed as potential optimal criteria for "load&go" plus successful E-ECLS treatment at the ED. The observation period was from August 1, 2013 to July 31, 2014.
   Results: Over 948 OHCA patients registered during the study period; data were exploitable for 864 patients. Of all patients, "load&go"-criteria were fulfilled by 55 (6%). However, 96 (11%) were transported with on-going CPR to the ED. Of these 96 patients, only 16 (17%) met the "load&go"-criteria. Similarly, among the 96 patients, 12 adults were treated with E-ECLS at the ED, with only 5 meeting the criteria. Among these 12 patients, favourable neurological outcome (CPC 1/2) was obtained in 1 patient without criteria.
   Conclusion: Further promotion of these criteria within the ambulance crews is needed. May be these criteria could serve as a decision support for emergency physicians/paramedics, which patients to transport with on-going CPR to the ED for E-ECLS. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Objective: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a prominent cause of death worldwide. As indicated by the high proportion of COVID-19 suspicion or diagnosis among patients who had OHCA, this issue could have resulted in multiple fatalities from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring at home and being counted as OHCA. Methods: We used the MeSH term "heart arrest" as well as non-MeSH terms "out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, OHCA, cardiac arrest, coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)." We conducted a literature search using these search keywords in the Science Direct and PubMed databases and Google Scholar until 25 April 2022. Results: A systematic review of observational studies revealed OHCA and mortality rates increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period of the previous year. A temporary two-fold rise in OHCA incidence was detected along with a drop in survival. During the pandemic, the community's response to OHCA changed, with fewer bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitations (CPRs), longer emergency medical service (EMS) response times, and worse OHCA survival rates. Conclusions: This study's limitations include a lack of a centralised data-gathering method and OHCA registry system. If the chain of survival is maintained and effective emergency ambulance services with a qualified emergency medical team are given, the outcome for OHCA survivors can be improved even more.

TI  - Cardiopulmonar Resuscitation. When the Heart Stops, Resucitate or Keep Company?
T2  - UNIVERSITAS MEDICA
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) introduces an important paradigm shift regarding the revert of death, which generates great expectations in the general public and even so in physicians. However, despite tha fact that medical progress has led to improved outcomes, short- and long-term survival remains low, accompanied with significant alterations in quality of life and functionality of survivors. Recognizing this reality, "do not resuscitate orders" (DNR) emerge as an alternative and various societies suggest the need to establish indications, whether to start a CPR and when to stop CPR. This article provides tools for decision making on CPR, and to recognize our human limitation in the face of death, understanding that the most beneficial act in many cases will be to keep company and not resucitate.

T2  - HONG KONG MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after a witnessed cardiac arrest, having had compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiated by her son on the backseat of his car. She was resuscitated in the emergency department for 1 hour before the return of spontaneous circulation. She then underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and therapeutic hypothermia. She was discharged without significant neurological deficit. This case illustrates better survival and neurological outcome can be achieved by prompt implementation of a 'chain of survival' interventions and therapeutic hypothermia.

TI  - Life after death: Posttraumatic stress disorder in survivors of cardiac arrest - Prevalence, associated factors, and the influence of sedation and analgesia
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Cardiac arrest is possibly one of the most traumatizing conditions for patients, but to date, its influence on psychic morbidity remains unknown. Posttraumatic stress disorder is a unique symptom configuration after an extreme event consisting of intrusion re-experiencing, avoidance and numbness, and hyperarousal symptoms. We studied a) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in long term survivors of cardiac arrest; b) the role of specific stress factors related to cardiac arrest for the development of PTSD; and c) the influence of sedation and analgesia during or after cardiac arrest on the occurrence of PTSD.
   Design: Prospective, cohort study.
   Setting: University teaching hospital.
   Patients: Analysis was performed in cardiac arrest survivors who were discharged with favorable neurologic outcome during an 8-yr period (1991-1999).
   Interventions: All patients received the Davidson Trauma Score for the assessment of PTSD and a modified German version of the EuroQol questionnaire for assessment of quality of life. Cardiac arrest circumstances and administration of sedation and analgesia were assessed.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,630 initially resuscitated patients, 270 patients were discharged with good neurologic outcome. A total of 226 patients were contacted, and 143 patents (63% of all eligible patients) completed the study. Mean time from cardiac arrest to follow up was 45 months (range, 24-66). Thirty-nine patients (27%; 95% confidence interval, 21% to 35%) had a Davidson Trauma Score >40 and fulfilled criteria for PTSD. Patients with PTSD had a significantly lower quality of life. The only independent risk factor for the development of PTSD was younger age. There was no difference between patients with or without PTSD regarding the use of sedation and analgesia during or after cardiac arrest.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of PTSD in cardiac arrest survivors is high. Besides younger age, neither clinical factors nor the use of sedation and analgesia were associated with development of PTSD.

TI  - Impact of AEDs and training of smartphone activated volunteers in residential areas on OHCA: a nationwide stepped-wedge implementation trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Early bystander interventions can improve out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival rates. We hypothesized that an interventional bundle including automated external defibrillator (AED) installation in residential areas and training smartphone activated volunteers would increase bystander intervention and survival rates. Methods: We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster non-randomized study between 1 April 2010 and 31 December 2020 in Singapore. AEDs were installed sequentially over eight "wedges", with one AED installed at every two housing blocks. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)/AED training was conducted for residents including enrolling them as smartphone activated volunteers. Primary outcome was bystander AED application. Secondary outcomes were bystander CPR application, prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to discharge/30th day/with favorable neurological function. Using generalized estimating equation, we compared outcomes between intervention and control groups, accounting for clustering effects and confounders. A stratified analysis by location of arrest was also conducted. Results: 18,086 OHCAs were analysed (Intervention: n = 8,180; Control: n = 9,906). We found increased odds of bystander AED application in the intervention compared to control group (aOR 3.94 [95 %CI 3.28, 4.74]; p < 0.05). The effect of the intervention on bystander AED application was greater for OHCAs occurring in residential (aOR 10.31 [95 %CI 6.94, 15.33]) than those in public locations (aOR 2.84 [95 %CI 2.24, 3.59]). Conclusions: The implementation of AED installation in residential areas and training of smartphone activated volunteers increased bystander AED application; the impact was higher for OHCAs occurring in residential compared to public locations. This may be a promising strategy for increasing bystander AED use in densely populated residential areas.

TI  - Increasing the shockable rhythm and survival rate by dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Japan
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) directions by dispatchers. We analysed the relationship of dispatcher-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-BCPR) with favourable cerebral function, shockable rhythm rate, and emergency medical service (EMS) arrival time.
   Methods: This nationwide study was based on CPR statistical data of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients (n= 629,471) from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015, and included 107,669 patients with bystander-witnessed cardiogenic cardiac arrest.
   The primary outcome was good brain function prognosis after 1 month, while the secondary outcome was the rate of shockable rhythm on ECG at the time of EMS arrival.
   EMS arrival time at the site was stratified into 7min, 8-10min, and 11-20min using tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the association between DA-BCPR and outcomes in each tertile.
   Results: There were 37,269 (35%), 18,109 (17%), and 52,291 (49%) patients in the DA-BCPR, Only-BCPR, and no-BCPR groups, respectively. Compared to No-BCPR, DA-BCPR was associated with favourable neurological outcomes regardless of the time from 119 call to EMS contact (AOR, 1.56, 2.01, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.43-1.71, 1.80-2.24, 1.52-2.19; <= 7min, 8-10min, and 11-20min, respectively). DA-BCPR showed association with the shockable rhythm rate upon EMS arrival regardless of the time 119 call to EMS contact (AOR, 1.30, 1.60, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.23-1.38, 1.51-1.70, 1.75 -2.06; <= 7min, 8-10min, and 11-20min, respectively).
   Conclusion: Providing dispatcher assistance with CPR to 119 callers improves the long-term outcome regardless of the patient's age and EMS response time. Thus, encouraging dispatchers to promote BCPR is important for increasing the shockable rhythm rate and improving the brain function prognosis.

TI  - What should a family physician know about nutrition and physical exercise rehabilitation' advices to communicate to 'long-term COVID-19' patients?
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE
AB  - In real practice, there is a paradox in the management of patients with 'long-term Covid-19.' Indeed, Family physicians (FPs) are on the front line in the management process of these patients. For 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and according to the World Health Organization guideline, the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) should be provided not only at tertiary- or secondary care but mainly at primary care with a real implication of FPs. However, specific guidelines/recommendations were addressed for FPs. Therefore, an alternative including the CPR minimal advice that an FP should provide to 'long-term Covid-19' patients, seems to be necessary to respond to the needs of FPs to face their involvement with 'long-term Covid-19' patients. Thus, this paper aimed to report the CPR 'minimal advice' that should be provided by FPs managing 'long-term Covid-19' patients with incapacity (i.e.; alteration of the cardiorespiratory and muscular chain). According to the authors, FPs should be more cautious in the prescription of exercise and nutrition program and informed about the minimal advices related to nutritional and physical exercise rehabilitation guidelines when taking care of 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and how these guidelines can relieve the mental and physical problems, improve immunity, and accelerate the recovery process of the patients. With the occurrence of new variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the nutritional and exercise rehabilitation guidelines implemented by FPs become indispensable to promote the recovery of Covid-19 patients and support a return to normal life.

TI  - Postinfarction left ventricular free wall rupture: a 17-year single-centre experience
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Left ventricular free wall rupture (LVFWR) is a catastrophic complication following acute myocardial infarction with an estimated incidence of 0.2-7.6% and mortality can be as high as 60%. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for morbidity and mortality in patients affected by LVFWR.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 35 patients who underwent surgery for LVFWR between January 2000 and December 2016 at our institution.
   RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 68.3 years. The in-hospital survival was 65.7% (n = 23), and 13% of survived patients presented with cardiac arrest. The following characteristics were associated with in-hospital mortality at univariable analysis: pre-existing hypertension (P = 0.02), need for inotropes (P = 0.02) and cardiac arrest (P < 0.0001) at presentation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P = 0.004), preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (P = 0.004), technique of LVFWR repair (P = 0.013), operation on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (P = 0.005) and postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (P = 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, cardiac arrest at presentation was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 2.352-59.063; P = 0.003). The overall mean postoperative follow-up was 8.3 +/- 1.3 years. Overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 53.2 +/- 8.6% and 49.1 +/- 8.9%, respectively. Among the survivors, only 6 (26.1%) patients died during follow-up with a 5-year and 10-year overall survival rate of 80.9 +/- 8.7% and 74.7 +/- 10%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a trend towards long-term benefit in patients surviving high-risk surgery for LVFWR repair. Considering the high lethality of LVFWR, the urgency and complexity of the primary surgical intervention early diagnosis and prompt surgery play a key role in the management of this complication.

TI  - One-year quality-of-life outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors by initial defibrillation provider
T2  - HEART
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the long-term functional and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors stratified by initial defibrillation provider. MethodsThis retrospective study included adult non-traumatic OHCA with initial shockable rhythms between 2010 and 2019. Survivors at 12 months after arrest were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews. Outcomes were identified using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and living and work status-related questions. Results6050 patients had initial shockable rhythms, 3211 (53.1%) had a pulse on hospital arrival, while 1879 (31.1%) were discharged alive. Bystander defibrillation using the closest automated external defibrillator had the highest survival rate (52.8%), followed by dispatched first responders (36.7%) and paramedics (27.9%). 1802 (29.8%) patients survived to 12-month postarrest; of these 1520 (84.4%) were interviewed. 1088 (71.6%) were initially shocked by paramedics, 271 (17.8%) by first responders and 161 (10.6%) by bystanders. Bystander-shocked survivors reported higher rates of living at home without care (87.5%, 75.2%, 77.0%, p<0.001), upper good recovery (GOS-E=8) (41.7%, 30.4%, 30.6%, p=0.002) and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) >= 80 (64.9%, 55.9%, 52.9%, p=0.003) compared with first responder and paramedics, respectively. After adjustment, initial bystander defibrillation was associated with higher odds of EQ-5D VAS >= 80 (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10; p=0.004), good functional recovery (GOS-E >= 7) (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.11; p=0.009), living at home without care (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.16-2.71; p=0.009) and returning to work (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.81; p=0.031) compared with paramedic defibrillation. ConclusionSurvivors receiving initial bystander defibrillation reported better functional and HRQoL outcomes at 12 months after arrest compared with those initially defibrillated by paramedics.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE EPINEPHRINE DOSE ADMINISTERED DURING HUMAN CPR ON HEMODYNAMIC, OXYGEN-TRANSPORT, AND UTILIZATION VARIABLES IN THE POSTRESUSCITATION PERIOD
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Background: Studies evaluating the dose of epinephrine required to optimize return of spontaneous circulation and survival after CPR have shown that doses greater than recommended by advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) improve coronary perfusion pressure and shortterm resuscitation rates. Since survival has not improved, it is possible that higher doses of epinephrine may be physiologically detrimental in the postresuscitation period.
   Objective: The object of this study is to measure the effect of the total cumulative dose of epinephrine given during ACLS on the hemodynamic, oxygen transport, and utilization variables in the postresuscitation period.
   Design: A prospective nonrandomized control trial of inception cohorts.
   Setting: A large urban emergency department and intensive care unit.
   Patients: Forty-nine successfully resuscitated witnessed, normothermic, nontraumatic, out-of-hospital patients, who had suffered cardiac arrests.
   Interventions: All patients were treated according to ACLS guidelines; however, the epinephrine dose (0.01 to 0.2 mg/kg or 1 to 14 mg) was selected at the clinician's discretion and given through central venous access every 3 to 5 min, Hemodynamic, oxygen transport, and utilization variables were measured on a return of spontaneous circulation, and at least every 30 min thereafter under a standardized postresuscitation protocol.
   Main outcome measures: Hemodynamic, oxygen transport/utilization variables, and mortality in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. The total cumulative dose of epinephrine given during ACLS until a return of spontaneous circulation was recorded.
   Results: A total cumulative epinephrine dose of 15 mg was found to best predict 24-h mortality. Of the 49 patients, 20 received less than 15 mg (group 1) and 29 received greater than 15 mg (group 2). Age, premorbid health status, sex, presenting rhythm, and duration of cardiac arrest were similar in both groups. The 24-h survival was 17 of 20 (85%) and 12 of 29 (41%) in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.002). Over the first 6 h of the postresuscitation period, both groups had similar mean arterial pressure (MAP), mixed venous oxygen saturation, and systemic oxygen extraction ratio (all p>0.1). Group 2, however, had a significantly lower cardiac index (CI), systemic oxygen consumption (VO2), and systemic oxygen delivery (DO2) (all p<0.01). Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), initial and 6-h lactic acid levels were significantly higher in group 2 (all p<0.03).
   Conclusions: The administration of all doses of epinephrine during the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with impairment of DO2 and VO2 in the postresuscitation period. Both duration and severity of these impairments correlate with the total cumulative epinephrine dose given during the resuscitation. Thus, inadvertent catecholamine toxicity represents a further complicating factor in the production of postresuscitation disease. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions addressed toward mitigating these potentially reversible adverse effects may impact morbidity and mortality in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

TI  - Phantom Scanning in Point-of-Care Ultrasound After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Impact of Clinical Presentation in a Single-Center Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Phantom scanning, defined as the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) without image archiving, occurs frequently in cardiac arrest and carries clinical, legal, and quality improvement consequences. Its association with clinical presentation following out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains understudied. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of phantom scanning in OHCA, stratified by clinical presentation and emergency department (ED) disposition. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of adult patients presenting with atraumatic OHCA. The primary outcome was phantom scanning among patients presenting with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in progress versus return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The secondary outcome compared phantom scanning between admitted patients versus those who died in the ED. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals evaluated associations. Results: Of 306 patients reviewed, 244 met inclusion criteria. POCUS was more likely with CPR in progress (OR = 3.58, 95% CI [2.08, 6.261, p < 0.001). Among patients who underwent POCUS, phantom scanning was more frequent with CPR in progress (OR = 3.15, 95% CI [1.49, 6.841, p = 0.002). POCUS was less likely among admitted patients (OR = 0.37, 95% CI [0.21, 0.661, p < 0.001), and phantom scanning was less common in this group (OR = 0.23, 95% CI [0.11, 0.471, p < 0.001). Differences in research should focus on strategies to reduce phantom scanning and promote adherence to POCUS best practices. (c) 2025 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Long-term neurological outcome after cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: To analyse the neurological status of survivors after cardiac arrest (CA) treated with hypothermia.
   Methods: We prospectively included all patients with CA treated with hypothermia at intensive care units (ICU) in two university hospitals and one regional hospital. All adult survivors at 6 months after CA, n = 48, were invited for neurological follow-up and 43 accepted. History, clinical status, ability testing and questionnaires were administered to screen for difficulties, including Assessment of Motor and Process Skills, Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination, Frontal Lobe Assessment Battery, EQ-VAS quality of life scale, Skane Sleep Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale, Self-reported Montgomery and Astrand Depression Rating Scale, Global Deterioration Scale, Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, and the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC).
   Results: No patient was found to be in a chronic vegetative state and all patients were living at home, one with extensive help. Thirty-six patients were in CPC1 at follow-up, and some degree of neurological sequelae was found in 40 patients, but was mild in all but 3. Three patients had no subjective complaints, nor could any deficits be detected. Initial defects improved over-time. Short-term memory loss, executive frontal lobe dysfunction along with mild depression and steep rhythm disturbances were the most common findings.
   Conclusions: Mild cognitive impairment is common following hypothermia-treated cardiac arrest but has little effect on activities of daily living or quality of life. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mechanical devices for cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review The most current practice guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation published by the American Heart Association and European Reuscitation Council have placed the highest priority on achieving the most optimal circulation possible following sudden cardiac arrest through the delivery of early, consistent, high-quality and infrequently interrupted chest compressions during reuscitative efforts. The purpose of this review is to analyze the most recent trials involving adjunct mechanical devices designed to optimize blood flow to vital organs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation conditions.
   Recent findings Six devices show substantial promise based on the compelling results of numerous animal and small-scale clinical trials. All these promising interventions, however, have yet to be validated in definitive clinical trials, particularly those examining long-term survival and neurological function.
   Summary Markedly enhanced circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts has been found to be a critical element for effecting successful resciscitation. Preliminary studies of adjunct mechanical cardiopulmonary rescuscitation devices have revealed significant increases in improved hemodynamics in both animal models and human studies, as well as improvements in short-term human survival in the clinical setting. Several of these devices are currently undergoing definitive clinical trials that hopefully will establish irrefutable efficacy and improved long-term neurological outcomes.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Effect of Automated External Defibrillator Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Protocol on Outcome From Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) that implement the Guidelines 2000 resuscitation protocol constrains administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to <50% of AED connection time. We tested a different AED protocol aimed at increasing the CPR administered to patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods and Results-In a randomized controlled trial, patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation were treated with 1 of 2 AED protocols. In the control protocol, based on Guidelines 2000, sequences of up to 3 stacked countershocks were delivered, with rhythm analyses initially and after the first and second shocks. The study protocol featured 1 minute of CPR before the first shock, shorter CPR interruptions before and after each shock, and no stacked shocks. The primary end point was survival to hospital admission. Of 5107 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients connected to an AED, 1238 required defibrillation, and 845 were included in the final analysis. Study patients (n<421) had shorter preshock pauses (9 versus 19 seconds; P<0.001), had shorter postshock pauses (11 versus 33 seconds; P<0.001), and received more CPR (61% versus 48%; P<0.001) and fewer shocks (2.5 versus 2.9; P<0.001) than control patients (n=424). Similar proportions survived to hospital admission (43.2% versus 42.7%; P=0.87), survived to hospital discharge (13.3% versus 10.6%; P=0.19), achieved return of spontaneous circulation before physician arrival (47.0% versus 48.6%; P=0.65), and survived to 1 year (P=0.77).
   Conclusions-Following prompts from AEDs programmed with a protocol similar to Guidelines 2005, firefighters shortened pauses in CPR and improved overall hands-on time, but survival to hospital admission of patients with ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest did not improve.

TI  - Expanding Spectrum of Desmin-Related Myopathy, Long-term Follow-up, and Cardiac Transplantation
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and Objectives We aimed to determine the genetic and clinical phenotypes of patients with desmin-related myopathy and long-term outcomes after cardiac transplantation. Methods We performed a retrospective review of cardiac and neurologic manifestations of patients with genetically confirmed desmin-related myopathy (January 1, 1999-January 1, 2020). Results Twenty-five patients in 20 different families were recognized. Median age at onset of symptoms was 20 (range 4-50) years; median follow-up time was 36 (range 1-156) months. Twelve patients initially presented with skeletal muscle involvement, and 13 presented with cardiac disease. Sixteen patients had both cardiac and skeletal muscle involvement. Clinically muscle weakness distribution was distal (n = 11), proximal (n = 4), or both (n = 7) in 22 patients. Skeletal muscle biopsy from patients with missense and splice site variants (n = 12) showed abnormal fibers containing amorphous material in Gomori trichrome-stained sections. Patients with cardiac involvement had atrioventricular conduction abnormalities or cardiomyopathy. The most common ECG abnormality was complete atrioventricular block in 11 patients, all of whom required a permanent pacemaker at a median age of 25 (range 16-48) years. Sudden cardiac death resulting in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks or resuscitation was reported in 3 patients; a total of 5 patients had ICDs. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in 3 patients at 20, 35, and 39 years of age. Discussion Pathogenic variants in desmin can lead to varied neurologic and cardiac phenotypes beginning at a young age. Two-thirds of the patients have both neurologic and cardiac symptoms, usually starting in the third decade. Heart transplantation was tolerated with improved cardiac function and quality of life.

TI  - Seconds Matter: Novel Transport Solutions in Urban Settings Reduce Transport Times
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requires immediate intervention to optimize survival and neurological outcomes. Rapid recognition and treatment are critical, especially in prehospital settings. Case Report: A 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest while riding a city bus. Bystanders activated Emergency Medical Services (EMS), who promptly initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Due to the patient's proximity to a tertiary care STEMI center, EMS made the unconventional decision to continue resuscitative efforts en route using the city bus, bypassing traditional ambulance transport. Upon arrival, she underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieved full neurological recovery. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: This case illustrates the importance of flexibility and innovation in prehospital care. However, it also highlights the need to balance innovation with adherence to EMS safety protocols and statutory requirements. Uninterrupted CPR, rapid defibrillation, and expedited transport-even via unconventional means-can dramatically impact outcomes in STEMI-related cardiac arrest, but such strategies must always be weighed against provider and patient safety.

TI  - Mobile applications enhance out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction Mobile applications, as innovative tools for promoting bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), have demonstrated potential to improve outcomes for patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This meta-analysis sought to systematically review the technical features of existing mobile applications and evaluate their impact on OHCA patient outcomes under various emergency response strategies. The findings aimed to guide the development and optimization of prehospital public emergency response systems. Methods A systematic search was conducted in databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to August 2023. The included studies involved notifying citizens via text messages or smartphone applications to act as first responders or volunteers in OHCA cases. Using a random effects model and subgroup analysis, we synthesized the results to identify sources of heterogeneity and assess outcomes. Results Thirteen mobile applications were included, with an average activation rate of 35.3% among patients and a volunteer arrival rate of 53.3%. Compared to traditional emergency medical services, mobile applications significantly improved survival to discharge or 30-day survival rates (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.44; P < 0.05), return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rates upon hospital admission (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40; P < 0.05), bystander CPR rates (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.13-1.37; P < 0.05), and bystander defibrillation rates (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00-1.51; P = 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent results for bystander CPR rates and survival outcomes, while variations in defibrillation rates and ROSC at admission were observed, indicating potential influences of application design and operational parameters. Conclusions This study highlighted the significant potential of mobile applications in enhancing bystander interventions and improving patient outcomes. Addressing challenges such as improving access to automated external defibrillators and raising public awareness remained essential to maximizing their overall effectiveness.

TI  - Infectious complications in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in the therapeutic hypothermia era
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Infectious complications are frequently reported in critically ill patients, especially after cardiac arrest. Recent and widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia has raised concerns about increased septic complications, but no specific reappraisal has been performed. We investigated the infectious complications in cardiac arrest survivors and assessed their impact on morbidity and long-term outcome.
   Design: Retrospective review of a prospectively acquired intensive care unit database.
   Setting: A 24-bed medical intensive care unit in a French university hospital.
   Patients: Between March 2004 and March 2008, consecutive patients admitted for management of resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were considered. Patients dying within 24 hrs were excluded. All patients' files were reviewed to assess the development of infection.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of the 537 patients admitted after cardiac arrest, 421 were included and 281 patients (67%) presented 373 infectious complications. Pneumonia was the most frequent (318 episodes), followed by bloodstream infections (35 episodes) and catheter-related infections (11 episodes). When grouped together, Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated infectious germs (64%), but the main pathogen detected was Staphylococcus aureus (57 occurrences). Both application itself (83 vs. 73%; p = .02) and duration (1244 vs. 1176 mins; p = .05) of therapeutic hypothermia were significantly more frequent in infected patients. Infection was associated with increased mechanical ventilation duration (6 [2-9] vs. 3 [2-5.5] days; p < .001) and intensive care unit length of stay (7 [4-10] vs. 3 [2-7] days; p < .001). Nonetheless, there was no impact on intensive care unit mortality (174 [62%] vs. 92 [66%] patients; p = .45) or on favorable neurologic outcome (cerebral performance category 1-2, 102 [36%] vs. 47 [34%] patients; p = .58).
   Conclusions: Infectious complications are frequent after cardiac arrest and may be even more frequent after therapeutic hypothermia. Despite increase in care costs, long-term and clinically relevant outcomes do not seem to be impaired. This should not discourage the use of therapeutic hypothermia in cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - Long-term outcome after surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Introduction: Traumatic chest wall injuries are common however the incidence of non-union rib fractures is unknown. Previous studies have suggested that surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures could be beneficial in selected patients, although many experience persisting pain despite surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term outcome after surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study including adults (>= 18 years) managed surgically for symptomatic nonunion rib fractures with plate fixation during the period 2010-2020 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Patients operated for acute chest wall injury or injury due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded. Patients answered standardized questionnaires concerning remaining symptoms and satisfaction with surgery, quality of life (QoL, EQ-5D-5 L) and disability (Disability Rating Index, DRI). Lung function, movement of chest wall and thoracic spine, and shoulder function (Bostro center dot m index) were assessed. Results: Sixteen patients, 12 men and four women, with mean age 61.6 +/- 11.1 were included in the study. The mechanism of injury was trauma in 10 patients and cough -induced injuries in five patients. Lung disease was significantly more prevalent in cough -induced injuries compared to traumatic injuries, 5 vs 1 (p = 0.008). The mean follow-up time was 3.5 years. Ninety-four percent were satisfied with the surgery and reported that their symptoms had decreased, although 69 % had remaining symptoms, especially pain, from the chest wall. Quality of Life was decreased with EQ-5D-5 L index 0.819 (0.477-0.976) and EQ-VAS 69 (10-100). Disability Rating Index was 31.5 (1.3-76.7) with problems running, lifting heavy objects, and performing heavy work. Predicted lung function was decreased with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) 86.2 +/- 14.2 %, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) 79.1 +/- 10.7 % and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) 89.7 +/- 14.5 %. Patients with cough -induced injuries had full shoulder mobility. Conclusions: Chest wall surgery for symptomatic non-union rib fractures results in decreased symptoms and patient satisfaction in most cases despite remaining symptoms, reduced lung function, chest wall movement, and QoL and persistent disability.

TI  - Ethical Considerations for Patients Requiring Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
AB  - Immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can significantly improve survival chances. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during CPR (eCPR) could further enhance survival rates. Current evidence supports the implementation of eCPR as a part of the Advanced Life Support protocol, which may positively affect survival and long-term neurological outcomes and provide additional time for diagnosing and treating the underlying cause of cardiac arrest. Based on the patient's potential for recovery and neurological outcome, multidisciplinary teams can pursue weaning of the patient from mechanical support or withdrawal of care in the case of an unfavorable outcome. These decisions should align with the patient's values, prognosis, and ethical guidelines. A healthcare system that actively promotes eCPR as a standardized part of every Advanced Life Support protocol may face challenges, such as an increased number of patients requiring constant care in long-term care facilities. This could potentially lead to a reduced quality of life and create burdens on patients, families, the healthcare system, and society. Furthermore, in cases of potential organ donation, the principles of beneficence and autonomy may place healthcare providers in significant ethical dilemmas. Given the potential for eCPR to become a standard of care for eligible patients, this work focuses on the ethical and social implications, as well as the impact on the healthcare system.

TI  - Outcomes after fixation of rib fractures sustained during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A retrospective single center analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundHistorically rib fractures have been typically treated non-operatively. Recent studies showed promising results after osteosynthesis of rib fractures in trauma patients with flail segments or multiple rib fractures. However, there is a paucity of data on rib fixation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study evaluated the outcomes of patients who received rib fixation after CPR. MethodsAdult patients who received surgical fixation of rib fractures sustained during CPR between 2010 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. Outcome measures included complications, quality of life (EQ 5D 5L) and level of dyspnea. ResultsNineteen patients were included with a mean age of 66.8 years. The mean number of fractured ribs was ten, seven patients additionally had a sternum fracture. Pneumonia occurred in 15 patients (74%), of which 13 were diagnosed preoperatively and 2 post-operatively. Six patients developed a postoperative pneumothorax, none of which required revision surgery. One patient showed persistent flail chest after rib fixation and required additional fixation of a concomitant sternum fracture. One infection of the surgical site of sternal plate occurred, while no further surgery related complications were reported. Mean EQ-5D-5L was 0.908 and the average EQ VAS was 80. One patient reported persisting dyspnea. ConclusionTo date, this is the largest reported cohort of patients who received rib fixation for fractures sustained during CPR. No complications associated with rib fixation were reported whereas one infection after sternal fixation did occur. Current follow-up demonstrated a good long-term quality of life after fixation, warranting further studies on this topic. Deeper knowledge on this subject would be beneficial for a wide spectrum of physicians.

TI  - A Structured Tool for Communication and Care Planning in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION
AB  - Residents in long-term care settings are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infections and, compared to younger adults, are at higher risk of poor outcomes and death. Given the poor prognosis of resuscitation outcomes for COVID-19 in general, the specter of COVID-19 in long-term care residents should prompt revisiting goals of care. Visitor restriction policies enacted to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to long-term care residents requires advance care planning discussions to be conducted remotely. A structured approach can help guide discussions regarding the diagnosis, expected course, and care of individuals with COVID-19 in long-term care settings. Information should be shared in a transparent and comprehensive manner to allay the increased anxiety that families may feel during this time. To achieve this, we propose an evidence-based COVID-19 Communication and Care Planning Tool that allows for an informed consent process and shared decision making between the clinician, resident, and their family.

TI  - Post-discharge outcomes after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A ROC PRIMED substudy
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Importance: Assessment of morbidity is an important component of evaluating interventions for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Objective: We evaluated among survivors of OHCA cognition, functional status, health-related quality of life and depression as functions of patient and emergency medical services (EMS) factors.
   Design: Prospective cohort sub-study of a randomized trial.
   Setting: The parent trial studied two comparisons in persons with non-traumatic OHCA treated by EMS personnel participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium.
   Participants: Consenting survivors to discharge.
   Main outcome measures: Telephone assessments up to 6 months after discharge included neurologic function (modified Rankin score, MRS), cognitive impairment (Adult Lifestyle and Function Mini Mental Status Examination, ALFI-MMSE), health-related quality of life (Health Utilities Index Mark 3, HUI3) and depression (Telephone Geriatric Depression Scale, T-GDS).
   Results: Of 15,794 patients enrolled in the parent trial, 729 (56% of survivors) consented. About 644 respondents (88% of consented) completed >= 1 assessment. Likelihood of assessment was associated with baseline characteristics and study site. Most respondents had MRS <= 3 (82.7%), no cognitive impairment (82.7% ALFI-MMSE >= 17), no severe impairment in health (71.6%, HUI3 >= 0.7) and no depression (90.1% T-GDS <= 10). Outcomes did not differ by trial intervention or time from hospital discharge.
   Conclusions and relevance: The majority of patients in this large cohort who survived cardiac arrest and were interviewed had no, mild or moderate health impairment. Concern about poor quality of life is not a valid reason to abandon efforts to improve an EMS system's response to cardiac arrest. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - A randomized trial of expedited intra-arrest transfer versus more extended on-scene resuscitation for refractory out of hospital cardiac arrest: Rationale and design of the EVIDENCE trial
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Refractory Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (r-OHCA) is common and the benefit versus harm of intra-arrest transport of patients to hospital is not clear.Objective To assess the rate of survival to hospital discharge in adult patients with r-OHCA, initial rhythm pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) or Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) treated with 1 of 2 locally accepted standards of care:1 expedited transport from scene; or2 ongoing advanced life support (ALS) resuscitation on-scene.Hypothesis We hypothesize that expedited transport from scene in r-OHCA improves survival with favorable neuro-logical status/outcome. Methods/Design Phase III, multi-center, partially blinded, prospective, intention-to-treat, safety and efficacy clinical trial with contemporaneous registry of patient ineligible for the clinical trial. Eligible patients for inclusion are adults with witnessed r-OHCA; estimated age 18 to 70, assumed medical cause with immediate bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); initial rhythm of VF/pulseless VT, or PEA; no return of spontaneous circulation following 3 shocks and/or 15 minutes of professional on-scene resuscitation; with mechanical CPR available. Two hundred patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either expedited transport from scene or ongoing ALS at the scene of cardiac arrest.Setting Two urban regions in NSW Australia.Outcomes Primar y: sur vival to hospital discharge with cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2. Secondary: safety, survival, prognostic factors, use of ECMO supported CPR and functional assessment at hospital discharge and 4 weeks and 6 months, quality of life, healthcare use and cost-effectiveness.Conclusions The EVIDENCE trial will determine the potential risks and benefits of an expedited transport from scene of cardiac arrest.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support in therapy-refractory cardiocirculatory failure: looking beyond 30 days
T2  - INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Venoarterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has emerged as a potentially life-saving treatment option in therapy-refractory cardiocirculatory failure, but longer-term outcome is poorly defined. Here, we present a comprehensive follow-up analysis covering all major organ systems.
   METHODS: From February 2012 to December 2016, 180 patients were treated with ECLS for therapy-refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. The 30-day survival was 43.9%, and 30-day survivors (n = 79) underwent follow-up analysis with the assessment of medium-term survival, quality of life, neuropsychological, cardiopulmonary and end-organ status.
   RESULTS: After a median of 1.9 (1.1-3.6) years (182.4 patient years), 45 of the 79 patients (57.0%) were alive, 35.4% had died and 7.6% were lost to follow-up. Follow-up survival estimates were 78.0% at 1, 61.2% at 3 and 55.1% at 5 years. NYHA class at follow-up was <= 11 for 83.3%. The median creatinine was 1.1 (1.0-1.4) mg/dl, and the median bilirubin was 0.8 (0.5-1.0) mg/dl. No patient required dialysis. Overall, 94.4% were free from moderate or severe disability, although 11.1% needed care. Full re-integration into social life was reported by 58.3%, and 39.4% were working. Quality of life was favourable for mental components, but a subset showed deficits in physical aspects. While age was the only peri-implantation parameter significantly predicting medium-term survival, adverse events and functional status at discharge or 30 days were strong predictors.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates positive medium-term outcome with high rates of independence in daily life and self-care but a subset of 10-20% suffered from sustained impairments. Our results indicate that peri-implantation parameters lack predictive power but downstream morbidity and functional status at discharge or 30 days can help identify patients at risk for poor recovery.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of a community first responder system for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Belgium
T2  - OPEN HEART
AB  - Objective Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health challenge across Europe, with a survival rate of only 8.5% to hospital discharge. Implementing a community first responder (CFR) system, including earlier Basic Life Support and defibrillation, can enhance survival rates and neurological outcomes. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of two scenarios for implementing such a system in Belgium.Methods A decision tree and the long-term Markov model were used to evaluate cost-effectiveness by comparing two scenarios with current care standards. Scenario 1 involved an awareness campaign on OHCA, while Scenario 2 included implementing a CFR system with automated external defibrillator (AED) integration, dispatch centre linkage and training for citizen responders. The analysis covered survival to the emergency department, hospital, discharge and neurologically intact survival, with sensitivity analyses to test robustness.Results The awareness campaign and implementation of the CFR system resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>14,976 and <euro>16,442 per quality-adjusted life year gained for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Both scenarios showed improvements in survival rates at various stages, including hospital discharge and neurologically intact survival.Conclusion This study highlights the benefits of enhancing Belgium's CFR for OHCA patients. It suggests that accessible AEDs, trained CFRs and an integrated emergency response system could improve survival rates and quality of life. These findings can guide policy and resource decisions, potentially improving the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of OHCA emergency services. Additionally, this approach could serve as a model for other regions aiming to strengthen their response to time-sensitive emergencies.

TI  - Cardiac arrest with refractory ventricular fibrillation: a successful resuscitation using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of a mechanical cardiopulmonary life-support system and an adjunct to prolonged cardiac resuscitation. The ECMO results in good outcomes for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. We present a case of a 52-year-old man with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by refractory ventricular fibrillation. The patient was referred to our emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation was refractory to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In this case, the ECMO-cardiopulmonary resuscitation provided cardiopulmonary life support for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, achieving a sustained return of spontaneous circulation that allowed prompt percutaneous coronary intervention and a good recovery.

TI  - OUTCOMES OF ELDERLY PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: A 7-YEAR ANALYSIS ABSTRACT
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF GERIATRICS-TURK GERIATRI DERGISI
AB  - Introduction: We aimed to analyze demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients aged 65 years and older who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Materials and Method: Data of eldery patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitaion in the emergency department between January 2013 and December 2019 were scanned retrospectively. Patients characteristics, cardiac arrest location, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed.
   Results: In total, 224 patients with mean age of 76.51 +/- 8.23 years. A return of spontaneous circulation rate was 46.4%, and the 30-day survival rate was 7.6%. A return of spontaneous circulation rate was decreased with age. Some 86.7% of the patients had at least one comorbidity and cancer was the most common. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 33.28 +/- 22.16 minutes. The mean cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration in the patients who had an return of spontaneous circulation and survived was significantly lower. The pH and lactate values of the patients were found to be statistically different in patients who had a return of spontaneous circulation. The most common cardiac arrest cause was infectious diseases in 72 (32.1%) patients and the most common diagnosis in living patients was cardiac causes.
   Conclusion: As the number of elderly individuals increases, and the number of comorbidities increase, the number of emergency department admissions as well as the incidence of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest will also increase in parallel with the increase in life expectancy.

TI  - National trends in utilization and outcomes of extracorporeal support for in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has shown promise in the management of cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends and predictors of ECLS utilization and survival to discharge among inpatients with cardiac arrest in the United States.
   Methods: All patients admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and those who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) from 2005 to 2014 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample. Patients carrying a pregnancy as well as those with do-not-resuscitate orders or trauma-related diagnoses were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ECLS utilization and survival to discharge.
   Results: An estimated 1,624,827 patients were identified. During the study period, use of ECLS increased from 77 to 564 per 100,000 arrests for OHCA, and 60 to 632 per 100,000 arrests for IHCA. Survival among patients on ECLS for OHCA and IHCA increased from 34.2% to 54.2% and from 4.7% to 19.2%, respectively. Age, year of arrest, cardiac rhythm, and the presence of a potentially reversible etiology including myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, were predictive of ECLS utilization. Among patients placed on ECLS, age, rhythm at arrest, and location of arrest were predictive of survival to discharge.
   Conclusions: Mortality after cardiac arrest for those on ECLS has substantially decreased. Younger age, shockable rhythm, and out-of-hospital arrest location were predictive of survival or utilization. As ECLS use increases, it is critical to define selection criteria that maximize the benefits of ECLS.

TI  - Long-Term Morbidities in Children with Critical Illness: Gaps and Opportunities
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: Improved mortality rates in paediatric critical care may come with the cost of increased morbidity. Goals of modern paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management should focus on restoring long-term function of paediatric critical illness survivors. This review outlines our current knowledge on trajectories and risk factors of long-term morbidities in PICU survivors. Specifically, we aimed to identify current limitations and gaps in this area so as to identify opportunities for future investigations to reduce the burden of morbidities in these children. Materials and Methods: A review of primary studies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases in the last decade (2008-2017) describing long-term morbidities in PICU survivors was conducted. Results: Children surviving critical illness continue to experience morbidities after discharge. A set of risk factors modify their long-term trajectories of recovery, with some children achieving their premorbid level of function, while some others deteriorate or die. Limitations in current methodologies of morbidity research impair our understanding on the causes of these morbidities. Opportunities for future endeavours to reduce the burden of these morbidities include identifying patients who are more likely to develop morbidities, evaluating the efficacy of early rehabilitation, identifying patients who might benefit from tight glycaemic control, characterising the optimal nutritional intervention, and improving management of increased intracranial pressure. Conclusion: Survivors of paediatric critical illness experience differing trajectories of recovery from morbidities. Future research is needed to expand our repertoire on management strategies to improve long-term function in these children.

TI  - The long-term outcome in surviving infants with Apgar zero at 10 minutes: a systematic review of the literature and hospital-based cohort
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of infants who had Apgar scores of zero at 10 minutes and were resuscitated successfully.
   STUDY DESIGN: The literature was reviewed systematically to identify the outcomes of cases; in addition, the perinatal database at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, was used to identify similar cases. Eligible infants were identified through hospital records, and outcomes of all infants with an Apgar score of zero at 10 minutes, who were born between January 1991 and December 2004, were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Eighty-five cases were identified from the literature. With the Oxford database, 9 of 83,065 infants ( 0.12/1000 births) met our study criteria. Six of the 9 infants died before leaving hospital. One infant with severe quadriparesis and microcephaly died at 11 months of age. One infant at follow-up examination at 5 years had severe spastic quadriparesis with severe global delay. One infant with grade 2 hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, who was born with severe anemia that was corrected promptly at birth, had mild disability at follow-up examination at 2 years. Thus, death or severe disability occurred in 8 of 9 infants. Combining the results of metaanalysis of published data with our results of 94 infants, 88 infants ( 94%) either died or were handicapped severely; 2 infants (2%) were handicapped moderately, and 1 infant (1%) was handicapped mildly. For 3 infants (3%), the long-term outcome could not be determined.
   The outcome of infants with an Apgar score of zero at 10 minutes is almost universally poor.

TI  - Target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest-a randomized, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial-rationale and design
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Experimental animal studies and previous randomized trials suggest an improvement in mortality and neurologic function with induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest. International guidelines advocate the use of a target temperature management of 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C for 12 to 24 hours after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A systematic review indicates that the evidence for recommending this intervention is inconclusive, and the GRADE level of evidence is low. Previous trials were small, with high risk of bias, evaluated select populations, and did not treat hyperthermia in the control groups. The optimal target temperature management strategy is not known.
   Methods The TTM trial is an investigator-initiated, international, randomized, parallel-group, and assessor-blinded clinical trial designed to enroll at least 850 adult, unconscious patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac cause. The patients will be randomized to a target temperature management of either 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C after return of spontaneous circulation. In both groups, the intervention will last 36 hours. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up. The main secondary outcomes are the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and poor neurologic function (cerebral performance categories 3 and 4) at hospital discharge and at 180 days, cognitive status and quality of life at 180 days, assessment of safety and harm.
   Discussion The TTM trial will investigate potential benefit and harm of 2 target temperature strategies, both avoiding hyperthermia in a large proportion of the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest population. (Am Heart J 2012; 163:541-8.)

TI  - Variability in functional outcome and treatment practices by treatment center after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: analysis of International Cardiac Arrest Registry
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - PurposeFunctional outcomes vary between centers after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and are partially explained by pre-existing health status and arrest characteristics, while the effects of in-hospital treatments on functional outcome are less understood. We examined variation in functional outcomes by center after adjusting for patient- and arrest-specific characteristics and evaluated how in-hospital management differs between high- and low-performing centers.MethodsAnalysis of observational registry data within the International Cardiac Arrest Registry was used to perform a hierarchical model of center-specific risk standardized rates for good outcome, adjusted for demographics, pre-existing functional status, and arrest-related factors with treatment center as a random effect variable. We described the variability in treatments and diagnostic tests that may influence outcome at centers with adjusted rates significantly above and below registry average. ResultsA total of 3855 patients were admitted to an ICU following cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation. The overall prevalence of good outcome was 11-63% among centers. After adjustment, center-specific risk standardized rates for good functional outcome ranged from 0.47 (0.37-0.58) to 0.20 (0.12-0.26). High-performing centers had faster time to goal temperature, were more likely to have goal temperature of 33 degrees C, more likely to perform unconscious cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention, and had differing prognostication practices than low-performing centers. ConclusionsCenter-specific differences in outcomes after OHCA after adjusting for patient-specific factors exist. This variation could partially be explained by in-hospital management differences. Future research should address the contribution of these factors to the differences in outcomes after resuscitation.

TI  - Identification of Factors Associated with Return of Spontaneous Circulation after Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Natural Language Processing
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Introduction Prior studies examining prehospital characteristics related to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are limited to structured data. Natural language processing (NLP) could identify new factors from unstructured data using free-text narratives. The purpose of this study was to use NLP to examine EMS clinician free-text narratives for characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of patients ages 0-17 with OHCA in 2019 from the ESO Data Collaborative. We performed an exploratory analysis of EMS narratives using NLP with an a priori token library. We then constructed biostatistical and machine learning models and compared their performance in predicting ROSC. Results There were 1,726 included EMS encounters for pediatric OHCA; 60% were male patients, and the median age was 1 year (IQR 0-9). Most cardiac arrest events (61.3%) were unwitnessed, 87.3% were identified as having medical causes, and 5.9% had initial shockable rhythms. Prehospital ROSC was achieved in 23.1%. Words most positively correlated with ROSC were "ROSC" (r = 0.42), "pulse" (r = 0.29), "drowning" (r = 0.13), and "PEA" (r = 0.12). Words negatively correlated with ROSC included "asystole" (r = -0.25), "lividity" (r = -0.14), and "cold" (r = -0.14). The terms "asystole," "pulse," "no breathing," "PEA," and "dry" had the greatest difference in frequency of appearance between encounters with and without ROSC (p < 0.05). The best-performing model for predicting prehospital ROSC was logistic regression with random oversampling using free-text data only (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92). Conclusions EMS clinician free-text narratives reveal additional characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Incorporating those terms into machine learning models of prehospital ROSC improves predictive ability. Therefore, NLP holds promise as a tool for use in predictive models with the goal to increase evidence-based management of pediatric OHCA.

TI  - Improving Survival after Cardiac Arrest
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Each year, approximately half a million people suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) in Europe: The majority die. Survival after CA varies greatly between regions and countries. The authors give an overview of the important elements necessary to promote improved survival after CA as a function of the chain of survival and formula for survival concepts. The chain of survival incorporates bystanders (who identify warning symptoms, call the emergency dispatch center, initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]), dispatchers (who identify CA, and instruct and reassure the caller), first responders (who provide high-quality CPR, early defibrillation), paramedics and other prehospital care providers (who continue high-quality CPR, and provide timely defibrillation and advanced life support, transport to CA center), and hospitals (targeted temperature management, percutaneous coronary intervention, delayed prognostication). The formula for survival concept consists of (1) medical science (international guidelines), (2) educational efficiency (e.g., low-dose, high-frequency training for lay people, first responders, and professionals; and (3) local implementation of all factors in the chain of survival and formula for survival. Survival rates after CA can be advanced through the improvement of the different factors in both the chain of survival and the formula for survival. Importantly, the neurologic outcome in the majority of CA survivors has continued to improve.

TI  - Predictors of Survival From Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
CP  - Scientific Research Forum of the American-College-of-Emergency-Physicians
AB  - Background-Prior studies have identified key predictors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but differences exist in the magnitude of these findings. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the strength of associations between OHCA and key factors (event witnessed by a bystander or emergency medical services [EMS], provision of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], initial cardiac rhythm, or the return of spontaneous circulation). We also examined trends in OHCA survival over time.
   Methods and Results-An electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane DSR, DARE, ACP Journal Club, and CCTR was conducted (January 1, 1950 to August 21, 2008) for studies reporting OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology in adults. Data were extracted from 79 studies involving 142 740 patients. The pooled survival rate to hospital admission was 23.8% (95% CI, 21.1 to 26.6) and to hospital discharge was 7.6% (95% CI, 6.7 to 8.4). Stratified by baseline rates, survival to hospital discharge was more likely among those: witnessed by a bystander (6.4% to 13.5%), witnessed by EMS (4.9% to 18.2%), who received bystander CPR (3.9% to 16.1%), were found in ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (14.8% to 23.0%), or achieved return of spontaneous circulation (15.5% to 33.6%). Although 53% (95% CI, 45.0% to 59.9%) of events were witnessed by a bystander, only 32% (95% CI, 26.7% to 37.8%) received bystander CPR. The number needed to treat to save 1 life ranged from 16 to 23 for EMS-witnessed arrests, 17 to 71 for bystander-witnessed, and 24 to 36 for those receiving bystander CPR, depending on baseline survival rates. The aggregate survival rate of OHCA (7.6%) has not significantly changed in almost 3 decades.
   Conclusions-Overall survival from OHCA has been stable for almost 30 years, as have the strong associations between key predictors and survival. Because most OHCA events are witnessed, efforts to improve survival should focus on prompt delivery of interventions of known effectiveness by those who witness the event.

TI  - Quality of life and cardiorespiratory function in chronic heart failure: Effects of 12 months' aerobic training
T2  - HEART
AB  - Objective-To examine the long-term benefits and safety of aerobic training in patients with chronic heart failure.
   Design-Non-randomised control trial with 52 weeks follow up.
   Setting-Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation referral centre.
   Patients-Patients with compensated chronic heart failure (mean (SD) age 62 (6) years, New York Heart Association stage III, initial resting ejection fraction 22 (7)%). Experimental group of 17 men, 4 women; control group 8 men, 1 woman.
   Interventions-Experimental group: progressive, supervised aerobic walking programme for 52 weeks. Control group: standard medical treatment.
   Main outcome measures-Six-minute walk distance, progressive cycle ergometer test to subjective exhaustion, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, and standard gamble test, all measured at entry, 4, 8, 12, 16, 26, and 52 weeks.
   Results-Control data showed no changes except a small trend to improved emotional function (P = 0.02 at 12 weeks only). Fifteen of the 21 patients completed all 52 weeks of aerobic training; two withdrew for non-cardiac reasons (16, 52 weeks). Three were withdrawn because of worsening cardiac failure unrelated to their exercise participation (4, 4, 8 weeks), and one had a non-fatal cardiac arrest while shopping (16 weeks). Gains of cardiorespiratory function plateaued at 16-26 weeks, with 10-15% improvement in six-minute walk, peak power output, and peak oxygen intake linked to gains in oxygen pulse and ventilatory threshold and reductions in resting heart rate. Marked improvements in quality of life followed a parallel course.
   Conclusions-Aerobic training is safe and beneficial in compensated chronic heart failure. Gains in aerobic function and quality of life persisted over a programme lasting 52 weeks.

TI  - Early cognitive and emotional outcome after stroke is independent of discharge destination
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and purpose Cognitive and emotional problems occur frequently after stroke. Patients with minor stroke are more likely to be discharged home. This paper compares early cognitive and emotional outcomes in patients discharged home after stroke versus patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation, and examines the effect of cognitive and emotional outcomes on long-term participation. Methods In this multicenter prospective cohort study, patients with stroke were assessed at two months with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Checklist for Cognitive and Emotional Consequences following Stroke (CLCE-24) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). One year post stroke, participation was assessed with the Restriction subscale of the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P Restriction). Results The study included 332 patients. Two months post stroke, anxiety and cognitive problems were equally prevalent among patients discharged home (n = 243; 73%) and patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (n = 89; 27%) (HADS-A = 4.8 +/- 3.9 versus 4.6 +/- 4.0,p = 0.747; MoCA < 26: 66.7% versus 70.8%,p = 0.477; CLCE-cognition = 3.0 +/- 2.9 versus 3.3 +/- 2.8,p = 0.499). Depressive symptoms were less severe in patients discharged home (HADS-D = 4.3 +/- 3.9 versus 5.5 +/- 3.8,p = 0.010). In patients discharged home, cognitive complaints were predictive of long-term participation (B = - 2.03; 95% CI - 3.15, - 0.90), while cognitive or emotional outcomes were not predictive in patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. Conclusions Cognitive and emotional problems at two months post stroke were comparable between patients discharged home and those discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. For patients discharged home, cognitive complaints were predictive of long-term participation.

TI  - Case Report: Allograft aortic valve replacement in irreparable infant mitral valve
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - This case report describes a 3-month-old male infant diagnosed with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) by transthoracic echocardiography. The male infant initially underwent complex mitral valve repair surgery. However, postoperative deterioration occurred with hemodynamic instability and shock, necessitating multiple resuscitation efforts and ultimately requiring support from Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Given the serious conditions, the cardiac team decided to perform mitral valve replacement with a fresh allograft aortic valve. Postoperatively, the patient was promptly weaned off ECMO support, and the valve demonstrated sustained functionality throughout the long-term follow-up.

TI  - QT-INTERVAL VARIABILITY IN HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY PATIENTS WITH CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - We studied long-term variability of QT-dispersion in three patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Maron III) and ventricular fibrillation. Late potentials were absent on signal-averaged electrocardiogram. ST-segment depression was recorded in all three patients at Holter monitoring, and in two during exercise stress testing, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was present in only one patient. The maximal correct QT-interval and corrected QT-dispersion (QT(cd)) were measured retrospectively, both off-drug and under treatment with amiodarone and beta-blocker (two patients), or sotalol alone (one patient). Ten age- and sex-matched normal subjects, and 13 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients without ventricular arrhythmias formed the control groups. QT(cd)-values in the control groups never exceeded 80 ms and mean values of 30.1 +/- 10.1 ms and 44.1 +/- 7.9 ms respectively, were found. During long-term follow-up, QT(cd) increased progressively in two of the three patients with ventricular fibrillation, and at the time of the event all showed a value > 100 ms. Sotalol, but not the amiodarone reduced QT(cd). QT(cd) seems to be a powerful predictor of ventricular electrical instability in the absence of other specific markers, and a promising guide for effective pharmacological therapy.

TI  - Cognitive function and quality of life after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Studies on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) use overall performance category (OPC)/cerebral performance category (CPC) as outcome. We studied quality of life, neuro-cognitive functioning and independency in daily life of patients and strain of caregivers 6-12 months after cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Two hundred and twenty patients (>18 year) who survived 6-12 months after OHCA and relatives were interviewed by telephone with validated questionnaires (Short-form Health Survey) (SF-12), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), telephonic interview cognitive status (TICS) and Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and compared with OPC and CPC at discharge. SF-12 of elderly (>= 80 years) was compared to an open Dutch population of >= 80 years.
   Results: Of all patients, 45% had normal physical and 90% had normal mental SF-12. Eighty-one percent had a normal MRS (MRS <= 2). Eighty-four percent had normal TICS. Compared to the reference population, elderly scored 40.5 on the mental and 53.2 on the physical SF-12, while the reference population scored 38.1 (theta = 0.20) and 54.4 (theta = -0.15), respectively, (n.s.) Of the patients with OPC <= 2 and CPC <= 2 at discharge 15% scored MRS 3-5 and 15% abnormal TICS at follow-up, respectively. Ninety-two percent of all patients gave their quality of life a value of >= 6 (maximum 10). Patients treated with hypothermia scored on most health outcomes similar to those who did not need such treatment. Sixteen percent of caregivers experienced strain, correlating significantly with TICS of patients.
   Conclusion: The great majority of survivors have normal functioning and cognition 6-12 months after OHCA.

TI  - The outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest - a narrative review
T2  - CONTEMPORARY NURSE
AB  - BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors often face physical, cognitive, and psychosocial challenges that reduce health-related quality of life. While cardiac rehabilitation programs aim to aid recovery, their effectiveness in improving health-related quality of life for Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors remains uncertain.AimThis narrative review evaluates the impact of cardiac rehabilitation and tailored rehabilitation programs on the health-related quality of life of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors during their first year of recovery.MethodsA literature review on cardiac rehabilitation was conducted using four databases (MEDLINE Complete, CINAHL, Scopus, and Embase). The review focused on studies published between 2014 and 2024. The inclusion criteria specified out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors aged eighteen years and older who were engaged in rehabilitation post-hospital discharge. A narrative review was conducted, adhering to the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. The database searches initially identified 365 articles, which were reduced to 347 after removing duplicates and non-English articles. Subsequent screening of titles and abstracts excluded 333 studies, leaving 57 full-text articles for further consideration. Ultimately, 14 studies were included.ResultsTraditional cardiac rehabilitation programs showed limited improvement in health-related quality of life, particularly in addressing cognitive and emotional needs. Tailored interventions, incorporating cognitive and emotional cardiac rehabilitation programs, multidisciplinary teams, and peer support, demonstrated better health-related quality of life outcomes, though physical health differences were minimal. Challenges in societal reintegration and return to work remained unaddressed by both approaches.ConclusionPerson-centred, evidence-based rehabilitation programs addressing cognitive, emotional, and societal challenges are essential for improving the health-related quality of life of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors. Further research is needed to establish robust guidelines and optimise outcomes for this vulnerable population.

TI  - The role of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: what the evidence tells us
T2  - HELLENIC JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global public health problem. Lay bystanders witness almost half of OHCA, so early recognition is critical to allow immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by the bystander. The present investigation aims to analyze the most recent scientific evidence of the effect of bystander CPR on survival after an OHCA. A systematic literature review was carried out at the "Web of Science," "Scopus," and "PubMed" databases, including publications from the last 20 years. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 37 articles were identified. Results indicate that patients who receive CPR are more likely to survive than those who don't, and CPR is associated with a good quality of life post-OHCA. Emphasis should be placed on practicing chest compressions only when the bystander has not mastered the artificial ventilation technique. Finding an AED is the first step to using it in an OHCA situation. Correct use of an AED by laypeople is associated with nearly double the survival rate after an OHCA when compared to standard CPR. It is important to promote CPR and AED training to non-professionals, such as community residents and youth, as training is associated with higher success rates of effective CPR-AED. A mobile phone positioning system to recruit trained laypeople or text message alerts to send citizen volunteers as well as assistance through a mobile app appear to have significant advantages in practicing effective CPR. The benefits of bystander CPR outweigh the risk of injury to victims, highlighting the need to disseminate training to laypeople.

TI  - Cognitive function after cardiac arrest and temperature management; rationale and description of a sub-study in the Target Temperature Management trial
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Mild to moderate cognitive impairment is common amongst long-term survivors of cardiac arrest. In the Target Temperature Management trial (TTM-trial) comatose survivors were randomized to 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C temperature control for 24 hours after cardiac arrest and the effects on survival and neurological outcome assessed. This protocol describes a sub-study of the TTM-trial investigating cognitive dysfunction and its consequences for patients' and relatives' daily life.
   Methods/Design: Sub-study sites in five European countries included surviving TTM patients 180 days after cardiac arrest. In addition to the instruments for neurological function used in the main trial, sub-study patients were specifically tested for difficulties with memory (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test), attention (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) and executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery). Cognitive impairments will be related to the patients' degree of participation in society (Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4), health related quality of life (Short Form Questionnaire-36v2 (c)), and the caregivers' situation (Zarit Burden Interview (c)). The two intervention groups (33 degrees C and 36 degrees C) will be compared with a group of myocardial infarction controls.
   Discussion: This large international sub-study of a randomized controlled trial will focus on mild to moderate cognitive impairment and its consequences for cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers. By using an additional battery of tests we may be able to detect more subtle differences in cognitive function between the two intervention groups than identified in the main study. The results of the study could be used to develop a relevant screening model for cognitive dysfunction after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Part 7: Systems of Care 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Survival after cardiac arrest requires an integrated system of people, training, equipment, and organizations working together to achieve a common goal. Part 7 of the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care focuses on systems of care, with an emphasis on elements that are relevant to a broad range of resuscitation situations. Previous systems of care guidelines have identified a Chain of Survival, beginning with prevention and early identification of cardiac arrest and proceeding through resuscitation to post-cardiac arrest care. This concept is reinforced by the addition of recovery as an important stage in cardiac arrest survival. Debriefing and other quality improvement strategies were previously mentioned and are now emphasized. Specific to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, this Part contains recommendations about community initiatives to promote cardiac arrest recognition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, public access defibrillation, mobile phone technologies to summon first responders, and an enhanced role for emergency telecommunicators. Germane to in-hospital cardiac arrest are recommendations about the recognition and stabilization of hospital patients at risk for developing cardiac arrest. This Part also includes recommendations about clinical debriefing, transport to specialized cardiac arrest centers, organ donation, and performance measurement across the continuum of resuscitation situations.

TI  - Organisations supporting cardiac arrest survivors: An exploratory survey of organisational structures and activities
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest survivors have diverse needs beyond healthcare, including spirituality, social networks, practical, legal, and economic matters, highlighting the need for community-based support. While some non-governmental organisations support various patient groups, little is known about those dedicated to cardiac arrest survivors. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) conducted a survey to identify and understand these organisations' structures and activities. Methods: An internet survey developed by the ERC was disseminated through media channels, national resuscitation councils, and social networks. Responses were verified against publicly available information to confirm declared activities and sustained support efforts. Organisations were classified based on whether their primary focus was on cardiac arrest survivors or if support was a secondary activity. Results: Of fifty-six responses, eight organisations were identified as providing structured, continuous support. Six primarily focused on cardiac arrest survivors, while two had a broader scope. Most were established after 2000, with six in Europe and two in the United States. Membership ranged from 520 to 3000 survivors. Common activities included peer support and distributing information materials. Connections with healthcare systems varied, with three reporting none. Only two were represented in their national resuscitation councils (NRCs). Conclusions: Organisations supporting cardiac arrest survivors are scarce but address important unmet needs. However, public presence is limited, and ties with institutions remain weak. Strengthening collaborations with healthcare providers, NRCs, and stakeholders could enhance support networks and improve long-term post-resuscitation care.

TI  - Methods Used to Maximize Follow-Up: Lessons Learned From the Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Trials*
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To describe telephone interview completion rates among 12-month cardiac arrest survivors enrolled in the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital and Out-of-Hospital trials, identify key characteristics of the completed follow-up interviews at both 3- and 12-month postcardiac arrest, and describe strategies implemented to promote follow-up. Setting: Centralized telephone follow-up interviews. Design: Retrospective report of data collected for Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest trials, and summary of strategies used to maximize follow-up completion. Patients: Twelve-month survivors (n = 251) from 39 Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest PICU sites in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Interventions: Not applicable. Measurements and Main Results: The 3- and 12-month telephone interviews included completion of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition data were available on 96% of 3-month survivors (242/251) and 95% of 12-month survivors (239/251) with no differences in demographics between those with and without completed Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition. At 12 months, a substantial minority of interviews were completed with caregivers other than parents (10%), after calls attempts were made on 6 or more days (18%), and during evenings/weekends (17%). Strategies included emphasizing the relationship between study teams and participants, ongoing communication between study team members across sites, promoting site engagement during the study's final year, and withholding payment for work associated with the primary outcome until work had been completed. Conclusions: It is feasible to use telephone follow-up interviews to successfully collect detailed neurobehavioral outcome about children following pediatric cardiac arrest. Future studies should consider availability of the telephone interviewer to conduct calls at times convenient for families, using a range of respondents, ongoing engagement with site teams, and site payment related to primary outcome completion.

TI  - Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder after cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Quality of life after surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is poorly understood, and the risk to mental health is not well understood. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following OHCA. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to July 3, 2021, for studies reporting the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among OHCA survivors. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by two authors independently, and a third resolved discrepancies. A single-arm meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool the proportion of patients with these conditions at the earliest follow-up time point in each study and at predefined time points. Meta-regression was performed to identify significant moderators that contributed to between-study heterogeneity. Results: The search yielded 15,366 articles. 13 articles were included for analysis, which comprised 186,160 patients. The pooled overall prevalence at the earliest time point of follow-up was 19.0% (11 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0-30.0%) for depression, 26.0% (nine studies; 95% CI = 16.0-39.0%) for anxiety, and 20.0% (three studies; 95% CI = 3.0-65.0%) for PTSD. Meta-regression showed that the age of patients and proportion of female sex were non-significant moderators. Conclusion: The burden of mental health disorders is high among survivors of OHCA. There is an urgent need to understand the predisposing risk factors and develop preventive strategies.

TI  - Quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest: An 11-year experience from an university center
T2  - ANAESTHESIOLOGIE
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent medical care and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given that in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still poorly investigated, data on health-associated quality of life thereafter remains scarce. The available evidence is mostly transferred from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies, but the epidemiology and determinants of success might be different. The aim of the study was to investigate the change in the quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify potential risk factors for a poor outcome. Material and methods: This retrospective analysis of data and prospective evaluation of quality of life included all patients surviving an IHCA and being treated by the emergency medical team between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint of the study was the quality of life after IHCA at the reference date. Secondary endpoints covered determination of risk factors and predictors of poor outcome after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results: In total 604 patients were resuscitated within the period of 11 years and 61 (10%) patients survived until the interview took place. Finally, 48 (79%) patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 31 (65%) were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest (EQ-5D-5L utility 0.79 vs. 0.78, p = 0.567) and in the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Conclusion: The quality of life before and after IHCA in survivors was good and comparable. The quality of life was mostly affected by reduced mobility and anxiety/depression. Future studies with larger patient samples should focus on potentially modifiable factors that could prevent, warn, and limit the consequences of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Moreover, research on outcomes of IHCA should include available tools for the quality of life assessment.

TI  - Association between Mode of Transport and Patient Outcomes in the Emergency Department following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Single-Center Retrospective Study
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a health problem worldwide, carrying a high mortality rate. Comparison of emergency department (ED) return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA in relation to emergency medical services (EMS) and non-EMS modes of transportation to the hospital was conducted to assess the impact points of the EMS system in Thailand. Methods This retrospective observational study enrolled all OHCA patients who visited the ED of Ramathibodi Hospital, a tertiary university hospital in Bangkok, between January 1, 2008, and May 31, 2020. Patients were differentiated into EMS and non-EMS groups according to mode of transportation to the ED. Patients' characteristics and comorbidities, witnessed arrests, bystander chest compression, initial rhythm, and resuscitation treatment were documented. ED-sustained ROSC, ED survival, 30-day survival, and 30-day survival with good cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were monitored and recorded. Multivariate logistic analyses were performed to assess factors influencing clinical outcomes. Results A total of 339 patients were enrolled, 117 (34.51%) of whom were in the EMS transport group. There were no differences between the EMS and non-EMS groups in ED-sustained ROSC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.70; P = 0.98), or ED survival (aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.57-1.71; P = 0.97). There were also no differences in 30-day survival or 30-day survival with good CPC score between the two groups. Conclusions In our cohort data of OHCA, ED-sustained ROSC and ED survival outcomes were not superior in the EMS transportation group. Evidence to show that EMS transportation affected 30-day survival and 30-day good CPC score was also lacking. Thus, public promotion of Thailand's EMS system is advocated with a simultaneous improvement of EMS response to enhance OHCA outcomes.

TI  - Endoscopic management of choledochocele complicated with choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis in an old patient
T2  - AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Choledochocele, or type III choledochal cyst, is a rare congenital disease and is even less common among adults compared with children. In this case, a 75-year-old female was admitted to our hospital presented with epigastric pain and vomiting for one day. Abdominal computed tomography revealed dilated common bile duct, pancreatitis and peripancreatic effusion. The patient was treated with fasting, fluid resuscitation, anti-acid agents, somatostatin and antibiotics. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was employed for the further diagnosis of choledochocele, choledocholithiasis and biliary stenosis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy, stone extraction and plastic stent placement were performed for treatment. The patient recovered quickly after the treatment and no signs of recurrence and complications were observed during the first follow-up. Endoscopic management may be a promising and alternative therapy for choledochocele although long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of this procedure in the future.

TI  - A concept for the development of a pioneer regional Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Program to improve patient outcomes
T2  - KARDIOLOGIA POLSKA
AB  - BACKGROUND Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases chances of restoring spontaneous circulation and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). For some refractory cases, extended cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may be a promising option.
   AIMS The aim of the study was to estimate the possibility of implementation of ECPR procedure to improve current early outcomes of patients after OHCA.
   METHODS The medical charts of the Province Emergency Station in Poznan from a 12-month period were assessed retrospectively. All OHCA cases were identified and the following potential inclusion criteria for ECPR were analyzed: initial defibrillation rhythm, age between 18 and 65 years, CPR conducted by bystanders, and time to hospital arrival less than 40 minutes.
   RESULTS In 576 (46.7%) of 1233 identified OHCA cases, CPR was initiated by bystanders and automated external defibrillator was applied only 17 times. An initial defibrillation rhythm was noted in 138 individuals (11.2%). Out of 65 patients who met the ECPR age criterion, 55 underwent CPR by bystanders which lead to a no-flow time that did not exceed 10 minutes. The additional 9 of them would be excluded due to time to hospital arrival. This means that ECPR would be applicable in 46 patients after OHCA.
   CONCLUSIONS Our analysis showed that in some patients after sudden cardiac arrest, it would have been possible to implement ECPR as a crucial part of the Regional Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) Program, and in consequence, probably to improve early outcomes of patients with refractory and potentially reversible cardiac arrest.

TI  - Microvascular perfusion in cardiac arrest: a review of microcirculatory imaging studies
T2  - PERFUSION-UK
AB  - Cardiac arrest represents a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) increases the chances for a beneficial outcome in victims of refractory cardiac arrest. However, ECPR and post-cardiac arrest care are affected by high mortality rates due to multi-organ failure syndrome, which is closely related to microcirculatory disorders. Therefore, microcirculation represents a key target for therapeutic interventions in post-cardiac arrest patients. However, the evaluation of tissue microcirculatory perfusion is still demanding to perform. Novel videomicroscopic technologies (Orthogonal polarization spectral, Sidestream dark field and Incident dark field imaging) might offer a promising way to perform bedside microcirculatory assessment and therapy monitoring. This review aims to summarise the recent body of knowledge on videomicroscopic imaging in a cardiac arrest setting and to discuss the impact of extracorporeal reperfusion and other therapeutic modalities on microcirculation.

TI  - Outcome of avalanche victims with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Study background: Previous studies focused on the outcome of avalanche victims with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) after long duration of burial (> 35 min); the outcome of victims with short duration (<= 35 min) remains obscure.
   Aim of the study: To investigate outcome of avalanche victims with OHCA.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of avalanche victims with OHCA between 2008 and 2013 in the Tyrolean Alps.
   Results: 55 avalanche victims were identified, 32 of whom were declared dead after extrication without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), all with long duration of burial. In the remaining 23 CPR was initiated at scene; three were partially and 20 completely buried, nine of whom suffered short and 11 long duration of burial. All nine victims with short duration of burial underwent restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at scene, four of them after bystander CPR, five after advanced life support by the emergency physician. Two patients with ROSC after short duration of burial and bystander CPR survived to hospital discharge with cerebral performance category 1. None of the 11 victims with long duration of burial survived to hospital discharge, although six were transported to hospital with ongoing CPR and three were supported with extracorporeal circulation.
   Conclusions: In this case series survival with favourable neurological outcome was observed in avalanche victims with short duration of burial only if bystander CPR was immediately performed and ROSC achieved. Strategies for reducing avalanche mortality should focus on prompt extrication from the snow and immediate bystander CPR by uninjured companions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is an early predictor of mortality in patients with cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Post-cardiac arrest management has seen significant advances with profound improvements in survival and neurologic outcome. However, early prognostication after return of spontaneous circulation remains most challenging. Biomarkers have evolved as helpful tools in identifying patients who are at increased risk of adverse outcome. While fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) has recently emerged as a promising predictor of mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock, its role in risk stratification in post-resuscitation management remains unresolved.
   Methods: This study included 90 patients who had been resuscitated and transferred to the ICU of the University Hospital Heidelberg. Survivors and non-survivors were retrospectively analyzed for known prognostic biomarkers as well as FGF-23 serum levels 24 h and 72 h post cardiac arrest (CA).
   Results: FGF-23 levels were significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to survivors. ROC analysis of FGF-23 levels at 24 h and 72 h post CA yielded an AUC of 0.759 and 0.726, respectively, for prediction of overall survival after 6 months. FGF-23 levels remained as significant prognosticators after adjusting for age, renal function, and initial cardiac rhythm. FGF-23 levels did not show significant differences in patient outcome after stratification for cardiac origin of CA or left ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, FGF-23 levels were moderately predictive of poor neurologic outcome in ROC analysis on day 1 and day 3 post CA with an AUC of 0.738 and 0.687, respectively.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates elevated FGF-23 serum levels to be potentially helpful in prediction of mortality and poor neurological outcome as early as 24 h post cardiac arrest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - KIDS SAVE LIVES: Basic Life Support Education for Schoolchildren: A Narrative Review and Scientific Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background:Basic life support education for schoolchildren has become a key initiative to increase bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates. Our objective was to review the existing literature on teaching schoolchildren basic life support to identify the best practices to provide basic life support training in schoolchildren. Methods:After topics and subgroups were defined, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. Systematic reviews and controlled and uncontrolled prospective and retrospective studies containing data on students Results:Schoolchildren are highly motivated to learn basic life support. The CHECK-CALL-COMPRESS algorithm is recommended for all schoolchildren. Regular training in basic life support regardless of age consolidates long-term skills. Young children from 4 years of age are able to assess the first links in the chain of survival. By 10 to 12 years of age, effective chest compression depths and ventilation volumes can be achieved on training manikins. A combination of theoretical and practical training is recommended. Schoolteachers serve as effective basic life support instructors. Schoolchildren also serve as multipliers by passing on basic life support skills to others. The use of age-appropriate social media tools for teaching is a promising approach for schoolchildren of all ages. Conclusions:Schoolchildren basic life support training has the potential to educate whole generations to respond to cardiac arrest and to increase survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Comprehensive legislation, curricula, and scientific assessment are crucial to further develop the education of schoolchildren in basic life support.

TI  - The Association Between Ventricular Fibrillation and Serum Catecholamine Levels
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background and objective Epinephrine (Ep) is the first choice as a vasoconstrictor in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for patients with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA); however, the Ep concentration in the serum of CPA patients is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serum Ep levels and achieving the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF). Methods This was a prospective, observational clinical study involving OHCA patients with VF transferred to our hospital from July 2014 to July 2017. The measurement of serum catecholamines [Ep, norepinephrine (Nep), and dopamine (DOA)] and vasopressin [antidiuretic hormone (ADH)] levels was performed with blood samples obtained immediately upon patients' arrival at our hospital. Patients were classified into two groups: the ROSC(+) group and ROSC(-) group; the serum concentrations of catecholamines and ADH were compared between these two groups. Results The serum Ep and Nep levels were lower in the ROSC(+) group than those in the ROSC(-) group and the difference was statistically significant. On the other hand, no significant differences were found in serum DOA and ADH levels between the two groups. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that an increment in serum Ep levels does not promote achieving ROSC in OHCA patients with VF.

TI  - Functional outcome, cognition and quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia: data from a randomized controlled trial
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: To study functional neurologic and cognitive outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a cohort of patients included in a randomised controlled trial on glucose control following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) from ventricular fibrillation (VF) treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
   Methods: Patients alive at 6 months after being discharged from the hospital underwent clinical neurological and extensive neuropsychological examinations. Functional outcome was evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category scale, the modified Rankin scale and the Barthel Index. Cognitive outcome was evaluated by neuropsychological test battery including two measures of each cognitive function: cognitive speed, execution, memory, verbal skills and visuospatial performance. We also assessed quality of life with a HRQoL 15D questionnaire.
   Results: Of 90 OHCA-VF patients included in the original trial, 57 were alive at 6 months. Of these, 52 (91%) were functionally independent and 54 (95%) lived at their previous home. Focal neurological deficits were scarce. Intact cognitive performance was observed in 20 (49%), mild to moderate deficits in 14 (34%) and severe cognitive deficits in 7 (17%) of 41 patients assessed by a neuropsychologist. Cognitive impairments were most frequently detected in executive and memory functions. HRQoL of the CA survivors was comparable to that of age-and gender matched population.
   Conclusions: Functional outcome six months after OHCA and therapeutic hypothermia was good in the great majority of the survivors, and half of them were cognitively intact. Of note, the HRQoL of CA survivors did not differ from that of age-and gender matched population.

TI  - Application of high-quality targeted temperature management guided by multimodal brain monitoring in brain protection of patients with cardiac arrest: A case series
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:Cardiac arrest (CA) is an acute emergency with high mortality and is closely associated with the risk of brain damage or systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury, post-traumatic stress symptoms.Patient concerns:Targeted temperature management in the intensive care unit can improve the neurological outcomes of patients who are comatose after resuscitation from CA. However, there is often a lack of specific evaluation methods for optimal target temperature settings.Diagnoses:From November 2021 to October 2022, 9 CA patients received prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation after approximately 10 to 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University.Interventions:We retrospectively reviewed 9 CA patients' medical data, including demographic characteristics, hemodynamic change, clinically relevant score, imageological examination, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, electroencephalogram (EEG), somatosensory-evoked potential, and laboratory data.Outcomes:According to the result of each patient's transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, somatosensory-evoked potential, and EEG to formulate an individualized target temperature. Contrary to the internationally recommended target of hypothermia, we found that not all patients require hypothermia therapy to maintain normal cerebrovascular autonomic regulation function. And neuron-specific enolase and S100 beta in patients showed a downward trend after hypothermia therapy. Compared with before hypothermia treatment, clinically relevant scores were reduced in patients with good prognosis. Intracranial congestion or ischemia was improved and intracranial pressure was reduced in all patients during hypothermia treatment. For patients with good EEG response, the ratio of gray matter in the brain increased and the neurological prognosis was significantly improved. Finally, after 6 months of follow-up, we found 3 patients died and 1 patient had a long-term vegetative state, the other patients had a good prognosis.Lessons:Individualized targeted temperature management under the guidance of multimodal brain monitoring plays an important role in brain protection of patients with CA.

TI  - The Role of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis systematically evaluated the impact of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) on the survival of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and related factors. Methods: A computerized search of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, and Embase was conducted from the database's inception to May 1, 2023. The study included observational studies of patients who experienced OHCA and were successfully resuscitated using BCPR, following the predetermined criteria for inclusion and exclusion. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) used as effect size measures. The data were statistically analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 software. Results: Fourteen observational studies were included in this study, involving 253,247 cases of OHCA. The primary outcome measure was survival to discharge or survival at 30 days. A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the data from these 14 studies. The findings indicated that the no-BCPR group had a significantly reduced survival rate compared to the BCPR group (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.40-2.12, p < 0.05). Secondly, the study examined 14 studies that focused on prehospital return of spontaneous circulation and neurological recovery before they reached the hospital. The findings revealed that patients who received BCPR had a higher rate of prehospital ROSC (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.66-2.57, p < 0.05) and experienced better neurological recovery (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.67-2.47, p < 0.05) compared to those who did not receive BCPR. This difference was found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: BCPR can potentially enhance the likelihood of survival for patients experiencing OHCA. BCPR can offer patients an opportunity for both survival and favorable neurological recovery during the time when emergency medical services (EMS) respond. Given the existing circumstances, it is advisable to enhance the promotion and training of public CPR and improve the prevalence of bystander CPR in society since this is expected to yield substantial social advantages.

TI  - Early in-hospital management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Scotland: a national survey
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Guidelines recommend the use of mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the early post-resuscitation management of select out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases. This study aims to assess the current use of MTH and PCI in Scottish Emergency Departments (ED) and Intensive Care Units (ICU). We conducted a questionnaire survey of all the Scottish Emergency Medicine Consultants, EDs and ICUs. MTH was more commonly initiated in ICU than in the ED (19; 91 vs. 7; 37%, P<0.05). Only a minority two (11%) EDs routinely referred OHCA patients for early PCI and only three (16%) EDs receiving patients after OHCA had on-site access to PCI facilities. The use of MTH after OHCA appears to be widespread, although it is infrequently initiated in the ED. The utilization of PCI in OHCA management has yet to be widely established.
   Increased awareness may increase the use of promising therapies such as MTH and PCI following OHCA to save lives. European Journal of Emergency Medicine 18:102-104 (C) 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TI  - Possibilities of post-resuscitation neuroprotection in 2019
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Post-resuscitation brain injury forms the leading cause of death of patients after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation that explains why post-resuscitation neuroprotection is the most important part of post-resuscitation therapy. The goals of the neuroprotection tools available today are preventing the evolution of primary and formation of secondary brain injury. We are going to summarize the neuroprotective possibilities that we can reach today. We will discuss the role of pharmacologic strategies including sedation, the modalities of upholding brain perfusion, the monitoring of proper hemodynamic variables and the practice of targeted temperature management. It is very important to avoid hypo- and hyperoxia, to keep normocapnia, normoglycemia and to control seizures during the management of post-cardiac arrest patients. There is still a lack of evidence to prove which pharmacologic agent may be effective in postresuscitation neuroprotection, however, there are some promising results regarding thiamine. Hemodynamic management guided by higher level hemodynamic monitoring may be beneficial in enhancing brain perfusion but more clinical studies are needed to investigate its usefulness. Targeted temperature management constitutes the main element of post-resuscitation neuroprotection, however, the details of its implementation raise several questions.

TI  - Post-cardiac arrest Sedation Promotes Electroencephalographic Slow-wave Activity and Improves Survival in a Mouse Model of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background:Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest are routinely sedated during targeted temperature management, while the effects of sedation on cerebral physiology and outcomes after cardiac arrest remain to be determined. The authors hypothesized that sedation would improve survival and neurologic outcomes in mice after cardiac arrest. Methods:Adult C57BL/6J mice of both sexes were subjected to potassium chloride-induced cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Starting at the return of spontaneous circulation or at 60 min after return of spontaneous circulation, mice received intravenous infusion of propofol at 40 mg center dot kg(-1) center dot h(-1), dexmedetomidine at 1 mu g center dot kg(-1) center dot h(-1), or normal saline for 2 h. Body temperature was lowered and maintained at 33 degrees C during sedation. Cerebral blood flow was measured for 4 h postresuscitation. Telemetric electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in freely moving mice from 3 days before up to 7 days after cardiac arrest. Results:Sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine starting at return of spontaneous circulation improved survival in hypothermia-treated mice (propofol [13 of 16, 81%] vs. no sedation [4 of 16, 25%], P = 0.008; dexmedetomidine [14 of 16, 88%] vs. no sedation [4 of 16, 25%], P = 0.002). Mice receiving no sedation exhibited cerebral hyperemia immediately after resuscitation and EEG power remained less than 30% of the baseline in the first 6 h postresuscitation. Administration of propofol or dexmedetomidine starting at return of spontaneous circulation attenuated cerebral hyperemia and increased EEG slow oscillation power during and early after sedation (40 to 80% of the baseline). In contrast, delayed sedation failed to improve outcomes, without attenuating cerebral hyperemia and inducing slow-wave activity. Conclusions:Early administration of sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine improved survival and neurologic outcomes in mice resuscitated from cardiac arrest and treated with hypothermia. The beneficial effects of sedation were accompanied by attenuation of the cerebral hyperemic response and enhancement of electroencephalographic slow-wave activity.

TI  - A "NIRS" death experience: a reduction in cortical oxygenation by time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy preceding cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used effectively post-cardiac-arrest to gauge adequacy of resuscitation and predict the likelihood of achieving a return of spontaneous circulation. However, preempting hemodynamic collapse is preferable to achieving ROSC through advanced cardiac life support. Minimizing "time down" without end-organ perfusion has always been a central pillar of ACLS. In many critically ill patients there is a prolonged phase of end-organ hypoperfusion preceding loss of palpable pulses and initiation of ACLS. Due to the relative infrequency of in-hospital cardiac arrest, NIRS has not previously evaluated the period immediately prior to hemodynamic collapse. Here we report a young man who suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest while cortical oxygenation was monitored using time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy. The onset of cortical deoxygenation preceded the loss of palpable pulses by 15 min, suggesting that TRS-NIRS monitoring might provide a means of preempting PEA arrest. Our experience with this patient represents a promising new direction for continuous NIRS monitoring and has the potential to not only predict clinical outcomes, but affect them to the patient's benefit as well.

TI  - Regional Brain Net Water Uptake in Computed Tomography after Cardiac Arrest - A Novel Biomarker for Neuroprognostication
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Selective water uptake by neurons and glial cells and subsequent brain tissue oedema are key pathophysiological processes of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) after cardiac arrest (CA). Although brain computed tomography (CT) is widely used to assess the severity of HIE, changes of brain radiodensity over time have not been investigated. These could be used to quantify regional brain net water uptake (NWU), a potential prognostic biomarker. Methods:We conducted an observational prognostic accuracy study including a derivation (single center cardiac arrest registry) and a validation (international multicenter TTM2 trial) cohort. Early (<6 h) and follow-up (>24 h) head CTs of CA patients were used to determine regional NWU for grey and white matter regions after co-registration with a brain atlas. Neurological outcome was dichotomized as good versus poor using the Cerebral Performance Category Scale (CPC) in the derivation cohort and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in the validation cohort. Results:We included 115 patients (81 derivation, 34 validation) with out-of-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Regional brain water content remained unchanged in patients with good outcome. In patients with poor neurological outcome, we found considerable regional water uptake with the strongest effect in the basal ganglia. NWU >8% in the putamen and caudate nucleus predicted poor outcome with 100% specificity (95%-CI: 86-100%) and 43% (moderate) sensitivity (95%-CI: 31-56%). Conclusion:This pilot study indicates that NWU derived from serial head CTs is a promising novel biomarker for outcome prediction after CA. NWU >8% in basal ganglia grey matter regions predicted poor outcome while absence of NWU indicated good outcome. NWU and follow-up CTs should be investigated in larger, prospective trials with standardized CT acquisition protocols.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recent advances in resuscitation and effects on outcome
T2  - HEART
AB  - Successful treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains an unmet health need. Key elements of treatment comprise early recognition of cardiac arrest, prompt and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), effective defibrillation strategies and organised post-resuscitation care. The initiation of bystander CPR followed by a prompt emergency response that delivers high quality CPR is critical to outcomes. The integration of additional tasks such as defibrillation, airway management, vascular access and drug administration should avoid interruptions in chest compressions. Evidence for the routine use of CPR prompt/feedback devices, mechanical chest compression devices and pharmacological therapy is limited.

TI  - A POPULATION-BASED RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF POST-IN-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST SURVIVAL AFTER MODIFICATION OF THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In 2010, the American Heart Association recommended that postcardiac arrest care should be included in the chain of survival to reduce permanent neurological damage, improve quality of life, and reduce health care expenses of postcardiac arrest care. Objectives: To investigate post-in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survival prior to and after modification of the chain of survival in 2010, with subgroup analyses per age and concomitant coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: We retrospectively searched the National Health Insurance Research Database for the 2007-2015 period to collect case data coded as "427.41" or "427.5" per International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification, Ninth revision codes and analyzed the data with SPSS v22.0. Results: The 1-day survival rate in the 2011-2015 period was 2% higher than that in the 2007-2010 period (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.04). Moreover, in the 2011-2015 period, the survival-to-discharge rate was increased by 1% in patients under 65 years (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02) and 1% in CHD patients (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02) compared with that in the 2007-2010 period. Conclusion: For patients with IHCA, the overall short-term survival improved significantly after modification of the chain of survival. Younger patients and patients with CHD had better long-term survival. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Hyperoxic Reperfusion after Global Cerebral Ischemia Promotes Inflammation and Long-Term Hippocampal Neuronal Death
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB  - In this study we tested the hypothesis that long-term neuropathological outcome is worsened by hyperoxic compared to normoxic reperfusion in a rat global cerebral ischemia model. Adult male rats were anesthetized and subjected to bilateral carotid arterial occlusion plus bleeding hypotension for 10 min. The rats were randomized to one of four protocols: ischemia/normoxia (21% oxygen for 1 h), ischemia/hyperoxia (100% oxygen for 1 h), sham/normoxia, and sham/hyperoxia. Hippocampal CA1 neuronal survival and activation of microglia and astrocytes were measured in the hippocampi of the animals at 7 and 30 days post-ischemia. Morris water maze testing of memory was performed on days 23-30. Compared to normoxic reperfusion, hyperoxic ventilation resulted in a significant decrease in normal-appearing neurons at 7 and 30 days, and increased activation of microglia and astrocytes at 7, but not at 30, days of reperfusion. Behavioral deficits were also observed following hyperoxic, but not normoxic, reperfusion. We conclude that early post-ischemic hyperoxic reperfusion is followed by greater hippocampal neuronal death and cellular inflammatory reactions compared to normoxic reperfusion. The results of these long-term outcome studies, taken together with previously published results from short-term experiments performed with large animals, support the hypothesis that neurological outcome can be improved by avoiding hyperoxic resuscitation after global cerebral ischemia such as that which accompanies cardiac arrest.

TI  - Adenosine treatment delays postischemic hippocampal CA1 loss after cardiac arrest and resuscitation in rats
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Resuscitation from cardiac arrest results in reperfusion injury that leads to increased postresuscitation mortality and delayed neuronal death. One of the many consequences of resuscitation from cardiac arrest is a derangement of energy metabolism and the loss of adenylates, impairing the tissue's ability to regain proper energy balance. in this study, we investigated the effects of adenosine (ADO) on the recovery of the brain from 12 min of ischemia using a rat model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Compared to the untreated group, treatment with adenosine (7.2 mg/kg) initiated immediately after resuscitation increased the proportion of rats surviving to 4 days and significantly delayed hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss. Brain blood flow was increased significantly in the adenosine-treated rats 1 h after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Adeno sine-treated rats exhibited less edema in cortex, brainstem and hippocampus during the first 48 h of recovery. Adenosine treatment significantly lowered brain temperature during recovery, and a part of the neuroprotective effects of adenosine treatment could be ascribed to adenosine-induced hypothermia. With this dose, adenosine may have a delayed transient effect on the restoration of the adenylate pool (AXP = ATP + ADP + AMP) 24 h after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our findings suggested that improved postischemic brain blood flow and ADO-induced hypothermia, rather than adenylate supplementation, may be the two major contributors to the neuroprotective effects of adenosine following cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Although adenosine did not prevent eventual CA1 neuronal loss in the long term, it did delay neuronal loss and promoted long-term survival. Thus, adenosine or specific agonists of adenosine receptors should be evaluated as adjuncts to broaden the window of opportunity in the treatment of the reperfusion injury following cardiac arrest and resuscitation.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Risk Factors Associated With Cognitive Impairment After Pediatric Critical Illness*
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To identify risk factors associated with cognitive impairment as assessed by neuropsychologic tests in neurotypical children after critical illness.
   Data Sources: For this systematic review, we searched the Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed, Ovid, Embase, and CINAHL databases from January 1960 to March 2017.
   Study Selection: Included were studies with subjects 3-18 years old at the time of post PICU follow-up evaluation and use of an objective standardized neuropsychologic test with at least one cognitive functioning dimension. Excluded were studies featuring patients with a history of cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, or genetic anomalies associated with neurocognitive impairment.
   Data Extraction: Twelve studies met the sampling criteria and were rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.
   Data Synthesis: Ten studies reported significantly lower scores in at least one cognitive domain as compared to healthy controls or normed population data; seven of thesefour case-control and three prospective cohort studiesreported significant lower scores in more than one cognitive domain. Risk factors associated with post critical illness cognitive impairment included younger age at critical illness and/or older age at follow-up, low socioeconomic status, high oxygen requirements, and use of mechanical ventilation, sedation, and pain medications.
   Conclusions: Identifying risk factors for poor cognitive outcomes post critical illness may help healthcare teams modify patient risk and/or provide follow-up services to improve long-term cognitive outcomes in high-risk children.

TI  - Neuroprotection after Cardiac Arrest: Reevaluating the Role of Therapeutic Hypothermia - A Narrative Review
T2  - HEART AND MIND
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia, defined as lowering the core body temperature to 32 degrees C-34 degrees C, has emerged as a key intervention in post-cardiac arrest care, aimed at mitigating brain injury and improving neurological outcomes. The primary pathways underlying the potential neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia include the reduction of cerebral metabolic demand, the attenuation of excitotoxicity, and the suppression of inflammation. Early clinical studies, including the Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest (HACA) and the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest in Nonshockable Rhythm (HYPERION) trials, showed promising results and led to the endorsement of this approach in the post-cardiac arrest setting. However, more recent trials, such as the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM), the TTM2 and the HACA in-hospital studies, found no significant benefit in all-cause mortality or neurologic outcomes. These findings raised important questions about the ideal temperature range, the optimal timing of initiation, and the duration of cooling. Moreover, this approach is correlated with potential risks, like coagulopathy, increased infection risk, or electrolyte disturbances. The current review aims to present current clinical guidelines and recommendations from key scientific communities, including the European Resuscitation Council, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the American Heart Association, the European Society for Emergency Medicine and the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, on temperature management among comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and evaluate the benefits and risks of therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective strategy for post-cardiac arrest care.

TI  - Blood Cultures and Appropriate Antimicrobial Administration after Achieving Sustained Return of Spontaneous Circulation in Adults with Nontraumatic Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - We aimed to determine the incidence of bacteremia and prognostic effects of prompt administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AAT) on nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients achieving a sustained return of spontaneous circulation (sROSC), compared with non-OHCA patients. In the multicenter case-control study, nontraumatic OHCA adults with bacteremia episodes after achieving sROSC were defined as case patients, and non-OHCA patients with community-onset bacteremia in the emergency department were regarded as control patients. Initially, case patients had a higher bacteremia incidence than non-OHCA visits (231/2171, 10.6% vs. 10,430/314,620, 3.3%; p < 0.001). Compared with the matched control (2288) patients, case (231) patients experienced more bacteremic episodes due to low respiratory tract infections, fewer urosepsis events, fewer Escherichia coli bacteremia, and more streptococcal and anaerobes bacteremia. Antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, were frequently evident in case patients. Notably, each hour delay in AAT administration was associated with an average increase of 10.6% in crude 30-day mortality rates in case patients, 0.7% in critically ill control patients, and 0.3% in less critically ill control patients. Conclusively, the incidence and characteristics of bacteremia differed between the nontraumatic OHCA and non-OHCA patients. The incorporation of blood culture samplings and rapid AAT administration as first-aids is essential for nontraumatic OHCA patients after achieving sROSC.

TI  - Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: an overview of different cannulation techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
AB  - Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has known a widespread application over the last decade and is now an effective and valuable therapeutic option in refractory cardiogenic shock of various etiologies. In this subgroup of critically ill and unstable patients in cardiogenic shock, VA-ECMO allows, on the one hand, temporary hemodynamic stabilization with improvement of endorgan function and, on the other hand, gives the time to perform complementary diagnostic exams and to decide the therapeutic strategy in these high-risk candidates for immediate long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implantation. VA-ECMO could also be suggested as a rescue therapeutic option for refractory cardiac arrest. It showed promising results in the specific setting of in-hospital cardiac arrest and survival rates with good neurological outcome are reported between 20% and 40%. Conversely, there are contrasting data in the literature about survival after VA-ECMO for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as results are highly dependent on low-flow time. The aim of the present report is to offer an overview of different cannulation techniques of VA-ECMO.

TI  - Quality of life of survivors of paediatric intensive care
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
AB  - Objective: The mortality rate in paediatric intensive care units (PICU) has fallen over the last two decades. More advanced treatment is offered to children with life-threatening disease and there is substantial interest in knowing whether long term outcome and quality of life after intensive care are acceptable.
   Setting. 12-bed paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit
   Intervention: Prospective follow-up study with telephone interview 1 and 2 years after discharge.
   Methods: Four domains of quality of life (physical function, role function, social-emotional function and health problem) were recorded by calculating the health state classification (HSC) index. Outcome was classified good (HSC 1.0-0.7), moderate (HSC 0.69-0.3), poor (HSC 0.29-0) and very poor (HSC <0).
   Results: 661 patients were admitted to the PICU in the year 2001 with a mortality within the unit of 3.9%. Over 2 years follow-up there were 21 additional deaths (3.2%). 574 patients could be followed up after 1 year and 464 patients after 2 years. After two years the outcome was good in 77%, moderate in 15% and poor in 8%. Patients with respiratory disease had the best outcome, similar to those admitted for neurological and medical reasons. Patients admitted for postoperative care and for cardiovascular disease had a poorer quality of life. 31% of the children had preexisting health care problems and 21% of all patients had new chronic disease after intensive care.
   Conclusion: The majority of survivors admitted to the PICU have a good outcome. The overall mortality rate doubled if assessed two years after discharge.

TI  - Post-traumatic duodenopancreatectomy: A real challenge for emergency physicians, anesthesiologists-intensivists, and surgeons
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB  - Introduction: Duodenopancreatic trauma, accounting for 3-5 % of abdominal injuries, poses a major challenge in trauma surgery. Their rarity and complexity demand rapid, expert management, often complicated by associated multivisceral injuries. Case report: A 20-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department following a road traffic accident, presenting with severe cranial and abdominal impact trauma. Clinical examination revealed hemodynamic instability and abdominal distension with rigidity. Due to the patient's hemodynamic instability and the abdominal emergency, he was taken directly to the operating room without undergoing a CT scan. Urgent median laparotomy revealed a duodenal avulsion from D1 to D3 with partial detachment of the pancreatic head. The surgical intervention involved partial duodenal and pancreatic resection with complex reconstruction, including a jejunal patch and gastrojejunostomy. Postoperatively, the patient developed abdominal septic shock requiring intensive resuscitation measures. He was extubated on day 3, with continued monitoring in the ICU. Parenteral feeding was initiated on day 4, enteral feeding on day 17, and drains were removed on day 15. The patient was subsequently transferred to visceral surgery following favorable progression. Discussion: Duodenopancreatic traumas are rare surgical emergencies, representing 3-5 % of abdominal traumas, often complex due to associated injuries. Key challenges include difficult diagnosis due to initially subtle clinical signs, personalized surgical management (occasionally requiring post-traumatic pancreaticoduodenectomy, as in our case), frequent and potentially severe postoperative complications (e.g., fistulas, hemorrhages, abscesses), and significant long-term sequelae such as diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Long-term, multidisciplinary follow-up is essential to manage functional sequelae, including diabetes and steatorrhea. Conclusion: Duodenopancreatic injuries have a high mortality rate (5-30 %). Rapid intervention, specialized surgical expertise, and rigorous follow-up are crucial for optimizing outcomes and quality of life for patients. This case highlights the importance of a personalized approach and close monitoring in managing these complex traumas.

TI  - Prognostic value of glucose-to-potassium ratio and other biomarkers in in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the serum glucose/potassium ratio (GPR) for sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day mortality in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest in the emergency department (ED) were included. Routine laboratory parameters were obtained from the first blood sample collected during CPR in the ED. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated by dividing the absolute number of neutrophils and platelets, respectively, by the absolute number of lymphocytes. The GPR was calculated as serum glucose divided by potassium levels. Results: The 30-day mortality rate was 82.2% (n = 291). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified lactate, NLR, PLR and GPR as independent predictors of mortality. Among these markers, lactate exhibited the highest predictive power for mortality, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.817, compared to NLR (AUC: 0.676), PLR (AUC: 0.679) and GPR (AUC: 0.688). The optimal cut-off values for predicting mortality were 7.83 for lactate (sensitivity: 75.3%, specificity: 89.4%), 1.68 for NLR (sensitivity: 78.8%, specificity: 71.7%), 199.26 for PLR (sensitivity: 76.4%, specificity: 92.3%) and 57.81 for GPR (sensitivity: 71.8%, specificity: 84.1%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that GPR is a promising prognostic marker for predicting mortality in patients with IHCA.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Lay Responder Defibrillation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: Our objective is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by lay responders (CPR+AED) versus CPR only for cardiac arrest during a multicenter randomized trial.
   Methods: This was a prospective trial from July 2000 to September 2003 that randomly assigned 993 community units (eg, office buildings, public areas) in 24 sites to an emergency response system, using lay volunteers trained in CPR only or CPR+AED. Cost and quality of life data were collected with effectiveness data. The primary analysis evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of defibrillator use in public locations by using Markov modeling.
   Results: CPR only had 14 survivors to discharge and CPR+AED had 29. CPR only had a mean of 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.88) quality-adjusted life-years and a mean $42,400 (95% Cl $22,100 to $62,600) costs. CPR+AED had mean 1.14 (95% Cl 0.44 to 1.83) quality-adjusted life-years, mean $68,400 (95% Cl $28,300 to $108,400) costs, and a long-term cost of mean $46,700 (95% Cl $23,100 to $68,600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Results were sensitive to the effectiveness of the intervention, time horizon, location of arrest, and other factors.
   Conclusion: Training and equipping lay volunteers to defibrillate in public places may have an incremental cost-effectiveness that is similar to that of other common health interventions. [Ann Emerg Med. 2009;54: 226-235.]

TI  - TEE guided REBOA deflation following ROSC for non-traumatic cardiac arrest
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is most commonly used to manage non -compressible torso hemorrhage. It is also emerging as a promising treatment for non-traumatic refractory cardiac arrest. Aortic occlusion during chest compressions increases cardio-cerebral perfusion, increasing the potential for sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or serving as a bridge to extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). Optimal patient selection and post-ROSC management in such cases is uncertain and not well reported in the literature. We present a case of non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in which REBOA was placed in the emergency department with subsequent ROSC. Transesophageal echocardiography was used to guide post-ROSC REBOA management and balloon deflation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Systemic nicotinamide mononucleotide administration to mitigate post-cardiac arrest brain injury in mice
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is the leading cause of death and disability following cardiac arrest (CA). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion after CA contributes to neuronal injury, while nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) replenishes NAD+ and may provide neuroprotection via sirtuin activation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMN administration on neurological function, survival, and sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) levels in the brain post-CA. In adult male mice (C57BL/6NCrSlc, 10-15 weeks old), 10-min CA was induced by intravenous potassium chloride injection followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. NMN (60 mg/kg body weight) or normal saline (control) was randomly administered by intraperitoneal injection immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 24 and 48 h post-CA. Brain NAD+ and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, neurological function score (NFS), survival, histological neuronal injury, and brain gene expression and protein levels were measured. Brain NAD+ levels decreased at 2 h post-ROSC and NMN significantly increased brain NAD+ and ATP levels. At 48 h post-CA, surviving mice in the NMN group exhibited significantly higher NFS (control: 8 [IQR: 4-12] vs. NMN: 12 [IQR: 9-12], p = 0.03) and less severe hippocampal neuronal injury compared with controls. Moreover, the NMN group showed significantly higher 7-day survival rate (control: 22.2% [4/18] vs. NMN: 61.1% [11/18], p = 0.03) and brain SIRT3 levels (control: 17.7 +/- 3.6 vs. NMN: 34.5 +/- 4.4 pg/mg protein, p = 0.01). In conclusion, systemic NMN administration after ROSC attenuates PCABI. The increased brain ATP levels and SIRT3 upregulation may suggest the usefulness of NMN for improving mitochondrial function and contributing to neuroprotection. NAD+ supplementation with NMN is a promising therapeutic approach against PCABI.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to establish a ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest (CA) resuscitation model with consistent neurologic and neuropathologic damage as potential therapeutic target. Methods: Prospectively randomized groups of experiments in two phases. In phase 1 four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n =5) were resuscitated after 6 min VFCA with 2 and 6 min basic life support durations (BLS) with and without adrenaline. In phase 2 the most promising group regarding return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival was compared with a group of 8 min CA. Resuscitability, neurologic deficit scores (NDS), and overall performance category (OPC) were assessed daily; histolopathology of the hippocampal CA1 region [hematoxylin and eosin-(viable neurons), Fluoro-Jade-(dying neurons), and Iba-1 immunostaining (microglial activation-semiquantitative)] on day 14. Results: Two minutes BLS and with adrenaline as most promising group of phase 1 compared with an 8 min group in phase 2 exhibited ROSC in 8 (80%) vs. 9 (82%) animals and survivors till day 14 in 7 (88%) (all OPC 1, NDS 0 = ) vs. 6 (67%) (5 OPC 1, 1 OPC 2, NDS 0.83 +/- 2.4) animals. OPC and NDS were only significantly different at day 1 (OPC: P = 0.035; NDS: P = 0.003). Histopathologic results between groups were not significantly different; however, a smaller variance of extent of lesions was found in the 8 min group. Both CA durations caused graded neurologic, overall, such as histopathologic damage. Conclusions: This dynamic global ischemia model offers the possibility to evaluate further cognitive and novel neuroprotective therapy testing after CA.

TI  - Simulation-based assessment of trainee's performance in post-cardiac arrest resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Objectives: To assess trainees' performance in managing a patient with post-cardiac arrest complicated by status epilepticus.
   Methods: In this prospective, observational, single-center simulation-based study, trainees ranging from sub interns to critical care fellows evaluated and managed a post cardiac arrest patient, complicated by status epilepticus. Critical action items were developed by a modified Delphi approach based on American Heart Association guidelines and the Neurocritical Care Society's Emergency Neurological Life Support protocols. The primary outcome measure was the critical action item sum score. We sought validity evidence to support our findings by including attending neurocritical care physicians and comparing performance across four levels of training.
   Results: Forty-nine participants completed the simulation. The mean sum of critical actions completed by trainees was 10/21 (49%). Eleven (22%) trainees verbalized a differential diagnosis for the arrest. Thirty-two (65%) reviewed the electrocardiogram, recognized it as abnormal, and consulted cardiology. Forty trainees (81%) independently decided to start temperature management, but only 20 (41%) insisted on it when asked to reconsider. There was an effect of level of training on critical action checklist sum scores (novice mean score [standard deviation (SD)] = 4.8(1.8) vs. intermediate mean score (SD) = 10.4(2.1) vs. advanced mean score (D) = 11.6(3.0) vs. expert mean score (SD) = 14.7(2.2))
   Conclusions: High-fidelity manikin-based simulation holds promise as an assessment tool in the performance of post-cardiac arrest care.

TI  - The management of congenital tracheal stenosis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
CP  - 8th International Congress of Paediatric Otorhinolaryngology
AB  - This paper reviews current concepts and results in the management of congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS). Diagnostic options are considered and the requirements for successful management defined. Chief amongst these is a multi-disciplinary approach with individualised patient management. Severe long-segment CTS represents the biggest challenge to clinicians and the worst problems for affected families. Near-death episodes are frequent in affected infants and some cannot be ventilated and require ECMO. Associated cardiovascular anomalies are frequent. Patients require immediate resuscitation and transfer to a specialist unit. After careful assessment, accurate diagnosis and discussion, primary resection and end-to-end repair with a slide technique should always be the first option, with concomitant repair of associated cardiac anomalies. If this is impossible because of the severity of the Lesion, some form of patch tracheoptasty will be indicated. Cardiopulmonary bypass is often required. Patches include pericardium, autograft trachea, carotid artery, cartilage, and allograft trachea. Mortality ranges from 0 to 30% in the literature, which Largely comprises single-centre long-term experience. Recurrence is common and can be managed by stenting and tracheal homograft implantation. Long-term quality of life of survivors is little reported but seems good. Physiological data are tacking. To improve results, we suggest a treatment algorithm to rationalise care.

TI  - Delayed Fluoxetine Administration Restores Hippocampal Function in a Juvenile Global Cerebral Ischemia Mouse Model in a Sex-Specific Manner
T2  - NEURAL PLASTICITY
AB  - Global cerebral ischemia (GCI) during childhood is a leading cause of long-term cognitive impairment, yet no therapies currently exist to promote recovery in survivors. We previously demonstrated that juvenile mice exhibit transient hippocampal synaptic dysfunction after GCI, associated with reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and partial endogenous recovery over time. In this study, we tested whether delayed treatment with fluoxetine (FLX)-a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) known to enhance BDNF-TrkB signaling-could accelerate synaptic recovery. Juvenile mice underwent cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, followed by in vivo FLX or vehicle administration from postinjury days 10-13. Electrophysiological recordings on day 14 revealed that FLX restored hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in males but not females. This effect was paralleled by an increase in hippocampal BDNF expression in FLX-treated males, whereas no change was observed in females. Paired ex vivo experiments further confirmed that acute FLX exposure rescued LTP in GCI-injured male slices. These findings suggest that FLX promotes synaptic recovery through BDNF-TrkB signaling in males, while recovery in females may proceed via alternate, hormone-dependent mechanisms. Together, these results identify a novel therapeutic window for enhancing neuroplasticity after juvenile GCI and underscore the importance of developmental stage and biological sex in shaping responses to treatment.

TI  - Post-resuscitation talk in the intensive care unit: Living interprofessionalism-a must have!
T2  - MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN
AB  - Background: In the context of medical care, healthcare professionals are confronted with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which can have long-term effects on the participants. ObjectiveThe aim was to develop, implement, and evaluate a protocol-supported post-resuscitation talk for practice in the intensive care unit of a university hospital. Materials and methods: Within the evidence-based nursing working group, university-qualified nurses performed a systematic literature search in CareLit (hpsmedia, Hungen, Germany), the Cochrane Library (Cochrane, London, England), LIVIVO (Deutsche Zentralbibliothek fur Medizin, Cologne, Germany), and PubMed/MEDLINE (U.S. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) as well as using the snowball principle. Based on the results, the post-resuscitation talk and a debriefing protocol were developed and consented in a multiprofessional team. Additionally, a questionnaire to analyze the current situation (t(0)) and evaluate the implementation (t(1)) was developed. Results: Implementation of the post-resuscitation talk was conducted from August 2021. The t(0) survey took place from June to July 2021 and for t(1) from February to March 2022. In t(0), fewer interprofessional reflections were carried out after resuscitations in the category always or frequently (17.5%, n = 7) than in t(1) (50.0%, n = 13). The rate of initiated improvement interventions was increased (t(0): 24.3%, n = 9 vs. t(1): 59.1%, n = 13). The results show promotion of multiprofessional collaboration in t(0) and t(1), and potential for optimization in the debriefing protocol in t(1). Conclusion: Implementation of a post-resuscitation talk in hospitals is a useful tool for the structured interprofessional follow-up of resuscitation events. The results demonstrated initial positive effects and potential for optimization.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the older age groups in Melbourne, Australia
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Controversy exists around CPR in the elderly. The characteristics and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in this age group were studied in Melbourne, Australia.
   Methods: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) was searched for all OHCAs not witnessed by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) occurring in those aged 65 years and older.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2009 there were 30,006 OHCAs of which 9703 (32%) were in people 65-79 years of age, 6430 (21%) in octogenarians, 1530 (5%) in nonagenarian and 40 (0.1%) in centenarians. Rates of attempted resuscitation decreased with advancing age: 48% for those aged 65-79 years, 39% for octogenarians, 31% for nonagenarians and 17% for centenarians. Similarly rates of survival to hospital discharge decreased with age: 8% for those aged 65-79 years, 4% for octogenarians, 2% for nonagenarians; for 65-79 year olds, octogenarians and nonagenarians survival if in VF/VT was - 17%, 10% and 4%; asystole - 1%, 1% and 0.5%; and PEA - 6%, 3% and 3%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression shows that between 2000 and 2009 rates of transportation with return of spontaneous circulation have improved for both shockable and non-shockable rhythms [OR 95% CI 1.07(1.04-1.10) and 1.16(1.12-1.20), respectively] but survival to hospital discharge has improved in the shockable rhythm group only [OR 1.12(1.07-1.16)].
   Conclusion: Outcomes for OHCA with shockable rhythm have improved over the last 10 years for people aged 65 years and over. Quality of life studies should be performed to help inform the community and EMS on appropriate resuscitative efforts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Uric acid and sudden cardiac arrest: A more significant intermediate role of renal insufficiency than cardiac events
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND Although serum uric acid (SUA) has been frequently linked to a range of cardiorenal diseases, its potential role in disease trajectories leading to incident sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) has not been previously explored using a multistate modeling approach. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the long-term effect of SUA on SCA and the possible intermediate diseases. METHODS Based on the UK Biobank cohort, the Cox proportional hazard model was applied to explore associations between SUA and SCA. Chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were selected as intermediate conditions, and a multistate model was used for trajectory analysis. RESULTS Atotal of 468,427 participants were included. During a median follow-up of 14.5 years, 2972 participants developed SCA. The hazard ratios (HRs) for SCA were 1.12 (1.08-1.15) per 1 mg/dL increment of SUA. Restricted cubic spline demonstrated a significant positive and nonlinear correlation between SUA and risk of incident SCA (P for nonlinearity < .01). Most prominently, SUA and hyperuricemia could induce SCA by promoting transitions from baseline health to chronic kidney disease/acute kidney injury (HRs 1.10 and 1.29) and then to SCA (HRs 1.15 and 1.32). Less importantly, SCA could be developed through transitions from baseline health to MACE (HRs 1.05 and 1.14) and further to SCA (HRs 1.08 and 1.25). CONCLUSION This study provides novel and compelling evidence that the long-term effect of SUA could promote the develof SCA, with renal insufficiency emerging as a more significant intermediate condition than MACE.

TI  - Predictors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation utilization and survival during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out and in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promise in managing both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in -hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods: We analyzed hospital discharge records from the National Inpatient Sample of adult individuals who underwent ECPR between 2016 and 2020. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify fa ctors influencing ECPR utilization and survival. Results: Among 1,585,960 patients (901,470 OHCA, 684,490 IHCA), ECPR utilization rates were 1 % for OHCA and 1.4 % for IHCA, with inpatient mortality rates of 52 % and 67 %, respectively. In OHCA, ECPR was more likely in patients from higher-income areas, those with Medicaid/private insurance, systolic heart failure, shockable rhythms, and Hispanic/other races but less likely in those over 65, with patients with history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, or COPD. In IHCA, ECPR was more common in larger hospitals, higher-income areas, and those with private insurance but less frequent in Black patients, those over 65, or with prior cerebrovascular accidents, COPD, diabetes, or end-stage renal disease. In OHCA ECPR, Asian race (aOR: 2.31), diabetes (aOR: 1.29), and liver disease (aOR: 1.77) predicted mortality, while shockable rhythms (aOR: 0.75), systolic hear t failure (aOR: 0.67), and treatmentin southern states (aOR: 0.72) predicted survival. In IHCA ECPR, acute myocardial infarction (aOR: 0.73) and private insurance (aOR: 0.63) were associated with improved survival, whereas liver disease (aOR: 1.59) predicted higher mortality. Conclusion: We highlight the selective nature of ECPR utilization between OHCA and IHCA and the distinct survival predictors in each setting. Further research is needed to refi ne selection criteria and optimize patient outcomes.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to coronary artery spasm
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The clinical features of coronary artery spasm as a cause of cardiac arrest were determined in a prospective study on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: Coronary angiography was performed at admission in 300 consecutive patients with no obvious non-cardiac cause of OHCA. In survivors with no or minimal coronary artery stenosis, a second angiography with provocation test and electrophysiological testing were performed at I month. Results: Spasm was demonstrated in ten patients. Diagnosis was based upon (1) spontaneous spasm on the admission angiogram (3 patients), (2) transient significative ST-segment elevation at follow-up in patients with no or non-significant coronary artery lesions (4 patients) and (3) spasm during the I month provocation test (3 patients). Six patients survived at I month; spasm occurred during a new provocation test in five despite treatment with high dosage calcium channel blockers leading to coronary stenting in two, an internal cardiovertor defibrillator in one. and increased drug therapy with prolonged hospitalization in the remainder. At a mean follow-up of 55+/-27 months, no recurrent cardiac arrest occurred. Conclusion: Systematic coronary angiograms and provocation tests in survivors of OHCA allow prompt diagnosis of coronary artery spasm. Residual spasm despite treatment with calcium channel blockers is frequent. Therapy should therefore be guided by repetitive provocation tests, and seems to avoid recurrence of cardiac arrest.

TI  - The REVIVE Project: From Survival to Holistic Recovery-A Prospective Multicentric Evaluation of Cognitive, Emotional, and Quality-of-Life Outcomes in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background/Objectives: Most survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) may suffer from cognitive, mental difficulties, and fatigue, which negatively impact their quality of life, despite a good physical recovery. However, no definitive data are available on this topic, so this study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional screening system for OHCA survivors in Italy and the prevalence of these disorders. Methods: OHCA survivors discharged with good neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) <= 2 and modified Ranking Scale (mRS) <= 3) from hospitals in the "Lombardia CARe" registry will be evaluated by a clinical psychologist using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) at pre-discharge or within 15 days and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients with clinical issues will be referred for psychological support or to a community rehabilitation program. Feasibility will be defined as a recruitment rate >= 80% and acceptability as a retention rate >= 50% over 12 months. Results: Based on historical data from the Lombardia CARe, an estimated 350 eligible survivors are expected, which will allow estimation of a prevalence ranging between 20% and 30% with 5% precision and 95% confidence. Conclusions: This study will be the first in Italy to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional system for pre-/post-discharge evaluation of cognitive impairment, mental health, and quality of life in a large cohort of OHCA survivors, documenting the prevalence of these disorders.

TI  - Temporal Trends in the Incidence, Characteristics, and Outcomes of Hanging-Related Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to describe temporal trends in the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of hanging-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Method: A retrospective study of all hanging-related OHCA in Victoria, Australia, between 2000 and 2017 was conducted. Trends in incidence, characteristics, and outcomes were assessed using linear regression and a non-parametric test for trend, as appropriate. Predictors of survival to hospital discharge were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Between 2000 and 2017, emergency medical services (EMS)-attended 3,891 cases of hanging-related OHCA, of which 876 cases (23%) received an attempted resuscitation. The overall incidence rate of EMS-attended cases was 3.8 cases per 100,000 person-years increasing from 2.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2000 to 4.7 cases in 2017 (p for trend <0.001). Incidence rates increased approximately two-fold in young adults (18?44?years) and three-fold in middle aged adults (45?64?years). Despite improvement in the rate of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (from 49% in 2000?2005 to 75% in 2012?2017), the survival to hospital discharge rate remained unchanged (3% overall). Among adult survivors with 12-month follow-up (n = 10), five patients responded to telephone interviews. Of those, three (60%) reported severe functional disability. Five patients responded to telephone interviews, of which 3 patients reported severe functional disability. An initial shockable rhythm (OR 23.17, 95% CI: 5.75, 93.36) or pulseless electrical activity (OR 13.14, 95% CI: 4.79, 36.03) were associated with survival. Conclusion: The incidence of hanging-related OHCA doubled over the 18?year period with no change to survival rates. New preventative strategies are needed to reduce the community burden of these events.

TI  - Extracorporeal resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults: A systematic review of international practices and outcomes
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Extracorporeal resuscitation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) deploys rapid cardiopulmonary bypass to sustain oxygenated circulation until the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The purpose of this systematic review is to address the defining elements and outcomes (quality survival and organ donation) of currently active protocols for ECPR in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of cardiac origin in adult patients. The results may inform policy and practices for ECPR and help clarify the corrresponding intersection with deceased organ donation.
   Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and seven other electronic databases from 2005 to 2015, with no language restrictions. Internal validity and the quality of the studies reporting outcomes and guidelines were assessed. The review was included in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero, CRD42014015259).
   Results: One guideline and 20 outcome studies were analyzed. Half of the studies were prospective observational studies assessed to be of fair to good methodological quality. The remainder were retrospective cohorts, case series, and case studies. Ages ranged from 16 to 75 years and initial shockable cardiac rhythms, witnessed events, and a reversible primary cause of cardiac arrest were considered favorable prognostic factors. CPR duration and time to hospital cannulation varied considerably. Coronary revascularization, hemodynamic interventions and targeted temperature management neuroprotection were variable. A total of 833 patients receiving this ECPR approach had an overall reported survival rate of 22%, including 13% with good neurological recovery. Additionally, 88 potential and 17 actual deceased organ donors were identified among the non-survivor population in 8 out of 20 included studies. Study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis preventing any meaningful comparison between protocols, interventions and outcomes.
   Conclusions: ECPR is feasible for refractory OHCA of cardiac origin in adult patients. It may enable neurologically good survival in selected patients, who practically have no other alternative in order to save their lives with quality of life, and contribute to organ donation in those who die. Large, prospective studies are required to clarify patient selection, modifiable outcome variables, risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Interruption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with the use of the automated external defibrillator in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: The protocol for the use of the automated external defibrillator calls for a period of "hands-off" time, during which no cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be performed. We assessed the actual interruption time of CPR during the use of the automated external defibrillator in patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: This study included 184 patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in which an automated external defibrillator was applied by first responders. ECG and voice recordings from the automated external defibrillator were down-loaded and analyzed. Start and end times of CPR were recorded, as were intervals measured from the recordings concerning the programmed interruption time and the interruption time related to performance.
   Results: The automated external defibrillators were connected for a median time of 4 minutes 47 seconds (range 31 to 1,404 seconds). CPR was performed during 45%+/-15% (mean+/-SD) of the connected time or until return of spontaneous circulation. During the automated external defibrillator connection time in the 96 patients with a shockable rhythm, CPR was performed 36%+/-20% of the time. Programmed interruption of CPR took 40%+/-15% of the automated external defibrillator connection time, and no CPR was performed related to performance during 23%+/-15% of the time. A palpable pulse was never present immediately after a shock, and return of spontaneous circulation was observed in 3 of 184 patients before arrival of the ambulance. Ultimately, return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 87 of 184 patients.
   Conclusion: First responders using automated external defibrillator voice prompts provide CPR less than half the time that the automated external defibrillator is connected to the patient. Technical improvements in automated external defibrillator rhythm analysis, more efficient resuscitation algorithms, and first-responder education could increase CPR delivery and, perhaps, improve outcome.

TI  - Inflammatory response after prehospital high-dose glucocorticoid to patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A sub-study of the STEROHCA trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is characterized by a series of pathological events, including inflammation. In the randomized "STERoid for OHCA" (STEROHCA) trial, prehospital high-dose glucocorticoid decreased interleukin (IL) 6 and C-reactive protein levels following resuscitated OHCA. The aim of this predefined sub-study was to assess the inflammatory response the first three days of admission. Methods: The STEROHCA trial enrolled 137 OHCA patients randomized to either a single prehospital injection of methylprednisolone 250 mg or placebo. Inflammatory markers, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, were analyzed in plasma samples, from 0-, 24-, 48-, and 72 h post-admission. Mixed-model analyses were applied using log-transformed data to assess group differences. Results: The 137 patients included in this sub-study had a median age of 67 years (57 to 74), and the 180-day survival rates were 75% (n = 51/68) and 64% (n = 44/69) in the glucocorticoid and placebo group, respectively. A total of 130 (95%) patients had at least one plasma sample available. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased at hospital admission in the glucocorticoid group (ratio 2.74 (1.49-5.05), p = 0.006), but the intervention showed the strongest effect after 24 h, decreasing pro-inflammatory levels of IL-6 (ratio 0.06 (0.03-0.10), p < 0.001), IL-8 (ratio 0.53 (0.38-0.75), p < 0.001), macrophage chemokine protein-1 (MCP-1, ratio 0.02 (0.13-0.31), p < 0.001), macrophage inflammatory protein-1-beta (MIP-1b, ratio 0.28 (0.18-0.45), p < 0.001), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, ratio 0.6 (0.4-0.8), p = 0.01). Conclusion: Administering high-dose glucocorticoid treatment promptly after resuscitation from OHCA influenced the inflammatory response with a reduction in several systemic proinflammatory cytokines after 24 h.

TI  - Medical Guidelines for Airline Travel: Management of In-Flight Cardiac Arrest
T2  - AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although cardiac arrest during airline flights is relatively uncommon, the unusual setting, limited resources, and the variability of the skills in medical volunteers present unique challenges. Survival in patients who suffer a witnessed arrest with a shockable rhythm who are treated promptly has improved since the advent of widely available automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In general, the chances of survival from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are greater when ventricular fibrillation (VF) is seen as the initial rhythm or if there is return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Not all in-flight cardiac arrests are witnessed because cabin crew or fellow passengers might simply assume that the victim is sleeping. Based upon a review of the literature on resuscitation after OHCA, we recommend that automatic external defibrillators be carried on all commercial airline flights, regardless of duration. Patients presenting with shockable rhythm (e.g.,VF, unstable ventricular tachycardia) have the best prognosis for survival and usually require diversion of the aircraft for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Because diversion may require interruption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and may impact flight safety, the volunteer rescuer, cabin crew, flight crew, and medical consultation services should discuss the possible outcome and operational considerations before recommending a diversion for a patient with a nonshockable rhythm. The recommendations in this article were developed by members of the Air Transport Medicine and Aerospace Human Performance Committees and approved by the Council of the Aerospace Medical Association.

TI  - Single versus Serial Measurements of Neuron-Specific Enolase and Prediction of Poor Neurological Outcome in Persistently Unconscious Patients after Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest - A TTM-Trial Substudy
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Prediction of neurological outcome is a crucial part of post cardiac arrest care and prediction in patients remaining unconscious and/or sedated after rewarming from targeted temperature management (TTM) remains difficult. Current guidelines suggest the use of serial measurements of the biomarker neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in combination with other predictors of outcome in patients admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study sought to investigate the ability of NSE to predict poor outcome in patients remaining unconscious at day three after OHCA. In addition, this study sought to investigate if serial NSE measurements add incremental prognostic information compared to a single NSE measurement at 48 hours in this population.
   Methods
   This study is a post-hoc sub-study of the TTM trial, randomizing OHCA patients to a course of TTM at either 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C. Patients were included from sites participating in the TTM-trial biobank sub study. NSE was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours after ROSC and follow-up was concluded after 180 days. The primary end point was poor neurological function or death defined by a cerebral performance category score (CPC-score) of 3 to 5.
   Results
   A total of 685 (73%) patients participated in the study. At day three after OHCA 63 (9%) patients had died and 473 (69%) patients were not awake. In these patients, a single NSE measurement at 48 hours predicted poor outcome with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.83. A combination of all three NSE measurements yielded the highest discovered AUC (0.88, p = .0002). Easily applicable combinations of serial NSE measurements did not significantly improve prediction over a single measurement at 48 hours (AUC 0.58-0.84 versus 0.83).
   Conclusion
   NSE is a strong predictor of poor outcome after OHCA in persistently unconscious patients undergoing TTM, and NSE is a promising surrogate marker of outcome in clinical trials. While combinations of serial NSE measurements may provide an increase in overall prognostic information, it is unclear whether actual clinical prognostication with low false-positive rates is improved by application of serial measurements in persistently unconscious patients. The findings of this study should be confirmed in another prospective cohort.

TI  - Instantaneous amplitude: Association of ventricular fibrillation waveform measures at time of shock with outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Prompt defibrillation is key to successful resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (VF-OHCA). Preliminary evidence suggests that the timing of shock relative to the amplitude of the VF ECG waveform may affect the likelihood of resuscitation. We investigated whether the VF waveform amplitude at the time of shock (instantaneous amplitude) predicts outcome independent of other validated waveform measures.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of VF-OHCA patients >= 18 old. We evaluated three VF waveform measures for each shock: instantaneous amplitude at the time of shock, and maximum amplitude and amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) over a 3-s window preceding the shock. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to determine whether instantaneous amplitude was associated with shock-specific return of organized rhythm (ROR) or return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) independent of maximum amplitude or AMSA.Results: The 566 eligible patients received 1513 shocks, resulting in ROR of 62.0% (938/1513) and ROSC of 22.3% (337/1513). In unadjusted regression, an interquartile increase in instantaneous amplitude was associated with ROR (Odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval] = 1.27 [1.11-1.45]) and ROSC (OR = 1.27 [1.14-1.42]). However, instantaneous amplitude was not associated with ROR (OR = 1.13 [0.97-1.30]) after accounting for maximum amplitude, nor with ROR (OR = 1.00 [0.87-1.15]) or ROSC (OR = 1.05 [0.93-1.18]) after accounting for AMSA. By contrast, AMSA and maximum amplitude remained independently associated with ROR and ROSC.Conclusions: We did not observe an independent association between instantaneous amplitude and shock-specific outcomes. Efforts to time shock to the maximal amplitude of the VF waveform are unlikely to affect resuscitation outcome.

TI  - Survivors' quality of life after cardiopulmonary resuscitation: an integrative review of the literature
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES
AB  - Background: The incidence of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation continues to increase worldwide largely due to greater awareness of the symptoms of cardiac events and increased attention to cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in the community. Globally, predicted survival rates after cardiopulmonary resuscitation have remained at 10% for decades and although patient outcome remains unpredictable, there is a positive trend in life expectancy. For a resuscitation attempt to be classed as successful, not only survival but also quality of life has to be evaluated.
   Aim: The aim of this review was to examine literature that explores the quality of life (QOL) for survivors' after CPR and the influence cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has had on their QOL.
   Review methods: This review follows Whittemore and Knafl's framework for an integrative literature review. Electronic databases EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed and EMBASE were searched. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, thirty-six papers published from January 2000 to June 2015 were included in this review.
   Results: These papers represent a broad spectrum of research evaluating quality of life for survivors of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The heterogeneous research methods and vast number of different research tools make it challenging to compare the findings. The majority of papers concluded that quality of life for survivors of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was generally acceptable. However, studies also described survivors' experience of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and cognitive dysfunction.
   Conclusion: A majority of papers reported an acceptable quality of life if the patient survived to hospital discharge. The heterogeneity in quantitative papers was noticeable and indicates a marked variance in patient outcomes. This review highlights the absence of specialized tools used to investigate survivors' experience of the event. Further exploration of the impact cardiopulmonary resuscitation has on the individual may improve ongoing rehabilitation and quality of life levels for survivors.

TI  - Long- and short-term outcomes following coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with and without chronic kidney disease
T2  - NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Background. Improved understanding of the incidence and risk factors for operative complications and long-term mortality following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is needed to better define the optimal role for CABG in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Methods. We analysed 2438 patients who underwent CABG at a single centre between 2005 and 2008. Multi-variable regression was used to analyse associations and to generate a CKD-specific predictive tool.
   Results. Operative mortality was 4.8% in individuals with stage 3 CKD, 7.1% in individuals with stage 4-5 CKD and 2.2% in those without significant CKD (P < 0.001). CKD was associated with post-operative blood transfusion, acute kidney injury, myocardial injury and cardiac arrest, and use of exogenous blood and acute kidney injury were strongly associated with in-hospital death in CKD patients. Patients with stage 3 (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.30-45.94) and stage 4-5 CKD (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.00-2.68) were more likely to die during follow-up than those without CKD, but mortality rates were low among patients who survived to discharge-stage 3 (0.006 deaths/year) and stage 4-5 CKD (0.009/year). A scoring system including urgent or emergent surgery (OR 2.30), prior cardiac surgery (OR 3.06), concurrent valve surgery (OR 2.06), preoperative shock (OR 6.18), and prior stroke (OR 1.98) had 96.4% percent specificity for the detection of in-hospital death in patients with CKD.
   Conclusions. Perioperative mortality and morbidity remain more frequent in patients with stage 3-5 CKD than patients with preserved renal function, but long-term outcomes in patients surviving hospitalization are favourable. We have developed a predictive tool that holds promise as a means of identifying CKD patients most likely to survive surgery and benefit from CABG.

TI  - Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest Without ST Segment Elevation: One-Year Outcomes of the COACT Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA CARDIOLOGY
AB  - ImportanceIschemic heart disease is a common cause of cardiac arrest. However, randomized data on long-term clinical outcomes of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest in the absence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are lacking. ObjectiveTo determine whether immediate coronary angiography improves clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients after cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI, compared with a delayed coronary angiography strategy. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA prespecified analysis of a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluated 552 patients who were enrolled in 19 Dutch centers between January 8, 2015, and July 17, 2018. The study included patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm who were successfully resuscitated without signs of STEMI. Follow-up was performed at 1 year. Data were analyzed, using the intention-to-treat principle, between August 29 and October 10, 2019. InterventionsImmediate coronary angiography and PCI if indicated or coronary angiography and PCI if indicated, delayed until after neurologic recovery. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSurvival, myocardial infarction, revascularization, implantable cardiac defibrillator shock, quality of life, hospitalization for heart failure, and the composite of death or myocardial infarction or revascularization after 1 year. ResultsAt 1 year, data on 522 of 552 patients (94.6%) were available for analysis. Of these patients, 413 were men (79.1%); mean (SD) age was 65.4 (12.3) years. A total of 162 of 264 patients (61.4%) in the immediate angiography group and 165 of 258 patients (64.0%) in the delayed angiography group were alive (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63-1.28). The composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or repeated revascularization since the index hospitalization was met in 112 patients (42.9%) in the immediate group and 104 patients (40.6%) in the delayed group (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.77-1.56). No significant differences between the groups were observed for the other outcomes at 1-year follow-up. For example, the rate of ICD shocks was 20.4% in the immediate group and 16.2% in the delayed group (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.66-2.64). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this trial of patients successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without signs of STEMI, a strategy of immediate angiography was not found to be superior to a strategy of delayed angiography with respect to clinical outcomes at 1 year. Coronary angiography in this patient group can therefore be delayed until after neurologic recovery without affecting outcomes.

TI  - Management of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Complicating Acute Coronary Syndromes
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of the Review Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) complicating acute coronary syndromes (ACS) continues to carry a high rate of morbidity and mortality despite significant advances in EMS and interventional cardiology services. In this review, we discuss an evidence-based approach to the initial care and management of patients with OHCA complicating ACS from the pre-hospital response and initial resuscitation strategy, to advanced therapies such as coronary angiography, targeted-temperature management, neuro-prognostication, and care of the post-arrest patient. Recent Findings Early recognition of cardiac arrest and prompt initiation of bystander CPR are the most important factors associated with improved survival. A comprehensive and coordinated approach to in-hospital management, including PCI, targeted temperature management, critical care, and hemodynamic support represents a significant critical link in the chain of survival. OHCA complicated by ACS continues to be one of the most challenging disease states facing healthcare practitioners and maintains a high mortality rate despite substantial advancements in healthcare delivery. A comprehensive approach to in-hospital management and further exploration of novel interventions, including ECMO, may yield opportunities to optimize care and improve outcomes for cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Neurologic Outcomes in a Two-Center Cohort of Neonatal and Pediatric Patients Supported on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
T2  - ASAIO JOURNAL
AB  - Contemporary studies of long-term outcomes in children supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the United States are limited. We enrolled 99 ECMO patients between July 2010 and June 2015 in a two-center prospective observational study that included neurologic and neuropsychologic evaluation at 6 and 12 months, using standardized outcome measures. Pre-ECMO, 20 (20%) had a pre-existing neurologic diagnosis, 40 (40%) had cardiac arrest, and 10 of 47 (21%) children with neuroimaging had acute abnormal findings. Of 50 children eligible for follow-up at 6 or 12 months, 40 (80%) returned for at least one visit. At the follow-up visit of longest interval from ECMO, the median Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) score was 91 (interquartile range [IQR], 81-98), the median Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) score was 1 (IQR, 0-2), and the median Mullen Scales of Early Learning composite score was 85 (IQR, 72-96). Presence of new neuroimaging abnormalities during ECMO or within 6 weeks post-ECMO was associated with VABS-II score <85 or death within 12 months after ECMO. The Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category at hospital discharge showed a strong relationship with unfavorable VABS-II and PSOM scores at 6 or 12 months after ECMO. In this study, we report a higher prevalence of pre-ECMO neurologic conditions than previously described. In survivors to hospital discharge, median scores for adaptive behavior and cognitive, neurologic, and quality of life assessments were all below the general population means, but most deficits would be considered minor within each of the domains tested.

TI  - Therapeutic Efficacy of Craniocerebral Hypothermia Helmet Versus Arctic Sun Surface Cooling System in Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome: A Prospective Comparative Study
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia is a critical intervention in post-cardiac arrest care, yet the optimal cooling method remains debatable. This prospective, single-center study compared the efficacy of a novel craniocerebral hypothermia helmet with the Arctic Sun 5000 surface cooling system in post-cardiac arrest patients. Thirty-four comatose survivors of cardiac arrest were randomized to receive either craniocerebral hypothermia (n = 17) or peripheral surface cooling (n = 17). Target temperature management (32-34 degrees C) was initiated within 30-120 minutes of return of spontaneous circulation and maintained for 36-48 hours. Craniocerebral hypothermia demonstrated significantly faster cooling initiation (32.9 +/- 13.5 vs. 238 +/- 25.7 minutes, p < 0.001) compared with peripheral cooling, while both methods achieved similar target temperature maintenance. The craniocerebral group showed better preservation of renal function and electrolyte stability, with significantly lower increases in serum creatinine and urea levels (p < 0.001). Hospital stays were notably shorter in the craniocerebral group (13 +/- 7 vs. 24.29 +/- 31 days, p < 0.001). While both methods achieved comparable survival rates, the craniocerebral group exhibited a lower incidence of seizures (17.6% vs. 66.6%) and improved neurological outcomes based on Cerebral Performance Category scores though not reaching statistical significance. These findings suggest that craniocerebral hypothermia offers advantages in terms of rapid cooling initiation, physiological stability, and reduced hospital stay, representing a promising alternative for targeted temperature management in post-cardiac arrest care. The enhanced practicality and comparable efficacy of this approach warrant further investigation through larger multicenter trials.

T2  - CARDIOLOGY IN THE YOUNG
AB  - Background: Although survival to hospital discharge among children requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for medical and surgical cardio-circulatory failure has been reported in international registries, extended survival and re-hospitalisation rates have not been well described in the literature. Material and methods: This is a single-institution, retrospective review of all paediatric patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for primary cardiac dysfunction over a 5-year period. Results: A total of 74 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs in 68 patients were identified, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years from hospital discharge. Overall, 66% of patients were decannulated alive and 25 patients (37%) survived to discharge. There were three late deaths at 5 months, 20 months, and 6.8 years from discharge. Of the hospital survivors, 88% required re-hospitalisation, with 63% of re-admissions for cardiac indications. The median number of hospitalisations per patient per year was 0.62, with the first re-admission occurring at a mean time of 9 months after discharge from the index hospitalisation. In all, 38% of patients required further cardiac surgery. Conclusions: Extended survival rates for paediatric hospital survivors of cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for medical and post-surgical indications are encouraging. However, re-hospitalisation within the first year following hospital discharge is common, and many patients require further cardiac surgery. Although re-admission hospital mortality is low, longer-term follow-up of quality-of-life indicators is required.

TI  - European Registry of Cardiac Arrest - Study-THREE (EuReCa THREE) - An international, prospective, multi-centre, three-month survey of epidemiology, treatment and outcome of patients with out-of- hospital cardiac arrest in Europe - The study protocol
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: The aim of the European Registry of Cardiac Arrest (EuReCa) network is to provide high quality evidence on epidemiology of out-of -hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Europe by supporting and developing cardiac arrest registries and performing European-wide studies. To date, the EuReCa ONE and EuReCa TWO studies have involved around 28 countries, with population covered increasing from the first to the second study. The aim of the EuReCa THREE study is to build on previous work and to support the promotion of quality data collection on OHCA throughout Europe. Methods/design: EuReCa THREE will be the third prospective cohort study on epidemiology of OHCA and will involve around 30 European coun-tries. The study will be conducted between 1st September and 30th November 2022. Data will be collected on cardiac arrest cases attended, resus-citation attempted, patient and cardiac arrest event characteristics and outcomes (including return of spontaneous circulation, status on hospital arrival and discharge). A particular focus for EuReCa THREE will be to describe key time intervals in OHCA management; time from call to EMS arrival on scene, time from cardiac arrest to start CPR, time from EMS arrival to delivery of patient to hospital. EuReCa THREE was registered with the German Registry of Clinical Trials Registration Number: DRKS00028591 searchable via WHO meta -registry (https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/). Discussion: The EuReCa THREE study will increase our knowledge on longitudinal OHCA epidemiology and provide new knowledge on crucial time intervals in OHCA management in Europe. However, the primary aim of building a network to support quality data on OHCA, remains the central tenant of the EuReCa project.

TI  - Mechanical Circulatory Support Following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Insights From the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Evidence is limited regarding the role of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CGS). In particular, the role of MCS in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is unknown.
   Methods: The National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative (NCSI) is a multicenter United States registry of patients with ACS complicated by CGS treated with MCS. We compared the rate of survival to hospital discharge among patients with OHCA, in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), or no cardiac arrest. We subsequently used multivariable analyses to determine independent predictors of OHCA survival.
   Results: Survival to hospital discharge occurred in 85.7% (42/49) of OHCA. 72.4% (50/69) of MCA, and 74.5% (111/ 149) of non-cardiac arrest patients. By multivariable analysis, pre-procedural predictors of survival included younger age, female sex, fewer diseased vessels, left anterior descending coronary artery culprit, lower troponin, higher lactate, and delayed initiation of MCS. Procedural and post-procedural predictors of survival included fewer vessels treated, complete revascularization, higher post-MCS cardiac power output, and fewer inotropic medications required.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that excellent outcomes may be achieved following OHCA when MCS is employed for patients appropriately selected by prognostic demographic, anatomic, and health status characteristics. A larger study population, currently being enrolled, is needed to validate the observation further. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Life-threatening massive pulmonary embolism rescued by venoarterialextracorporeal membrane oxygenation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Despite quick implementation of reperfusion therapies, a few patients with high-risk, acute, massive, pulmonary embolism (PE) remain highly hemodynamically unstable. Others have absolute contraindication to receive reperfusion therapies. Venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) might lower their right ventricular overload, improve hemodynamic status, and restore tissue oxygenation.
   Methods: ECMO-related complications and 90-day mortality were analyzed for 17 highly unstable, ECMO-treated, massive PE patients admitted to a tertiary-care center (2006-2015). Hospital-discharge survivors were assessed for long-term health-related quality of life. A systematic review of this topic was also conducted.
   Results: Seventeen high-risk PE patients [median age 51 (range 18-70) years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score parallel to (SAPS II) 78 (45-95)] were placed on VA-ECMO for 4 (1-12) days. Among 15 (82%) patients with pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, seven (41%) were cannulated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and eight (47%) underwent pre-ECMO thrombolysis. Pre-ECMO median blood pressure, pH, and blood lactate were, respectively: 42 (0-106) mmHg, 6.99 (6.54-7.37) and 13 (4-19) mmol/L. Ninety-day survival was 47%. Fifteen (88%) patients suffered in-ICU severe hemorrhages with no impact on survival. Like other ECMO-treated patients, ours reported limitations of all physical domains but preserved mental health 19 (4-69) months post-ICU discharge.
   Conclusions: VA-ECMO could be a lifesaving rescue therapy for patients with high-risk, acute, massive PE when thrombolytic therapy fails or the patient is too sick to benefit from surgical thrombectomy. Because heparin-induced clot dissolution and spontaneous fibrinolysis allows ECMO weaning within several days, future studies should investigate whether VA-ECMO should be the sole therapy or completed by additional mechanical clot-removal therapies in this setting.

TI  - Improving survival after cardiac arrest in Europe: The synergetic effect of rescue chain strategies
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest is a global problem and is considered the third leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Patient survival rates after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) vary significantly between countries and continents. In particular, the 2021 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Resuscitation Guidelines place a special focus on the chain of survival of patients after OHCA. As a complex, interconnected approach, the focus is on: Raising awareness for cardiac arrest and lay resuscitation, school children's education in resuscitation "KIDS SAVE LIVES", first responder systems - technologies to engage the community, telephone-assisted resuscitation (telephone-CPR; T-CPR) by dispatchers, and cardiac arrest centers (CAC) for further treatment in specialized hospitals. The Systems Saving Lives approach is a comprehensive strategy that empha-sizes the interconnectedness of all links in the chain of survival following an OHCA, with a particular focus on the relationship between the community and emergency medical services (EMS). This system-level approach emphasizes the importance of the connection between all those involved in the chain of survival. It has a high potential to improve overall survival after OHCA. Therefore, it is recommended that these strategies be promoted and expanded in all countries.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs. conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a pre-planned, trial-based economic evaluation
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims When out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) becomes refractory, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a potential option to restore circulation and improve the patient's outcome. However, ECPR requires specific materials and highly skilled personnel, and it is unclear whether increased survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) justify these costs.Methods and results This cost-effectiveness study was part of the INCEPTION study, a multi-centre, pragmatic randomized trial comparing hospital-based ECPR to conventional CPR (CCPR) in patients with refractory OHCA in 10 cardiosurgical centres in the Netherlands. We analysed healthcare costs in the first year and measured HRQOL using the EQ-5D-5L at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-effectiveness planes, and acceptability curves were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for per-protocol and as-treated subgroups as well as imputed productivity loss in deceased patients. In total, 132 patients were enrolled: 62 in the CCPR and 70 in the ECPR group. The difference in mean costs after 1 year was <euro>5109 (95% confidence interval -7264 to 15 764). Mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) after 1 year was 0.15 in the ECPR group and 0.11 in the CCPR group, resulting in an ICER of <euro>121 643 per additional QALY gained. The acceptability curve shows that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of <euro>80.000, the probability of ECPR being cost-effective compared with CCPR is 36%. Sensitivity analysis showed increasing ICER in the per-protocol and as-treated groups and lower probabilities of acceptance.Conclusion Hospital-based ECPR in refractory OHCA has a low probability of being cost-effective in a trial-based economic evaluation.

TI  - Increment of C-peptide after glucagon injection determines the progressive nature of Japanese type 2 diabetes: A long-term follow-up study
T2  - ENDOCRINE JOURNAL
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by a steady worsening of beta-cell dysfunction as the disease progresses. The objective of this study was to estimate the decline of insulin secretion in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (T2D-patients) by glucagon injection over an observation period of more than 10 years. Thirty-three T2D-patients were followed for 10.4 +/- 1.4 years. Fasting C-peptide immunoreactivity (FCPR), the 6 min value of CPR after glucagon injection (6MCPR), and the increment of CPR (Delta CPR) were measured at baseline and follow-up. FCPR, 6MCPR, Delta CPR were significantly lower at follow-up than at baseline (p<0.05, p<0.005, and p<0.0005, respectively). The annual change of Delta CPR was significantly (p<0.05) greater than the annual change of FCPR (-0.062 +/- 0.076 ng/mL/year and -0.025 +/- 0.067 ng/mL/year, respectively). In contrast, CPR-index (an index of beta-cell function) and SUIT-index (secretory units of islets in transplantation) calculated based on fasting blood samples were unaltered. The annual changes of FCPR, 6MCPR, and Delta CPR were negatively correlated with the FCPR, 6MCPR, and Delta CPR values at baseline, respectively. Duration of diabetes, BMI, diabetic retinopathy, and secondary sulfonylurea failure at baseline were not correlated with the annual changes of FCPR, 6MCPR, and Delta CPR. In conclusion, our longitudinal observations suggest that beta-cell function progressively declines in Japanese T2D-patients. The annual declines of Delta CPR were more prominent than the annual declines of FCPR. Delta CPR after glucagon injection may be more useful for estimating individual longitudinal insulin secretion than fasting blood samples.

TI  - Intraosseous Versus Intravenous Vascular Access in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background. Establishing prompt vascular access facilitates resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). While intraosseous access may decrease the time to vascular access, the impact on clinical outcomes in OHCA is unclear. Therefore, we aim to compare the effect of intraosseous (IO) versus intravenous (IV) vascular access on clinical outcomes after OHCA resuscitation. Methods. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) obtained from PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science until January 2025. Using Stata MP v. 17, we used the fixed-effects model to report dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). PROSPERO ID: CRD42024627354. Results. Four RCTs and 9475 patients were included. There was no difference between both groups regarding the prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (RR: 0.97, 95% CI [0.91, 1.03], p = 0.33), maintained ROSC (RR: 0.94, 95% CI [0.87, 1.01], p = 0.09), survival to discharge (RR: 1.03 with 95% CI [0.88, 1.21], p = 0.71), 30-day survival (RR: 0.98, 95% CI [0.82, 1.17], p = 0.79), or favorable neurological recovery (RR: 1.07, 95% CI [0.90, 1.29], p = 0.44). However, IO access significantly increased first-attempt access (RR: 1.24, 95% CI [1.19, 1.29], p < 0.001), decreased time to vascular access (MD: -0.24 min with 95% CI [-0.48, -0.01], p = 0.04), and decreased time to drug administration (MD: -0.38, 95% CI [-0.66, -0.10], p = 0.01). Conclusions. IO and IV vascular accesses showed similar clinical outcomes in OHCA patients, with no difference in ROSC, survival, or neurological recovery. Still, IO access showed a better procedural outcome with increased first-attempt success rates, faster access, and faster drug administration.

TI  - RETRACTED: Metformin prevents brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and activating AMPK-mediated autophagy (Retracted Article)
T2  - SCOTTISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background and aims The neurological damage caused by cardiac arrest (CA) can seriously affect quality of life. We investigated the effect of metformin pretreatment on brain injury and survival in a rat CA/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) model. Methods and results After 14 days of pretreatment with metformin, rats underwent 9 minutes of asphyxia CA/CPR. Survival was evaluated 7 days after restoration of spontaneous circulation; neurological deficit scale (NDS) score was evaluated at days 1, 3, and 7. Proteins related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and autophagy were measured using immunoblotting. Seven-day survival was significantly improved and NDS score was significantly improved in rats pretreated with metformin. Metformin enhanced AMPK-induced autophagy activation. AMPK and autophagy inhibitors removed the metformin neuroprotective effect. Although metformin inhibited the ER stress response, its inhibitory effect was weaker than 4-PBA. Conclusion In a CA/CPR rat model, 14-day pretreatment with metformin has a neuroprotective effect. This effect is closely related to the activation of AMPK-induced autophagy and inhibition of the ER stress response. Long-term use of metformin can reduce brain damage following CA/CPR.

TI  - Compression-only versus standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - PERFUSION-UK
AB  - Background: Bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can improve survival rates in individuals with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Two CPR approaches are commonly utilized, standard (S-CPR) with mouth-to-mouth breathing and compression-only (CO-CPR). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare clinical outcomes associated with S-CPR versus CO-CPR in OHCA. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on adult OHCA patients receiving CO-CPR or S-CPR. Forest plots were generated for pooled data analysis using Review Manager version 5.4. Random-effect analyses were used, and statistical significance was set at p < .05. Results: Four randomized controlled trials were included in the final analysis, encompassing a total sample size of 4987 patients (2482 in the CO-CPR group and 2505 in the S-CPR group). CO-CPR was associated with significantly improved 1-day survival compared with S-CPR (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02-1.31; p = .03) and survival to hospital discharge (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01-1.55; p = .04). No heterogeneity was observed among the studies for either outcome. Conclusion: CO-CPR emerges as a promising strategy for improving outcomes in OHCA compared to S-CPR. However, further large-scale RCTs are required to generate more robust evidence.

TI  - Implementation of Basic Life Support training in schools: a randomised controlled trial evaluating self-regulated learning as alternative training concept
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background The Kids save lives statement recommends annual Basic Life Support (BLS) training for school children but the implementation is challenging. Trainings should be easy to realise and every BLS training should be as effective as possible to prepare learners for lifesaving actions. Preparedness implies skills and positive beliefs in the own capability (high self-efficacy). Methods This randomized controlled cluster study investigates, if self-regulated learning promotes self-efficacy and long-term retention of practical BLS skills. Students in the age of 12 years participated in a practical training in BLS and a scenario testing of skills. In the control group the practical training was instructor-led. In the intervention group the students self-regulated their learning processes and feedback was provided by the peer-group. The primary outcome self-efficacy for helping in cardiac arrest after the training and 9 months later was analysed using a multilevel mixed model. Means and pass-rates for BLS skills were secondary outcomes. Results Contrary to the assumptions, this study could not measure a higher self-efficacy for helping in cardiac arrest of the students participating in the intervention (n = 307 students) compared to the control group (n = 293 students) after training and at the follow-up (mean difference: 0.11 points, 95% CI: - 0.26 to 0.04, P = 0.135). The odds to pass all items of the BLS exam was not significantly different between the groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.52, p = 0.533). Self-regulated learning was associated with a higher performance of male students in the BLS exam (mean score: 7.35) compared to females of the intervention (female: 7.05) and compared to males of the control (7.06). Conclusion This study could not resolve the question, if self-regulated learning in peer-groups improves self-efficacy for helping in cardiac arrest. Self-regulated learning is an effective alternative to instructor-led training in BLS skills training and may be feasible to realise for lay-persons. For male students self-regulated learning seems to be beneficial to support long-term retention of skills.

TI  - Identifying patients at risk of futile resuscitation: palliative care indicators in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - Objectives Patients with indicators for palliative care, such as those with advanced life-limiting conditions, are at risk of futile cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Patients at risk of futile CPR could benefit from anticipatory care planning (ACP); however, the proportion of OHCA patients with indicators for palliative care is unknown. This study quantifies the extent of palliative care indicators and risk of CPR futility in OHCA patients. Methods A retrospective medical record review was performed on all OHCA patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) in Edinburgh, Scotland in 2015. The risk of CPR futility was stratified using the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool. Patients with 0-2 indicators had a 'low risk' of futile CPR; 3-4 indicators had an 'intermediate risk'; 5+ indicators had a 'high risk'. Results Of the 283 OHCA patients, 12.4% (35) had a high risk of futile CPR, while 16.3% (46) had an intermediate risk and 71.4% (202) had a low risk. 84.0% (68) of intermediate-to-high risk patients were pronounced dead in the ED or ED step-down ward; only 2.5% (2) of these patients survived to discharge. Conclusions Up to 30% of OHCA patients are being subjected to advanced resuscitation despite having at least three indicators for palliative care. More than 80% of patients with an intermediate-to-high risk of CPR futility are dying soon after conveyance to hospital, suggesting that ACP can benefit some OHCA patients. This study recommends optimising emergency treatment planning to help reduce inappropriate CPR attempts.

TI  - Neurological rehabilitation of severely disabled cardiac arrest survivors. Part II. Life situation of patients and families after treatment
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: About half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors experience secondary anoxic brain damage. Neurological outcome can be influenced by rehabilitative treatment approaches, but the nature and severity of persistent disabilities remain unclear. The aim of the study was to explore persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms, global function and life situation of these patients, and to evaluate quality of life in families. Methods: 25 months after inpatient rehabilitation, 12 individuals (mean age = 51 years; ten M: two F) attended a cross-sectional interdisciplinary follow-up assessment with their carers. Function was investigated by clinical rating scales, neuropsychological standard tests, and clinical psychological inventories. Family members were asked about quality of life and satisfaction with social support. Results: All patients had deficits in at least one or more cognitive areas such as orientation, memory, alertness, and awareness. Three different clinical syndromes were observed: very severe intellectual and physical impairment, (two), mild to moderate dementia, (five), and amnesic syndrome, (five). Prevalence of multiple disabilities, was high. A striking discrepancy was found between self and proxy rating of disabilities (P < 0.01). Family members faced dramatically altered life situations after CA; 60% of spouses suffered from psychosomatic problems, 50% complained of lack of social support. Conclusion: Despite optimal in-hospital treatment, severe anoxic brain damage resulted in permanent cognitive decline, impaired awareness and self care ability. Families felt isolated, and more than half need more support to prevent burn out. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comprehensive description of self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Self-reported health and life satisfaction are considered important outcomes in people surviving cardiac arrest. However, most previous studies have reported limited aspects on health, often based on composite scores, and few studies have focused on life satisfaction. Investigating health aspects with a broad and detailed perspective is important to increase the knowledge of life after cardiac arrest from the perspective of survivors. In addition, the knowledge of potential differences in health among survivors related to place of arrest (in-hospital cardiac arrest; IHCA or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; OHCA) is scarce. The aim was to describe and compare self-reported health and life satisfaction in IHCA and OHCA survivors. Methods This observational cross-sectional study included adult cardiac arrest survivors six months after resuscitation, treated at five Swedish hospitals between 2013 and 2018. Participants received a study specific questionnaire including Health Index (HI), EQ-5D 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Minimal Insomnia Sleeping Scale (MISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). In order to present characteristics descriptive statistics were applied. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fishers' exact test were used to compare differences in self-reported health and life satisfaction between in-hospital- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors Results In total, 212 survivors participated. Based on scale scores and general measures, the median scores of health and life satisfaction among survivors were high: HI total = 29, EQ VAS = 80, and SWLS = 20. According to HI, most problems were reported for tiredness (37.3 %) and strength (26.4 %), while pain/discomfort (57.5 %) and anxiety/depression (42.5 %) where most common according to EQ-5D-5L. Except for EQ-5D-5L mobility (p = 0.023), MSPSS significant other (p = 0.036), and MSPSS family (p = 0.043), no health differences in relation to place of arrest were identified. Conclusions Although general health and life satisfaction were good among cardiac arrest survivors, several prevalent health problems were reported regardless of place of arrest. To achieve an improved understanding of health in cardiac arrest survivors, it is important to assess specific symptoms as a complement to composite scores of general, physical, emotional, and social health.

TI  - Comparison of prehospital resuscitation quality during scene evacuation and early ambulance transport in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between residential location and non-residential location
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: High-quality prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is important for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We aimed to evaluate prehospital CPR quality during scene evacuation and early ambulance transport in patients with OHCA according to the type of cardiac arrest location.Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study enrolled patients with non-traumatic adult OHCA in Seoul between July 2020 and March 2022. Prehospital CPR quality data extracted from defibrillators were merged with the national OHCA database. The location of cardiac arrest was categorized into two groups (residential and non-residential). CPR quality indices including no-flow (any pause >1.5 s) fraction were compared according to the type of arrest location at each minute of EMS scene evacuation and early ambulance transport (5 min prior to 5 min after ambulance departure).Results: A total of 1,222 OHCAs were enrolled in the final analysis after serial exclusion. A total of 966 OHCAs (79.1%) occurred in the residential areas. The CPR quality deteriorated during the scene evacuation in both location type. The mean no-flow fractions were significantly higher in res-idential places than in non-residential places. The mean proportion of adequate compression depth and rate was lower in cardiac arrests in residen-tial places. The discrepancy in EMS CPR quality during scene evacuation was more prominent when mechanical CPR devices were not used. Conclusion: Deterioration of CPR quality was observed just before and during early ambulance transport, especially when the cardiac arrest loca-tion was a residential area or when only manual CPR was provided.

TI  - Improving the efficiency of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with an inspiratory impedance threshold valve
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 5th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - In an effort to improve the efficiency of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a new inspiratory impedance threshold valve has been developed to enhance the return of blood to the thorax during the chest decompression phase. This new device enhances negative intrathoracic pressure during chest wall recoil or the decompression phase, leading to improved vital organ perfusion during both standard CPR and active compression-decompression CPR. With active compression-decompression CPR, addition of the impedance threshold valve results in sustained diastolic pressures of >55 mm Hg in patients in cardiac arrest, The new valve shows promise for patients in asystole or shock refractory ventricular fibrillation, when enhanced return of blood flow to the chest is needed to "prime the pump." The potential long-term benefits of this new valve remain under study.

TI  - Case study: A positive cognitive outcome following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT
AB  - Objective Time is critical with any out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The possibility of brain cell death increases, and the likelihood of a "good" outcome decreases with time. The most prominent impairments involve memory and attentional difficulties. Limited research and few cases have shown positive cognitive results following an OHCA to the extent that this case study depicts. Method The current case study presents a right-handed male in his late 40s, with master's and law degrees, and a high-level functioning in the workplace who experienced an OHCA. He was treated for his OHCA and subsequently underwent neuropsychological testing less than 2 months following his hospital discharge. Results Expected results suggest impairments in key cognitive areas; however, a neuropsychological exam less than 2-months post-incident, testing pre-morbid IQ, overall cognitive ability, processing speed, attention, executive functioning, language, visuospatial abilities, and memory; each showing normal or better results. Additionally, self and collateral report questionnaires examining cognitive and emotional functioning reported no difficulties and no major changes since his cardiac arrest. Conclusions We speculate that this patient's exceptional outcome might be due to his cognitive reserve, and the immediateness of his intervention (5-10 min of CPR and return-of-spontaneous-circulation from an AED shock) and use of a saline cooling procedure upon arrival to the hospital. Overall, we highlight a patient with a remarkable cognitive outcome, utilizing data from neuropsychological testing within 2-months post-incident, and propose protective factors in neuropsychological functioning following an OHCA.

TI  - LncRNA MSTRG.13,871/miR155-5p/Grip1 network involved in the post-cardiac arrest brain injury
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain (PCABI) is a severe medical condition characterized by a significant risk of neurological impairment and death. Nevertheless, the specific process and essential molecules responsible for its development are not fully understood. Profiling based on competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) has been implicated in the onset and progression of neurological disorders, yet its role in PCABI remains unclear. In this study, we performed RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in the rat model for cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). A hub ceRNA regulatory network was constructed using miRWalk 2.0 and Cytohubba plug-in in Cytoscape. Subsequently, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and dual-luciferase activity assays validated MSTRG.13,871, miR-155-5p, and Grip1 as differentially expressed in CA/CPR group, with MSTRG.13,871 capable of targeting both miR-155-5p and Grip1. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed the ceRNA network enrichment in immunoregulation mechanisms such as mitochondrion, apoptotic process, and negative regulation cell death. Our research highlights the mechanism of PCABI by revealing a critical regulatory axis involving MSTRG.13,871-miR-155-5p-Grip1 in the hippocampus CA1 region after CA/CPR in rats, proposing a feasible controlled mechanism, which may serve as a theoretical basis for designing innovative therapies.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have rapidly expanded across the continuum of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), with growing evidence of their contribution to improving early recognition, intervention quality, and post-cardiac arrest outcomes. This narrative review synthesizes the current advancements and challenges in AI/ML-enhanced resuscitation science. Methods: A targeted literature search was conducted in Web of Science for the period 2018-2025 using the keywords "artificial intelligence" and "cardiopulmonary resuscitation". The search identified studies addressing AI/ML applications across the resuscitation pathway, which were reviewed and categorized according to the American Heart Association's Chain of Survival-prevention and preparedness, activation of the emergency response system, high-quality CPR including early defibrillation, advanced resuscitation interventions, post-cardiac arrest care, and recovery. Results: The literature demonstrates substantial promise for AI/ML in several domains: (1) early recognition and timely activation of emergency medical services through real-time detection algorithms; (2) optimization of high-quality CPR, including feedback systems, automated assessment of chest compressions, and prediction of defibrillation success; (3) support for advanced resuscitation interventions, such as rhythm classification, prognostication, and intra-arrest decision support; (4) post-cardiac arrest care, including outcome prediction and neuroprognostication; and (5) integrative and cross-domain approaches that link multiple phases of resuscitation into end-to-end AI-supported systems. Emerging work also highlights the role of AI in education and training, with applications in simulation, assessment, and skill reinforcement. Conclusions: AI/ML technologies hold significant potential to augment clinical performance across all links of the Chain of Survival. Their effective implementation requires attention to ethical considerations, data representativeness, and real-world validation. Future research should prioritize multicenter datasets, transparency, bias mitigation, and clinically embedded evaluation frameworks to ensure that AI/ML systems support safe, equitable, and high-impact resuscitation care.

TI  - Delta Neutrophil Index as a Promising Prognostic Marker in Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   The post-resuscitation phase after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is characterised by a systemic inflammatory response (e.g., severe sepsis), for which the immature granulocyte count is a diagnostic marker. In this study we evaluated the prognostic significance of the delta neutrophil index (DNI), which is the difference in leukocyte subfractions as assessed by an automated blood cell analyser, for early mortality after OHCA.
   Materials and Methods
   OHCA records from the emergency department cardiac arrest registry were retrospectively analysed. Patients who survived at least 24 h after return of spontaneous circulation were included in the analysis. We evaluated mortality and cerebral performance category scores at 30 days.
   Results
   A total of 83 patients with OHCA were included in the study. Our results showed that DNI >8.4% on day 1 (hazard ratio [HR], 3.227; 95% CI, 1.485-6.967; p = 0.001) and DNI >10.5% on day 2 (HR, 3.292; 95% CI, 1.662-6.519; p<0.001) were associated with increased 30-day mortality in patients with OHCA. Additionally, DNI >8.4% on day 1 (HR, 2.718; 95% CI, 1.508-4.899; p<0.001) and DNI >10.5% on day 2 (HR, 1.709; 95% CI, 1.051-2.778; p = 0.02) were associated with worse neurologic outcomes 30 days after OHCA.
   Conclusion
   A higher DNI is a promising prognostic marker for 30-day mortality and neurologic outcomes after OHCA. Our findings indicate that patients with elevated DNI values after OHCA might be closely monitored so that appropriate treatment strategies can be implemented.

TI  - Increasing lay-people's intentions to initiate CPR in out of hospital cardiac arrest: Results of a mixed- methods 'before and after' pilot study of a behavioural text-message intervention (BICeP)
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Prompt, effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, CPR is often not provided, even by people with training. Low confidence, perceptions of risks and high emotion can prevent initiation of CPR. Behaviour-change techniques may be helpful in increasing CPR rates.Aim: To pilot a text-message behavioural intervention designed to increase intentions to initiate CPR, explore participant responses and pilot meth-ods for future randomised controlled trial of effectiveness.Methods: A 'before and after' pilot study plus qualitative interviews was undertaken. Participants were lay-people who had undertaken CPR training in previous 2 years.Participants were sent an intervention, comprising 35 text-messages containing 14 behaviour-change techniques, to their mobile phone over 4- 6 weeks.Primary outcome: intentions to initiate CPR assessed in response to 4 different scenarios.Secondary outcomes: theory-based determinants of intention (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy) and self -rated competence.Results: 20 participants (6 female, 14 male), aged 20-84 provided baseline data. 17 received the full suite of 35 text messages.15 provided follow-up data. Intentions to perform CPR in scenarios where CPR was indicated were high at baseline and increased (18.1 +/- 3.2-19.5 +/- 1.8/21) after the intervention, as did self-efficacy and self-rated competency. Self-efficacy, attitudes, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms were pos-itively correlated with intentions. Qualitative data suggest the intervention was perceived as useful. Additional options for delivery format and pace were suggested.Conclusions: Pilot-testing suggests a text-message intervention delivered after CPR training is acceptable and may be helpful in increasing/main-taining intentions to perform CPR.

TI  - Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for heart graft dysfunction in adults: incidence, risk factors and outcomes in a multicentric study
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Background: The decision about whether to use venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in patients with cardiac graft dysfunction (GD) is usually made on a case-by-case basis and is guided by the team's experience. We aimed to determine the incidence of VA-ECMO use after heart transplantation (HT), to assess early- and long-term outcomes and to assess risk factors for the need for VA-ECMO and early mortality in these patients. Methods: We included adults who underwent heart transplantation at 3 cardiac centres who met the most recent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation definition of graft dysfunction (GD) over a 10-year period. Pre-transplant, intraoperative and posttransplant characteristics of the heart recipients as well as donor characteristics were analyzed and compared among recipients with GD treated with and without VA-ECMO. Results: There were 135 patients with GD in this study, of whom 66 were treated with VA-ECMO and 69 were not. The mean follow-up averaged 81.2 months (standard deviation 36 mo, range 0-184 mo); follow-up was complete in 100% of patients. The overall incidence of GD (30%) and of VA-ECMO use increased over the study period. We did not identify any predictive pre-transplantation factors for VA-ECMO use, but patients who required VA-ECMO had higher serum lactate levels and higher inotropes doses after HT. The overall survival rates were 83% and 42% at 1 year and 78% and 40% at 5 years among patients who received only medical treatment and those who received VA-ECMO, respectively. Delayed initiation of VA-ECMO and postoperative bleeding were strongly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: The incidence of GD increased over the study period, and the need for VA-ECMO among patients with GD remains difficult to predict. In-hospital mortality decreased over time but remained high among patients who required VA-ECMO, especially among patients with delayed initiation of VA-ECMO.

TI  - Pre-hospital ECPR in an Australian metropolitan setting: a single-arm feasibility assessment-The CPR, pre-hospital ECPR and early reperfusion (CHEER3) study
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction Survival from refractory out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without timely return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) utilising conventional advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) therapies is dismal. CHEER3 was a safety and feasibility study of pre-hospital deployed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for refractory OHCA in metropolitan Australia. Methods This was a single jurisdiction, single-arm feasibility study. Physicians, with pre-existing ECMO expertise, responded to witnessed OHCA, age < 65 yrs, within 30 min driving-time, using an ECMO equipped rapid response vehicle. If pre-hospital ECPR was undertaken, patients were transported to hospital for investigations and therapies including emergent coronary catheterisation, and standard intensive care (ICU) therapy until either cardiac and neurological recovery or palliation occurred. Analyses were descriptive. Results From February 2020 to May 2023, over 117 days, the team responded to 709 "potential cardiac arrest" emergency calls. 358 were confirmed OHCA. Time from emergency call to scene arrival was 27 min (15-37 min). 10 patients fulfilled the pre-defined inclusion criteria and all were successfully cannulated on scene. Time from emergency call to ECMO initiation was 50 min (35-62 min). Time from decision to ECMO support was 16 min (11-26 min). CPR duration was 46 min (32-62 min). All 10 patients were transferred to hospital for investigations and therapy. 4 patients (40%) survived to hospital discharge neurologically intact (CPC 1/2). Conclusion Pre-hospital ECPR was feasible, using an experienced ECMO team from a single-centre. Overall survival was promising in this highly selected group. Further prospective studies are now warranted.

TI  - Outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass in children after drowning-related resuscitation
T2  - PERFUSION-UK
AB  - Drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental deaths in children worldwide. However, the use of long-term extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in this setting is not widely established, and rewarming is often achieved by short-term cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) treatment. Thus, we sought to add our experience with this means of support as a bridge-to-recovery or to-decision. This retrospective single-center study analyzes the outcome of 11 children (median 23 months, minimum-maximum 3 months-6.5 years) who experienced drowning and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between 2005 and 2016 and who were supported by veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), CPB, or first CPB then ECMO. All but one incident took place in sweet water. Submersion time ranged between 10 and 50 minutes (median 23 minutes), water temperature between 2 degrees C and 28 degrees C (median 14 degrees C), and body core temperature upon arrival in the emergency department between 20 degrees C and 34 degrees C (median 25 degrees C). Nine patients underwent ongoing CPR from the scene until ECMO or CPB initiation in the operating room. The duration of ECMO or CPB before successful weaning/therapy withdrawal ranged between 2 and 322 hours (median 19 hours). A total of four patients (36%) survived neurologically mildly or not affected after 4 years of follow-up. The data indicate that survival is likely related to a shorter submersion time and lower water temperature. Resuscitation of pediatric patients after drowning has a poor outcome. However, ECMO or CPB might promote recovery in selected cases or serve as a bridge-to-decision tool.

TI  - Serum neprilysin and the risk of death in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of non-traumatic origin
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Background: Early risk stratification remains an unmet clinical need in patients with in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We hypothesised that soluble neprilysin may represent a promising biomarker in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of non-traumatic origin and provide new pathobiological insight.
   Methods: This pilot study was a biomarker analysis from the Heidelberg Resuscitation Registry. Serum soluble neprilysin levels on admission were measured in 144 patients with successful return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of non-traumatic origin. The primary endpoint was time to all-cause mortality. KM Event Rates are reported. Cox models were adjusted for age, bystander resuscitation, initial ECG rhythm, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline lactate, left ventricular function at baseline, and targeted temperature management.
   Results: In total, 90 (62.5%) patients died over a follow-up of at least 30 days. Soluble neprilysin correlated weakly with high-sensitivity troponin T (r=0.18, P=0.032) but did not correlate significantly with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=-0.12) or lactate (r=0.11). Patients with elevated soluble neprilysin levels on admission were at significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (Q4 69.1% vs. Q1 48.4%). After multivariable adjustment, soluble neprilysin in the top quartile (Q4) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted hazard ratio 2.48 (1.20-5.12)). In an adjusted multimarker model including high-sensitivity troponin T and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, soluble neprilysin and high-sensitivity troponin T remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (soluble neprilysin: adjusted hazard ratio 2.27 (1.08-4.78); high-sensitivity troponin T: adjusted hazard ratio 3.40 (1.63-7.09)).
   Conclusion: Soluble neprilysin, measured as early as on hospital admission, was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of non-traumatic origin and may prove to be useful in the estimation of risk in these patients.

TI  - Primary Outcomes for Resuscitation Science Studies A Consensus Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background and Purpose-The guidelines presented in this consensus statement are intended to serve researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and regulators in the selection of the most appropriate primary outcome for a clinical trial of cardiac arrest therapies. The American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of cardiac arrest depend on high-quality clinical trials, which depend on the selection of a meaningful primary outcome. Because this selection process has been the subject of much controversy, a consensus conference was convened with national and international experts, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration.
   Methods-The Research Working Group of the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee nominated subject leaders, conference attendees, and writing group members on the basis of their expertise in clinical trials and a diverse perspective of cardiovascular and neurological outcomes (see the online-only Data Supplement). Approval was obtained from the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. Preconference position papers were circulated for review; the conference was held; and postconference consensus documents were circulated for review and comments were invited from experts, conference attendees, and writing group members. Discussions focused on (1) when after cardiac arrest the measurement time point should occur; (2) what cardiovascular, neurological, and other physiology should be assessed; and (3) the costs associated with various end points. The final document underwent extensive revision and peer review by the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee, the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee, and oversight committees.
   Results-There was consensus that no single primary outcome is appropriate for all studies of cardiac arrest. The best outcome measure is the pairing of a time point and physiological condition that will best answer the question under study. Conference participants were asked to assign an outcome to each of 4 hypothetical cases; however, there was not complete agreement on an ideal outcome measure even after extensive discussion and debate. There was general consensus that it is appropriate for earlier studies to enroll fewer patients and to use earlier time points such as return of spontaneous circulation, simple "alive versus dead," hospital mortality, or a hemodynamic parameter. For larger studies, a longer time point after arrest should be considered because neurological assessments fluctuate for at least 90 days after arrest. For large trials designed to have a major impact on public health policy, longer-term end points such as 90 days coupled with neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments should be considered, as should the additional costs of this approach. For studies that will require regulatory oversight, early discussions with regulatory agencies are strongly advised. For neurological assessment of post-cardiac arrest patients, researchers may wish to use the Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale for global outcomes.
   Conclusions-Although there is no single recommended outcome measure for trials of cardiac arrest care, the simple Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale after 90 days provides a reasonable outcome parameter for many trials. The lack of an easy-to-administer neurological functional outcome measure that is well validated in post-cardiac arrest patients is a major limitation to the field and should be a high priority for future development.

TI  - Outcome for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults (ARDS) is a relatively frequent disease, the mortality of which has diminished considerably in recent years. The long-term outcome of patients who have survived ARDS has been studied extensively and should in the future be token into account in assessing new treatment modalities.
   The long-term respiratory sequelae are generally minimal and moderately disabling. Secondary deterioration of respiratory function is not part of the natural history of ARDS and should suggest other diagnoses.
   The various studies find a clear diminution in quality of life after ARDS (compared with the general population), essentially related to neuromuscular deficiencies associated with the neuromyopathies of resuscitation or to neuropsychologicol damage combining cognitive disorders and symptoms of posttraumatic stress.
   These symptoms ore not at all specific to ARDS. They are found in varying degrees in patients who have survived intensive care or resuscitation.
   Appropriate management for these symptoms remains to be determined. Critical care units must now work at preventing the onset of these disorders, by limiting the treatments at risk when possible and by identifying these disorders before discharge to prepare for optimal subsequent management. Patients with ARDS are only a subgroup of more severe illness among all patients in critical core departments.

TI  - Multi-centre implementation of an Educational program to improve the Cardiac Arrest diagnostic accuracy of ambulance Telecommunicators and survival outcomes for sudden cardiac arrest victims: the EduCATe study design and methodology
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of mortality in Canada, resulting in more than 35,000 deaths annually. Most cardiac arrest victims collapse in their own home (85% of the time) and 50% are witnessed by a family member or bystander. Survivors have a quality of life similar to the general population, but the overall survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) rarely exceeds 8%. Victims are almost four times more likely to survive when receiving bystander CPR, but bystander CPR rates have remained low in Canada over the past decade, not exceeding 15-25% until recently. Telecommunication-assisted CPR instructions have been shown to significantly increase bystander CPR rates, but agonal breathing may be misinterpreted as a sign of life by 9-1-1 callers and telecommunicators, and is responsible for as much as 50% of missed OHCA diagnoses. We sought to improve the ability and speed with which ambulance telecommunicators can recognize OHCA over the phone, initiate timely CPR instructions, and improve survival. Methods In this multi-center national study, we will implement and evaluate an educational program developed for ambulance telecommunicators using a multiple baseline interrupted time-series design. We will compare outcomes 12 months before and after the implementation of a 20-min theory-based educational video addressing barriers to recognition of OHCA while in the presence of agonal breathing. Participating Canadian sites demonstrated prior ability to collect standardized data on OHCA. Data will be collected from eligible 9-1-1 recordings, paramedic documentation and hospital medical records. Eligible cases will include suspected or confirmed OHCA of presumed cardiac origin in patients of any age with attempted resuscitation. Discussion The ability of telecommunication-assisted CPR instructions to improve bystander CPR and survival rates for OHCA victims is undeniable. The ability of telecommunicators to recognize OHCA over the phone is unequivocally impeded by relative lack of training on agonal breathing, and reluctance to initiate CPR instructions when in doubt. Our pilot data suggests the potential impact of this project will be to increase absolute OHCA recognition and bystander CPR rates by at least 10%, and absolute out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival by 5% or more.

TI  - Drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review The current narrative review outlines the evidence for the most common drugs given during adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recent findings Two large clinical trials recently made the roles of adrenaline and antiarrhythmic drugs clearer. Adrenaline leads to a substantially higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation and a moderate increase in survival. Amiodarone and lidocaine increase short-term outcomes, and point estimates suggest a small but uncertain effect on long-term survival. There is still a lack of high-quality evidence for other drugs during cardiac arrest such as bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium, but small-scale randomized clinical trials show no effect. A promising entity may be the combination of vasopressin and glucocorticoids, but external validation of preliminary trials is needed. Data from observational studies and subgroup analyses of trials generally favor intravenous over intraosseous access, while the latter remains a reasonable alternative. Guidelines for the above-mentioned drugs have been updated yet remain largely unchanged over the last decades. There are still multiple unanswered questions related to drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. On the contrary, only few trials are ongoing.

TI  - Long-term Effect of Face-to-Face vs Virtual Reality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Training on Willingness to Perform CPR, Retention of Knowledge, and Dissemination of CPR Awareness A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - IMPORTANCE Increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential to improve survival after cardiac arrest. Although most studies focus on technical CPR skills, the randomized Lowlands Saves Lives trial prespecified a follow-up survey on other important aspects that affect the widespread performance of CPR.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate bystander willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness 6 months after undergoing short face-to-face and virtual reality (VR) CPR trainings.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prespecified 6-month posttraining survey was conducted among 320 participants in the Lowlands Saves Lives trial, a randomized comparison between 20-minute face-to-face, instructor-led CPR training and VR training. Participants were recruited at the Lowlands music festival, with a designated area to conduct scientific projects (August 16-18, 2019; the Netherlands). Statistical analysis was performed from March 1, 2020. to July 31, 2021.
   INTERVENTIONS Two standardized 20-minute protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: instructor-led face-to-face training using CPR manikins or VR training using the Resuscitation Council (UK)-endorsed Lifesaver VR smartphone application and a pillow to practice compressions.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness as reported by the entire cohort. As secondary analyses, the results of the 2 training modalities were compared.
   RESULTS Of 381 participants, 320 consented to this follow-up survey; 188 participants (115 women [61%]; median age, 26 years [IQR, 22-32 years]) completed the entire survey and were accordingly included in the secondary analysis. The overall proportion of participants willing to perform CPR on a stranger was 77% (144 of 188): 81% (79 of 97) among face-to-face participants and 71% (65 of 91) among VR participants (P = .02); 103 participants (55%) reported feeling scared to perform CPR (P = .91). Regarding theoretical knowledge retention, a median of 7 (IQR, 6-8) of 9 questions were answered correctly in both groups (P = .81). Regarding dissemination of CPR awareness, 65% of participants (123 of 188) told at least 1 to 10 family members or friends about the importance of CPR, and 15% (29 of 188) had participated in certified, instructor-led training at the time of the survey, without differences between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this 6-month posttraining survey, young adult participants of short CPR training modules reported high willingness (77%) to perform CPR on a stranger, with slightly higher rates for face-to-face than for VR participants. Theoretical knowledge retention was good, and the high dissemination of awareness suggests that these novel CPR training modules staged at a public event are promising sensitizers for involvement in CPR, although further challenges include mitigating the fear of performing CPR.

TI  - Expert Consensus on Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in China
T2  - DISCOVERY MEDICINE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a critical public health challenge with high mortality and poor neurological outcomes. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has emerged as a promising intervention for refractory OHCA, offering improved survival and neurological recovery compared with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). This expert consensus, developed by the Emergency Medicine Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and the Emergency Medicine Branch of the Guangdong Medical Doctor Association, presents evidence-based recommendations for pre-hospital ECPR implementation in China. Key areas include dispatch protocols, team composition and training, equipment logistics, indications and timing, procedural techniques, and patient transport. The consensus emphasizes initiation of ECPR within 20 minutes of CCPR, establishment of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation within 60 minutes of arrest, and maintenance of high-quality resuscitation during cannulation. Special considerations for unique settings, such as large public events, are also discussed. This document aims to standardize pre-hospital ECPR practices, optimize patient outcomes, and guide healthcare providers in delivering effective extracorporeal life support for OHCA.

TI  - Longer-term quality of life following major trauma: age only significantly affects outcome after the age of 80 years
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Aim: Against the background of conflicting data on the topic, this study aimed to determine the differences in longer-term patient outcomes following major trauma with regard to age.
   Materials and methods: A prospective trauma center survey of survivors of trauma (>= 16 years) was carried out employing a New Injury Severity Score (NISS) >= 8 to investigate the influence of age on working capacity and several outcome scores, such as the trauma medical outcomes study Short Form-36 (physical component [PCS] and mental component [MCS]), the Euro Quality of Life (EuroQoL), or the Trauma Outcome Profile (TOP) at least 1 year following injury. Chi square tests, t-tests, and Pearson correlations were used as univariate; stepwise regression as multivariate analysis. Significance was set at p<0.05.
   Results: In all, 718 major trauma patients (53.4 +/- 19.4 years; NISS 18.4 +/- 9.2) participated in the study. Multivariate analysis showed only low associations of patient or trauma characteristics with longer-term outcome scores, highest for the Injury Severity Score of the extremities with the PCS (R-2=0.08) or the working capacity of employed patients (n=383; R-2=0.04). For age, overall associations were even lower (best with the PCS, R-2=0.04) or could not be revealed at all (TOP or MCS). Subgroup analysis with regard to decennia revealed the age effect to be mainly attributable to patients aged >= 80, who presented with a significantly worse outcome compared to younger people in all overall and physical component scores (p<0.001). In patients under 80 years an association of age was only found for EuroQoL (R-2=0.01) and the PCS (R-2=0.03).
   Conclusion: Given the small impact of age on the longer-term outcomes of major trauma patients, at least up to the age of 80 years, resuscitation as well as rehabilitation strategies should be adapted accordingly.

TI  - Health inequalities in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of automated electrical defibrillators in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) outcomes can be improved by strengthening the chain of survival, namely prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED). However, provision of bystander CPR and AED use remains low due to individual patient factors ranging from lack of education to socioeconomic barriers and due to lack of resources such as limited availability of AEDs in the community. Although the impact of health inequalities on survival from OHCA is documented, it is imperative that we identify and implement strategies to improve public health and outcomes from OHCA overall but with a simultaneous emphasis on making care more equitable. Disparities in CPR delivery and AED use in OHCA exist based on factors including sex, education level, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, all of which we discuss in this review. Most importantly, we discuss the barriers to AED use, and strategies on how these may be overcome.

TI  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE
AB  - As veterinary surgeons, we must all deal, on occasion, with an animal who has suffered a cardiac arrest. This article reviews the recent literature concerning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and examines the suggestions recently put forward by the American Heart Association in their improved resuscitation protocol. These protocol modifications have been shown experimentally and clinically to improve cerebral and myocardial haemodynamics during closed chest cardiac massage. The ultimate goal of CPR must be not merely to resuscitate the patient in the short term, but to promote complete neurological recovery in the longer term. Prompt recognition of cardiac arrest and the immediate initiation of resuscitative.measures play a major contributing role in a favourable neurological outcome. In addition to the familiar 'ABC' system of basic cardiac life support, the use of a high dose adrenaline (0.2 mg/kg) is proposed as the best first line. drug treatment in the arrested patient. This can be accompanied by abdominal wrapping and synchronous ventilation and chest compressions to optimise cerebral and myocardial blood flow. Calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate should no longer be included in the early resuscitative efforts.

TI  - Survival to discharge and outcome of a dog following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD CASE REPORTS
AB  - A 7-month-old dog presented with a 10-minute history of upper respiratory tract obstruction and secondary loss of consciousness in the minute before its arrival to the hospital. The dog was found to be dead on arrival. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, which led to successful return of spontaneous circulation 20 minutes later, with subsequent regain of consciousness. Symptomatic therapy and supportive care were provided for 3.5 weeks before discharging the dog into the care of its owners. Despite having made an initial improvement, it was subsequently euthanised 4 weeks later due to persistent severe neurological deficits. Although the neurological improvement was not deemed sufficient for the dog to have a good quality of life, this case report highlights that return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and a prolonged period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is feasible, and neurological improvement thereafter is possible.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: implementation in a district general hospital emergency department
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background The use of therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for unconscious adult patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. There is evidence that the time taken to achieve target temperature impacts survival.
   Objectives To audit the performance of an emergency department (ED) in implementing therapeutic hypothermia and achieving target temperature in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
   Methods Data were extracted from the medical records of patients admitted to the ICU from the ED in the Royal United Hospital following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between June 2002 and October 2008. The intervals between ROSC and initiation of cooling and between initiation of cooling and achieving the core temperature of 34 degrees C were recorded.
   Results During this period, 83 patients were admitted to the ICU following OHCA. Of these, 67 (81%) were actively cooled. All 16 patients who were not cooled had recognised exclusion criteria. The median time (IQR) from ROSC to initiation of cooling was 60 (40-165) minutes and the median time (IQR) to reach 34 degrees C was 175 (40-420) minutes. Of the 67 who were cooled, 44 (66%) achieved the temperature of 34 degrees C within 4 h, the audit standard published by the Royal College of Anaesthetists. In 29 (43%) patients, the temperature increased after leaving the ED.
   Conclusions Among OHCA patients who met recognised inclusion criteria, therapeutic hypothermia was implemented successfully by the ED staff. The temperature should be measured continuously from the same site in both the ED and the ICU. This will provide consistent and continuous temperature monitoring between the ED and the ICU and will enable prompt intervention to prevent temperature increases.

TI  - Safeguarding bacterial resources promotes biotechnological innovation
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Environmental research delivers valuable bacterial resources for biotechnology. We believe that systematic long-term preservation of bacteria will promote future biotechnological innovations, by safeguarding the accessibility of bacteria already recognized to have interesting features and providing a "pool" of bacterial resources for novel applied research. To this end, we want to advocate the incorporation of preservation tests in environmental or applied microbiological research. This paper introduces non-specialists to different preservation methods for bacteria. Several parameters that influence long-term storage of bacterial resources are explained and practical tips and guidelines are formulated. Also, the vital role of public culture collections is highlighted and the state-of-the-art of preservation of non-pure cultures is described.

TI  - Newer mechanical methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A review and analysis of efficacy
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - In a recent German multicenter study, 25% of the patients who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest outside the hospital were resuscitated successfully and were discharged from the hospital. Approximately 100000 people suffer a fatal cardiac arrest in Germany annually, which is about ten times more than deaths resulting from motor vehicle accidents. New devices and techniques for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have been developed in order to enhance the efficacy of chest compressions during CPR. The purpose of the present article is to review mechanisms of blood flow during CPR, to discuss CPR devices and techniques (vest CPR, CPR with interposed abdominal compressions, active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR, phased chest and abdominal compression-decompression CPR,and to further evaluate results from subsequently published laboratory and clinical studies.
   Vest CPR performs chest compressions with a pneumatic pump, which is able to compress the entire thorax with great force while minimizing injury. This device was developed to achieve an optimal driving force of the thoracic-pump mechanism during CPR. After promising results in laboratory studies and further technical development, vest CPR increased coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) in a clinical study even after 45 min of unsuccessful advanced cardiac life support. Currently,this device is being evaluated in an international multicenter study in Europe and the United States. A vest for employment by the emergency medical service (EMS) is in preparation. Interposed abdominal compressions during relaxation of the chest may augment artificial blood flow. In some laboratory studies, this mechanism resulted, in part, in promising data, and in another did not achieve better survival rates in comparison with standard CPR. No benefit of abdominal compressions was shown in an investigation in an EMS,whereas in a clinical study patients who were treated with interposed abdominal compressions were more likely to survive and be discharged from the hospital. However, in a follow-up study of in-hospital patients with asystole or pulseless electrical activity, abdominal compressions resulted in higher 24-h survival, but not hospital discharge rate, when compared with standard CPR. In animal studies ACD CPR produced increased CPP, end-tidal carbon dioxide, minute ventilation, and short-term survival. Subsequently performed clinical studies confirmed the data from the laboratory investigations; however, the hemodynamic advantage of ACD CPR did not result in increased longterm survival and a better neurological outcome in both in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. To date, the reason why better hemodynamic variables did not result in better outcomes is unknown. A combination of ACD CPR with interposed abdominal compressions raised cerebral blood flow by approximately 60%, but did not augment myocardial blood flow in comparison with standard CPR. Recently, a device was developed to administer phased chest and abdominal compression-decompression CPR; this technique has been tested in an animal study and showed significant hemodynamic advantages and better survival compared with standard CPR. Clinical investigations of this device are being performed.
   In summary, since the rediscovery of chest compressions more than 35 years ago, this intervention has not changed significantly. Objective data from laboratory and clinical studies such as systolic blood pressure, CPP, and the gold standard for the efficacy of CPR, long-term survival and neurorlogical outcome, will determine if a new device or technique can replace standard-CPR. Despite the new developments, it is mandatory to perform standard CPR correctly with a chest compression rate of 80-100/min and a depth of 38-50 mm.

TI  - Neurodevelopment at seven years and parents' feelings of prematurely born children
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - BackgroundThe evolution of knowledge and technical advances in neonatal resuscitation have improved the survival of very premature babies. However, the long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis and cognitive and learning abilities are still uncertain. ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the neurodevelopment and learning abilities of 7-year-old children born prematurely, and their parents' feelings at 8 years of age. Patients and methodsData from children born before 33 weeks gestation in a level III maternity hospital and involved in a regional follow-up network were analyzed at 7 years of age. Neurodevelopmental abnormalities were defined as cerebral palsy, hearing or visual impairment, and/or behavioral abnormalities. School performance was evaluated by the EDA test. A parents' questionnaire assessed their feelings about the child's and family's quality of life at 8 years of age. ResultsAt 7 years of age, 51% of the 238 children presented neurodevelopmental abnormalities: 3.3% with cerebral palsy, 6.2% with hearing impairments, 50.7% with visual impairments, and 11.3% with behavioral disorders. The children with neurodevelopmental abnormalities had lower gestational age (29.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 30.0 +/- 2.1 weeks, p = 0.003) and more EEG abnormalities during the neonatal period (31.1% vs. 19.8%, p = 0.048) than the children without abnormalities. Ninety-four percent of the children with abnormalities were enrolled in normal schools, 33% with special support. In the overall cohort, 31% of the children had all academic performance scores in the normal range of the reference population. At 8 years old, 39% of the parents of children with neurodevelopmental abnormalities felt that their child's situation significantly impacted their quality of life compared to 14% of parents of children without neurodevelopmental abnormality (p = 0.022). ConclusionHalf of children born very prematurely present with long-term neurodevelopmental abnormalities, which their parents feel significantly impacts their quality of life.

TI  - A review regarding the article 'Health inequalities in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of automated electrical defibrillators in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest '
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Out -of -hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with a high incidence and low survival rate. Prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) use are major contributors in the "chain of survival " for OHCA. the response of a community plays a key role in determining the outcomes in OHCA. The outcomes of OHCA are affected by health inequalities in bystander CPR and AED use, due to factors such as differences in sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status amongst others. Literature shows patients from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to have risk factors for a cardiac arrest and are therefore more likely to have OHCA. Studies have also reported lower rates of bystander AED use in females compared to males. Targeting deprived areas with tailored training and access to AEDs can be beneficial in improving CPR outcomes in communities. Due to the physical nature of CPR maneuvers, age and frailty of the patient can both impact the outcome of the resuscitation. Environmental factors affecting AED use include availability, visibility, accessibility, support, extra equipment, training materials, staffing, and awareness. Education should focus on areas such as conducting BLS on both male and female patients, recognizing cardiac arrest, tailoring BLS to difference ages as well as provision for training in different languages, including sign language. Like some other countries, CPR training is now being implemented in the school curriculum.

TI  - Long-term quality of life after refractory cardiac arrest requiring ECLS: A 10 years single-center analysis
T2  - ANAESTHESIA CRITICAL CARE & PAIN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Impact of V-A ECMO to treat cardiac arrest on quality of life is unclear. a Methods: In 2021, all patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) of our tertiary university hospital for cardiac arrest requiring V-A ECMO from 2006 to 2018, were contacted by mail and by phone in order to complete an SF-36 form. Quality of life was then compared with reference values (patients with cardiovascular diseases, patients with ischemic heart disease, ICU-survivor patients at 36 months after discharge, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with V-A ECMO). Results: Among 45 survivors, 25 patients completed the SF-36 form with a mean time for assessing quality of life of 6.9 f 2.3 years. Sub-scores were globally comparable with those observed in referent cohorts. Discussion: Cardiac arrest marks the beginning of a medical journey that includes intensive care management and the onset of cardiac disease, often of ischemic origin. Our data suggest that quality of life of patients treated with V-A ECMO for cardiac arrest is comparable to those reported in referent cohorts (ICU-survivors, patients with cardiovascular diseases of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with mechanical circulatory support). Conclusion: Survivor patients who experienced cardiac arrest and treated with V-A ECMO presented a good long-term quality of life. Decision regarding V-A ECMO implantation should not be limited by concerns about patients' future quality of life. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

TI  - Feedback on chest compression quality variables and their relationship to rate of return of spontaneous circulation
T2  - EMERGENCIAS
AB  - Background: Studies have revealed failure to follow international guidelines for performing chest compressions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Certain feedback devices are available for use. One such device (the Q-CPR) has been used in the Madrid Emergency and Rescue Service (SAMUR).
   Objectives. To analyze whether there is an association between the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the use of a feedback device, to describe the performance of compressions in comparison with quality standards, and to determine whether any of the measured variables are related to the rate of ROSC.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study. Recruitment period: November 2007 to December 2010. Inclusion criteria: patients with cardiorespiratory arrest attended by the SAMUR. Exposure factor: use of a CPR measurement and feedback device.
   Results: SAMUR attended 892 cases of cardiorespiratory arrest: the Q-CPR was used in 108 patients and 784 were given CPR without the device. Potential clinical and laboratory predictors were compared between the 2 cohorts. ROSC occurred in 46% in the Q-CPR cohort and 41% in the cohort without the device (P=.267). The Q-CPR recorded a mean (SD) of 105.7 (7.9) compressions per minute, with a mean depth of 41 (4.76) mm, and a percentage of adequate depth of 76.5% (17.6%). Complete chest recoil did not occur in 223 (13.26%) compressions per event, and this factor was significantly associated with ROSC (P<.05). The variable that was associated with ROSC in patients who had asystole at onset was the percentage of compressions with adequate depth; in patients with asystole or ventricular fibrillation at onset, the mean number of compressions followed by complete chest recoil was associated with the ROSC rate (P<.05). No factors were associated with ROSC in patients with pulseless electrical activity.
   Conclusions: The Q-CPR device effectively measures resuscitation components and promptly corrects them. Our findings allow us to say that 74.73% of our compressions are of adequate depth; this rate is higher than reports for CPR without feedback devices. The ROSC rate tended to be higher when the Q-CPR was used in this study. Allowing for complete chest recoil is crucial for improving the ROSC rate. [Emergencias 2013;25:99-104]

TI  - Quality of life after intensive care: A systematic review of the literature
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate quality of life at least 12 months after discharge from the intensive care unit of adult critically ill patients, to evaluate the methodology used to assess long-term quality of life, and to give an overview of factors influencing quality of life.
   Data Sources: EMBASE-PubMed, MEDLINE (OVID), SCI/Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and personal files.
   Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed independently and cross-checked by two reviewers using a predefined data extraction form. Eligible studies were published between 1999 and 2009 and assessed quality of life >= 12 months after intensive care unit discharge by means of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, EuroQol-5D, and/or the Nottingham Health Profile in adult intensive care unit patients.
   Data Synthesis: Fifty-three articles (10 multicenters) were included, with the majority of studies performed in Europe (68%). The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey was used in 55%, and the EuroQol-5D, the Nottingham Health Profile, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, or a combination was used in 21%, 9%, 8%, or 8%, respectively. A response rate of >= 80% was attained in 26 studies (49%). Critically ill patients had a lower quality of life than an age-and gender-matched population, but quality of life tended to improve over years. The worst reductions in quality of life were seen in cases of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged mechanical ventilation, severe trauma, and severe sepsis. Study quality criteria, defined as a baseline quality of life assessment, the absence of major exclusion criteria, a description of nonresponders, and a comparison with a reference population were met in only four studies (8%). Results concerning the influence of severity of illness, comorbidity, preadmission quality of life, age, gender, or acquired complications were conflicting.
   Conclusions: Quality of life differed on diagnostic category but, overall, critically ill patients had a lower quality of life than an age-and gender-matched population. A minority of studies met the predefined methodologic quality criteria. Results concerning the influence of the patients' characteristics and illnesses on long-term quality of life were conflicting.

TI  - Acute esophageal necrosis following cardiac arrest: A rare and lethal syndrome with diagnostic challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and clinical relevance: Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is a condition characterized by the necrosis of the distal portion of the esophageal mucosa. Risk factors predisposing to this condition are associated to compromised vascular perfusion ( e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, advanced age, and hypertension, shock states). Complications of AEN can be severe including UGI stricture, perforation and overall increased mortality. The true incidence of AEN remains uncertain due to potential subclincal presentations and early resolution. Case presentation: The case outlined involves a 66 -years -old obese male with history of alcoholism and lymphedema of the left leg who presented to the emergency department with hematemesis, haemodynamic instability and impaired consciousness. Shortly after initial assessment, the patient went into cardiac arrest with pulse -less electrical activity (PEA). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved following instigation of ALS protocol, fluid resuscitation and the administration of a total of 5 mg of adrenaline. Following stabilization, a CT scan was performed which reported a moderately enlarged esophagus with a thickened wall, liquid hypodense material within the esophagus and stomach, and liver cirrhosis. The emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) revealed extensive mucosal findings indicative of diffuse necrosis with initial scarring, which was later diagnosed as AEN. The patient unfortunately deceased in ICU after developing progression of the AEN, post -cardiac arrest syndrome and liver failure. Clinical discussion: The presented case highlights several crucial clinical issues and management problems related to AEN. To diagnose AEN, EGDS is still the gold -standard since it allows direct inspection of the esophageal mucosal layer. The management of AEN necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that includes aggressive resuscitation, treatment of underlying comorbidities, and supportive care ( e.g. proton pump inhibitors). The mortality rate for AEN remains high despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment highlighting the need to recognize this condition early and intervene promptly in the patients affected. Moreover, long-term sequelae like stricture formation of the esophagus and impaired esophageal motility may contribute to morbidity requiring continuos monitoring. Therefore, to optimize outcomes while reducing complications among affected patients, prompt identification associated with appropriate medical measures are essential. More research needs to be done aiming to better understand the pathophysiology of AEN thereby identifying strategies for its prevention or cure. Conclusions: AEN is a rare syndrome characterized by upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hypoxic damage of the esophageal mucosa, often associated with ischemia, gastric outlet obstruction, and compromised protective barriers. Treatment involves aggressive resuscitation, proton pump inhibitors, and monitoring for infection or perforation. However, despite intensive efforts, the mortality rate for AEN remains high at 32 %.

TI  - Outcomes by Mode of Transport of ST Elevation MI Patients in the United Arab Emirates
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this multicenter study was to assess differences in demographics, medical history, treatment times, and follow-up status among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who were transported to the hospital by emergency medical services (EMS) or by private vehicle, or were transferred from other medical facilities.
   Methods: This multicenter study involved the collection of both retrospective and prospective data from 455 patients admitted to four hospitals in Abu Dhabi. We collected electronic medical records from EMS and hospitals, and conducted interviews with patients in person or via telephone. Chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine differences in variables by mode of transportation.
   Results: Results indicated significant differences in modes of transportation when considering symptom-onset-to-balloon time (p < 0.001), door-to-balloon time (p < 0.001), and health status at sixmonth and one-year follow-up (p < 0.001). Median times (interquartile range) for patients transported by EMS, private vehicle, or transferred from an outside facility were as follows: symptom-onsetto- balloon time in hours, 3.1 (1.8-4.3), 3.2 (2.1-5.3), and 4.5 (3.0-7.5), respectively; door-toballoon time in minutes, 70 (48-78), 81 (64-105), and 62 (46-77), respectively. In all cases, EMS transportation was associated with a shorter time to treatment than other modes of transportation. However, the EMS group experienced greater rates of in-hospital events, including cardiac arrest and mortality, than the private transport group.
   Conclusion: Our results contribute data supporting EMS transportation for patients with acute coronary syndrome. Although a lack of follow-up data made it difficult to draw conc lusions about long-term outcomes, our findings clearly indicate that EMS transportation can speed time to treatment, including time to balloon inflation, potentially r educing readmission and adverse events. We conclude that future efforts should focus on encouraging the use of EMS and improving transfer practices. Such efforts could improve outcomes for patients presenting with STEMI.

TI  - What is the quality of life for survivors of cardiac arrest? A prospective study
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the quality of life of survivors of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and to correlate quality of life with clinically important parameters. Methods: Cohort followed at least six months after hospital discharge. Eligible patients had survived to hospital discharge after sudden cardiac arrest in 1) EDs, wards, and intensive care units of five university hospitals and 2) all locations outside hospitals in two midsized cities. Of 126 patients discharged alive, 30 died before they could be interviewed. Of the 96 patients remaining, 86 (90% of available patients, 68% of survivors to discharge) completed the interview. Quality of life was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, which describes health as a utility score on a scale from perfect health (equal to 1.0) to death (equal to 0.) Results: Mean age (+/-SD) of interviewed survivors was 65 +/- 14 years, and 47 (55%) were male; mean time between collapse and initiation of CPR was 2.2 +/- 2.6 minutes. Mean utility was 0.72 (+/-0.22). Utilities were significantly higher among patients who had a shorter duration of resuscitation (mean = 0.81 for those who received less than 2 minutes of CPR, 0.76 for those who received 3 to 10 minutes, and 0.65 for others, p = 0.05, r(2) = 0.07). Mean utilities of survivors were worse than those of the general population (mean = 0.85 +/- 0.16, p < 0.01) and those whose activities were not limited by chronic disease (mean = 0.91 +/- 0.08, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Although overall survival was poor, most survivors had acceptable health-related quality of life. Therefore, concerns about poor quality of life are not a valid reason to abandon efforts to improve the health care system's response to victims of sudden cardiac arrest. Further research is necessary to identify effective strategies for improving both survival and quality of life after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Out of hospital cardiac arrest in sporting facilities: an overview of rescue for sideline doctors
T2  - MEDICINA DELLO SPORT
AB  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) during sporting events is a rare but nonetheless relevant oc-currence, that must be promptly addressed by sideline doctors and, in their absence, as well as by laymen present on site. The use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers and public access defibrillators (PADs) has been shown to increase the possibility of ROSC and to improve the outcome of patients. The aim of our study is to analyze the characteristics of the patients rescued in sporting facilities in the Lombardy region, the maneuvers performed on site and the outcome of the patients.METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study performed in the Lombardy region. The data were provided by the registry on the website of AREU. The records of cardiac arrest in the EmMa database from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2019 were analyzed.RESULTS: The EMS rescued 35,362 patients with OHCA, of which 0.42% (N.=149) in sporting facilities. The aver-age time of arrival of the first vehicle on scene was 11.3 +/- 6.8 minutes, while the average time of hospital arrival was 52.7 +/- 25.7 minutes. About 76.0% of patients received CPR. PADs were used in 43.0% of events. In 32 cases (21.5%), patients that received CRP with PAD achieved ROSC.CONCLUSIONS: The mandatory training for managers and coaches might increase the possibility of ROSC in sports facilities and during sporting events, even in case of absence of sideline doctors. Sideline doctors should be familiar with the BLS-D training and ACLS training.

T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have become an indispensable tool in the management of end-stage cardiac failure, both as a means of bridging to cardiac transplantation and as destination therapy for long-term quality of life improvement. Although the technology continues to advance and these devices continue to be refined, they are still associated with significant complications. This article reviews the basics of VAD function and physiology, as well as the myriad to complications that follow their implantation. This review aims to provide a systematic approach to the troubleshooting, diagnosis and management of both VAD-associated complications and the resuscitation of the decompensated VAD patient presenting to the ED.

TI  - Care After REsuscitation: Implementation of the United Kingdom's First Dedicated Multidisciplinary Follow-Up Program for Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Survival rates after cardiac arrest (CA) are increasing, with more patients and their families living with the psychological consequences of surviving a sudden CA. The currently available neuropsychological assessment tools and therapies were not designed for CA, and may be inadequate. The Essex Cardiothoracic Centre set up the United Kingdom's first dedicated multidisciplinary "Care After REsuscitation" (CARE) service, offering CA survivors and their caregivers systematic psychological, cognitive, and specialized medical support for the first 6 months after CA. Twenty-one patients were recruited into the CARE pilot service evaluation. Patients' health at hospital discharge was poor; however, by 6 months all components (except general health) had improved significantly, and were close to that experienced by "healthy" individuals. Five (26%) required referral to a psychiatrist, with all 5 (26%) subsequently being diagnosed with moderate-to-severe depression, and 3 (16%) with comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder. Our study demonstrates a large unmet clinical need in general and neuropsychological assessment, and our results suggest that offering appropriate and prompt specialist diagnosis and therapies leads to an improvement in health at 6 months.

TI  - Clinical utility of the 'Impact of Event Scale- Revised' for identifying Acute Stress Disorder in survivors of sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Results from the multicenter REVIVAL cohort
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the Danish patient-reported Impact of Event-Scale Revised (IES-R) as a screening tool for Acute Stress Disorder in a population of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Methods: The REVIVAL study was designed as a multicenter cohort study of OHCA survivors in which survivors self-reported the IES-R. A subset of survivors underwent the clinician-rated Acute Stress Disorder Interview during hospitalization. Psychometric evaluation of the IES-R included reliability and validity testing. Structural validity was assessed using factor analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve were used to evaluate the discriminative ability of different IES-R thresholds in classifying probable Acute Stress Disorder, as determined by interview. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each cut-off value. The best performing IES-R threshold was applied to the total population to examine prevalence of probable Acute Stress Disorder. Results: Overall, 244 survivors completed the IES-R, out of which 106 completed the Acute Stress Disorder Interview. Good internal consistency and convergent validity of the IES-R were observed. Factor analysis supported the original three-factor structure of the IES-R. An IES-R total cut-off score of >= 30 showed the best sensitivity-to-specificity ratio; the scale correctly classified 77% of the survivors with a sensitivity rate of 100% and a specificity rate of 75% (n = 106). Using this IES-R cut-off score, the prevalence of probable Acute Stress Disorder was 23% (n = 244). Conclusion: The IES-R appears to be a useful screening tool for Acute Stress Disorder during hospitalisation and helps clinicians make post- cardiac arrest diagnostic and treatment decisions.

TI  - Neuroprotective Approaches for Brain Injury After Cardiac Arrest: Current Trends and Prospective Avenues
T2  - JOURNAL OF STROKE
AB  - With the implementation of improved bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques and public-access defibrillation, survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has increased significantly over the years. Nevertheless, OHCA survivors have residual anoxia/reperfusion brain damage and associated neurological impairment resulting in poor quality of life. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or targeted temperature management has proven effective in improving post-cardiac arrest (CA) neurological outcomes, yet considering the substantial healthcare costs and resources involved, there is an urgent need for alternative treatment strategies that are crucial to alleviate brain injury and promote recovery of neurological function after CA. In this review, we searched PubMed for the latest preclinical or clinical studies (2016-2023) utilizing gas-mediated, pharmacological, or stem cell-based neuroprotective approaches after CA. Preclinical studies utilizing various gases (nitric oxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, argon, and xenon), pharmacological agents targeting specific CA-related pathophysiology, and stem cells have shown promising results in rodent and porcine models of CA. Although inhaled gases and several pharmacological agents have entered clinical trials, most have failed to demonstrate therapeutic effects in CA patients. To date, stem cell therapies have not been reported in clinical trials for CA. A relatively small number of preclinical stem-cell studies with subtle therapeutic benefits and unelucidated mechanistic explanations warrant the need for further preclinical studies including the improvement of their therapeutic potential. The current state of the field is discussed and the exciting potential of stem-cell therapy to abate neurological dysfunction following CA is highlighted.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in children
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   To summarize current opinion and advances in pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including etiology, pathophysiology, rationale for interventions, and postresuscitation management.
   Recent findings
   Cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation in children are not as uncommon as previously reported. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in 8-20 children/100 000/year, and in-hospital arrests occur in 2-6% admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit. Most pediatric arrests are precipitated by asphyxia or circulatory shock, but approximately 10% are precipitated by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. In addition, greater than 1/4 of children with in-hospital cardiac arrests have ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation at some time during the event. After out-of-hospital arrests, approximately 10% survive to hospital discharge, whereas greater than 25% survive to discharge after in-hospital arrests. Appropriate interventions differ during the four phases of cardiac arrest: prearrest, no-flow, low-flow, and postresuscitation. Close monitoring and prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation can minimize the no-flow phase, good quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation is important during the low-flow phase, defibrillation is necessary for ventricular fibrillation, and aggressive supportive care is important during the postresuscitation phase.
   Summary
   Recent advances in our understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and therapies tied to the timing, phase, and duration of cardiac arrest can improve outcomes for children. New epidemiological data and multicenter studies are ushering in the era of evidence-based pediatric resuscitation therapeutics.

TI  - Perceived Cognition after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Association with Quality of Life, Mood and Fatigue in the THORESCI Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a common invasive procedure for the treatment of coronary artery diseases. Long-term cognitive functioning after PCI and its association with health-related quality of life (HRQL) and psychological factors is relatively unknown. The aim of this study is to examine whether perceived cognitive functioning during the year after PCI is associated with HRQL over this time period, and whether mood, fatigue, and age are associated with changes in perceived cognition and HRQL.
   Patients undergoing PCI (n = 384, 79% male, mean age = 63, SD = 10) were recruited in the observational Tilburg Health Outcome Registry of Emotional Stress after Coronary Intervention (THORESCI) cohort study. Perceived concentration and attention problems, HRQL, mood, and fatigue were assessed at baseline, at 1-month and 12-month follow-up.
   General linear mixed modeling analysis showed that across time, between- and within-subject differences in perceived concentration problems were associated with a reduced HRQL in all domains independent of clinical and demographic covariates. Only a part of this association could be explained by negative mood, fatigue, and older age. Similar findings were found for between-subject differences in perceived attention problems.
   Between-subject differences and within-subject changes in perceived cognition in PCI patients were strongly associated with HRQL across time, such that poorer perceived cognition was associated with poorer HRQL, independent of demographic and clinical variables. Most of the associations were also independent of mood and fatigue. The results should increase the awareness of clinicians for the role of cognition in the cardiac rehabilitation and recovery post-PCI.

TI  - From Resuscitation to Rehabilitation: The Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Continuum in Sepsis Care
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis and septic shock affect nearly 49 million people worldwide each year. Although advances in early recognition and evidence-based management have improved survival, many patients experience long-term cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments collectively known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These sequelae often extend to families and caregivers (PICS-F), resulting in lasting declines in quality of life. Recovery from sepsis represents a continuum that begins during intensive care and extends into survivorship. Decisions regarding analgesia, sedation, delirium prevention, mobilization, and family engagement shape this recovery trajectory. The ABCDEF bundle provides an evidence-based framework to mitigate these long-term effects through structured approaches to pain control, paired awakening and breathing trials, targeted sedation, early mobility, and family involvement. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on PICS in sepsis and septic shock and examines how implementation of the ABCDEF bundle across the continuum of care can reduce the incidence and severity of post-ICU impairments. Reframing sepsis survivorship as an ongoing process rather than an endpoint underscores the need for critical care practices that promote not only survival but also restoration of function, cognition, and quality of life.

TI  - Determinants of hospital and one-year mortality among older patients admitted to intensive care units: results from the multicentric SENIOREA cohort
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background Improving outcomes of older patients admitted into intensive care units (ICU) is a raising concern. This study aimed at determining which geriatric and ICU parameters were associated with in-hospital and long-term mortality in this population. Methods We conducted a prospective multicentric observational cohort study, including patients aged 75 years and older requiring mechanical ventilation, admitted between September 2012 and December 2013 into ICU of 13 French hospitals. Comprehensive geriatric assessment at ICU admission and ICU usual parameters were registered in a standardized manner. Survival was recorded and comprehensive geriatric assessment was updated after 1 year during a dedicated home visit. Results 501 patients were analyzed. 108 patients (21.6%) died during the hospital stay. One-year survival rate was 53.8% (IC 95% [49.2%; 58.2%]). Factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality were higher acute illness severity score, resuscitated cardiac arrest as primary ICU diagnosis, perception of anxiety and low quality of life by the proxy, and living in a chronic care facility before ICU admission. Among patients alive at hospital discharge, factors associated with increased 1-year mortality in multivariate analysis were longer duration of mechanical ventilation, all primary ICU diagnoses other than septic shock, a Katz-activities of daily living (ADL) score below 5 and living in a chronic care facility before ICU admission. Among the 163 survivors at 1 year who received a second comprehensive geriatric assessment, the ADL score (functional abilities) showed a significant but moderate decline over time, whereas the Mini-Zarit score (family burden) improved. No significant change in patients' place of life was observed after 1 year, and quality of life was reported as happy-to-very-happy in 88% of survivors. Conclusions The mortality rate remains high among older ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Factors associated with short- and long-term mortality combined geriatric and ICU criteria, which should be jointly evaluated in routine care. Clinical trial registration NCT01679171

TI  - Sepsis and Septic Shock During Pregnancy and Postpartum
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Sepsis complicates an estimated 1 in 1,000 pregnancies and is responsible for 24% of in-hospital maternal deaths. Because most cases occur outside of the hospital, it is crucial to educate patients about warning signs to seek early medical care and for clinicians to engage in critical listening and evaluation of patient concerns. In the hospital, screening patients for vital sign aberrancy, followed by bedside and laboratory evaluation for signs of end-organ injury, prompt antibiotic therapy, and restoration of perfusion (through fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration), is critical for optimal outcomes. Long-term sequelae are common and include psychological sequelae, cognitive dysfunction, and weakness. Screening for these long-term effects and referrals for treatment are key to patient recovery.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in children
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   To summarize recent advances in pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest prevention, resuscitation and postresuscitation management.
   Recent findings
   Pediatric cardiac arrest has traditionally been considered a futile medical condition with dismal outcomes. Data in the 21st century indicate that more than 25% of children treated for in-hospital cardiac arrests survive to hospital discharge and more than 10% of children older than 1 year treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests survive to hospital discharge. These data establish that children are more likely to survive to hospital discharge than adults after both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Before arrest, exciting new studies demonstrate that the implementation of in-hospital pediatric medical emergency teams is associated with significant decreases in cardiac arrest incidence and overall pediatric hospital mortality. During arrest, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, once thought to be rare in children, occurs during 25% of in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrests and at least 7% of out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrests. Survival to hospital discharge is much more likely after arrests with a first documented rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia than after pulseless electric activity and asystole. However, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia is not always a favorable rhythm, as survival to discharge is much less likely when ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia occurs during resuscitation from an arrest with the first documented rhythm of pulseless electric activity or asystole. Further, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cardiopulmonary resuscitation appears promising under special resuscitation circumstances to improve outcome from highly selected in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest victims. Further, postresuscitation interventions such as goal-directed therapies and therapeutic hypothermia have been demonstrated in adults and infants to improve outcome for selected cardiac arrest victims and are promising candidate targets for study in children.
   Summary
   Pediatric cardiac arrest is not a futile condition; many children are successfully resuscitated each year. The implementation of new prearrest, intraarrest and postresuscitative therapies has the potential to further improve survival rates following pediatric cardiac arrest.

TI  - Combination of Hydrogen Inhalation and Hypothermic Temperature Control After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Post hoc Analysis of the Efficacy of Inhaled Hydrogen on Neurologic Outcome Following Brain Ischemia During PostCardiac Arrest Care II Trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE:The Efficacy of Inhaled Hydrogen on Neurologic Outcome Following Brain Ischemia During Post-Cardiac Arrest Care (HYBRID) II trial (jRCTs031180352) suggested that hydrogen inhalation may reduce post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI). However, the combination of hypothermic target temperature management (TTM) and hydrogen inhalation on outcomes is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of hydrogen inhalation and hypothermic TTM on outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). DESIGN:Post hoc analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING:Fifteen Japanese ICUs. PATIENTS:Cardiogenic OHCA enrolled in the HYBRID II trial. INTERVENTIONS:Hydrogen mixed oxygen (hydrogen group) versus oxygen alone (control group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:TTM was performed at a target temperature of 32-34 degrees C (TTM32-TTM34) or 35-36 degrees C (TTM35-TTM36) per the institutional protocol. The association between hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 and 90-day good neurologic outcomes was analyzed using generalized estimating equations. The 90-day survival was compared between the hydrogen and control groups under TTM32-TTM34 and TTM35-TTM36, respectively. The analysis included 72 patients (hydrogen [n = 39] and control [n = 33] groups) with outcome data. TTM32-TTM34 was implemented in 25 (64%) and 24 (73%) patients in the hydrogen and control groups, respectively (p = 0.46). Under TTM32-TTM34, 17 (68%) and 9 (38%) patients achieved good neurologic outcomes in the hydrogen and control groups, respectively (relative risk: 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.66], p < 0.05). Hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 was independently associated with good neurologic outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 16.10 [95% CI, 1.88-138.17], p = 0.01). However, hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 did not improve survival compared with TTM32-TTM34 alone (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22 [95% CI, 0.05-1.06], p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS:Hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 was associated with improved neurologic outcomes after cardiogenic OHCA compared with TTM32-TTM34 monotherapy. Hydrogen inhalation is a promising treatment option for reducing PCABI when combined with TTM32-TTM34.

TI  - Supportive technology in the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   To discuss the increasing value of technological tools to assess and augment the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, in turn, improve chances of surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Recent findings
   After decades of disappointing survival rates, various emergency medical services systems worldwide are now seeing a steady rise in OHCA survival rates guided by newly identified sweet spots' for chest compression rate and chest compression depth, aided by monitoring for unnecessary pauses in chest compressions as well as methods to better ensure full-chest recoil after compressions. Quality-assurance programs facilitated by new technologies that monitor chest compression rate, chest compression depth, and/or frequent pauses have been shown to improve the quality of CPR. Further aided by other technologies that enhance flow or better identify the best location for hand placement, the future outlook for better survival is even more promising, particularly with the potential use of another technology - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for OHCA.
   Summary
   After 5 decades of focus on manual chest compressions for CPR, new technologies for monitoring, guiding, and enhancing CPR performance may enhance outcomes from OHCA significantly in the coming years.

T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Available literature suggests a need for both initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation basic life support training and refresher courses for parents and the public as well as health care professionals. The promotion of basic life support training courses that establish a pediatric chain of survival spanning from prevention of cardiac arrest and trauma to rehabilitative and follow-up care for victims of cardiopulmonary arrest is advocated in this policy statement and is the focus of an accompanying technical report. Immediate bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation for victims of cardiac arrest improves survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Pediatricians will improve the chance of survival of children and adults who experience cardiac arrest by advocating for cardiopulmonary resuscitation training and participating in basic life support training courses as participants and instructors.

TI  - Can We Accept Donors Who Have Suffered a Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest?
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 1st Congress of the Spanish-Society-of-Transplantation (SET)
AB  - Introduction and aims. The shortage of donor organs has prompted increased acceptance of hearts from donors with more comorbidities. With increasing frequency, hearts are being offered from patients who have undergone a resuscitated cardiac arrest (RCA). Our aim was to compare the rate of complications in the postoperative and follow-up periods, depending on whether the transplanted organ came from a donor who had undergone an RCA.
   Materials and methods. We included all 604 heart transplantations (His) performed in our center from 1987 to 2009, including 25 recipients who received an organ from a donor who had undergone RCA. We considered RCA to be an in-hospital cardiac arrest that was resuscitated from the onset, with a duration of <30 minutes, and with total recovery of cardiac and hemodynamic function. We analyzed ischemia time, incidence of acute graft failure (AGF), intubation period, recovery room stay, and long-term survival. The statistical methods were Student t and chi-square tests.
   Results. There were no differences in baseline characteristics, except that patients in the RCA group were younger (47 +/- 13 vs 51 +/- 11 years; P = .50). There were also no differences between the RCA group and the other patients in ischemia time (151 50 vs 154 53 minutes; P = .826), incidence of AGF (33% vs 24.7%; P = .311), hours of intubation (76 +/- 204 vs 72 +/- 249; P = .926), days of recovery room stay (6 +/- 7 vs 8 +/- 6; P = .453), or survival after HT (53 +/- 54 vs 53 +/- 52 months; P = .982).
   Conclusions. Patients receiving a heart from a patient with an in-hospital RCA and subsequent hemodynamic stability have a similar outcomes to other HT patients.

Finally, factors that are associated with a higher care burden at 12 months after the cardiac arrest were investigated.
   Subjects: A total of 195 family caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors were included.
   Main measures: Quality of life (SF-36, EuroQol-VAS), caregiver strain (CSI) and emotional functioning (HADS, IES) were measured at two weeks, three months and one year after the cardiac arrest. Thereby, the caregiver was asked to fill out the cognitive failure questionnaire (CFQ) to evaluate their view on the cognitive status of the patient.
   Results: Caregiver strain was high in 16 (15%) of the caregivers at 12 months. Anxiety was present in 33 (25%) caregivers and depression in 18 (14%) caregivers at 12 months. The repeated measures MANOVA showed that during the first year the following variables improved significantly: SF-36 domains social and mental health, role physical, role emotional and vitality, caregiver strain, HADS and IES (P<0.001). At 12 months caregiver strain correlated significantly (explained variance 63%, P=0.03) with caregiver HADS (P=0.01), EuroQol-VAS (P=0.02), and the CFQ (P<0.001), all measured at 12 months after the cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions: Overall wellbeing of the caregivers improves during the first year up to normal levels, but caregivers with emotional problems or perceived cognitive problems at 12 months are at risk for developing a higher care burden.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation without target temperature management for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients prolongs the therapeutic time window: a retrospective analysis of a nationwide multicentre observational study in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a promising therapy for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) compared with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). The no and low-flow time (NLT), the interval from collapse to reperfusion to starting ECMO or to the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in CCPR, is associated with the neurological outcome of OHCA. Because the effects of target temperature management (TTM) on the outcomes of ECPR are unclear, we compared the neurological outcomes of OHCA between ECPR and CCPR without TTM. Methods We performed retrospective subanalyses of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry. Witnessed cases of adult cardiogenic OHCA without TTM were selected. We performed univariate, multivariable and propensity score analyses to compare the neurological outcomes after ECPR or CCPR in all eligible patients and in patients with NLT of > 30 min or > 45 min. Results We analysed 2585 cases. Propensity score analysis showed negative result in all patients (odds ratio 0.328 [95% confidence interval 0.141-0.761],P= 0.010). However, significant associated with better neurological outcome was shown in patients with NLT of > 30 min or > 45 min (odds ratio 2.977 [95% confidence interval 1.056-8.388],P= 0.039, odds ratio 5.099 [95% confidence interval 1.259-20.657],P= 0.023, respectively). Conclusion This study revealed significant differences in the neurological outcomes between ECPR and CCPR without TTM, in patients with NLT of > 30 min.

TI  - Frequency and methodologic rigor of quality-of-life assessments in the critical care literature
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To present a framework for describing/measuring quality of life (QOL) and health-related quality of life (HRQL), and to assess the frequency and methodologic rigor of QOL studies in the adult critical care literature.
   Data Sources: Computerized bibliographic search of published research, manual search of key intensive care unit (ICU) journals, and citation review of relevant articles.
   Study Selection: We manually searched Critical Care Medicine American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, and Intensive Care Medicine for the period January 1992 to July 1995 to assess the frequency of published QOL studies. Combined with a computerized bibliographic search, we found 64 studies that met our criteria that reported on patient-related outcomes (other than mortality) after hospital discharge.
   Data Extraction: We abstracted data on the nature of each study, the instruments used to measure QOL, and the methodologic rigor of the QOL assessments. We evaluated each study using criteria we developed to assess the validity of HRQL measurements.
   Measurements and Main Results: in our manual search, we found 1,073 articles relevant to the practice of adult critical care. Of these, 19(1.7%)/1073 included QOL measurements. Combined with our comprehensive search strategy, we found 64 papers that evaluated QOL in ICU patients. These papers dealt primarily with issues of: prognosis(32 [50%]), resource allocation (23 [36%]), and clinical prediction (9 [14%]). We found no randomized trials that included post-ICU QOL as an outcome. With respect to the validity of the HRQL assessments, 63/64 (98%) studies evaluated aspects at patients' lives that we considered important. Thirty-three (52%) studies were limited in scope to specific aspects of HRQL, and 31 (48%) studies covered broad areas of HRQL. In these 64 studies, there were 108 different instruments used. The reliability and validity of the instruments used were reported in 7 (6%) and 15 (14%) cases, respectively. For 81 (75%) instruments, the investigators either explained the results or used informative, qualitative descriptors whose interpretation was self-evident. Overall, three (5%) of the included studies met all four methodologic criteria to assess the validity of HRQL assessments.
   Conclusions: QOL assessments occur infrequently in the ICU literature and are of limited methodologic quality. More studies using valid and reliable instruments are necessary to document the long-term QOL of critically ill patients, especially those at risk of a "poor" outcome.

TI  - Post-Cardiac Arrest Encephalopathy
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Brain injury continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest. During periods of hypoxia and ischemia, numerous mechanisms contribute to the initial and secondary injury of the brain. Though many drugs and therapies have been evaluated for neuroprotection, only therapeutic hypothermia has been proven to be effective. Accurate prognostication after cardiac arrest is essential, and can be achieved with careful neurologic examination and several ancillary tests utilizing neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and biochemistry. Practice guidelines are now available for prognostication and postresuscitation care, with emphasis on improving survival and quality of life. Also reviewed are a wide spectrum of postarrest neurologic complications and their targeted treatments.

TI  - Ethics in the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adults
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) promises to be an important advance in the treatment of cardiac arrest. However, ECPR involves ethical challenges that should be addressed as it diffuses into practice. Benefits and risks are uncertain, so the evidence base needs to be further developed, at least through outcomes registries and potentially with randomized trials. To inform decision making, patients' preferences regarding ECPR should be obtained, both from the general population and from inpatients at risk for cardiac arrest. Fair and transparent appropriate use criteria should be developed and could be informed by economic analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Different forms of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of death in the Western world with an estimated number of 275 000 treated with resuscitation attempts by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in Europe each year. Overall survival rates remain low, and most studies indicate that around 1 out 10 will survive to 30 days. Amongst the strongest factors associated with survival in OHCA is first recorded rhythm amendable to defibrillation, early defibrillation and prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Overall, CPR started prior to EMS arrival has repeatedly been shown to be associated with survival rates 2-3 times higher compared with no such initiation. The primary goal of CPR is to generate sufficient blood flow to vital organs, mainly the brain and heart, until restoration of spontaneous circulation can be achieved. Barriers to the initiation of CPR by bystanders in OHCA include fear of being incapable, causing harm, and transmission of infectious diseases. Partly due to these barriers, and low rates of CPR, the concept of CPR with compression only was proposed as a simpler form of resuscitation with the aim to be more widely accepted by the public in the 1990s. But how reliable is the evidence supporting this simpler form of CPR, and are the outcomes after CO-CPR comparable to standard CPR?

TI  - Sex disparities in bystander defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Previous studies have suggested that females experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) receive lower rates of both bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation compared to males. Whether this disparity has improved over time is unknown.Methods: A state-wide OHCA registry in Victoria, Australia collected data over twenty years (2002-2021) regarding rates of bystander interventions in OHCA. Characteristics and outcomes of each OHCA were compared with logistic regression according to sex and time (defined in two-year periods).Results: 32,502 OHCAs were included (69.7% male). Both bystander CPR and defibrillation rates increased for females over time (p < 0.0001). There was no sex disparity in receipt of bystander CPR after adjustment for baseline differences. Females were less likely than males to receive bystander defibrillation, with sex disparity increasing from 2010 onwards (adjOR 0.26 (95%CI 0.09-0.80) in 2020-21 for females compared to males).Conclusion: Initiatives to increase bystander CPR and defibrillation have resulted in higher overall rates of bystander interventions in the last two decades and no significant sex differences in provision of bystander CPR. However, females receive less bystander defibrillation than males, and sex disparity is increasing. Strategies to promote bystander defibrillation in females experiencing OHCA with a shockable rhythm should be a priority.

TI  - The addition of voice prompts to audiovisual feedback and debriefing does not modify CPR quality or outcomes in out of hospital cardiac arrest - A prospective, randomized trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: Chest compression quality is a determinant of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). ERC 2005 guidelines recommend the use of technical devices to support rescuers giving compressions. This prospective randomized study reviewed influence of different feedback configurations on survival and compression quality.
   Materials and methods: 312 patients suffering an OHCA were randomly allocated to two different feedback configurations. In the limited feedback group a metronome and visual feedback was used. In the extended feedback group voice prompts were added. A training program was completed prior to implementation, performance debriefing was conducted throughout the study.
   Results: Survival did not differ between the extended and limited feedback groups (47.8% vs 43.9%, p = 0.49). Average compression depth (mean +/- SD: 4.74 +/- 0.86 cm vs 4.84 +/- 0.93 cm, p = 0.31) was similar in both groups. There were no differences in compression rate (103 +/- 7 vs 102 +/- 5 min(-1), p = 0.74) or hands-off fraction (16.16% +/- 0.07 to 17.04% +/- 0.07, p = 0.38). Bystander CPR, public arrest location, presenting rhythm and chest compression depth were predictors of short term survival (ROSC to ED).
   Conclusions: Even limited CPR-feedback combined with training and ongoing debriefing leads to high chest compression quality. Bystander CPR, location, rhythm and chest compression depth are determinants of survival from out of hospital cardiac arrest. Addition of voice prompts does neither modify CPR quality nor outcome in OHCA. CC depth significantly influences survival and therefore more focus should be put on correct delivery. Further studies are needed to examine the best configuration of feedback to improve CPR quality and survival.

TI  - NPP-GPT: Forecasting nuclear power plants operating parameters using pre-trained large language model
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Accurate long-term forecasting of operating parameters in nuclear power plants (NPPs) is crucial for safety and cost-effective maintenance. However, the complexity and uncertainty of reactors, along with the high-dimensional and large-scale operating data, present challenges in capturing intricate dynamic behaviors and long-term de pendencies. This paper presents NPP-GPT, which for the first time investigates the potential of using pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to forecast long-term parameters from historical NPP data without explicit prompt engineering. Considering the modal disparity between textual pre-training data and numerical energy data, NPP-GPT employs a two-stage cross-modal transfer learning strategy that preserves the native next-token forecasting capability of LLMs while unlocking their potential for precise energy forecasting. First, the modal gap is bridged through input embedding reconstruction and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Second, domain-specific energy knowledge is integrated via LoRA fine-tuning. The framework was rigorously validated using data from an estab lished advanced nuclear energy research platform, focusing on a Chinese Pressurized Water Reactor (CPR-1000). Comprehensive experiments covering diverse operational scenarios, including normal and multiple fault condi tions, demonstrated that NPP-GPT outperforms both classical and advanced time-series forecasting models in accuracy and generalization, especially in long-term forecasting and under conditions with noise and missing data. This study offers a novel and generalizable solution for forecasting tasks in energy sectors.

TI  - Quality of life and functional outcomes after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Our aim was to determine the association of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) with quality of life after discharge.Methods: We performed a systematic review using available databases for studies that measured any quality-of-life or functional outcome both before and after CPR for IHCA. All screening and data abstraction was performed in duplicate.Results: We screened 10,927 records and included 24 papers representing 20 unique studies. Fifteen studies measured Cerebral Performance Category. Survival ranged from 11.8% to 39.5%. The risk of impaired cerebral function after discharged ranged from-16.1% (lower risk) to 44.7% increased risk of poor cerebral function after surviving to discharge. Four studies measured discharge to an institutional environment finding that the risk was increased by 18.2-72.2% among survivors. One study measured EQ-5D and found no difference pre and post CPR. One study measured performance of activities of daily living finding that survivors needed assistance with more activities after discharge.Conclusion: Our review is limited by the lack of adjustment for confounders, including the baseline level of each outcome, in all included studies. Therefore, although risk for most outcomes was increased after discharge vs pre-admission we cannot be certain if this is a causal relationship.

TI  - Cardiac function after cardiac arrest: what do we know?
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - Postcardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PCAMD) is a frequent complication faced during post-resuscitation care that adversely impacts survival and neurological outcome. Both mechanical and electrical factors contribute to the occurrence of PCAMD. Prearrest ventricular function, the cause of cardiac arrest, global ischemia, resuscitation factors, ischemia/reperfusion injury and post-resuscitation treatments contribute to the severity of PCMAD. the pathophysiology of PCAMD is complex and include myocytes energy failure, impaired contractility, cardiac edema, mitochondrial damage, activation of inflammatory pathways and the coagulation cascade, persistent ischemic injury and myocardial stiffness. Hypotension and low cardiac output with vasopressor/inotropes need are frequent after resuscitation. However, clinical, hemodynamic and laboratory signs of shock are frequently altered by cardiac arrest pathophysiology and post-resuscitation treatment, potentially being misleading and not fully reflecting the severity of postcardiac arrest syndrome. Even if validated criteria are lacking, an extensive hemodynamic evaluation is useful to define a "benign" and a "malign" form of myocardial dysfunction and circulatory shock, potentially having treatment and prognostic implications. cardiac output is frequently decreased after cardiac arrest, particularly in patients treated with target temperature management (TTM); however, it is not independently associated with outcome. sinus bradycardia during TTM seems independently associated with survival and good neurological outcome, representing a promising prognostic indicator. Higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) seems to be associated with improved survival and cerebral function after cardiac arrest; however, two recent randomized clinical trials failed to replicate these results. recommendations on hemodynamic optimization are relatively poor and are largely based on general principle of intensive care medicine.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for critically ill adults in the emergency department: history, current applications, and future directions
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a mode of extracorporeal life support that augments oxygenation, ventilation and/or cardiac output via cannulae connected to a circuit that pumps blood through an oxygenator and back into the patient. ECMO has been used for decades to support cardiopulmonary disease refractory to conventional therapy. While not robust, there are promising data for the use of ECMO in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock and the potential indications for ECMO continue to increase. This review discusses the existing literature on the potential use of ECMO in critically ill patients within the emergency department.

TI  - Rehabilitation after Cardiac Arrest: Integration of Neurologic and Cardiac Rehabilitation
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Cognitive impairments are common after resuscitation. Severe cognitive impairments are easily recognized. Mild cognitive impairments are much more difficult to spot. Given the influence of cognitive problems in daily functioning, it is important to identify cognitive impairments at an early stage. Also, emotional problems, mainly depression and fear, are common in this group of patients. To optimize the care for patients after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, rehabilitation should focus on the physical approach through cardiac rehabilitation and on brain injury and associated cognitive impairments. The goal of rehabilitation after a cardiac arrest is to provide excellent patient centered cardiac and cognitive rehabilitation to all patients and their spouses to achieve optimal participation in society, with minimal burden for spouses and society. To achieve this, cardiac and cognitive rehabilitation need to be coordinated in an integrated care path.

TI  - Mechanisms, Diagnostic Approaches, and Treatment Strategies in Cardiac Arrest
T2  - INSUFICIENCIA CARDIACA
AB  - Cardiac arrest is a critical, life-threatening event defined by the abrupt cessation of effective cardiac activity, resulting in an immediate interruption of blood flow to vital organs. It remains one of the leading causes of death globally and demands prompt medical intervention to enhance the chances of survival and neurological recovery. The causes of cardiac arrest are varied and include ventricular arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, and underlying structural heart disease. This review examines the mechanisms underlying cardiac arrest, the principal diagnostic approaches used to identify its etiology and guide therapy, and current management strategies. Particular emphasis is placed on evidence-based resuscitation practices, comprehensive post-cardiac arrest care, and emerging therapeutic interventions designed to improve clinical outcomes in affected patients.

TI  - Predicting arrhythmia-free survival using spectral and modified-moving average analyses of T-wave alternans
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background: T-wave alternans (TWA) is a promising electrocardiogram (ECG) predictor of sudden cardiac arrest, yet needs specialized recordings for conventional spectral analysis. Modified moving average (MMA) analysis is a new approach that can measure TWA from routine ECGs, thus widening its applicability. However, MMA-TWA has not been calibrated against spectral TWA nor outcome in high risk patients. We hypothesized that spectral and MMA-TWA would both predict arrhythmia-free survival on long-term prospective follow-up.
   Methods and Results: In 41 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 31 +/- 13%), we studied TWA simultaneously using spectral and MMA during pacing (< 110 beats/min). MMA amplified TWA over spectral analyses (13.0 +/- 8.28 mu V vs 1.96 +/- 5.15 mu V, P < 0.001). On 542 +/- 311 days' follow-up, from clinic visits, telephonic interviews, and device interrogations, there were 11 deaths or sustained ventricular arrhythmias ('events'). Positive spectral TWA (>= 1.9 mu V) identified patients with from those without events (P = 0.02). Receiver-operating characteristics for MMA-TWA showed that the cutpoint >= 10.75 mu V was optimal for the combined endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis using this MMA-TWA cutpoint trended to predict events (P = 0.06), while MMA combined with spectral TWA identified events (P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: MMA amplifies TWA compared to traditional spectral analyses, but both likely reflect similar pathophysiology. Validation in larger populations will enable MMA-TWA to be widely applied to stratify risk for sudden cardiac arrest.

AB  - Background: In-depth analysis of emergency medical services (EMSs) performances in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) promotes quality improvement.
   Aims: The purpose of this study was to identify the improvable factors of the EMS response to OHCA through the description and analysis of OHCA incidence, characteristics, management and outcome.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study on all OHCA patients treated by the EMSs of the district of Trieste, Italy (236,556 inhabitants) in 2011.
   Results: A total of 678 OHCAs occurred and 142 (20.1%) underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), with a respective incidence of 287/100,000/year and 60/100,000/year. The incidence of shockable rhythms in the CPR group was 13/100,000. OHCAs occurred mainly during daytime, though the proportion of patients receiving CPR was significantly higher by night-time (p=0.01). Thirty-four CPR patients (23.9%) restored spontaneous circulation on scene; 12 (8.5%) survived to hospital discharge (11 with good neurological recovery). Survival was not correlated with age, while was significantly higher for patients with shockable rhythms (32.3%; p<0.001). Mean response time was 8 min. Direct intervention of physician-staffed units did not improve the outcome when compared with two-tiered activation. Patients immediately identified as OHCA by dispatch nurses and those undergoing therapeutic hypothermia showed a non-significant trend towards improved survival (p=0.09 and 0.07, respectively).
   Conclusions: OHCA identification by dispatch nurses and reduction of response time were the factors most susceptible to improvement.

TI  - Prospective observational study of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and early reperfusion for refractory cardiac arrest in Sydney: the 2CHEER study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Patients with prolonged cardiac arrest that is not responsive to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation have poor outcomes. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory cardiac arrest has shown promising results in carefully selected cases. We sought to validate the results from an earlier extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) study (the CHEER trial.
   Methods: Prospective, consecutive patients with refractory in-hospital (INCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who met predefined inclusion criteria received protocolised care, including mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initiation of EC MO, and early coronary angiography (if an acute coronary syndrome was suspected).
   Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study (11 OHCA, 14 IHCA); the median age was 57 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39-65 years), and 17 patients (68%) were male. ECMO was established in all patients, with a median time from arrest to ECMO support of 57 minutes (IQR, 38-73 min). Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on 18 patients (72%). The median duration of ECMO support was 52 hours (IQR, 24-108 h). Survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological recovery occurred in 11/25 patients (44%, of which 72% had IHCA and 27% had OHCA). When adjusting for lactate, arrest to ECMO flow time was predictive of survival (odds ratio, 0.904; P = 0.035).
   Conclusion: ECMO for refractory cardiac arrest shows promising survival rates if protocolised care is applied in conjunction with predefined selection criteria.

TI  - Partial liquid ventilation for preventing death and morbidity in adults with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are syndromes of severe respiratory failure that are associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Artifical ventilatory support is commonly required and may exacerbate lung injury. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) has been proposed as a less injurious form of ventilatory support for these patients. Although PLV has been shown to improve gas exchange and to reduce inflammation in experimental models of ALI, a previous systematic review did not find any evidence to support or refute its use in humans with ALI and ARDS.
   Objectives
   The primary objective of this review was to assess whether PLV reduced mortality (at 28 d, at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), at discharge from hospital and at one, two and five years) in adults with ALI or ARDS when compared with conventional ventilatory support.
   Secondary objectives were to determine how PLV compared with conventional ventilation with regard to duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, incidence of infection, long-term cognitive impairment, long-term health related quality of life, long-term lung function, long-term morbidity costs and adverse events. The following adverse events were considered: hypoxia (arterial PO2 <80 mm Hg), pneumothorax (any air leak into the pleural space requiring therapeutic intervention), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg sustained for longer than two minutes or requiring treatment with fluids or vasoactive drugs), bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats per minute sustained for longer than one minute or requiring therapeutic intervention) and cardiac arrest (absence of effective cardiac output).
   Search methods
   In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 10, 2012, in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1980 to November 2012) and CINAHL (EBSCO-host, 1982 to November 2012) for published studies. In our original review, we searched until May 2004.
   Grey literature was identified by searching conference proceedings and trial registries and by contacting experts in the field. Selection criteria As in the original review, review authors selected randomized controlled trials that compared PLV with other forms of ventilation in adults (16 y of age or older) with ALI or ARDS, reporting one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit or stay in hospital; infection; long-term cognitive impairment or health-related quality of life; long-term lung function or cost.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from included studies.
   Main results
   In this updated review, one new eligible study was identified and included, yielding a total of two eligible studies (including a combined total of 401 participants). Of those 401 participants, 170 received 'high'-dose partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a mean dose of at least 20 mL/kg), 99 received 'low-dose' partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a dose of 10 mL/kg) and 132 received conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for all those who received 'high'-dose PLV versus conventional ventilation. No evidence indicated that 'high'-dose PLV either reduced mortality at 28 d (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.85, P = 0.37) or increased the number of days free of CMV at 28 d (mean difference (MD) -2.24, 95% CI -4.71 to 0.23, P = 0.08). The pooled estimate of effect for bradycardia in those who received PLV was significantly greater than in those who received CMV (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005). Pooled estimates of effect for the following adverse events hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension and cardiac arrest all showed a nonsignificant trend towards a higher occurrence of these events in those treated with PLV. Because neither eligible study addressed morbidity or mortality beyond 28 d, it was not possible to determine the effect of PLV on these outcomes.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm could be candidates for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a retrospective study
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a promising treatment for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Most studies evaluating the effectiveness of ECPR include patients with an initial shockable rhythm. However, the effectiveness of ECPR for patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm remains unknown. This retrospective single-center study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ECPR for patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm, with reference to the outcomes of OHCA patients with an initial shockable rhythm. Methods Adult OHCA patients treated with ECPR at our center during 2011-2018 were included in the study. Patients were classified into the initial shockable rhythm group and the non-shockable rhythm group. The primary outcome was the cerebral performance category (CPC) scale score at hospital discharge. A CPC score of 1 or 2 was defined as a good outcome. Results In total, 186 patients were eligible. Among them, 124 had an initial shockable rhythm and 62 had an initial non-shockable rhythm. Among all patients, 158 (85%) were male, with a median age of 59 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-65) years, and the median low flow time was 41 (IQR, 33-48) min. Collapse was witnessed in 169 (91%) patients, and 36 (19%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) transiently. Proportion of female patients, presence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and collapse after the arrival of emergency medical service personnel were significantly higher in the non-shockable rhythm group. The rate of good outcomes at hospital discharge was not significantly different between the shockable and non-shockable groups (19% vs. 16%,p = 0.69). Initial shockable rhythm was not significantly associated with good outcome after controlling for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.66-3.81,p = 0.31). In the non-shockable group, patients with good outcomes had a higher rate of transient ROSC, and pulmonary embolism was the leading etiology. Conclusions The outcomes of patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm are comparable with those having an initial shockable rhythm. OHCA patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm could be candidates for ECPR, if they are presumed to have reversible etiology and potential for good neurological recovery.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory OHCA: lessons from three randomized controlled trials-the trialists' view
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a promising treatment for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Three recent randomized trials (ARREST trial, Prague OHCA study, and INCEPTION trial) that addressed the clinical benefit of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest yielded seemingly diverging results. The evidence for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, derived from three recent randomized controlled trials, is not contradictory but rather complementary. Excellent results can be achieved with a very high level of dedication, provided that strict selection criteria are applied. However, pragmatic implementation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation does not necessarily lead to improved outcome of refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Centres that are performing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or aspire to do so should critically evaluate whether they are able to meet the pre-requisites that are needed to conduct an effective extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation programme.

TI  - Temperature management and its role in cardiac arrest patients-a review
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - Thermoregulation constitutes one of the most important homeostatic systems of the human body. The human thermoregulatory system is highly complex and intertwined with other regulatory homeostatic systems. Different evolutionary adaptations have evolved to ensure a well-regulated body temperature, encompassing simple behavioural (e.g., seeking shelter. going underground) as well as physiological changes (e.g., vasodilatation. sweating). However, when the heat, cold or other stimuli cause a disruption in the thermoregulatory state and our adaptations can no longer cope with the additional stress. the body enters a pathological state. In such instances other measures must be undertaken. In medicine there are several pathological states associated with disruptions in temperature homeostasis. Consequently, these patients have to be, in broad terms, thermoregulated. Speaking specifically, the most common application of thermoregulation is therapeutic temperature management. A prominent example is the utilisation of this technique in post-cardiac arrest patients, who remain comatose after resuscitation. This technique has been in use for almost 20 years since the first major reports on its benefits in improving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest survival as well as improving neurological outcome. Recently, the findings from one of the biggest targeted temperature international and multicentre trials to date have been published (TTM2 trial; https://ttm2trial.org/). The study surprisingly showed no difference in mortality between patients after out of hospital cardiac arrest, who underwent normo- or hypothermia. Consequently, we might need to re-evaluate certain guidelines, recommendations, and perspectives. The aim of the current review is to present an overview of targeted temperature management in the field of intensive care medicine and cardiac arrest.

TI  - Artificial neural networks improve early outcome prediction and risk classification in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Pre-hospital circumstances, cardiac arrest characteristics, comorbidities and clinical status on admission are strongly associated with outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early prediction of outcome may inform prognosis, tailor therapy and help in interpreting the intervention effect in heterogenous clinical trials. This study aimed to create a model for early prediction of outcome by artificial neural networks (ANN) and use this model to investigate intervention effects on classes of illness severity in cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods Using the cohort of the TTM trial, we performed a post hoc analysis of 932 unconscious patients from 36 centres with OHCA of a presumed cardiac cause. The patient outcome was the functional outcome, including survival at 180 days follow-up using a dichotomised Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale with good functional outcome defined as CPC 1-2 and poor functional outcome defined as CPC 3-5. Outcome prediction and severity class assignment were performed using a supervised machine learning model based on ANN. Results The outcome was predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.891 using 54 clinical variables available on admission to hospital, categorised as background, pre-hospital and admission data. Corresponding models using background, pre-hospital or admission variables separately had inferior prediction performance. When comparing the ANN model with a logistic regression-based model on the same cohort, the ANN model performed significantly better (p = 0.029). A simplified ANN model showed promising performance with an AUC above 0.852 when using three variables only: age, time to ROSC and first monitored rhythm. The ANN-stratified analyses showed similar intervention effect of TTM to 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C in predefined classes with different risk of a poor outcome. Conclusion A supervised machine learning model using ANN predicted neurological recovery, including survival excellently, and outperformed a conventional model based on logistic regression. Among the data available at the time of hospitalisation, factors related to the pre-hospital setting carried most information. ANN may be used to stratify a heterogenous trial population in risk classes and help determine intervention effects across subgroups.

TI  - Impact of smartphone activated first responders on provision of bystander CPR, bystander AED and outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The smartphone application to activate a community first responder (myResponder) was launched in 2015 to activate volunteer first responders for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients in Singapore. This study aimed to investigate the impact of myResponder on provision of bystander CPR, bystander AED, and patient survival outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis using the Singapore Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study between 2016 and 2019 that included adult non-traumatic OHCA patients. Patients were categorized into myResponder activated and non-activated groups. The primary outcomes were bystander CPR and bystander AED. The secondary outcome was survival at 30-days with favourable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance category 1-2). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and we reported adjusted odds ratio [aOR] and 95% confidence interval for the effect of activation. Results: 9,167 patients were included in this analysis. The median (Interquartile range, IQR) age was 71 (59-82) years. The activated group comprised 5,499 (60%) of cases. The activated group was associated with higher bystander CPR (aOR [95%CI]: 5.69 [4.89-6.62]) and bystander AED (aOR [95% CI]: 2.23 [1.82-2.74]) compared to non-activated group. The activated group was associated with better survival at 30 days with favourable neurological outcomes (aOR [95% CI]: 1.54 [1.11-2.15]). Conclusion: We found that the implementation of technology-activated first responders was associated with an improvement in the performance of bystander CPR, bystander AED application, and OHCA outcomes in an urban area. Further efforts should be made to promote the use of activated first responders in EMS systems.

TI  - Impact of implementing novel automated code blue activation system on in-hospital cardiac arrest: A single center study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Prompt identification and management of patients having clinical deterioration on wards is one of the key steps to reduce in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). Our organization implemented a novel Automated Code Blue Alert and Activation (ACBAA) system since 1st March 2018. Methods: We conducted a retrospective before-and-after ACBAA system implementation study in JurongHealth Campus (JHC) of National University Health system (NUHS), Singapore. In JHC, code blue can be activated by both manual activation and ACBAA system activation from 1st March 2018. The ACBAA system will be activated when any of the pre-defined peri-arrest criteria is met. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of IHCA. The secondary outcome included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of IHCA and in-hospital survival to home discharge of code blue activation. Outcomes: The incidence of IHCA per 1000 hospital admissions after-ACBAA system implementation was 14.6% lower than before-ACBAA system though not statistically significant [relative risk (RR): 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.34, P > 0.05]. Compared to the before-ACBAA system period, the after-ACBAA system period had a trend for higher rate of survival to home discharge after IHCA (RR: 2.13, 95% CI 0.65-6.93, P > 0.05) with good neurological outcome. Conclusions: Implementation of a novel ACBAA system has shown a trend in reducing IHCA incidence. In the era of digitalised healthcare system, the ACBAA system is practical and advisable to implement in order to reduce IHCA. Further studies are required to validate the criteria for peri-arrest code blue activation.

TI  - Coagulopathy Induced by Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Is Associated With a Poor Outcome in Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In recent years, the use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in patients with cardiopulmonary arrest who do not respond to conventional resuscitation, has increased. However, despite the development of VA-ECMO, the outcomes of resuscitated patients remain poor. The poor prognosis may be attributed to deterioration owing to the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS); this includes the systemic inflammatory response and coagulation activation caused by the extracorporeal circulation (VA-ECMO circuit) itself. This study aimed to evaluate the coagulofibrinolytic changes caused by VA-ECMO and to identify predictive factors of poor prognosis.
   Methods: We analyzed 151 cases of PCAS with witnessed cardiac arrest. As biomarkers, platelet counts, prothrombin time ratio, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, fibrinogen, antithrombin, and lactate were recorded from blood samples from the time of delivery to the third day of hospitalization. The maximum (max) and minimum (min) values of each factor during the study period were calculated. To evaluate the impact of VA-ECMO on patients with PCAS, we performed propensity score matching between the patients who received and did not receive VA-ECMO. Sub-analysis was performed for the group with VA-ECMO.
   Results: There were significant differences in all baseline characteristics and demographics except the time from detection to hospital arrival, percentage of cardiopulmonary resuscitations (CPR) by witnesses, and the initial rhythm between the groups. Propensity score matching adjusted for prehospital factors demonstrated that the patients who received VA-ECMO developed significantly severe coagulation disorders. In a sub-analysis, significant differences were noted in the prothrombin time ratio min, fibrinogen max, antithrombin max, and lactate min between survivors and non-survivors. In particular, the prothrombin time ratio min and antithrombin max were strongly correlated with poor outcome.
   Conclusion: In the present study, significant coagulopathy was observed in patients who received VA-ECMO for CPR. In particular, in patients receiving VA-ECMO, the minimum prothrombin time ratio and maximum antithrombin by day 3 of hospitalization were strongly correlated with poor outcomes. These results suggest that VA-ECMO-induced coagulopathy can be a promising therapeutic target for patients resuscitated by VA-ECMO.

TI  - Educating Dutch General Practitioners in Dementia Advance Care Planning: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objectives: Advance care planning (ACP) is seldom initiated with people with dementia (PWD) and mainly focuses on medical end-of-life decisions. We studied the effects of an educational intervention for general practitioners (GPs) aimed at initiating and optimizing ACP, with a focus on discussing medical and nonmedical preferences of future care.
   Design: A single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial.
   Setting and participants: In 2016, 38 Dutch GPs (all from different practices) completed the study. They recruited 140 PWD, aged =65 years at any stage and with any type of dementia, from their practice.
   Methods: Intervention group GPs were trained in ACP, including shared decision-making and role-playing exercises. Control group GPs provided usual care. The primary outcome was ACP initiation: the proportion of PWD that had at least 1 ACP conversation documented in their medical file. Key secondary outcomes were the number of medical (ie, resuscitation, hospital admission) and nonmedical (ie, activities, social contacts) preferences discussed. At the 6-month follow-up, subjects' medical records were analyzed using random effect logistics and linear models with correction for GP clustering.
   Results: 38 GP clusters (19 intervention; 19 control) included 140 PWD (intervention 73; control 67). Four PWD (2.9%) dropped out on the primary and key secondary outcomes. After 6 months, intervention group GPs initiated ACP with 35 PWD (49.3%), and control group GPs initiated ACP with 9 PWD (13.9%) [odds ratio (OR) 1.99; P = .002]. Intervention group GPs discussed 0.8 more medical [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3, 1.3; P = .003] and 1.5 more nonmedical (95% CI 0.8, 2.3; P < .001) preferences per person with dementia than control group GPs.
   Conclusions and Implications: Our educational intervention increased ACP initiation, and the number of nonmedical and medical preferences discussed. This intervention has the potential to better align future care of PWD with their preferences but because of the short follow-up, the GPs' long-term adoption remains unknown. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Outcomes in adults living with frailty receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Frailty is a clinical expression of adverse ageing which could be a valuable predictor of outcomes from cardiac arrest. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate survival outcomes in adults living with frailty versus adults living without frailty receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following cardiac arrest.
   Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases was performed using pre-defined search terms, with no date or language restrictions applied. Prospective and retrospective observational studies measuring outcomes from CPR in adults assessed for frailty using an accepted clinical definition were selected.
   Results: Eight eligible studies were included. Seven retrospective observational studies presenting high methodological quality were included in a meta-analysis comprising 1704 participants. Frailty was strongly associated with an increased likelihood of mortality after CPR, with moderate interstudy heterogeneity (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 2.74-4.63, I-2 = 71%).
   Discussion: This review supports the consideration of frailty status in a holistic approach to CPR. The present findings suggest that frailty status provides valuable prognostic information and could complement other known pre-arrest prognostic factors such as comorbidities in the context of Do Not Attempt CPR consideration. Awareness of the poorer outcomes in those living with frailty could support the identification of individuals less likely to benefit from CPR. Validation of our findings and evaluation of quality-of-life in frail individuals surviving cardiac arrest are prerequisites for the future integration of frailty status into CPR clinical decision-making.

TI  - Good quality of life before cardiac arrest predicts good quality of life after resuscitation
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - BackgroundThe survival rate of cardiac arrest patients is increasing. Our aim was to compare the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest and analyse the factors associated with outcome.
   MethodsAll adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to the Tampere University Hospital intensive care unit between 2009 and 2011 were included in a retrospective follow-up study if surviving to discharge and were asked to return a questionnaire after 6 months. Data on patient demographics and pre-arrest quality of life were retrieved from medical records. Data are given as means (SD) or medians [Q(1), Q(3)]. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with better quality of life after cardiac arrest.
   ResultsSix months after cardiac arrest, 36% (79/222) were alive and 70% (55/79) of those patients completed the follow-up EuroQoL (EQ-5D) quality of life questionnaire. Median values for the EQ-5D before and after cardiac arrest were 0.89 [0.63, 1] and 0.89 [0.62, 1], respectively (P = 0.75). Only the EQ-5D prior to cardiac arrest was associated with better quality of life afterwards (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.3; P = 0.02).
   ConclusionsQuality of life remained good after cardiac arrest especially in those patients who had good quality of life before cardiac arrest.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation alone vs. cardiopulmonary resuscitation plus automated external defibrillator use by non-healthcare professionals: A meta-analysis on 1583 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) accounts for 250.000-350.000 sudden cardiac deaths per year in the United States. The availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) promoted the implementation of public access defibrillation programs based on out-of-hospital early defibrillation by non-healthcare professionals.
   Aim of the study: To perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the pooled effect of studies comparing the outcome of pts receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation plus AED therapy (CPR+AED) vs. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) atone, both delivered by non-healthcare professionals, for the treatment of OHCA.
   Methods: We performed a search of the relevant literature exploring major scientific databases, carrying out a hand search of key journals, analysing conference proceedings and abstracts and discussing the topic with other researchers. Two analyses were planned to assess the outcomes of interest (survival to hospital admission and survival to hospital discharge).
   Results: Three studies were selected for the meta-analysis. The first meta-analysis evidenced a RR of 1.22 (95% C.I.: 1.04-1.43) of surviving to hospital admission for people treated withCPR+AED as compared to CPR-only. The second meta-analysis showed a RR of 1.39 (95% C.I.: 1.06-1.83) of surviving to hospital discharge for people treated with CPR+AED as compared to CPR-only.
   Conclusions: The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that programs based on CPR plus early defibrillation with AEDs by trained non-healthcare professionals offer a survival advantage over CPR-only in OHCA. The conclusions of our meta-analysis add to previous evidence in favour of developing public-health strategies based on AED use by trained layrescuers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Acute massive pulmonary embolism with cardiopulmonary resuscitation - Management and results
T2  - TEXAS HEART INSTITUTE JOURNAL
AB  - Patients who experience hemodynamic collapse after acute massive pulmonary embolism have a poor prognosis. Herein, we report our results with 8 patients and discuss a surgical strategy that can improve perioperative survival.
   From August 1994 through May 2005, 8 consecutive patients (6 women, 2 men; age range, 27-68 yr) were urgently referred to our unit after experiencing hemodynamic collapse. All required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Seven patients underwent pulmonary embolectomy One patient was successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy alone under continuous monitoring by the surgical team.
   There were 2 intraoperative deaths (30-day mortality rate, 28.5%). One survivor required a right ventricular assist device. Follow-up of the patients ranged from 8 months to 8 years. One patient died 8 months after the pulmonary embolectomy from long-term complications of cerebral damage that had occurred during preoperative resuscitation.
   We conclude that prompt surgical management improves the early survival rates of patients who require cardiopulmonary resuscitation subsequent to massive pulmonary embolism.

TI  - Aging is only significant factor causing CPR-induced injuries and serious injuries
T2  - LEGAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) sometime cause severe injuries and can affect quality of life, lead to long-term disabilities or death of the patient. The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors causing CPR-induced injuries and those of serious injuries.
   Methods: This was a retrospective forensic autopsy study in a single institution. Among 885 forensic autopsies undertaken between 2011 and 2018, those in which the victim had undergone CPR immediately after cardiac arrest were recorded. 'Serious injuries' were defined as an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score >= 3. CPR-induced injuries were evaluated by three experienced forensic pathologists. With the background and history of the patient, the circumstances of cardiac arrest and risks of causing CPR-induced injuries were determined by multivariate analyses.
   Results: Seventy-five victims comprised the study cohort. CPR-induced injuries were found in 52 victims (69.3%). Rib fracture was the most common (60.0%), followed by sternal fracture (37.3%), heart injury (21.3%) and liver injury (8.0%). Multivariate analysis revealed higher age to be an independent factor causing CPR-induced injuries (odds ratio [OR], 1.07, P < 0.001). Thirty-six victims had 39 serious injuries in the chest or abdomen: fracture of >= 3 ribs (35 cases), aortic dissection (two), lung contusion (one) and rupture of the heart (one). Multivariate analysis revealed higher age to be an independent factor causing CPR-induced serious injuries (OR, 1.09; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Aging was the significant factor causing CPR-induced injuries and serious injuries.

TI  - Health-related quality of life following pediatric critical illness
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The aims of this focused review of the literature on children surviving critical illness were to (1) determine whether health-related quality of life (HRQL) represents a clinically meaningful outcome measure for children surviving critical illness and (2) evaluate the HRQL measures implemented in pediatric critical care studies to date.
   This was a focused review of the literature from 1980 to 2015 based on a search of EMBASE/PubMed, MEDLINE and PsycInfo assessing trends and determinants of HRQL outcomes in children surviving critical illness. We also evaluated the psychometric properties of the HRQL instruments used in the studies identified by examining each measure's reported reliability, validity and sensitivity to clinical change.
   The literature search identified 253 pediatric articles for potential inclusion in the review, among which data from 78 studies were ultimately selected for inclusion. Of the 22 measures utilized in the studies reviewed, only four demonstrated excellent psychometric properties for use in pediatric critical care trials. Trends in HRQL identified in the studies reviewed suggest significant ongoing morbidity for children surviving critical illness. Key determinants of poor HRQL outcomes include reason for PICU admission (sepsis, meningoencephalitis, trauma), antecedents (chronic comorbid conditions), treatments received (prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, long-stay patients, invasive technology), psychological outcomes (post-traumatic stress disorder, parent anxiety/depression) and social and environmental characteristics (low socioeconomic status, parental education and functioning).
   Validated pediatric HRQL instruments are now available. Significant impact on HRQL has been demonstrated in acute and acute on chronic critical illness. Future pediatric critical care interventional trials should include both mortality as well as long-term HRQL measurements to truly ascertain the full impact of critical illness in children.

TI  - Echocardiographic comparison of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using periodic acceleration (pGz) versus chest compression
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: This investigation compared the effects of conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using an automated Thumper (TM) chest compression device to periodic acceleration CPR (pGz-CPR) on early post-resuscitation ventricular function assessed by echocardiography, in an adult pig model of CPR.
   Background: Whole body periodic acceleration along the spinal axis (pGz) is a new method of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Biomechanical forces and biochemical release produced by pGz impart ventilation and increase blood flow. Our laboratory has reported normal neurological and cardiovascular function 48 h after return of spontaneous circulation in animals that have undergone 22 min of pGz-CPR.
   Methods: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in 16 animals (25-35 kg). After 3 min of non-interventional period, the animals were randomized to receive either pGz-CPR or Thumper-CPR for 15 min. After 18 min of VF, a single dose of vasopressin and bicarbonate were administered and defibrillation attempted. An echocardiogram was performed at baseline and serially for 6 h. Ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS) and wall motion were assessed by 2D and M-mode echocardiography.
   Results: Return of spontaneous circulation to 360min occurred in 5/8 (62%) of the animals receiving Thumper-CPR and in 7/8 (88%) receiving pGz-CPR. FS and EF were impaired after CPR, but pGz-CPR animals had less impairment than Thumper-CPR animals. Further, wall motion score index (WMSI) was more impaired after Thumper-CPR and remained as such even 6 h post-CPR.
   Conclusion: pGz holds promise as a new method for CPR with better left ventricular (LV) function post-CPR than the more traditional chest compression method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Astroglial CD38 impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity after global cerebral ischemia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN STROKE
AB  - Cardiac arrest-induced global cerebral ischemia (GCI) results in profound cognitive impairment in survivors. Our prior work demonstrated persistent disruption of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons, correlating with learning and memory deficits in a rodent model of cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Delayed inhibition of the Ca2+-permeable TRPM2 ion channel restored LTP post-CA/CPR, yet the mechanisms upstream of TRPM2 activation remain elusive. This study investigates CD38 as a potential regulator of TRPM2, highlighting a novel target to reverse hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits after ischemia. We observe elevated levels of CD38 in activated astrocytes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 7 days following CA/CPR in both male and female mice. Delayed inhibition of CD38 reverses hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairments at subacute timepoints after CA/CPR, phenocopying TRPM2 restoration of LTP. Our previous findings demonstrated that TRPM2 inhibition reverses the CA/CPR-induced enhancement of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) clustering, which contribute to ongoing LTP deficits. We, therefore, assessed the effect of CD38 on GABAergic inhibitory potentiation and find that inhibition of CD38 reverses GABAAR clustering in a TRPM2-dependent manner. In this study, we identify astroglial CD38 as a potential target and upstream regulator of the TRPM2 channel, offering a promising approach to restore hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairments following GCI through modulation of GABAergic signaling.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of intravenous aminophylline for atropine-resistant out-of-hospital asystolic cardiac arrest
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
CP  - SAEM Annual Meeting
AB  - Objectives: Myocardial ischemia, during cardiopulmonary arrest, can lead to atropine-resistant bradyasystole from interstitial accumulation of endogenous adenosine. Aminophylline is a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist capable of reversing ischemia-induced bradyasystole in a variety of settings. The hypothesis of this study was that aminophylline improves the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in atropine-resistant asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when used early in the resuscitation effort. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial set in an urban emergency medical services system serving a population of 250,000. All non-pregnant, normothermic adults suffering nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (February 1999 to August 2000) with asystole were eligible. Patients remaining in asystole after initial doses of epinephrine and atropine received either aminophylline 250 mg or matching placebo as a bolus injection through a peripheral intravenous line. All other aspects of the attempted resuscitation proceeded in accordance with standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines. A sample size of 102 patients was calculated to yield a power of 80% to show an absolute improvement of 25% in ROSC. The aminophylline and control groups were compared by calculating 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and the data were modeled using logistic regression. Results: The investigators enrolled 112 consecutive patients. One subject was dropped prior to analysis because of missing data. Data for 111 patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline characteristics were similar for the two groups. Comparing the control and aminophylline groups, ROSC was achieved in 15.6% (95% CI = 6% to 29%) and 22.7% (95% CI = 13% to 35%), while reversal of asystole occurred in 26.7% (95% CI = 15% to 42%) and 40.9% (95% CI = 29% to 54%), respectively. Group allocation had an odds ratio of 1.8 (95% CI = 0.6 to 5.3) for ROSC. Witnessed arrest was an independent predictor of outcome with an odds ratio of 3.8 (95% CI = 1.3 to 11.2). Conclusions: Addition of aminophylline appears to be a promising new intervention in the ACLS treatment of atropine-resistant asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Determinants of Long-Term Neurological Recovery Patterns Relative to Hospital Discharge Among Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To explore factors associated with neurological recovery at 1 year relative to hospital discharge after cardiac arrest.
   Design: Observational, retrospective review of a prospectively collected cohort.
   Setting: Medical or surgical ICUs in a single tertiary care center.
   Patients: Older than 18 years, resuscitated following either in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and considered for targeted temperature management between 2007 and 2013.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Logistic regressions to determine factors associated with a poor recovery pattern after 1 year, defined as persistent Cerebral Performance Category Score 3-4 or any worsening of Cerebral Performance Category Score relative to discharge status. In total, 30% (117/385) of patients survived to hospital discharge; among those discharged with Cerebral Performance Category Score 1, 2, 3, and 4, good recovery pattern was seen in 54.5%, 48.4%, 39.5%, and 0%, respectively. Significant variables showing trends in associations with a poor recovery pattern (62.5%) in a multivariate model were age more than 70 years (odds ratio, 4; 95% CIs, 1.1-15; p = 0.04), Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 4; CI, 1.2-13; p = 0.02), and discharge disposition (home needing out-patient services (odds ratio, 1), home requiring no additional services (odds ratio, 0.15; CI, 0.03-0.8; p = 0.02), acute rehabilitation (odds ratio, 0.23; CI, 0.06-0.9; p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Patients discharged with mild or moderate cerebral dysfunction sustained their risk of neurological worsening within 1 year of cardiac arrest. Old age, Hispanic ethnicity, and discharge disposition of home with out-patient services may be associated with a poor 1 year neurological recovery pattern after hospital discharge from cardiac arrest.

TI  - Long-term results of spine surgery in Duchenne muscular dystrophy
T2  - NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - We report the long-term orthopaedic and functional results of segmental spinal instrumentation and fusion in 30 Duchenne patients. Twenty-nine had a mean 59% correction of scoliosis with post-operative immobilization in a brace of only three months on average and with a very limited loss of correction over time. One died after cardiac arrest. The mean vital capacity preoperatively was 57 +/- 17% with a decrease to 34 +/- 13% at 3.9 +/- 2 yr after surgery. The sitting position, aesthetic improvement and the quality of life after spinal fusion have been positively evaluated by the large majority of the patients and their parents. Head control was lost in the 14 patients who developed a more severe extension contracture of the neck measured as a significantly longer chin-sternum distance. More than 90% would have the operation or would give their consent again for their son having the operation.

TI  - Women in Healthy Transition (KISO) Survey: a cohort of 153,800 women aged 45-59 years living in Denmark
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - The nationwide Women in Healthy Transition (KISO) Survey Cohort is a population-based longitudinal prospective cohort study established to explore the significant data gap on women's symptoms through different stages of menopause in a Northern European context. The KISO Survey Cohort was set up to represent women aged 45-59 years living in Denmark. In total 575,863 women were invited to participate in the study at baseline. Data were collected through digital questionnaires from June to December 2024 and included self-reported information on stages of menopause, menopausal symptoms, quality of life, physical activity, and work productivity loss using validated scales as well as information on various health, social and lifestyle factors. The follow-up of the KISO Survey Cohort will be conducted through digital questionnaires every three years over a 15-year period, inviting baseline respondents and eligible women aged 45-59 at follow-up. A total of 153,800 women completed the baseline questionnaire, yielding a 27% response rate. Among the participants, 8% were in premenopause, 24% in perimenopause, and 45% in postmenopause. Moreover, 13% had induced menopause and 10% were undergoing menopausal hormone therapy. The KISO Survey Cohort is the first large-scale longitudinal study on menopausal symptoms among women in Denmark. Data are coupled with the personal identification numbers (CPR) enabling opportunities to link data to national administrative registers. This ongoing study, thus, offers unique and extensive data, enabling future research to advance our understanding of menopause, how it affects women, and its long-term effects on women.

TI  - Save a Life: Implementation and Evaluation of a Community-Focused CPR Education Program in Houston, Texas
T2  - JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Over 350 000 people in the United States experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) annually-and almost 90% die as a result. However, survival varies widely between counties, ranging from 3.4% to 22.0%-a disparity that the American Heart Association (AHA) largely attributes to variation in rates of bystander CPR. Studies show that regions with low rates of bystander CPR have low rates of CPR training, making CPR training initiatives a high-priority intervention to reduce OHCA mortality. In Houston, Texas, researchers have identified census tracts with higher OCHA incidence and lower rates of bystander CPR. We developed a free, annual Hands-Only CPR bilingual health education program central to these high-risk neighborhoods. In 5 years, this collaborative effort trained over 2700 individuals. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, we conducted a process evaluation to assess fidelity, dose delivered, and dose received. We also conducted an outcome evaluation using the Kirkpatrick Model for Training Evaluation to assess participants' reactions and learning. Overall, the program yielded positive outcomes. Of the 261 respondents (from 314 attendees), 63% were first-time learners. The majority (87%) were satisfied with the event and 85% felt that information was presented clearly and concisely. Pre- and post-knowledge assessments showed a 51% increase in the proportion of respondents who could correctly identify the steps for Hands-Only CPR. This program exemplifies how collaborative education can impact a community's health status. Leveraging each partner's resources and linkages with the community can enhance the reach and sustainability of health education initiatives.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory cardiac arrest: an overview of current practice and evidence
T2  - NETHERLANDS HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) is a common and potentially avoidable cause of death, while constituting a substantial public health burden. Although survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have improved in recent decades, the prognosis for refractory OHCA remains poor. The use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is increasingly being considered to support rescue measures when conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) fails. ECPR enables immediate haemodynamic and respiratory stabilisation of patients with CA who are refractory to conventional CPR and thereby reduces the low-flow time, promoting favourable neurological outcomes. In the case of refractory OHCA, multiple studies have shown beneficial effects in specific patient categories. However, ECPR might be more effective if it is implemented in the pre-hospital setting to reduce the low-flow time, thereby limiting permanent brain damage. The ongoing ON-SCENE trial might provide a definitive answer regarding the effectiveness of ECPR. The aim of this narrative review is to present the most recent literature available on ECPR and its current developments.

TI  - Perfusion parameters and target values during extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a scoping review protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) is increasingly applied in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) patients. Treatment results are promising, but the efficacy and safety of the procedure are still unclear. Currently, there are no recommended target perfusion parameters during eCPR, the lack of which could result in inadequate (re)perfusion. We aim to perform a scoping review to explore the current literature addressing target perfusion parameters, target values, corresponding survival rates and neurologic outcomes in OHCA and IHCA patients treated with eCPR.
   Methods and analysis To identify relevant research, we will conduct searches in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Social Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index Expanded and the Cochrane library. We will also check references of relevant articles and perform a cited reference research (forward citation tracking). Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, check full texts for eligibility and perform data extraction. We will resolve dissent by consensus, moderated by a third reviewer. We will include observational and controlled studies addressing target perfusion parameters and outcomes such as survival rates and neurologic findings in OHCA and IHCA patients treated with eCPR. Data extraction tables will be set up, including study and patients' characteristics, aim of study, details on eCPR including target perfusion parameters and reported outcomes. We will summarise the data using tables and figures (ie, bubble plot) to present the research landscape and to describe potential clusters and/or gaps.
   Ethics and dissemination An ethical approval is not needed. We intend to publish the scoping review in a peer-reviewed journal and present results on a scientific meeting.

TI  - Identification, Characterization, and Ultrastructure Analysis of the Phenol-Degrading Rhodococcus erythropolis 7Ba and Its Viable but Nonculturable Forms
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Phenol and its chlorinated derivatives are introduced into the environment with wastewater effluents from various industries, becoming toxic pollutants. Phenol-degrading bacteria are important objects of research; among them, representatives of the genus Rhodoccocus are often highlighted as promising. Strain 7Ba was isolated by enrichment culture. A new isolate was characterized using culturing, biochemistry, high-throughput sequencing, microscopy (including electron microscopy), and functional genome analysis. Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 7Ba is able to grow on phenol and chlorophenols without losing its properties during long-term storage. It was shown that strain 7Ba is able to form viable but nonculturable (VBNC) forms during long-term storage under nutrient limitation, preserving both cell viability and the ability to degrade phenols. The ultrastructural organization of the vegetative forms of cells and VBNC forms was characterized. The following distinctive features were found: modifications (thickening) of cell membranes, cell size reduction, nucleoid condensation. Functional analysis of the genome showed the presence of genes for the degradation of alkanes, and two branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation of aromatic compounds. Also, the genome of strain 7Ba contains several copies of Rpf (resuscitation promoting factor) genes, a resuscitation factor of resting bacterial forms. The new isolate strain 7Ba is a promising biotechnological agent that can not only utilize toxic aromatic compounds but also remain viable during long-term storage. For this reason, its further application as an agent for bioremediation can be successful under changing conditions of climate and given the deficiency of nutrient compounds in nature. Minor biostimulation will allow the strain to recover its metabolic activity and effectively degrade pollution.

TI  - Challenge in the nontrauma bay-pericardial tamponade due to atrial occluder following resuscitation
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of unknown origin and successful resuscitation (CPR) on-scene. However, shortly after admission, the patient developed pericardial tamponade (PT) in the trauma bay despite an initially unremarkable echocardiography. Emergency pericardiocentesis was required to relieve the tamponade but led to hemorrhagic shock. Subsequent imaging and intraoperative findings revealed injury to the left circumflex artery (CX), likely caused by a left atrial appendage occluder (LAAO) that had penetrated the CX during resuscitation efforts. The tamponade was promptly identified through repeat extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST) imaging following hemodynamic deterioration, and the underlying cause was quickly confirmed using standardized postresuscitation imaging protocols. The frequency of this complication remains unclear and warrants further investigation, particularly as the use of LAAOs continues to increase. These devices, while beneficial, may pose a risk for life-threatening, resuscitation-related injuries such as PT. This case report highlights the complexity of managing critically ill nontraumatic OHCA patients, who are often elderly, have multiple comorbidities, and may be on anticoagulation therapy-all factors that can complicate acute care. It also underscores the challenges of post-CPR management, as chest compressions themselves can cause significant trauma, even after brief durations of CPR. Common resuscitation-related injuries must therefore be anticipated and promptly addressed. Prehospital eFAST plays a critical role in the initial management of critically ill patients but should never delay transport. Repeating eFAST imaging after hospital admission is essential. In cases of hemodynamic deterioration, the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure) approach including eFAST sonography should be revisited, and differential diagnoses that were previously excluded must be reconsidered. To ensure high-quality care in these complex scenarios, the search for the underlying cause of OHCA should include standardized postresuscitation imaging as an integral part of trauma bay management.

TI  - TAT-PEP, a novel blocker of PirB, enhances the recovery of cognitive function in mice after transient global cerebral ischemia
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Neuronal damage and axonal regeneration inhibition are the main reasons to poor functional recovery after ischemia. Nogo-A signals inhibit axon outgrowth through the PirB receptor after ischemic reperfusion injury in central nervous system. We use TAT-PEP, a novel protein which could pass through the blood brain barrier, to block the function of PirB and identify the long-term neurological and behavioral recovery after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) in mice. We observed that TAT-PEP promoted neuron survival and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. TAT-PEP increased the expression of Tau, GAP43 and MAP-2 proteins. In addition, the short-term and long-term cognitive functions were also enhanced, indicating that TAT-PEP had a long-term neuroprotective effect, which reduced neurologic injury and neuron loss, promoted neurite outgrowth and enhanced functional recovery after ischemia. These studies reveal the mechanism of PirB on stroke and offer a potential therapeutic method for cerebral ischemia in humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lay People Training in CPR and in the Use of an Automated External Defibrillator, and Its Social Impact: A Community Health Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) mortality remains high. The best survival rates are achieved when trained people provide OHCA victims with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); however, it is estimated that only 25% of victims receive CPR. This community health study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a training programme in basic CPR and in the use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) on knowledge and skills for lay people, and its social impact. The training courses were based on Catalan Council of Resuscitation guidelines. Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, evaluation of knowledge and practical skills at baseline and at the end of the training courses, and also on the social impact of the programme. A total of 36 training courses with 482 participants were carried out, and most participants achieved a qualification of suitable. The mean score in knowledge was 3.1 +/- 1.1 at baseline and 3.8 +/- 1.2 (p = 0.001) at the end of the programme. Participants rated the training courses as very satisfactory, considered the training useful, and felt more qualified to respond to an emergency. This study shows that a high percentage of participants acquired skills in basic CPR and use of an AED, which confirms the usefulness and effectiveness of training courses and its important social impact.

TI  - Neurological function before and after an in-hospital cardiac arrest - A nationwide registry-based cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background : According to the Utstein Registry Template for in -hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), a good neurological outcome is defined as either Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2 at discharge from hospital or unchanged CPC compared to baseline. However, the latter alternative has rarely been described in IHCA. This study aimed to examine CPC at admission to hospital, the occurrence of post -arrest neurological deterioration, and the factors associated with such deterioration. Methods : We studied adult IHCA survivors registered in the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2007 and 2022. The CPC was assessed based on information from admission and discharge from hospital. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and significance tests. Results : One in ten IHCA had a CPC score > 1 at admission to hospital. Out of 7,677 IHCA who survived until hospital discharge and had full CPC data, 6,774 (88%) had preserved CPC, 150 (2%) had improved CPC, and 753 (10%) had deteriorated CPC. Among the factors significantly associated with deteriorated neurological function are IHCA in a general ward or intensive care unit, non -shockable rhythm, no ECG surveillance, and a higher proportion of intra-arrest and post -resuscitation treatments (all p -values < 0,05). Conclusion : Most patients had preserved neurological function compared to admission. Factors associated with deteriorated neurological function are mainly concordant with established risk factors for adverse outcomes and are primarily intra-arrest and post -resuscitation, making deterioration hard to predict. Further, every tenth survivor was admitted with CPC more than 1, stressing the use of unchanged CPC as an outcome in IHCA.

TI  - Characteristics and Outcomes of Emergency Transferred Patients with Foreign Body Airway Obstruction in Tokyo, Japan
T2  - PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction:Foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) is a life-threatening emergency, and the prognosis of patients with FBAO is greatly affected by the prehospital process. There are only a few large-scale studies analyzing prehospital process databases of the fire department. Study Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate whether characteristics of patients with FBAO were associated with prehospital factors and outcomes. Methods:In this retrospective observational study, patients transferred to the hospital by the Tokyo, Japan Fire Department for FBAO from 2017 through 2019 were included. The association between neurologically favorable survival among the characteristics of patients with FBAO and prehospital factors affecting the outcomes was evaluated. Results:Of the 2,429,175 patients, 3,807 (0.2%) patients had FBAO. The highest number of FBAO cases was 99 (2.6%), which occurred on January 1 (New Year's Day), followed by 40 cases (1.1%) on January 2, and 28 cases (0.7%) on January 3. The number of patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) caused by FBAO was 1,644 (43.2%). Comparing the OHCA and non-OHCA groups, there were significant differences in age, sex, time spent at the site, and distance between the site and hospital. Cardiac arrest was significantly lower in infants after FBAO (P < .001). In total, 98.2% of patients who did not have return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before hospital arrival died within 30 days, a significantly higher mortality rate than that in patients who had ROSC (98.2% versus 65.8%; P < .001). Conclusions:Among patients who did not have ROSC following FBAO upon arrival at the hospital, 98.2% died within 30 days. Thus, it is important to remove foreign bodies promptly and provide sufficient ventilation to the patient at the scene to increase the potential for ROSC. Further, more precautions should be exercised to prevent FBAO at the beginning of the year.

A1  - PAD Trial Investigators
TI  - The Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) Trial - Study design and rationale
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The PAD Trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical study testing whether volunteer, non-medical responders can improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) by using automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These lay volunteers, who have no traditional responsibility to respond to a medical emergency as part of their primary job description, will form part of a comprehensive, integrated community approach to the treatment of OOH-CA. The study is being conducted at 24 field centers in the United States and Canada. Approximately 1000 community units (e.g. apartment or office buildings, gated communities, sports facilities, senior centers, shopping malls, etc.) were randomized to treatment by trained laypersons who will provide either cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) alone or CPR plus use of an AED, while awaiting arrival of the community's emergency medical services responders. The primary endpoint is the number of OOH-CA victims who survive to hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints include neurological status, health-related quality of life (HRQL), cost, and cost-effectiveness. Data collection will last approximately 15 months and is expected to be completed in September 2003. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Unexpected cardiac arrests occurring inside the ICU: outcomes of a French prospective multicenter study
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose Cardiac arrest may occur unexpectedly in intensive care units (ICU). We hypothesize that certain patient characteristics and treatments are associated with survival and long-term functional outcome following in-ICU cardiac arrest. Methods Over a 12-month period, cardiac arrests with resuscitation attempts were prospectively investigated in 45 French ICUs. Survivors were followed for 6 months. Results In total, 677 (2.16%) of 31,399 admitted patients had at least one in-ICU cardiac arrest with resuscitation attempt, 42% of which occurred on the day of admission. In 79% cases, one or more condition(s) likely to promote the occurrence of cardiac arrest was/were identified, including hypoxia (179 patients), metabolic disorders (122), hypovolemia (94), and adverse events linked to the life-sustaining devices in place (98). Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 478 patients, of whom 163 were discharged alive from ICU and 146 from hospital. Six-month survival with no or moderate functional sequel (118 of 125 patients alive) correlated with a number of organ failures <= 2 when cardiac arrest occurred (OR 4.17 [1.92-9.09]), resuscitation time <= 5 min (3.32 [2.01-5.47]), shockable rhythm cardiac arrests (2.13 [1.26-3.45]) or related to the life-sustaining devices in place (2.11 [1.22-3.65]), absence of preexisting disability (1.98 [1.09-3.60]) or disease deemed fatal within 5 years (1.70 [1.05-2.77]), and sedation (1.71 [1.06-2.75]). Conclusion Only one in six patients with in-ICU cardiac arrest and resuscitation attempt was alive at 6 months with good functional status. Certain characteristics specific to cardiac arrests, resuscitation maneuvers, and the pathological context in which they happen may help clarify prognosis and inform relatives.

TI  - Acute lung injury and post-cardiac arrest syndrome: a narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - BackgroundPost-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) presents a multifaceted challenge in clinical practice, characterized by severe neurological injury and high mortality rates despite advancements in management strategies. One of the important critical aspects of PCAS is post-arrest lung injury (PALI), which significantly contributes to poor outcomes. PALI arises from a complex interplay of pathophysiological mechanisms, including trauma from chest compressions, pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, aspiration, and systemic inflammation. Despite its clinical significance, the pathophysiology of PALI remains incompletely understood, necessitating further investigation to optimize therapeutic approaches.MethodsThis review comprehensively examines the existing literature to elucidate the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic strategies for PALI. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify preclinical and clinical studies investigating PALI. Data from these studies were synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of PALI and its management.ResultsEpidemiological studies have highlighted the substantial prevalence of PALI in post-cardiac arrest patients, with up to 50% of survivors experiencing acute lung injury. Diagnostic imaging modalities, including chest X-rays, computed tomography, and lung ultrasound, play a crucial role in identifying PALI and assessing its severity. Pathophysiologically, PALI encompasses a spectrum of factors, including chest compression-related trauma, pulmonary IR injury, aspiration, and systemic inflammation, which collectively contribute to lung dysfunction and poor outcomes. Therapeutically, lung-protective ventilation strategies, such as low tidal volume ventilation and optimization of positive end-expiratory pressure, have emerged as cornerstone approaches in the management of PALI. Additionally, therapeutic hypothermia and emerging therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction hold promise in mitigating PALI-related morbidity and mortality.ConclusionPALI represents a significant clinical challenge in post-cardiac arrest care, necessitating prompt diagnosis and targeted interventions to improve outcomes. Mitochondrial-related therapies are among the novel therapeutic strategies for PALI. Further clinical research is warranted to optimize PALI management and enhance post-cardiac arrest care paradigms.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Combination Therapy of Shenfu Injection and Postresuscitation Bundle in Patients With Return of Spontaneous Circulation After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Randomized, Assessor-Blinded, Controlled Trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Postresuscitation care bundle treatment after return of spontaneous circulation in patients experiencing in-hospital cardiac arrest can improve patients' survival and quality of life. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy of Shenfu injection and postresuscitation care bundle in these patients.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study.
   Setting: Fifty hospitals in China.
   Patients: Adult patients had experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2015.
   Interventions: Based on the standardized postresuscitation care bundle treatment, patients were randomized to a Shenfu injection group (Shenfu injection + postresuscitation care bundle) or control group (postresuscitation care bundle) for 14 days or until hospital discharge. In the Shenfu injection group, 100 mL Shenfu injection was additionally administered via continuous IV infusion, bid.
   Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was 28-day survival after randomization. The secondary outcomes included 90-day survival as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and the hospital stay and the total cost of hospitalization. Of 1,022 patients enrolled, a total of 978 patients were allocated to the two groups: the control (n = 486) and Shenfu injection (n = 492) groups. The Shenfu injection group had a significantly greater 28-day survival rate (42.7%) than the control group (30.1%). Also, the Shenfu injection group had a significantly higher survival rate at 90 days (39.6%) than the control group (25.9%). Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the Shenfu injection group had lower risks of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89; p = 0.009) and 90-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.79; p = 0.002). In the Shenfu injection group, the duration of mechanical ventilation (8.6 +/- 3.2 vs 12.7 +/- 7.9 d; p < 0.001) and the hospital stay (8.7 +/- 5.9 vs 13.2 +/- 8.1 d; p < 0.001) were significantly less than in the control group. Irreversible brain damage was the main cause of death in both groups. No serious drug-related adverse event was recorded.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Shenfu injection in combination with conventional postresuscitation care bundle treatment is effective at improving clinical outcomes in patients with return of spontaneous circulation after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Factors associated with shock-refractory prehospital cardiac arrest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - A significant number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients experience refractory ventricular arrhythmias despite prompt defibrillation. These refractory arrhythmias are associated with poor clinical outcomes, underscoring the need to investigate improved management strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors associated with shock-refractory OHCA during the prehospital stages of resuscitation. This multicenter observational study included adult OHCA patients (age >= 18 years) from October 2015 to June 2022 who required at least one prehospital defibrillation. This study's primary endpoint was shock-refractory OHCA, defined as three defibrillation shocks during resuscitation. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with shock-refractory OHCA. Among the 4320 patients included, 1961 (45.4%) experienced shock-refractory OHCA. Male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.423; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.209-1.676), bystander automated external defibrillator (AED) shock (OR 2.350; 95% CI 1.426-3.968), and initial shockable rhythm (OR 1.739; 95% CI 1.490-2.030) were associated with a high risk of shock-refractory, while old age (OR 0.993; 95% CI 0.989-0.998) and receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (OR 0.829; 95% CI 0.718-0.958) were associated with a low risk of shock-refractory OHCA. This study showed that the prehospital factors of age, sex, initial rhythm, AED shock source, and absence of bystander CPR were associated with shock-refractory OHCA.

TI  - A practical guide to the management of oesophageal varices
T2  - DRUGS
AB  - Bleeding oesophageal varices are a frequent and sometimes fatal complication of portal hypertension, Prompt resuscitation and arrest of haemorrhage are the immediate short term priorities. Vasoactive therapy to reduce portal pressure is administered on presentation. Early endoscopy is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy; usually emergency sclerotherapy or banding. After the acute bleeding episode, follow-up therapy is instituted either to obliterate the varices by sclerotherapy or banding, or to chronically lower portal pressure and hence reduce the risk of bleeding pharmacologically; a combination of both strategies may be also used, Active surveillance of those at risk of developing varices is advocated. Long term P-blocker therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in both the primary prevention of variceal haemorrhage and the prevention of rebleeding in those who have already bled, Despite a multitude of therapeutic regimes and ongoing clinical trials, mortality from this condition remains disappointingly high.

TI  - Recognition and Treatment of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests by Non-Emergency Ambulance Services in Singapore
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: Prompt recognition of cardiac arrest and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation is necessary for good outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study aims to describe the recognition and treatment of OHCA in patients conveyed by non-emergency ambulance services (EAS) in Singapore. Materials and Methods: This is a multi-centre, retrospective chart review, of cases presenting to public emergency departments (EDs), conveyed by non-EAS and found to be in cardiac arrest upon ED arrival. The study was from October 2002 to August 2009. The following variables were examined: ability to recognise cardiac arrest, whether CPR was carried out by the ambulance crew and whether an automated external defibrillator (AED) was applied. Results: Eighty-six patients were conveyed by non-EAS and found to be in cardiac arrest upon ED arrival. Mean age was 63 years (SD 21.8), 70.9% were males. A total of 53.5% of arrests occurred in the ambulance while 70.9% were found to be asystolic upon ED arrival. Seven patients had a known terminal illness. Survival to discharge was 3.5%. Cardiac arrest went unrecognised by the ambulance crew in 38 patients (44.2%). CPR was performed in 35 patients (40.7%) of the 86 patients and AED was applied in only 10 patients (11.6%). Conclusion: We found inadequate recognition and delayed initiation of treatment for OHCA. Possible reasons include a lack of training in patient monitoring and detection of cardiac arrest, lack of CPR training, lack of confidence in performing CPR, lack of AEDs on ambulances and lack of training in their use.

TI  - Quality-of-life and formal functional testing of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest correlates poorly with traditional neurologic outcome scales
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
CP  - 1995 Society-for-Academic-Emergency-Medicine Annual Meeting
AB  - Study hypothesis: The traditional (and unvalidated) five-point Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at hospital discharge does not correlate with the results yielded by a validated functional status instrument and subjective quality-of-life assessment.
   Methods: We compared CPC scores with the results of prospective standardized testing after discharge in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Consenting survivors were tested with the validated Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ), a subjective quality-of-life assessment, and traditional CPC scoring.
   Results: Of the 3,130 arrests during the 52 months of the study, 93 patients survived. Thirty-five patients were tested (71% of those eligible at the time of follow-up). Of these patients, 34% said their quality of life was worse, 38% said it was the same, and 28% said it was better than before the cardiac arrest. Fifty-four percent of patients scored normally on all FSQ subscales, but the remainder had an average 2.1 areas (of 6) with significant impairment. CPC score correlated very poorly with quality-of-life rating and with all scores and subscores on the FSQ. A CPC of 1 on discharge (supposedly normal function) had a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 43%, a positive predictive value of 64%, and a negative predictive value of 60% for quality of life the same as or better than that before arrest. With regard to ability to predict the presence of any major areas of impairment on the FSQ, the respective figures were 32%, 43%, 43%, and 32%.
   Conclusion: The CPC score, relied on as a measure of functional outcome in cardiac arrest, correlates poorly with subsequent subjective quality of life and with validated objective functional testing instruments, and conclusions based on it are suspect. Future researchers should employ standardized testing instruments.

TI  - The Effect of Transport Time Interval on Neurological Recovery after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients without a Prehospital Return of Spontaneous Circulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Longer transport adversely affects outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients who do not return to spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The aim of this study was to determine the association between the transport time interval (TTI) and neurological outcomes in OHCA patients without ROSC.
   Methods: We analyzed adult OHCA patients with presumed cardiac etiology and without prehospital ROSC from 2012 to 2015. The study population was divided into 2 groups according to STI (short STI [1-5 minutes] and long STI [>= 6 minutes]). The primary exposure was TTI, which was categorized as short (1-5 minutes), intermediate (6-10 minutes), or long (>= 11 minutes). The primary outcome was a good neurological recovery at discharge. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used in each STI group.
   Results: Among 57,822 patients, 23,043 (40%), 20,985 (36%), and 13,794 (24%) were classified as short, intermediate, and long TTI group. A good neurological recovery occurred in 1.0%, 0.6%, and 0.3% of the patients in the short, intermediate and long TTI group, respectively. Among 12,652 patients with short STI, a good neurological recovery occurred in 2.2%, 1.0%, and 0.4% of the patients in the short, intermediate and long TTI group, respectively. Among 45,570 patients with long STI, a good neurological recovery occurred in 0.7%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of the patients in the short, intermediate and long TTI group, respectively. When short TTI was used as a reference, the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of TTI for good neurological recovery was different between short STI group and long STI group (AOR [95% confidence interval, 0.46 [0.32-0.67] vs. 0.72 [0.59-0.89], respectively, for intermediate TTI and 0.31 [0.17-0.55] vs. 0.49 [0.37-0.65], respectively, for long TTI).
   Conclusion: A longer TTI adversely affected the likelihood of a good neurological recovery in OHCA patients without prehospital ROSC. This negative effect was more prominent in short STI group.

TI  - Systematic Review on the Worldwide Disparities in the Frequency and Results of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Response to Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA)
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - This systematic analysis aimed to analyze the key patterns and tendencies regarding bystander interventions, emergency medical service (EMS) systems, dispatcher support, regional and temporal differences, and the influence of national efforts on survival rates in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The studies published between 2010 and 2024 examining outcomes of OHCA, interventions by bystanders, and variables linked to OHCA were included in this research. The inclusion process was done under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), where publications (n = 24) from various geographical locations, including a wide range of research methodologies, were included for this research. The thematic analysis used for the data analysis shows that bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) enhances the chances of survival. The effectiveness of the EMS system, the assistance offered by dispatchers, and the inclusion of doctors in ambulance services are essential components in the management of OHCA. Regional and temporal variations highlight disparities in resuscitation protocols, emphasizing the need for adaptable approaches. Observations from statewide endeavors emphasize the impact of these activities in fostering a culture of prompt bystander intervention. This systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis of research conducted globally, providing a thorough insight into the variables that influence survival rates in instances of OHCA. The review recognizes the importance of bystander CPR and effective EMS services, while also bringing novel perspectives, such as gender disparities and geographical variations that contribute to the existing body of research. Despite possible variances in the studies and biases, the findings underscore the need for tailored therapies and ongoing research to optimize strategies for controlling OHCA and improving survival rates.

TI  - Liver transplantation for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: a retrospective analysis from Chinese experience
T2  - ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundHomozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) increases risk of premature cardiovascular events and cardiac death. In severe cases of HoFH, clinical signs and symptoms cannot be controlled well by non-surgical treatments, liver transplantation (LT) currently represents the viable option.MethodTo assess the clinical efficacy, prognosis, and optimal timing of LT for HoFH, a retrospective analysis was conducted on the preoperative, surgical conditions, and postoperative follow-up of children who received an LT for HoFH at the Beijing Friendship Hospital over the period from December 2014 to August 2022.ResultsXanthoma and decreased activity tolerance were the primary clinical manifestations in the 7 HoFH children initially assessed (one child died suddenly prior to surgery due to cardiac arrest). Accompanying these symptoms were increased blood total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, along with severe cardiovascular diseases. HoFH was confirmed in all cases by genetic and biochemical assays. Initial treatments administered to these patients consisted of low-fat diets and lipid-lowering drugs with poor outcomes. Accordingly, all 6 patients received orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT), with the result that significant postoperative reductions were observed in levels of TC and LDL. The median follow-up of these six cases was 37.41 months (range: 19.40-94.10 months). Regular postoperative follow-ups revealed that all survived and showed significant improvements in their clinical symptoms.ConclusionSo far, LT is the only way to heal HoFH. LT before the appearance of obvious cardiovascular atherosclerotic lesions can significantly improve the quality of life and prognosis of patients. At the same time, the blood cholesterol level of patients should be continuously monitored after LT to further control the progression of vascular complications.

TI  - Addison disease Diagnosis and initial management
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
AB  - Background
   Adrenal insufficiency is a rare disease caused by either primary adrenal failure (Addison disease) or by impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Steroid replacement therapy normalises quality of life, however, adherence can be problematic.
   Objective
   This article provides information on adrenal insufficiency focusing on awareness of initial symptoms and on risk scenarios, emergency management and baseline investigations, complete investigations and long term management.
   Discussion
   Early recognition of adrenal insufficiency is essential to avoid associated morbidity and mortality. Initial diagnosis and decision to treat are based on history and physical examination. Appropriate management includes emergency resuscitation and steroid administration. Initial investigations can include sodium, potassium and blood glucose levels. However, complete investigations can be deferred. Specialist advice should be obtained and long term management includes a Team Care Arrangement. For patients, an emergency plan and emergency identification are essential.

TI  - Functional Outcomes: One Year after a Cardiac Arrest
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Objective. The study aim was to characterize the time-course of recovery in impairments, activity limitations, participation restrictions, disability, and quality of life during the first year after cardiac arrest. Secondarily, the study described the associations between the instruments used to measure each of these domains. Methods. Measures of global disability (Cerebral Performance Category, CPC, Modified Rankin Scale, mRS), quality of life, activity limitations, participation restrictions, and affective and cognitive impairments were administered to 29 participants 1, 6, and 12 months after cardiac arrest. Results. Global measures of disability indicated recovery between one month and one year after cardiac arrest (mean CPC: 2.1 versus 1.69, P < 0.05; mean mRS: 2.55 versus 1.83, P < 0.05). While global measures of disability were moderately associated with participation, they were poorly associated with other measures. The cohort endorsed depressive symptomatology throughout the year but did not have detectable cognitive impairment. Conclusions. Recovery from cardiac arrest is multifaceted and recovery continues for months depending upon the measures being used. Measures of global disability, reintegration into the community, and quality of life yield different information. Future clinical trials should include a combination of measures to yield the most complete representation of recovery after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Effectiveness of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Non-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: An Analysis From the SOS-KANTO 2017 Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) using veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) has the potential as a viable treatment for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). While mechanical circulatory support devices, such as Impella (R) and left ventricular assist devices, are being increasingly used, initial ECPR often relies on V-A ECMO. Previous studies, including randomized controlled trials, reported the prognostic benefits of ECPR for shockable OHCA (SOHCA); however, its effectiveness for non-SOHCA (NSOHCA) remains unclear, with poorer neurological outcomes and the lower return of spontaneous circulation rates than for SOHCA being reported. The present study utilized data from the SOS-KANTO 2017 study to examine the impact of ECPR on the neurological outcomes of NSOHCA. Data from 2,502 OHCA cases were analyzed, with a focus on the relationship between ECPR and 90-day neurological outcomes. The results obtained showed significantly higher survival rates at 30 and 90 days and significantly better 90-day neurological outcomes in the ECMO attempt group than in the non-ECMO attempt group. A multivariate analysis identified ECPR as one of the significant independent predictors of favorable neurological outcomes. The prognosis of NSOHCA cases with CA was improved by ECPR using V-A ECMO, particularly in those where CPR was initiated within one minute of onset and the patient arrived at the hospital within 45 minutes. Factors associated with a favorable prognosis included a shorter time from onset to hospital arrival and the likelihood of acute coronary syndrome being the cause of CA. The present results suggest the potential of ECPR to improve the survival and the 90-day prognosis of NSOHCA, particularly when bystander CPR is initiated quickly and hospital arrival is prompt.

TI  - Epidemiology of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Bielsko-Biala district: a 12-month analysis
T2  - KARDIOLOGIA POLSKA
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, which occurs out of specialist healthcare facilities and inevitably leads to death if uninterrupted by effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Aim: To evaluate the circumstances and basic epidemiological indices of OHCA in the population of adult inhabitants of Bielsko-Biala district within 12 months.
   Methods: On the basis of standard ambulance dispatch cards of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) teams, a retrospective analysis was made of 272 OHCA cases covering the period from 01.01.2013 to 31.12.2013. We assessed the basic demographic data of the victims, circumstances of the occurrence of OHCA, information on the potential cause and mechanism of the OHCA, and data related to the actions undertaken by witnesses and EMS teams.
   Results: The overall OHCA incidence was 170/100,000 (243/100,000 in men; 99/100,000 in women). It increased with subjects' age (p < 0.01). The most frequent place of OHCA was the victim's home (82%). OHCA occurred in the presence of witnesses in 60% of cases. CPR was undertaken by a witness in 56% cases. Median CPR duration undertaken by a witness was 10 (IQR 8-14) min. Median time from notification receipt by the EMS to the team arrival was 9 (7-11) min. On the scene, defibrillation rhythm was recognised in 39% of cases. Sixty-seven patients were declared deceased after the arrival of the EMS teams. In the remaining 205 cases, CPR was undertaken, which was ineffective for 141 persons. Median CPR duration undertaken by the EMS team was 30 (20-40) min. The overall prehospital case fatality ratio was 76.5% (75.3% for men; 79.3% for women).
   Conclusions: OHCA incidence in the Bielsko-Biala population in 2013 was high, increased with age, and was twice as high for men than women. OHCA occurred most often at home, in the presence of a witness; however, CPR was not always undertaken promptly at the scene. CPR was effective for approximately 30% of the victims. The prehospital mortality was high with no differences between genders.

TI  - Potential Candidates for Emergency Department Initiated Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) in a Canadian Institution
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients experience poor survival. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a form of heart-lung bypass, in the setting of cardiac arrest, termed extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), has promise in improving survival with good neurologic outcomes. The study objective was to determine the number of potential annual ECPR candidates among the OHCA population in a health region within the Atlantic Canadian province of Nova Scotia.Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted over a five-year period: January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016. Consecutive non-traumatic OHCA and emergency department (ED) cardiac arrests occurring in a pre-determined catchment area (20-minute transport to ECMO center) defined by a geographic bounding box were identified. Criteria for ECPR were developed to identify candidates for activation of a "Code ECPR": (1) age 16-70, (2) witnessed arrest, (3) no flow duration (time to CPR, including bystander) <10 minutes, (4) resuscitation >10 minutes without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), (5) emergency medical service (EMS) transport to hospital <20 minutes, (6) no patient factors precluding ongoing resuscitation (do not resuscitate status (DNR), palliative care involvement, or metastatic cancer), and (7) initial rhythm not asystole. Candidates were stratified by initial rhythm. Candidates were considered ultimately ED ECPR eligible if they failed conventional treatment, defined by death or resuscitation >30 minutes. Clinical data related to candidacy was extracted by an electronic query from prehospital and ED electronic records and manual chart review by three researchers.Results Our search yielded 561 cases of EMS-treated OHCA or in-ED arrests. Of those 204/561 (36%; 95% CI 33-40%) met the criteria for activation of a "Code ECPR". Ultimately 79/204 (34%; 95% CI 28-41%) of those who met activation criteria were considered ED ECPR eligible; which is 14% (95% CI 11-17%) of the total number of arrests-of the total number of arrests, the initial rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (PEA) 33/79 (42%; 95% CI 32-53%) and shockable 46/79 (58%; 95% CI 47-69%).Conclusion Of all cardiac arrests in the area surrounding our ECMO center, approximately 41 per year met the criteria for a Code ECPR activation, with 16 per year ultimately being eligible for ED ECPR. This annual estimate varies based on the inclusion of initial rhythm. This provides insight into both prehospital and hospital implications of an ED ECPR program and will help guide the establishment of a program within our Nova Scotian health region. This study also provides a framework for similar investigation at other institutions contemplating ED ECPR program implementation.

TI  - Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) for Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analysis in Out-of- Hospital Cardiac Arrests' Management; a Cross-sectional Study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis are among the reversible causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that can be promptly identified using point-of-care testing (POCT) for blood gas and electrolyte analysis. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of POCT in the prehospital setting for OHCA management. Methods: In this cross-sectional study the management and outcomes of OHCA patients were compared before and after implementing the POCT for blood gas and electrolyte analysis by EMS in the prehospital setting of Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand. Results: 217 OHCA patients with a mean age of 61 +/- 17.07 (range: 58.72-63.28) years were studied (64.06 % male). 148 (68.2%) patients received POCT in the prehospital setting. Patients in the POCT group received higher administration of sodium bicarbonate (p <0.001) and calcium gluconate (p <0.001) compared to those without POCT. Sustained ROSC was achieved in 25% of the POCT group, compared to 11.59% in the no POCT group (p = 0.030). POCT blood gas analysis was identified as an independent predictor of sustained ROSC based on multivariable analysis (adjusted Odds: 4.60, 95% CI: 1.35-15.69; p = 0.015). Conclusion: It seems that POCT for blood gas and electrolyte analysis in the prehospital setting could improve sustained ROSC in OHCA patients by enabling rapid and targeted management of cardiac arrest's reversible causes.

TI  - From crisis to recovery: A case report on nursing strategies for hepatitis E post-cardiac arrest
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-support technology for refractory cardiac arrest, but the massive blood transfusions required during treatment significantly increase the risk of transfusion-related infections. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) - traditionally linked to fecal-oral transmission - is increasingly recognized as a transfusion-transmitted pathogen, especially in emergency settings where urgent blood product infusion is common and routine HEV screening in blood banks is often lacking. However, nursing strategies for managing acute HEV infection after ECMO remain poorly defined, highlighting the need to address this clinical gap.Patient concerns:A 35-year-old female nurse developed sudden cardiac arrest due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and underwent ECMO. Post-ECMO, she received red blood cells and plasma transfusions. On postoperative day 15, she had worsening liver function (alanine aminotransferase 938 U/L, total bilirubin 69.3 mu mol/L) and abnormal coagulation function (prothrombin time [PT] 14.5 seconds), along with intermittent low-grade fever (37.3-38.0 degrees C); subsequent jaundice of the skin, sclera, and urine developed.Diagnoses:Next-generation sequencing confirmed acute HEV infection. The diagnosis was further supported by typical liver function abnormalities (marked elevation of transaminases and bilirubin), abnormal coagulation (PT 14.5 seconds), and clinical manifestations of HEV infection (fever, jaundice), with no evidence of other etiologies (e.g., viral hepatitis A/B/C, drug-induced liver injury).Interventions:Comprehensive nursing and clinical interventions were implemented. Daily monitoring: liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin), coagulation status (with focus on PT, e.g., baseline PT 14.5 seconds), and jaundice-related symptoms (skin/sclera color, pruritus, urine color); gastrointestinal management: Bacillus licheniformis (0.5 g twice daily) to regulate intestinal flora, and lactulose (15 mL twice daily) to promote bowel movement, maintaining gut-liver axis balance; personalized nutritional support: Collaboration with the nutrition department to provide a low-fat semi-liquid diet (1500-1600 kcal/d, 75-80 g branched-chain amino acid-rich protein, and adequate vitamins/minerals); and cardiac follow-up: planning and implementation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation on postoperative day 50 (after resolution of liver injury and stabilization of coagulation function).Outcomes:After 49 days of hospitalization, the patient's liver function normalized (total bilirubin within normal range, albumin increased from 31.3 to 35.1 g/L), coagulation function (PT) returned to normal, and jaundice resolved. She successfully underwent ICD implantation on postoperative day 50. A 3-month follow-up showed no chronic liver damage, and serum HEV-IgM turned negative at 6 months; no malignant arrhythmias or ICD discharges were recorded during follow-up.Lessons:This case emphasizes 3 key lessons: Firstly, for patients receiving ECMO and blood transfusions, close monitoring of liver function, coagulation indicators (e.g., PT), and clinical signs of HEV infection (fever, jaundice) is critical for early diagnosis; secondly, multimodal interventions - combining targeted monitoring (including coagulation tracking), gut-liver axis regulation, and personalized nutrition - are effective for managing acute HEV infection post-ECMO; and thirdly, timing of ICD implantation (e.g.
   , postoperative day 50, after liver and coagulation stabilization) and collaboration between nursing teams, nutrition departments, and cardiac specialists ensure holistic care, supporting both liver recovery and long-term cardiac safety.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)- a cross-sectional population survey in Sweden
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim of the study: Rates of bystander CPR are increasing, yet mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains high. The aim of this survey was to explore public knowledge and attitudes to CPR. Our hypotheses were that recent CPR training (< 5 years) would be associated with a high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, and associated with an interest to become a smartphone app responder in suspected OHCA.
   Methods: Data were collected through a web survey. Respondents (>= 18 years) in Skane County, Sweden were members of a panel created by a market research company. Data were weighted with respect to gender, age, municipalities and level of education to increase generalisability to the general population.
   Results: A total of 1060 eligible answers were analysed. Seventy- six percent of non-healthcare professionals (n = 912) had participated in a CPR course at some time in life, 58 percent during the previous five years. The recommended CPR algorithm was known by 57 percent, whereas knowledge of the location of the nearest automated external defibrillator (AED) in a home environment was poor. Recent CPR training (< 5 years) did not favour high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, but was one predictor of wanting to become a smartphone app responder.
   Conclusion: This study highlights possible areas of improvement in CPR training, which might improve OHCA identification and facilitate knowledge retention. The potential to recruit smartphone app responders seems promising in certain groups.

TI  - Post-Cardiac arrest outcome prediction using machine learning: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Early and reliable prognostication in post-cardiac arrest patients remains challenging, with various factors linked to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival, and neurological results. Machine learning and deep learning models show promise in improving these predictions. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates how effective these approaches are in predicting clinical outcomes at different time points using structured data. Methods: This study followed PRISMA guidelines, involving a comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until March 2024. Studies aimed at predicting ROSC, survival (or mortality), and neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest through the application of machine learning or deep learning techniques with structured data were included. Data extraction followed the guidelines of the CHARMS checklist, and the bias risk was evaluated using PROBAST tool. Models reporting the AUC metric with 95 % confidence intervals were incorporated into the quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis. Results: After extracting 2,753 initial records, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 97 machine learning and 16 deep learning models. The pooled AUC for predicting favorable neurological outcomes (CPC 1 or 2) at hospital discharge was 0.871 (95 % CI: 0.813 - 0.928) for machine learning models and 0.877 (95 % CI: 0.831-0.924) across deep learning algorithms. For survival prediction, this value was found to be 0.837 (95% CI: 0.757-0.916). Considerable heterogeneity and high risk of bias were observed, mainly attributable to inadequate management of missing data and the absence of calibration plots. Most studies focused on pre-hospital factors, with age, sex, and initial arrest rhythm being the most frequent features. Conclusion: Predictive models utilizing AI-based approaches, including machine and deep learning models exhibit enhanced effectiveness compared to previous regression algorithms, but significant heterogeneity and high risk of bias limit their dependability. Evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models tailored for tabular data and their clinical generalizability can enhance outcome prediction after cardiac arrest.

TI  - A scoping review to determine the barriers and facilitators to initiation and performance of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation during emergency calls
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: To maximise out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients' survival, bystanders should perform continuous, good quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until ambulance arrival.
   Objectives: To identify published literature describing barriers and facilitators between callers and call-takers, which affect initiation and performance (continuation and quality) of bystander CPR (B-CPR) throughout the OHCA emergency call.
   Eligibility criteria: Studies were included if they reported on the population (emergency callers and call-takers), concept (psychological, physical and communication barriers and facilitators impacting the initiation and performance of B-CPR) and context (studies that analysed OHCA emergency calls).
   Sources of evidence: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Scopus and ProQuest were searched from inception to 9 March 2022.
   Charting methods: Study characteristics were extracted and presented in a narrative format accompanied by summary tables.
   Results: Thirty studies identified factors that impacted B-CPR initiation or performance during the emergency call. Twenty-eight studies described barriers to the provision of CPR instructions and CPR initiation, with prominent themes being caller reluctance (psychological), physical ability (physical), and callers hanging up the phone prior to CPR instructions (communication). There was little evidence examining barriers and facilitators to ongoing CPR performance (2 studies) or CPR quality (2 studies).
   Conclusions: This scoping review using emergency calls as the source, described barriers to the provision of B-CPR instructions and B-CPR initiation. Further research is needed to explore facilitators and barriers to B-CPR continuation and quality throughout the emergency call, and to examine the effectiveness of call-taker strategies to motivate callers to perform B-CPR.

TI  - Hypothermia regulates mitophagy and apoptosis via PINK1/Parkin-VDAC 3 signaling pathway during oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery injury
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI), as the main cause of high mortality and long-term disability in patients, induces mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis. Hypothermia is well-known as an effective neuroprotective therapy, but its underlying mechanisms deserve further exploration. Previous study has demonstrated that hypothermia provides neuroprotection via increasing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, whether hypothermia can regulate both apoptosis and mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway or not. In this study, BV2 mouse microglial cells were cultured under oxygen-glucose deprivation for 6 h following reperfusion with or without hypothermia for 2-4 h. Cell viability was examined by trypan blue stain. Mitophagy was observed by transmission electron microscope. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were determined respectively by JC-1 staining and BBcellProbe M61 staining using a flow cytometer. Expression of mitophagy-related proteins (Cleaved PINK1, Parkin, SQSTM1/p62, Beclin-1, LC3B II/LC3B I), apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Cytochrome C, caspase-3, cleaved caspase3) and VDAC3 were assessed using western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. The interaction between Parkin and VDAC3 was confirmed by immunofluorescence colocalization. The results showed that hypothermia alleviated MMP damage, inhibited mPTP opening, then decreased cell apoptosis and activated mitophagy at 2 h after temperature intervention, which might be mediated by the PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway. Moreover, the effects of hypothermia were reduced or reversed at 4 h after temperature intervention. In conclusion, the potential mechanisms of hypothermia during oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery could be summarized as follows:1) At 2 h after temperature intervention, hypothermia provided neuroprotective effects via promoting mitophagy and reducing apoptosis through activating the PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway. 2) The curative effect of hypothermia was timeliness. At 4 h after temperature intervention, hypothermia aggravated apoptosis through inhibiting Parkin recruitment to mitochondria and aggravating the release of Cyt C through open mPTP.

TI  - Prognosis,risk stratification, and management of asymptomatic individuals with Brugada syndrome: A systematic review
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a primary electrical disease associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias. The prognosis, risk stratification, and management of asymptomatic individuals remain the most controversial issues in BrS. Furthermore, the decision to manage asymptomatic patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be made after weighing the potential individual risk of future arrhythmic events against the risk of complications associated with the implant and follow-up of patients living with such devices, and the accompanying impairment of the quality of life. Several clinical, electrocardiographic, and electrophysiological markers have been proposed for risk stratification of subjects with BrS phenotype, but the majority have not yet been tested in a prospective manner in asymptomatic individuals. Recent data suggest that current risk factors are insufficient and cannot accurately predict sudden cardiac death events in this setting. This systematic review aims to discuss contemporary data regarding prognosis, risk stratification, and management of asymptomatic individuals with diagnosis of Brugada electrocardiogram pattern and to delineate the therapeutic approach in such cases.

TI  - Association between prothrombin time-international normalized ratio and prognosis of post-cardiac arrest patients: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundCardiac arrest (CA) can activate blood coagulation. This study aimed to explore the potential prognostic value of prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (INR) in post-CA patients. MethodsThe clinical data of eligible subjects diagnosed with CA was extracted from the MIMIC-IV database as the training cohort. Restricted cubic spline (RCS), Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve, and Cox regression analyses were conducted to elucidate the association between the INR and all-cause mortality of post-CA patients. Subgroup analysis, propensity score matching (PSM), and inverse probability of treatment (IPTW) were also conducted to improve stability and reliability. Data of the validation cohort were collected from the eICU database, and logistic-regression analyses were performed to verify the findings of the training cohort. ResultsA total of 1,324 subjects were included in the training cohort. A linear correlation existed between INR and the risk of all-cause death of post-CA patients, as shown in RCS analysis, with a hazard ratio (HR) >1 when INR exceeded 1.2. K-M survival curve preliminarily indicated that subjects with INR >= 1.2 presented lower survival rate and shorter survival time, and the high level of INR was independently associated with 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, and in-hospital mortalities, with multivariate-adjusted HR of 1.44 (1.20, 1.73), 1.46 (1.23, 1.74), 1.44 (1.23, 1.69), and 1.37 (1.14, 1.64), respectively. These findings were consistent and robust across the subgroup analysis, PSM and IPTW analyses, and validation cohort. ConclusionsWe systematically and comprehensively demonstrated that elevated INR was associated with increased short- and long-term all-cause mortality of post-CA patients. Therefore, elevated INR may be a promising biomarker with prognosis significance.

TI  - Survival and quality of life in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - MEDICINA CLINICA
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few data in Spain on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and the efficacy of emergency systems. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate an emergency system, comparing survival at hospital discharge according to the origin, cardiac or non-cardiac, of cardiac arrest in out-of-hospital critically ill patients, and to describe the quality of life of the survivors.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study on 282 patients treated during 1995 and 1996 by ICU ambulances units of the Andalusian Public Health Emergency Company (061) in Granada, Almeria and El Ejido-Poniente (Spain). The Utstein style was followed, gathering the mortality at different times up to 6 months after hospital discharge and the origin (cardiac/non-cardiac) of the arrest. Quality of life 6 months after discharge was collected among survivors.
   RESULTS: Advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was applied to 176 (62.4%) patients. The survival rate to discharge was 4.9% for patients with cardiac etiology (7/142 x 100) and 5.9% for those with non-cardiac etiology (2/34 x 100), with non-significant differences between the two groups. An optimal quality of life in all domains, except for pharmacological dependence in seven, was found in the eight survivors 6 months after hospital discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: The origin (cardiac/non-cardiac) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not associated with survival at hospital discharge. The survivors exhibit an optimal quality of life 6 months after discharge.

TI  - Optimization of End-to-End Convolutional Neural Networks for Analysis of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Rhythms during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - High performance of the shock advisory analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is important for better management of the resuscitation protocol. It should provide fewer interruptions of chest compressions (CC) for non-shockable organized rhythms (OR) and Asystole, or prompt CC stopping for early treatment of shockable ventricular fibrillation (VF). Major disturbing factors are strong CC artifacts corrupting raw ECG, which we aimed to analyze with optimized end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) without pre-filtering or additional sensors. The hyperparameter random search of 1500 CNN models with 2-7 convolutional layers, 5-50 filters and 5-100 kernel sizes was done on large databases from independent OHCA interventions for training (3001 samples) and validation (2528 samples). The best model, named CNN3-CC-ECG network with three convolutional layers (filters@kernels: 5@5,25@20,50@20) presented Sensitivity Se(VF) = 89%(268/301), Specificity Sp(OR) = 91.7%(1504/1640), Sp(Asystole) = 91.1%(3325/3650) on an independent test OHCA database. CNN3-CC-ECG's ability to effectively extract features from raw ECG signals during CPR was comprehensively demonstrated, and the dependency on the CPR corruption level in ECG was tested. We denoted a significant drop of Se(VF) = 74.2% and Sp(OR) = 84.6% in very strong CPR artifacts with a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR < -9 dB, p < 0.05. Otherwise, for strong, moderate and weak CC artifacts (SNR > -9 dB, -6 dB, -3 dB), we observed insignificant performance differences: Se(VF) = 92.5-96.3%, Sp(OR) = 93.4-95.5%, Sp(Asystole) = 92.6-94.0%, p > 0.05. Performance stability with respect to CC rate was validated. Generalizable application of the optimized computationally efficient CNN model was justified by an independent OHCA database, which to our knowledge is the largest test dataset with real-life cardiac arrest rhythms during CPR.

TI  - Factors associated with change in resuscitation preference of seriously ill patients
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: During serious illness, patient preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments play an important role in medical decisions. However, little is known about life-sustaining preference stability in this population or about factors associated with preference change.
   Methods: We evaluated 2-month cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preference stability in a cohort of 1590 seriously ill hospitalized patients at 5 acute care teaching hospitals. Using multiple logistic regression, we measured the association of patient demographic and health-related factors (quality of life, function, depression, prognosis, and diagnostic group) with change in CPR preference between interviews.
   Results: Of 1590 patients analyzed, 73% of patients preferred CPR at baseline interview and 70% chose CPR at follow-up. Preference stability was 80% overall-85% in patients initially preferring CPR and 69% in those initially choosing do not resuscitate (DNR). For patients initially preferring CPR, older age, non-African American race, and greater depression at baseline were independently associated with a change to preferring DNR at follow-up. For patients initially preferring DNR, younger age, male gender, less depression at baseline, improvement in depression between interviews, and an initial admission diagnosis of acute respiratory failure or multiorgan system failure were associated with a change to preferring CPR at follow-up. For patients initially preferring DNR, patients with substantial improvements in depression score between interviews were more than 5 times as likely to change preference to CPR than were patients with substantial worsening in depression score.
   Conclusions: More than two thirds of seriously ill patients prefer CPR for cardiac arrest and 80% had stable preferences over 2 months. Factors associated with preference change suggest that depression may lead patients to refuse life-sustaining care. Providers should evaluate mood state when eliciting patients' preferences for life-sustaining treatments.

TI  - Increasing or fluctuating bispectral index values during post-resuscitation targeted temperature management can predict clinical seizures after rewarming
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To investigate whether an increasing bispectral index (BIS) value during targeted temperature management (TTM) correlates with increased clinical seizures after TTM or worse neurological prognoses after TTM.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective prognostication study of patients who were treated with TTM after recovery of spontaneous circulation from cardiac arrest at a tertiary care hospital. We recorded the BIS regularly during TTM and calculated the correlations of the mean BIS values, standard deviations of the BIS values, and linear regression coefficient of the trend of the BIS values over time as index tests. Study outcomes included the occurrence of clinical seizures after TTM and unfavourable neurological outcomes (defined as a Cerebral Performance Scale score of 3-5). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses evaluated the predictability of the index tests for the study outcomes.
   Results: Of 534 patients with post-cardiac arrest who were admitted to the intensive care unit, 103 were enrolled in this study. Thirty-one patients (30.1%) experienced sequelae in the form of clinical seizures, and 52 (50.5%) had unfavourable neurological outcomes at 30 days post-resuscitation. The standard deviation (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.763) and the regression coefficient (AUC = 0.763) had higher predictability of clinical seizures than the mean BIS value (AUC = 0.657); in contrast, the low mean BIS value best predicted unfavourable neurological outcomes (AUC= 0.861) compared to the standard deviation (AUC= 0.532) and regression coefficient (AUC = 0.501).
   Conclusion: An increase of, or greater fluctuation in, BIS during hypothermia may predict clinical seizures after TTM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - All-cause mortality risks among participants in mass-participation sporting events
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives Exercise transiently increases the risk for sudden death, whereas long-term exercise promotes longevity. This study assessed acute and intermediate-term mortality risks of participants in mass-participation sporting events.Methods Data of participants in Dutch running, cycling and walking events were collected between 1995 and 2017. Survival status was obtained from the Dutch Population Register. A time-stratified, case-crossover design examined if deceased participants more frequently participated in mass-participation sporting events 0-7 days before death compared with the reference period (14-21 days before death). Mortality risks during follow-up were compared between participants and non-participants from the general population using Cox regression.Results 546 876 participants (median (IQR) age 41 (31-50) years, 56% male, 72% runners) and 211 592 non-participants (41 (31-50) years, 67% male) were included. In total, 4625 participants died of which more participants had partaken in a sporting event 0-7 days before death (n=23) compared with the reference period (n=12), and the mortality risk associated with acute exercise was greater but did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.92; 95% CI 0.95 to 3.85). During 3.3 (1.1-7.4) years of follow-up, participants had a 30% lower risk of death (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.74) compared with non-participants after adjustment for age and sex. Runners (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.69) and cyclists (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.77) had the best survival during follow-up followed by walkers (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94).Conclusion Participating in mass-participation sporting events was associated with a non-significant increased odds (1.92) of mortality and a low absolute event rate (4.2/100 000 participants) within 7 days post-event, whereas a 30% lower risk of death was observed compared with non-participants during 3.3 years of follow-up. These results suggest that the health benefits of mass sporting event participation outweigh potential risks.

TI  - Achieving rapid mainstream deammonification through inoculating long-term refrigerated sidestream sludge in plug-flow fixed-bed biofilm reactor
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The start-up of a stable mainstream deammonification requires sufficient anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). This study used a plug-flow fixed-bed reactor (PFBR) to verify the feasibility of establishing the mainstream deammonification system by inoculating the sidestream sludge after long-term refrigeration. A rapid resuscitation of the mainstream deammonification system was accomplished by controlling the front-end aeration rate of the PFBR. Results showed that the system was rapidly resuscitated in 44days eventually with the nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen removal efficiency of 0.1 kg N.(m(3). d)(-1) and 79.1%, respectively. Also, the efficient performance was secured by the proportionate approaching equilibrium of AnAOB and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity of 235 +/- 0.40 and 2.60 +/- 0.29 mg N.(g VSS.h)(-1), respectively. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that AnAOB abundance (detected Candidatus Kuenenia) negatively correlated with the AOB (mainly Nitrosomonas)/AnAOB abundance ratio, while correlated positively with the residual ammonium concentration of a region. Furthermore, long-term refrigeration probably reduced the cross-feed relationship between AnAOB and other symbiotic organisms (Armatimonadetes and Chloroflexi) to maintain the basic metabolism. Meanwhile, extracellular polymeric substances produced by other genera (order Xanthomonadales and Pseudomonadales) decreased the mass transfer, protecting AnAOB from unfavorable conditions, thereby facilitating high AnAOB abundance during refrigeration. Thus, this study provides a promising perspective towards the practical applications of mainstream process. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Death, dying, and last wishes
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Numerous issues confront emergency physicians regarding end-of-life care in the emergency department (ED). Principles of bioethics can be helpful in developing a framework for the analysis and conclusions of ethical dilemmas. Some of the important issues and dilemmas frequently encountered in emergency medicine include issues surrounding resuscitation and resuscitation attempts, palliative care, symptom resolution, honoring advance directives and patient preferences, religious preferences, and spiritual beliefs. Effective communication and support techniques, including establishing the patient's wishes, goals, and values of medical treatment can be beneficial in carrying out those wishes. In many cases, definitive curative care is not possible or is not desired, and the goals of medical care at the end of life shift away from technologic care to measures that provide comfort and support to the patient and family.

TI  - Prospective study of complications in neurosurgery and their impact on the health related quality of life (HRQOL) - Proposal of a new complication grading in neurosurgery based on HRQOL
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY NEUROSURGERY-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND CASE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Objective: To study various complications in neurosurgery and their impact on the health related quality of life (HRQOL) and proposal of a complication grading system in neurosurgery that is based on or at least incorporates HRQOL.
   Methods: The study was conducted in the Department of Neurosurgery at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS), Tirupati. Patients operated between June 2018 to July 2019 and after satisfying the "inclusion criteria" were included in the study, those patients who developed complication(s) after surgery as per our "definition of complication" constituted the "study group" and were followed-up for maximum three months. Diseases were categorised, complications initially graded as per Landriel scale. For measuring the health related quality of life (HRQOL), EUROQOL (EQ-5D-5L-5L) scale was used and HRQOL was noted at admission, after complication, at discharge and at follow-up and the results were analysed to measure the impact of complication on HRQOL.
   Results: Out of total of 2186 patients operated, 212 developed complications (16.48%), cranium cases having 3.64 times risk than spine cases. Brain tumours, vascular disorders and spinal tumours had highest relative risk, age and sex doesn't seem to have any significant effect on rate of complication, respiratory complications f/b CSF leak and cranial nerve palsies were most common complication. Sudden onset cardiac arrest, tumour bed hematoma, hydrocephalus, limb weakness and respiratory distress most severely affected the HRQOL.
   Conclusion: Treatment based grading of complications do not efficiently reflect the correlation with impact on HRQOL. EQ-5D-5L Index score can be used as a HRQOL scale and complication based HRQOL is a must in this modern era. Landriel scale performed satisfactorily as a group when considering HRQOL, but has lacunae when considered on individual patient basis, for which we propose HRQOL based SVIMS COMPLICATION GRADING and MODIFIED LANDRIEL SCALE incorporating HRQOL.

TI  - Trends in ischaemic heart disease hospitalisation and case fatality in the Hong Kong Chinese population 2000-2009: a secondary analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives: This study examines the recent trends in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) incidence and case fatality in Hong Kong and explores the possible risk factors.
   Design: Retrospective observational study.
   Setting: All public hospitals in Hong Kong.
   Outcome measures: Incidence rate was defined as the number of IHD inpatient episodes divided by the size of the corresponding population. Short-term and long-term case fatality rate was defined as deaths from all causes occurring within 30 and 31-365 days, respectively, divided by the number of IHD inpatient episodes among the corresponding population.
   Methods: Poisson and logistic regression models were used to examine the IHD incidence and short-term/long-term case fatality trends, respectively, for different age and sex groups.
   Results: IHD incidence was stable in most age groups. However, the incidence in men aged 15-24, 35-44 and >= 85 years showed increasing trends, whereas the incidence in men aged 55-64 years and women aged 35-74 years showed decreasing trends. Overall, the short-term/long-term case fatality rates were unchanged over time for both sexes. Short-term case fatality showed increasing trends in women aged 65-74 and >= 85 years, while long-term case fatality in men aged 55-64 and 75-84 years and women aged >= 75 years showed increasing trends.
   Conclusions: Hong Kong trends resembled those in the USA, England and Wales, showing stable or slow decline in the IHD rates, while increasing trends were observed for some age groups, particularly young adults. Public health promotion efforts should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension prevalence.

TI  - Usefulness of the R-Wave Sign as a Predictor for Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia in Patients With Brugada Syndrome
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an autosomal dominant channelopathy which is responsible for a large number of sudden cardiac deaths in young subjects without structural abnormalities. The most challenging step in management of patients with BrS is identifying who is at risk for developing malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA). In patients with BrS, conduction delay in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) causes a prominent R wave in lead aVR. This electrocardiographic parameter can be useful to detect these high-risk patients. The goal of this study was to test the significance of R-wave elevation in lead aVR as a predictor for VTA in patients with BrS. In this retrospective study, we included 132 patients with BrS (47 15 years, 65% men) who visited the outpatient clinic for cardiogenetic screening. Patients' medical records were examined for the presence of a positive R-wave sign in lead aVR and VTA. A positive R-wave sign in lead aVR was observed in 41 patients (31%). This sign was more frequently observed in patients who experienced VTA (n = 24) before the initial diagnosis, during electrophysiological studies, or during follow-up (p <0.001). The positive R-wave sign occurred more frequently in symptomatic patients with a history of an out of hospital cardiac arrest, VTA, or syncope than asymptomatic patients (60% vs 26%; p = 0.002). During the follow-up period, this sign was more frequently detected in patients who developed either de novo (50%) or recurrent VTA (80%) (p = 0.017). Multivariable regression analysis showed that R-wave sign is an independent predictor for VTA development (odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.79 to 13.27). The presence of a positive R-wave sign in lead aVR is associated with the development of VTA. In conclusion, positive R-wave sign in lead aVR can be used to identify patients with BrS at risk for malignant VTA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Misplacement of a femoral venous catheter into the ascending lumbar vein: A case report and first use of balloon catheter compression hemostasis
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:This case report aims to highlight a rare but life-threatening complication of femoral venous catheterization and to describe a novel endovascular technique for its management. Non-tunneled femoral catheters provide rapid vascular access for emergency dialysis (e.g., arteriovenous graft [AVG] occlusion, hyperkalemia) but carry risks of vascular injury, potentially causing fatal bleeding. This is the first report of hemorrhagic shock due to ascending lumbar vein rupture from femoral catheter misplacement, successfully managed by balloon compression hemostasis.Patient concerns:A 48-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease presented with hyperkalemia and an occluded AVG. Following ultrasound-guided femoral vein catheterization, she developed recurrent hypotension during dialysis. Suspected anaphylactic shock or abdominal hemorrhage was refractory to anti-allergic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and arterial embolization.Diagnoses:Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the catheter tip had perforated the ascending lumbar vein, causing intraperitoneal hemorrhage. DSA clearly identified the injury site and ruled out other causes, confirming hemorrhagic shock secondary to catheter-induced venous rupture.Interventions:Immediate balloon catheter compression was applied under fluoroscopic guidance. The balloon was precisely positioned at the venous rupture site and inflated to apply direct pressure, sealing the breach for 15 to 20 minutes to promote endothelial repair. This avoided surgical intervention and was particularly suited to this deep, anatomically complex injury.Outcomes:Post-compression angiography confirmed complete hemostasis. The patient's hemodynamics stabilized immediately, with no further episodes of hypotension. Hemoglobin levels remained stable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization (post-procedure Hb: 65 g/L, discharged with Hb: 95 g/L). Subsequent dialysis sessions were successful without recurrent bleeding. The patient was successfully transitioned to long-term dialysis access. At 1-month postdischarge telephone follow-up, the patient reported no complications and had successfully undergone AVG thrombectomy at another facility.Lessons:This first report demonstrates the efficacy of interventional balloon compression for catheter-related deep vein rupture, offering a novel strategy for rapid hemostasis. Clinicians must be vigilant for vascular injury during non-tunneled catheter placement, especially in complex areas, and utilize DSA promptly for diagnosis. Further research into standardized protocols and long-term outcomes is warranted.

TI  - Fever management with or without a temperature control device after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and resuscitation (TEMP-CARE): A study protocol for a randomized clinical trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - BackgroundFever is associated with brain injury after cardiac arrest. It is unknown whether fever management with a feedback-controlled device impacts patient-centered outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. This trial aims to investigate fever management with or without a temperature control device after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.MethodsThe TEMP-CARE trial is part of the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial Sedation, TEmperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (STEPCARE) trial, a randomized, international, multicenter, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, superiority trial that will evaluate sedation strategies, temperature management, and blood pressure targets simultaneously in nontraumatic/nonhemorrhagic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients following hospital admission. For the temperature management component of the trial described in this protocol, patients will be randomly allocated to fever management with or without a feedback-controlled temperature control device. For those managed with a device, if temperature >= 37.8 degrees C occurs within 72 h post-randomization the device will be started targeting a temperature of <= 37.5 degrees C. Standard fever treatment, as recommended by local guidelines, including pharmacological agents, will be provided to participants in both groups. The two other components of the STEPCARE trial evaluate sedation and blood pressure strategies. Apart from the STEPCARE trial interventions, all other aspects of general intensive care will be according to the local practices of the participating site. A physician blinded to the intervention will determine the neurological prognosis following European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at six months post-randomization. To detect a 5.6% absolute risk reduction (90% power, alpha .05), 3500 participants will be enrolled. Secondary outcomes include poor functional outcome at six months, intensive care-related serious adverse events, and overall health status at six months.ConclusionThe TEMP-CARE trial will investigate if post-cardiac arrest management of fever with or without a temperature control device affects patient-important outcomes after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Neuroprotective Treatment of Postanoxic Encephalopathy: A Review of Clinical Evidence
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Postanoxic encephalopathy is the key determinant of death or disability after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Animal studies have provided proof-of-principle evidence of efficacy of divergent classes of neuroprotective treatments to promote brain recovery. However, apart from targeted temperature management (TTM), neuroprotective treatments are not included in current care of patients with postanoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. We aimed to review the clinical evidence of efficacy of neuroprotective strategies to improve recovery of comatose patients after cardiac arrest and to propose future directions. We performed a systematic search of the literature to identify prospective, comparative clinical trials on interventions to improve neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. We included 53 studies on 21 interventions. None showed unequivocal benefit. TTM at 33 or 36 degrees C and adrenaline (epinephrine) are studied most, followed by xenon, erythropoietin, and calcium antagonists. Lack of efficacy is associated with heterogeneity of patient groups and limited specificity of outcome measures. Ongoing and future trials will benefit from systematic collection of measures of baseline encephalopathy and sufficiently powered predefined subgroup analyses. Outcome measurement should include comprehensive neuropsychological follow-up, to show treatment effects that are not detectable by gross measures of functional recovery. To enhance translation from animal models to patients, studies under experimental conditions should adhere to strict methodological and publication guidelines.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hypothermic cardiac arrest: A secondary analysis of multicenter extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation registry data in Japan
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is used to resuscitate patients with cardiac arrest; however, its effect in treating hypothermic cardiac arrest has not been well studied. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the characteristics and outcomes of patients with hypothermic cardiac arrest who underwent ECPR, using a multicenter out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) registry in Japan. Methods: Baseline characteristics of patients with hypothermic OHCA and body temperature below 32 degrees C were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality and neurological outcomes in these patients. Outcomes of hypothermic and cardiogenic OHCA cases were compared using propensity-score matching to investigate differences among subgroups. Results: We included 2,157 patients, with 102 and 1,646 in the hypothermic and cardiogenic groups, respectively. Higher age and longer low-flow time were independent risk factors for mortality, and higher age was an independent risk factor for unfavorable neurological outcomes in the hypothermic OHCA group. Eighty matched pairs were selected during propensity-score matching, and the mortality rate was lower in the hypothermic group than in the cardiogenic group (46.2% vs. 77.5%; p < 0.01). Unfavorable neurological outcome rate was lower in the hypothermic group than in the cardiogenic group (62.5% vs. 87.5%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: Increased age and prolonged low-flow time were identified as negative prognostic factors in patients with hypothermic OHCA who underwent ECPR. These patients showed lower mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome rates than patients with cardiogenic OHCA, suggesting that ECPR is a promising strategy for treating hypothermic OHCA.

TI  - Cardiac arrest in an infant with congenital adrenal hyperplasia
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - We report a 3-month-old boy who suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. During resuscitation, the medical team was informed that he was receiving hydrocortisone treatment. The possibility of adrenal insufficiency with hyperkalemic cardiac arrest prompted the administration of calcium, which resulted in the return of spontaneous circulation. The infant's diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia was not spontaneously mentioned by the parents. This case illustrates the importance of obtaining adequate parental information and considering hyperkalemia as a possible cause of cardiac arrest.

TI  - RAndomized Cluster Evaluation of Cardiac ARrest Systems (RACE-CARS) trial: Study rationale and design
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurs in nearly 350,000 people each year in the United States (US). Despite advances in pre and in-hospital care, OHCA survival remains low and is highly variable across systems and regions. The critical barrier to improving cardiac arrest outcomes is not a lack of knowledge about effective interventions, but rather the widespread lack of systems of care to deliver interventions known to be successful. The RAndomized Cluster Evaluation of Cardiac ARrest Systems (RACE-CARS) trial is a 7-year pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial of 62 counties (57 clusters) in North Carolina using an established registry and is testing whether implementation of a customized set of strategically targeted community-based interventions improves survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function in OHCA relative to control/standard care. The multifaceted intervention comprises rapid cardiac arrest recognition and systematic bystander CPR instructions by 9-1-1 telecommunicators, comprehensive community CPR training and enhanced early automated external defibrillator (AED) use prior to emergency medical systems (EMS) arrival. Approximately 20,000 patients are expected to be enrolled in the RACE CARS Trial over 4 years of the assessment period. The primary endpoint is survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic outcome defined as a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2. Secondary outcomes include the rate of bystander CPR, defibrillation prior to arrival of EMS, and quality of life. We aim to identify successful community- and systems-based strategies to improve outcomes of OHCA using a cluster randomized-controlled trial design that aims to provide a high level of evidence for future application.

TI  - The combination of chest compression synchronized ventilation and aortic balloon occlusion improve the outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in swine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - AimThe primary mission of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is to provide adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery for restoring spontaneous circulation from cardiac arrest (CA) events. Previously, studies demonstrated that chest compression synchronized ventilation (CCSV) improved systemic oxygen supply during CPR, and aortic balloon occlusion (ABO) augments the efficacy of external CPR by increasing blood perfusion to vital organs. However, both them failed to make a significant improvement in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In this study, we investigated the effects of combined CCSV and ABO on the outcomes of CPR in swine. MethodsThirty-one male domestic swine were subjected to 8 min of electrically induced and untreated CA followed by 8 min of CPR. CPR was performed by continuous chest compressions and mechanical ventilation. At the beginning of CPR, the animals were randomized to receive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV, n = 10), CCSV (n = 7), IPPV + ABO (n = 7), or CCSV + ABO (n = 7). During CPR, gas exchange and systemic hemodynamics were measured, and ROSC was recorded. After resuscitation, the function and injury biomarkers of vital organs including heart, brain, kidney, and intestine were evaluated. ResultsDuring CPR, PaO2 was significantly higher accompanied by significantly greater regional cerebral oxygen saturation in the CCSV and CCSV + ABO groups than the IPPV group. Coronary perfusion pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and carotid blood flow were significantly increased in the IPPV + ABO and CCSV + ABO groups compared with the IPPV group. ROSC was achieved in five of ten (IPPV), five of seven (CCSV), six of seven (IPPV + ABO), and seven of seven (CCSV + ABO) swine, with the rate of resuscitation success being significantly higher in the CCSV + ABO group than the IPPV group (P = 0.044). After resuscitation, significantly improved myocardial and neurological function, and markedly less cardiac, cerebral, renal, and intestinal injuries were observed in the CCSV + ABO group compared with the IPPV group. ConclusionThe combination of CCSV and ABO improved both ventilatory and hemodynamic efficacy during CPR, promoted ROSC, and alleviated post-resuscitation multiple organ injury in swine.

TI  - When the Female Heart Stops: Sex and Gender Differences in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Epidemiology and Resuscitation
T2  - CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Sex- and gender-based differences are emerging as clinically significant in the epidemiology and resuscitation of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Female patients tend to be older, experience arrest in private locations, and have fewer initial shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia). Despite standardized algorithms for the management of OHCA, women are less likely to receive evidence-based interventions, including advanced cardiac life support medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, and targeted temperature management. While some data suggest a protective mechanism of estrogen in the heart, brain, and kidney, its role is incompletely understood. Female patients experience higher mortality from OHCA, prompting the need for sex-specific research. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Frozen elephant trunk in normothermia without circulatory arrest: initial experience
T2  - ANNALS OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Background: Aortic arch surgery has evolved significantly with novel techniques aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality. Traditional approaches rely on hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA), which remains associated with neurological and systemic complications. This study presents our initial experience with a normothermic frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique that eliminates circulatory arrest while maintaining continuous cerebral and systemic perfusion. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent FET without HCA at Polytechnic University of Marche from September 2019 to January 2025. The surgical strategy included femoral and innominate artery cannulation for extracorporeal circulation, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (ASCP), and retrograde stent graft deployment with balloon occlusion. Perioperative outcomes, complications, and mid-term follow-up data were evaluated. Results: Twenty-three patients (median age, 73 years) underwent FET without HCA. Indications included degenerative aneurysm (n=14), type I endoleak (n=4), acute aortic dissection (n=2), chronic penetrating ulcer (n=2), and Kommerell's diverticulum (n=1). Technical success was 100%. Two in-hospital deaths occurred due to septic shock and stroke. No cases of permanent spinal cord injury were reported. The median intensive care unit and hospital stays were 4 and 10 days, respectively. The median peak intraoperative lactate level was 1.8 mmol/L (range, 1-4.8 mmol/L). At a median follow-up of 27 months, three patients required distal aortic reintervention due to type Ib (n=2) and type II (n=1) endoleaks. Conclusions: Normothermic FET without circulatory arrest is a feasible and potentially advantageous alternative to traditional techniques, reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury while maintaining cerebral and systemic perfusion. Early outcomes suggest promising results in selected patients, though further studies with larger cohorts are necessary to validate long-term safety and efficacy.

TI  - Mechanistic insights into the neuroprotective effects of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation in post-cardiac arrest brain injury: Modulation of the Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt pathway
T2  - BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) remains a significant challenge, marked by high mortality and disability rates due to persistent neuroinflammation. This study explored the neuroprotective potential of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LITUS) in mitigating brain damage after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using a murine model and in vitro assays. LITUS treatment improved 24-h survival rates and neurological recovery in cardiac arrest (CA) mice, as evidenced by behavioral assessments and reduced neurological deficit scores. Proteomic analyses revealed modulation of Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, characterized by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that LITUS enhanced Piezo1 and Dkk3 activation, promoting calcium influx and anti-inflammatory responses. The Piezo1 antagonist GsMTx4 abrogated these effects, underscoring Piezo1's specific role. Additionally, in vitro experiments using oxygen/glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated BV2 microglial cells confirmed that LITUS reduced inflammatory responses and enhanced cellular recovery via the Piezo1-Dkk3 axis. These findings highlight LITUS as a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy to ameliorate PCABI by modulating neuroinflammation through the Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt pathway. This work provides a basis for translational research and potential clinical applications in improving outcomes for CPR survivors.

TI  - Persistence of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms 12 and 36 Months After Acute Coronary Syndrome
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To assess the prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in patients at 12 and 36 months post hospital admission for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There is increasing recognition that posttraumatic stress may develop in the aftermath of an acute cardiac event. However, there has been little research on the longer-term prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Posttraumatic stress Symptoms were assessed at 12 months in 213 patients with ACS and in 179 patients at 36 months. Predictor variables included clinical, demographic, and emotional factors measured during hospital admission. Results: At 12 months post ACS, 26 (12.2%) patients qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD; 23 (12.8%) patients were identified with PTSD at 36 months. Posttraumatic symptoms at 12 months were associated with younger age, ethnic minority status, social deprivation, cardiac symptom recurrence, history of depression, depressed mood during admission, hostility, and Type D personality. In multiple regression, depressed mood during admission and recurrent cardiac symptoms were independent predictors of posttraumatic symptoms (R-2 = 0.507, p < .001). At 36 months, posttraumatic Stress symptoms were independently predicted by posttraumatic symptom levels at 12 months and depressed mood during admission (R 2 = 0.635, p < .001). Conclusion: Posttraumatic stress symptoms persist for at least 3 years after an acute cardiac event. Early emotional responses are important in predicting longer-term posttraumatic stress. It is important to identify patients at risk for posttraumatic stress as they are more likely to experience reduced quality of life.

TI  - Extracorporeal vs. conventional CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a potential intervention for OHCA, but its effectiveness compared to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) needs further evaluation. Method: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials. gov for relevant studies from January 2010 to March 2023. Pooled meta-analysis was performed to investigate any potential association between ECPR and improved survival and neurological outcomes. Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included two randomized controlled trials enrolling 162 participants and 10 observational cohort studies enrolling 4507 participants. The pooled meta-analysis demonstrated that compared to CCRP, ECPR did not improve survival and neurological outcomes at 180 days following OHCA (RR: 3.39, 95% CI: 0.79 to 14.64; RR: 2.35, 95% CI: 0.97 to 5.67). While a beneficial effect of ECPR was obtained regarding 30-day survival and neurological outcomes. Furthermore, ECPR was associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications. Subgroup analysis showed that ECPR was prominently beneficial when exclusively initiated in the emergency department. Additional post-resuscitation treatments did not significantly impact the efficacy of ECPR on 180-day survival with favorable neurological outcomes. Conclusions: There is no high-quality evidence supporting the superiority of ECPR over CCPR in terms of survival and neurological outcomes in OHCA patients. However, due to the potential for bias, heterogeneity among studies, and inconsistency in practice, the non-significant results do not preclude the potential benefits of ECPR. Further high-quality research is warranted to optimize ECPR practice and provide more generalizable evidence.

TI  - Endothelial BMP4 Promotes Leukocyte Rolling and Adhesion and Is Elevated in Patients After Survived Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - INFLAMMATION
AB  - Leukocyte recruitment is a fundamental step in the inflammatory response during ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Rolling and adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelium promote tissue inflammation after IRI and require presentation of adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 on the endothelial surface. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 is a prominent member of the BMP family expressed and secreted by endothelial cells. BMP4 derived from endothelial cells has important functions in vascular disease but its influence on the leukocyte adhesion cascade during inflammation is incompletely understood. In the present study, we challenged mice with an inducible endothelial-specific BMP4 deletion (referred to as EC-BMP4(-/-)mice) and their control littermates (EC-BMP4(+/+)) with thioglycollate i.p. and assessed extravasation of different leukocyte subsets during peritonitis. Peritoneal lavages were performed and peritoneal cells were counted. Total cell count in lavages of EC-BMP4(-/-)mice was markedly reduced compared with lavages of EC-BMP4(+/+)mice. FACS analyses of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal cells revealed that diverse leukocyte subsets were reduced in EC-BMP4(-/-)mice. Intravital microscopy of cremaster venules demonstrated that rolling and adhesion of leukocytes were significantly diminished in EC-BMP4(-/-)mice in comparison with control mice in response to TNF alpha. These observations indicate that endothelial BMP4 is essential for rolling, adhesion, and extravasation of leukocytesin vivo. To understand the underlying mechanisms, levels of endothelial adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 were quantified in EC-BMP4(-/-)and EC-BMP4(+/+)mice by quantitative PCR and Western blotting. Interestingly, ICAM-1 and E-selectin expressions were reduced in the hearts of EC-BMP4(-/-)mice. Next we confirmed pro-inflammatory properties of BMP4 in a gain of function experiments and found that administration of recombinant BMP4 in male C57BL/6 mice increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion in cremaster venulesin vivo. To assess the regulation of BMP4 in inflammatory disease in humans, we collected plasma samples of patients from day 0 to day 7 after survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA,n= 42). Remarkably, plasma of OHCA patients contained significantly higher BMP4 protein levels compared with patients with coronary artery disease (CAD,n= 12) or healthy volunteers (n= 11). Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated plasma BMP4 levels after ROSC are associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcome. Collectively, endothelial BMP4 is a potent activator of inflammationin vivothat promotes rolling, adhesion, and extravasation of leukocyte subsets by induction of E-selectin and ICAM-1. Elevation of plasma BMP4 levels in the post-resuscitation period suggests that BMP4 contributes to pathophysiology and poor outcome of post-cardiac arrest syndrome.

TI  - Stem Cell Therapy for Ischemic Brain Injury: Early Intranasal Delivery after Cardiac Arrest
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL STROKE RESEARCH
AB  - Global ischemic brain injury is the leading cause of mortality and long-term disability in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Hypothermia and neuroprotective agents are two strategies partially improve neurological outcomes following resuscitation. However, the therapeutic effects of these treatments are inconsistently reported. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising protective strategy due to its potential for proliferation and differentiation into functional neural cells. This editorial reviews the current status of stem cell therapy via the intranasal route in primates and clinical studies, along with the treatment window of stem cell therapy in ischemic brain injury after cardiac arrest to provide new insight into stem cell therapy for cardiac arrest-induced global cerebral ischemia injury.

TI  - Beyond the hype: re-evaluating efficacy metrics and modeling rigor for MSC-EVs-based therapy in acute brain injury
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Acute brain injuries (ABI), such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, hypoxia-induced brain injury, and cardiac arrest, are critical and life-threatening conditions that contribute to substantial mortality and long-term disability. Despite extensive translational efforts, no effective therapy has improved long-term functional outcomes, highlighting a critical unmet need. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have emerged as promising cell-free therapeutic platform, offering multifaceted repair capabilities. This review synthesizes current evidence supporting the neuroprotective effects of MSC-EVs, which operate through synchronized immunomodulation, anti-apoptotic signaling, enhancement of neurogenesis, and stimulation of angiogenesis. We further delineated the fundamental EVs biology, including biogenesis pathways, spatiotemporal biodistribution, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) trafficking mechanisms that underpin therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, we established MSC-EV cargo as a strategic solution to unmet neuroprotective needs while mapping clinical translation roadmaps to accelerate the rational development of regenerative neurotherapeutics.

TI  - First Results of Our Local Practice Guide Used During the Late Phase of Resuscitation in Patients with Refractory VF in Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation (rVF) is a clinical challenge. If rVF is still present after standard advanced life support (ALS) guideline care, including amiodaron administration, other therapeutic options might be necessary. Based on the available evidence and expertise, our Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) team developed a local practice guide for the prolonged resuscitation of patients in rVF and implemented this as standard HEMS care in March 2022. Methods: This database study contains all patients treated with our local practice guide during out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with rVF beyond the fifth regular ALS shock-block. This local practice HEMS treatment algorithm consisted of, among others, cessation of epinephrine and alternating administration of esmolol and norepinephrine combined with enoximone. Data were derived from the HEMS database and the treating hospitals. Primary outcome was the return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary outcome was defined as survival to hospital discharge and cerebral performance. This outcome was compared to the literature to analyze for inferiority of treatment. Results: In a 21-month period, HEMS was 761 times deployed for OHCA. Nineteen patients were treated with the local practice guide, nine patients (47%) were admitted to hospital with return of spontaneous circulation. Median resuscitation time was 22min. Hospital survival with good neurology was achieved in 42% vs 17% as expected. Exact Clopper-Pearson and logistic regression analysis revealed non-inferiority of the local practice guide. Withholding epinephrine was achieved in 84% of patients. A total of 79% and 90% of patients received esmolol and norepinephrine/enoximone mixture, respectively. Alternative defibrillation positions were indicated in 18 patients but applied in only 6 (33%). Conclusion: In patients with persisting VF despite prolonged advanced life support care, a multifaceted bundle of care approach shows promising results and warrants further research. Alternative drug administrations were found to be substantially easier to achieve compared to alternative defibrillation positions.

TI  - Fresh Red Cells for Transfusion in Critically Ill Adults: An Economic Evaluation of the Standard Issue Transfusion Versus Fresher Red-Cell Use in Intensive Care (TRANSFUSE) Clinical Trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Trials comparing the effects of transfusing RBC units of different storage durations have considered mortality or morbidity as outcomes. We perform the first economic evaluation alongside a full age of blood clinical trial with a large population assessing the impact of RBC storage duration on quality-of-life and costs in critically ill adults. Design: Quality-of-life was measured at 6 months post randomization using the EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level instrument. The economic evaluation considers quality-adjusted life year and cost implications from randomization to 6 months. A generalized linear model was used to estimate incremental costs (2016 U.S. dollars) and quality-adjusted life years, respectively while adjusting for baseline characteristics. Setting: Fifty-nine ICUs in five countries. Patients: Adults with an anticipated ICU stay of at least 24 hours when the decision had been made to transfuse at least one RBC unit. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either the freshest or oldest available compatible RBC units (standard practice) in the hospital transfusion service. Measurements and Main Results: EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level utility scores were similar at 6 months-0.65 in the short-term and 0.63 in the long-term storage group (difference, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.00 to 0.04; p = 0.10). There were no significant differences in resource use between the two groups apart from 3.0 fewer hospital readmission days (95% CI, -5.3 to -0.8; p = 0.01) during follow-up in the short-term storage group. There were no significant differences in adjusted total costs or quality-adjusted life years between the short- and long-term storage groups (incremental costs, -$2,358; 95% CI, -$5,586 to $711) and incremental quality-adjusted life years: 0.003 quality-adjusted life years (95% CI, -0.003 to 0.008). Conclusions: Without considering the additional supply cost of implementing a freshest available RBC strategy for critical care patients, there is no evidence to suggest that the policy improves quality-of-life or reduces other costs compared with standard transfusion practice.

TI  - Survival Measures After Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Related Factors Among Children: Retrospective Cohort Study in Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is infrequently performed in pediatric emergencies, it is crucial that CPR is administered correctly and promptly for children requiring resuscitation. Objectives: This study aims to examine the demographic characteristics, etiological factors, and survival outcomes of patients who underwent CPR in the emergency department of the Children's Medical Center. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we gathered data from 149 resuscitated cases over a 2-year period. All patients under 18 years old who underwent CPR in the emergency department of the Children's Medical Center Hospital for any reason from April 2021 to March 2023 were retrospectively assessed. Demographic information and information related to the factors causing resuscitation, underlying diseases, vital and clinical signs on arrival, and resuscitation results were obtained by reviewing archived patient records. Results: The median age of patients was 18.0 months (IQR 6.0-70.0), and 51% were boys. 64.4% of patients achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 53.7% survived for 24 hours after the event, and 24.2% survived until discharge. The analysis of the association between contributing factors and survival measures in pediatric resuscitation efforts reveals several insights. The reason for resuscitation is an important factor, with respiratory arrest being strongly associated with better outcomes at all stages, while cardiac and cardiopulmonary arrests show poorer prognoses (P < 0.001). The rhythm prior to chest compressions is also a significant predictor, with asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) being associated with lower chances of ROSC and survival (P < 0.001). The location of the arrest is a pivotal factor, with in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs) showing better outcomes compared to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) (P <0.001). Conclusions: In conclusion, this study underscores the critical importance of prompt and correct administration of CPR in pediatric emergencies. These insights provide valuable guidance for improving resuscitation protocols and training programs to enhance survival rates in pediatric CPR scenarios.

TI  - Effects and barriers to deployment of telehealth wellness programs for chronic patients across 3 European countries
T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Benefits of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are well established, but long-term sustainability of training-induced effects and its translation into healthy lifestyles are unsolved issues. It is hypothesized that Integrated Care Services supported by Information and Communication Technologies (ICS-ICT) can overcome such limitations. In the current study, we explored 3 ICS-ICT deployment experiences conducted in Barcelona, Trondheim and Athens.
   Methods: In the 3 sites, a total of 154 patients completed an 8-week supervised CPR program. Thereafter, they were allocated either to an ICS-ICT group or to usual care (CPR + UC) during a follow-up period of at least 12 months with assessment of 6-min walking test (6MWT) as main outcome variable at all time points in the 3 sites. Because real deployment was prioritized, the interventions were adapted to site heterogeneities.
   Results: In the ICS-ICT group from Barcelona (n = 77), the use of the personal health folder (PHF) was the cornerstone technological tool to empower COPD patients for self-management showing high applicability and user-acceptance. Long-term sustainability of training-induced increase in exercise capacity was observed in ICS-ICT compared to the control group (p = 0.01). Likewise, ICS-ICT enhanced the activities domain of the SGRQ (p < 0.01) and daily physical activity (p = 0.03), not seen in controls. No effects of ICS-ICT were observed in Trondheim (n = 37), nor in Athens (n = 40), due to technological and/or organizational limitations.
   Conclusions: The study results suggest the potential of the ICS-ICT Barcelona's approach to enhance COPD management. Moreover, it allowed identification of the factors limiting transferability to the other sites. The research prompts the need for large multicenter trials specifically designed to assess effectiveness, efficiencies and transferability of this type of intervention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - GYY4137 ameliorates blood brain barrier damage by inhibiting autophagy mediated occludin degradation in cardiac arrest and resuscitation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac arrest (CA) is an important cause of neurological impairment and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality. The stability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for minimizing secondary neurological damage and improving long-term prognosis. However, the precise mechanisms and regulatory pathways that contribute to BBB dysfunction after CPR remain elusive. GYY4137 is an innovative hydrogen sulfide slow-release agent with excellent properties as a hydrogen sulfide substitute. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of GYY4137 on CA/CPR and the underlying mechanisms of BBB protection. The effects of GYY4137 on systemic inflammation, BBB integrity, and autophagy were evaluated using a mouse CA/CPR model. The underlying mechanisms of occludin changes associated with GYY4137 were investigated using oxygen-glucose deprivation / reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. ELISA, neurological function and other tests showed that GYY4137 ameliorates systemic inflammation and neurological prognosis. Western blotting, transwell migration and tube formation assays showed that GYY4137 improves BBB function both in vivo and in vitro. The detection of autophagy flow and protein degradation pathways showed the inhibition of occludin reduction by GYY4137 was mainly achieved by suppressing autophagy mediated degradation. Taken together, GYY4137 may improve BBB dysfunction following CPR by increasing occludin content. This effect was achieved by inhibiting autophagic degradation rather than promoting synthesis. GYY4137 also mitigated systemic inflammation and improved neurological outcomes after CA/CPR. In summary, our study provides valuable insights into protecting the integrity of BBB and improving neurological outcomes after CPR.

TI  - Pre-hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug administration In Cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC-2): Trial protocol
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Despite its use since the 1960s, the safety or effectiveness of adrenaline as a treatment for cardiac arrest has never been comprehensively evaluated in a clinical trial. Although most studies have found that adrenaline increases the chance of return of spontaneous circulation for short periods, many studies found harmful effects on the brain and raise concern that adrenaline may reduce overall survival and/or good neurological outcome. The PARAMEDIC-2 trial seeks to determine if adrenaline is safe and effective in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   This is a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with a parallel economic evaluation. Participants will be eligible if they are in cardiac arrest in the out-of-hospital environment and advanced life support is initiated. Exclusions are cardiac arrest as a result of anaphylaxis or life threatening asthma, and patient known or appearing to be under 16 or pregnant.
   8000 participants treated by 5 UK ambulance services will be randomised between December 2014 and August 2017 to adrenaline (intervention) or placebo (control) through opening pre-randomised drug packs. Clinical outcomes are survival to 30 days (primary outcome), hospital discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months, health related quality of life, and neurological and cognitive outcomes (secondary outcomes).

TI  - Specialist Physician Approaches to Discussing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Frail Older Adults: A qualitative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - Background: Despite the impact and importance of end-of-life discussions, little is known about how physicians discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with patients and their families. The necessary components for successful communication about CPR are poorly understood and an established framework to structure these conversations is lacking. Here, we were motivated to understand how physicians approach resuscitation planning with families when older patients have limited life expectancy and a high burden of illness. Method: Qualitative analysis was conducted of semi-structured interviews of 28 physicians of varying medical sub-specialties in a tertiary care hospital. Results: Most physicians explored the surrogates' goals and values, but few provided explicit information about the patients' overall health status or expected long-term health outcome related to CPR and underlying illnesses. Conclusion: There is considerable heterogeneity in physicians' approaches to CPR discussions. The principle of autonomy is dominant with less emphasis on providing adequate information for effective decision-making.

TI  - Vasoactive support in the optimization of post-cardiac arrest hemodynamic status: From pharmacology to clinical practice
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - As a critical component of post-resuscitation care, prompt optimization of hemodynamic status by means of targeted interventions is vital in order to maximize the likelihood of good outcome. Vasoactive agents play an essential role in the supportive care of post cardiac arrest patients. The administration of these agents is associated with serious side-effects and therefore they should be used in the minimal dose necessary to achieve low-normal mean arterial pressure and adequate systematic perfusion. Careful and frequent serial evaluation of the patient is important primarily to assess volume status and adequacy of circulatory support. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and laboratory parameters is essential both to accurately titrate therapy and because inotropes and vasopressors have the potential to induce life-threatening side-effects. The clinical efficacy of inotropes and vasopressors has been largely investigated through examination of their impact on hemodynamic end points, and clinical practice has been driven in part by expert opinion, extrapolation from animal studies, and physician preference. Clearly these agents should all be considered as supportive measures to stabilize the patient prior to some form of definitive therapy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Editor's Choice-Extracorporeal life support for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Part of a treatment bundle
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of papers have been published on the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) in adult patients, but, although promising results have been reported in patients with in-hospital refractory cardiac arrest supported by extracorporeal life support (ECLS), data on patients with out-of-hospital (OHCA) cardiac arrest are scarce and conflicting. The present study aims at summarizing the available evidence on the use of ECPR in adult patients with OHCA, clinically focusing on the factors most often associated with outcome in these patients. Even in the absence of randomized trials, there is growing evidence from ECLS centers documenting sound clinical benefits of ECPR in selected OHCA. According to the available evidence, three factors seem to contribute strongly to the favorable outcome of ECLS supported OHCA patients: (a) selection of patients (mainly definition of age range and a witnessed cardiac arrest); (b) the availability of an ECLS team, well skilled and experienced (to reduce time of implantation and incidence of complications); (c) a multifaceted approach to the OHCA patient (the so-called ECLS-bundle) to treat the reversible cause of CA (i.e. percutaneous coronary intervention), ensure neuroprotection (hypothermia), and maintain organ perfusion (till recovery). Taking into account the promising results of ECPR in selected OHCA patients, there is a clinical need for shared protocols to reduce differences related to the center experience and mostly to increase availability of ECLS as part of a multifaceted approach for these patients.

AB  - Immediate and long-term results of surgical treatment of 67 pattients with different malignant paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias were evaluated. Before surgery all patients had syncopal attacks and 6 patients had episodes of cardiac arrest. Drugs failed to prevent attacks of arrhythmia and produced pronounced side affects while surgery was highly effective for prevention of different types of cardiac arrhythmias. Operative mortality depended an the state of leftventricular contractility. Successful surgery affected positively survival and quality of life of patients with malignant paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias.

TI  - Association between bystander physical limitations, delays in chest compression during telecommunicator-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Promptly initiated bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Many OHCA patients require repositioning to a firm surface. We examined the association between repositioning, chest compression (CC) delay, and patient outcomes.Methods: We used a quality improvement registry from review of 9-1-1 dispatch audio recordings of OHCA among adults eligible for telecommunicator-assisted CPR (T-CPR) between 2013 and 2021. OHCA was categorized into 3 groups: CC not delayed, CC delayed due to bystander physical limitations to reposition the patient, or CC delayed for other (non-physical) reasons. The primary outcome was the repositioning interval, defined as the interval between the start of positioning instructions and CC onset. We used logistic regression to assess the odds ratio of survival according to CPR group, adjusting for potential confounders.Results: Of the 3,482 OHCA patients eligible for T-CPR, CPR was not delayed in 1,223 (35%), delayed due to repositioning in 1,413 (41%), and delayed for other reasons in 846 (24%). The repositioning interval was longest for the physical limitation delay group (137 secs, IQR-148) compared to the other delay group (81 secs, IQR-70) and the no delay group (51 secs, IQR-32) (p < 0.001). Unadjusted survival was lowest in the physical limitation delay group (11%) versus the no delay (17%) and other delay (19%) groups and persisted after adjustment (p = 0.009).Conclusion: Bystander physical limitations are a common barrier to repositioning patients to begin CPR and are associated with lower likelihood of receiving CPR, longer times to begin CC, and lower survival.

TI  - Optimization of the Pre-Hospital Rescue System for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in China
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) presents a significant public health challenge in China. A sharp contrast in survival rate after OHCA exists between China and more developed countries. Due to the short life-saving time window, emergency medical services (EMS) and bystanders peripheral to EMS are key contributors to survival after OHCA. Here we discuss limitations and challenges for current EMS in rescuing OHCA by reviewing requirements for EMS in China. We call for an updated public health-based pre hospital rescue system that includes establishing a cardiac arrest registry, promoting a "Three Early's" campaign [early dialing of emergency hotline 120, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and early defibrillation], and operating a mechanism comprised of professional public health institutions (EMS, CDC, specialized disease prevention and control institutions, and health education institutions) as well as many governmental departments, such as healthcare, industry and information technology, and education, and non-governmental organizations, such as the Red Cross Society. Following the optimization of the pre hospital rescue system and the participation of the whole population in self-rescue and mutual rescue, we believe that a dramatic improvement in OHCA survival will come about in China.

TI  - Neuronal injury from cardiac arrest: aging years in minutes
T2  - AGE
AB  - Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death and permanent disability. Most victims succumb to the oxidative and inflammatory damage sustained during cardiac arrest/resuscitation, but even survivors typically battle long-term neurocognitive impairment. Although extensive research has delineated the complex mechanisms that culminate in neuronal damage and death, no effective treatments have been developed to interrupt these mechanisms. Of importance, many of these injury cascades are also active in the aging brain, where neurons and other cells are under persistent oxidative and inflammatory stress which eventually damages or kills the cells. In light of these similarities, it is reasonable to propose that the brain essentially ages the equivalent of several years within the few minutes taken to resuscitate a patient from cardiac arrest. Accordingly, cardiac arrest-resuscitation models may afford an opportunity to study the deleterious mechanisms underlying the aging process, on an accelerated time course. The aging and resuscitation fields both stand to gain pivotal insights from one another regarding the mechanisms of injury sustained during resuscitation from cardiac arrest and during aging. This synergism between the two fields could be harnessed to foster development of treatments to not only save lives but also to enhance the quality of life for the elderly.

TI  - Factors influencing Queenslanders' willingness to perform bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Study objective: The chances of surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are greatly increased if a bystander provides cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while awaiting the arrival of the emergency medical services. Over 50% of adult Queenslanders have been trained in CPR at some time in the past, however, little is known about the factors that affect their willingness to perform CPR. Method: A random survey of 4480 Queensland residents was conducted to address this question. Results: The survey indicated that the most common barriers to performing CPR were a fear of disease, visible blood and perceived danger. In contrast, respondents indicated that they were more likely to administer CPR if the respondent knew the victim, the victim would die if CPR was not administered, and respondents believed that they possessed the necessary skills to perform CPR. A majority (84%) of respondents indicated that they were at least likely to administer CPR. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the respondents most likely to perform CPR were males, those who were married or in a de facto relationship, those in paid employment, smokers, those recently trained in CPR, prospective organ donors, those who cited no barriers to CPR and those who cited one or more factors that would facilitate CPR. Conclusions: This study indicates that there is considerable variation in Queenslanders' willingness to perform bystander CPR. Public health education campaigns aimed at correcting inaccurate perceptions of risk and addressing other barriers to bystander CPR would promote its use in response to OHCA.

TI  - Chest compression-only cardiocerebral resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by bystanders with chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth ventilation has been documented to save life. Nevertheless, despite four decades of promulgation, it is a serious problem that the majority of bystanders are unwilling or unable to perform conventional CPR. I review the efficacy of chest compression-only cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) for all adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Recent findings
   Recent observational studies showed that chest compression-only CCR by bystanders was equivalent or superior to conventional CPR in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in terms of neurological benefits. In 2008, the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care committee recommended that bystanders who witness a sudden collapse in an adult should give chest compressions without ventilations (chest compression-only CCR; hands-only CPR). Furthermore, an observational study showed that chest compression-only CCR by emergency medical services personnel was a preferable approach to advanced cardiovascular life support for adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Summary
   To save more lives, I hope that compression-only CCR by citizen is generally, known, recommended, and taught to the public, because chest compression-only CCR by citizen is the preferable approach to basic life support for adult victims with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - External Ventricular Drain for the Management of Intraventricular Hemorrhage Secondary to Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in a Neonate: A Case-Based Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - Purpose:This case report highlights the successful application of an external ventricular drain (EVD) in managing increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraventricular hemorrhage associated with neonatal cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a rare but serious condition often overlooked due to its variable presentation.Materials and Methods:We describe the diagnosis and management of a 5-day-old term infant presenting with dehydration, hypernatremia, and intermittent seizures, who was subsequently diagnosed with CVST. We presented the clinical course, the use of an EVD for ICP management, and a review of the literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for neonatal CVST.Results:Intravenous fluid resuscitation normalized the infant's serum sodium, and anti-epileptic medication controlled the seizure 2. The EVD placement led to the resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage and ventriculomegaly with improved neurological status, allowing successful extubation. At 9-month follow-up, the child exhibited normal developmental milestones without hydrocephalus.Conclusion:In neonates presenting with hypernatremia and neurological deterioration, CVST should be promptly considered, and EVD may be considered an effective treatment option for managing increased ICP secondary to intraventricular hemorrhage. Further research and long-term follow-up are needed to better characterize the specific neurological impairments and developmental outcomes associated with neonatal CVST.

TI  - Hydroxyethyl starch versus saline for resuscitation of patients in intensive care: long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort from CHEST
T2  - LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Hydroxyethyl starch for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients is not associated with improved short-term patient-centred outcomes compared with crystalloid fluid solutions. However, its effect on longer term health economic outcomes has not been reported.
   Methods We did a prespecified cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort of patients from New South Wales enrolled in the Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST), who were randomised to treatment with either 6% hydroxyethyl starch with a molecular weight of 130 kD and a molar substitution ratio of 0.4 or 0 9% sodium chloride (saline) for fluid resuscitation. Clinical outcomes were mortality and life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months, health-related quality of life at 6 months, and quality-adjusted life-years gained at 6 months. Health economic outcomes were hospital and intensive-care unit (ICU) resource use and costs at 24 months and cost-effectiveness, which we defined as the probability of reaching a willingness-to-pay threshold of less than A$50 000 per quality adjusted life-year gained at 6 months and $100 000 per life-year gained at 24 months. CHEST is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00935168.
   Findings 3537 (51%) of 7000 patients were enrolled into CHEST from New South Wales, of whom 3450 (98%) were induded in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Mortality at both 6 months and 24 months did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 397/1684 [24%] vs 382/1706 [22%]; relative risk [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.93-1.19; p=0.41; 24 months: 586/1687 [35%] vs 594/1708 [35%]; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.10; p=0.89). The mean number of life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months was similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 0.41 days [SD 0.18] vs 0.41 days [0.17]; p=0.25; 24 months: 1.46 years [SD 0.80] vs 1.47 years [0.79]; p=0.72). At 6 months, the mean health-related quality of life score was 0.67 (SD 0.34) with hydroxyethyl starch versus 0.69 (0.35) with saline (p=0.33). The mean number of quality-adjusted life-years gained did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups at 6 months (0.26 days [SD 0.18] vs 0.26 days [0.18]; p=0.33). Total hospital costs (including ICU costs) at 24 months were similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (A$62 196 [55 935] vs $62 617 [56452]; p=0.83). The probability that hydroxyethyl starch was cost effective was 11% at 6 months and 29% at 24 months.
   Interpretation Although longer term clinical outcomes did not differ between patients resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch or saline in the ICU, from a health-care payer's perspective, the probability that hydroxyethyl starch is cost effective in these patients is low.

T2  - CLINICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - The Taussig-Bing anomaly is a rare cyanotic congenital heart defect treated surgically in the early infancy. The preferred repair procedure is an arterial switch operation combined with ventricular septal defect closure. Despite promising long-term functional outcomes and survival benefits, neo-aortic dysfunction and arrhythmias might be relevant complications.

TI  - Association Between Delays in Time to Bystander CPR and Survival for Witnessed Cardiac Arrest in the United States
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prompt initiation of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is critical to survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, the association between delays in bystander CPR and OHCA survival is poorly understood. METHODS: In this observational study using a nationally representative US registry, we identified patients who received bystander CPR from a layperson for a witnessed OHCA from 2013 to 2021. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to estimate the association between time to CPR (<1 minute versus 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, and >= 10-minute intervals) and survival to hospital discharge and favorable neurological survival (survival to discharge with cerebral performance category of 1 or 2 [ie, without severe neurological disability]). RESULTS: Of 78 048 patients with a witnessed OHCA treated with bystander CPR, the mean age was 63.5 +/- 15.7 years and 25, 197 (32.3%) were women. The median time to bystander CPR was 2 (1-5) minutes, with 10% of patients having a >= 10-minute delay before initiation of CPR. Overall, 15 000 (19.2%) patients survived to hospital discharge and 13 159 (16.9%) had favorable neurological survival. There was a graded inverse relationship between time to bystander CPR and survival to hospital discharge (P for trend <0.001). Compared with patients who received CPR within 1 minute, those with a time to CPR of 2 to 3 minutes were 9% less likely to survive to discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.95]) and those with a time to CPR 4 to 5 minutes were 27% less likely to survive (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.77]). A similar graded inverse relationship was found between time to bystander CPR and favorable neurological survival (P for trend <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with witnessed OHCA, there was a dose-response relationship between delays in bystander initiation of CPR and lower survival rates.

TI  - Outcome of intensive care in the elderly
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
AB  - The long-term survival of elderly patients following critical illness in the United Kingdom has not previously been studied. The demographic (age, sex, diagnosis, severity of illness) and treatment details (admission type, length of treatment, prior surgery) of all critically ill patients aged over 70 years were recorded. The 1-year survival of such patients was measured and compared with that of a matched normal population. Of 474 patients aged over 70 years, 88 patients died on the intensive care unit (19% mortality) and a further 133 died within 1 year (total mortality 47%). The 1-year survival of patients aged < 85 years was 56% which was significantly better than that of patients over 85 years (27%). The survival of all critically ill elderly patients was significantly poorer than that of a matched normal population (1-year survival 93%). Logistic regression revealed that age, diagnosis and severity of illness are independent predictors of 1-year survival.

TI  - Evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of dispatching EMS volunteers via "interconnected first-aid app" on the outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: protocol for a type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness study
T2  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - IntroductionOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) poses a critical public health challenge globally, with survival rates in China being significantly lower than that in high-income countries. Delayed emergency response, low bystander Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) rates, and limited AED accessibility contribute to poor outcomes. Leveraging smart technology to mobilize trained volunteers via mobile applications has emerged as a promising strategy to bridge these gaps. However, in urban contexts within China, there remains a scarcity of implementation evidence encompassing aspects such as adoption, contextual barriers, and sustainability. This shortage of evidence hinders the integration of policies and systems at the policy and system levels. This study aims to improve the survival rates of OHCA patients in China, by designing, implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of an optimized "Interconnected First-Aid App" dispatching EMS volunteers through a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.Methods and analysisA stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 24 streets/townships across three districts in Shaoguan, China. The 24 streets/townships will be randomly assigned to four clusters, and each cluster will receive staggered interventions over 18 months, including volunteer recruitment/training, app-AED-EMS integration, and community education step by step. The trial adopts the PEDALS framework (Problem, Evidence-based Practice, Determinants, Action, Long-term, Scale) to assess both implementation processes and clinical outcomes. Primary outcomes include survival rates, bystander CPR/AED utilization, and response times. Implementation outcomes will evaluate adoption, feasibility, and sustainability through surveys, interviews, and health system data analysis. Findings will inform scalable, context-adapted implementation strategies for community-based OHCA response, particularly leveraging digital health innovations to address inequities in emergency care access in low- and middle-income settings.Ethics and disseminationThis protocol was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital (2025R0017-0001). Findings will be disseminated through traditional academic pathways, including peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, with policy briefings prepared for stakeholders and leaders at the local, provincial and national levels.Trial registrationThe study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the ID ChiCTR2500101187, registered on April 21, 2025.

TI  - Health-related outcomes of critically ill patients with and without sepsis
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - To determine differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), survival and healthcare resource use of critically ill adults with and without sepsis.
   We conducted a primary propensity score matched analysis of patients with and without sepsis enrolled in a large multicentre clinical trial. Outcomes included HRQoL at 6 months, survival to 2 years, length of ICU and hospital admission and cost of ICU and hospital treatment to 2 years.
   We obtained linked data for 3442 (97.3%) of 3537 eligible patients and matched 806/905 (89.0%) patients with sepsis with 806/2537 (31.7%) without. After matching, there were no significant differences in the proportion of survivors with and without sepsis reporting problems with mobility (37.8% vs. 38.7%, p = 0.86), self-care (24.7% vs. 26.0%, p = 0.44), usual activities (44.5% vs. 46.8%, p = 0.28), pain/discomfort (42.4% vs. 41.6%, p = 0.54) and anxiety/depression (36.9% vs. 37.7%, p = 0.68). There was no significant difference in survival at 2 years: 482/792 (60.9%) vs. 485/799 (60.7%) (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.86-1.18, p = 0.94). The initial ICU and hospital admission were longer for patients with sepsis: 10.1 +/- 11.9 vs. 8.0 +/- 9.8 days (p < 0.0001) and 22.8 +/- 21.2 vs. 19.1 +/- 19.0 days, (p = 0.0003) respectively. The cost of ICU admissions was higher for patients with sepsis: A$43,345 +/- 46,263 (a,notsign35,109 +/- 35,043) versus 34,844 +/- 38,281 (a,notsign28,223 +/- 31,007), mean difference $8501 (a,notsign6885), 95% CI $4342-12,660 (a,notsign3517 +/- 10,254), p < 0.001 as was the total cost of hospital treatment to 2 years: A$74,120 +/- 60,750 (a,notsign60,037 +/- 49,207) versus A$65,806 +/- 59,856 (a,notsign53,302 +/- 48,483), p = 0.005.
   Critically ill patients with sepsis have higher healthcare resource use and costs but similar survival and HRQoL compared to matched patients without sepsis.

TI  - Statewide implementation of the cardiac arrest registry to enhance survival in Ohio
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Objective: Public health surveillance is essential for improving community health. The Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) is a surveillance system for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We describe results of the organized statewide implementation of Ohio CARES.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of CARES enactment in Ohio. Key elements included: establishment of statewide leadership, appointment of a dedicated coordinator, conversion to a statewide subscription, statewide dissemination of information, fundraising from internal and external stakeholders, and conduct of resuscitation academies. We identified all adult (>18 years) OHCA reported in the registry during 2013-2020. We evaluated OHCA characteristics before (2013-2015) and after (2016-2019) statewide implementation using chi-square test. We evaluated trends in OHCA outcomes using the Cochran-Armitage test of trend.Results: Statewide CARES promotion increased participation from 2 (urban) to 136 (129 urban, 7 rural) EMS agencies. Covered population increased from 1.2 M (10% of state) to 4.8 M (41% of state). After statewide implementation, OHCA populations increased male (58.1% vs 60.8%, p < 0.01), white (50.1% vs 63.7%, p < 0.01), bystander witnessed (26.9% vs 32.9%, p < 0.01) OHCAs. Bystander CPR (34.7% vs 33.2%, p = 0.22), bystander AED (13.5% vs 12.3%, p = 0.55) and initial rhythm (shockable 18.0% vs 18.3%, p = 0.32) did not change. From 2013 to 2019 there were temporal increases in ROSC (29.7% to 31.9%, p-trend = 0.028), survival (7.4% to 12.3%, p-trend < 0.001) and survival with good neurologic outcome (5.6% to 8.6%, p-trend = 0.047).Conclusion: The organized statewide implementation of CARES in Ohio was associated with marked increases in community uptake and concur-rent observed improvements in patient outcomes. These results highlight key lessons for community-wide fostering of OHCA surveillance.

TI  - Refibrillation during out-of-hospital arrest: A frequent event with clinical consequences
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - The refibrillation was a frequent event in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The number of recurrences of ventricular fibrillation (VF) is in inverse relationship with survival. In this article we discuss about causes and mechanism of refibrillation. The amiodarone and new technical solution (defibrillators that may allow continuous monitoring of the heart rhythm, while chest compressions continue and recommend defibrillation when refibrillation occurs) are promising new strategy to improve outcome of OHCA and recurrent VF.

TI  - Cognition, emotional state, and quality of life of survivors after cardiac arrest with rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Rhythmic and periodic patterns (RPPs) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in comatose patients after cardiac arrest have been associated with high case fatality rates. A good neurological outcome according to the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) has been reported in up to 10% of cases. Data on cognitive, emotional, and quality of life outcomes are lacking. We aimed to provide insight into these outcomes at one-year follow-up. Methods: We assessed outcome of surviving comatose patients after cardiac arrest with RPPs included in the 'treatment of electroencephalo-graphic status epilepticus after cardiopulmonary resuscitation' (TELSTAR) trial at one-year follow-up, including the CPC for functional neurological outcome, a cognitive assessment, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) for emotional outcomes, and the 36-item short-form health sur-vey (SF-36) for quality of life. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of more than 1.5 SD below the mean on & GE; 2 (sub)tests within a cognitive domain. Results: Fourteen patients were included (median age 58 years, 21% female), of whom 13 had a cognitive impairment. Eleven of 14 were impaired in memory, 9/14 in executive functioning, and 7/14 in attention. The median scores on the HADS and SF-36 were all worse than expected. Based on the CPC alone, 8/14 had a good outcome (CPC 1-2). Conclusion: Nearly all cardiac arrest survivors with RPPs during the comatose state have cognitive impairments at one-year follow-up. The inci-dence of anxiety and depression symptoms seem relatively high and quality of life relatively poor, despite 'good' outcomes according to the CPC.

TI  - Suppression of PCK1 attenuates neuronal injury and improves post-resuscitation outcomes
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) is a critical medical emergency that can occur in both patients with preexisting conditions and otherwise healthy individuals. Despite successful resuscitation through cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), many survivors are at significant risk of developing post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), a complex systemic response to CA that includes brain injury as a major component. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the first rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, has been implicated in various diseases. However, its role in neuronal damage following CA/CPR remains unclear. To investigate the role of PCK1 in neuronal damage after CA/CPR, we established the CA/CPR animal model and hypoxia/re-oxygenation (H/R) cell model, manipulated PCK1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. We found increased expression of PCK1 in cortical neurons after CA/CPR. In vivo PCK1 overexpression exacerbated brain injury after CA/CPR via augmenting neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. RNA-sequencing suggested PCK1-OE disturbed the neuronal metabolism while immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (IP/MS) revealed that PCK1 contributed to the mitochondrial dysfunction via binding to Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1) and promoting its oligomerization and cytochrome c release. Besides, we confirmed that 3Mercaptopicolinic acid (3-MPA), the PCK1 inhibitor, could ameliorate the mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis of neurons both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time, we identified the detrimental role of PCK1 in post-CA brain injury. During CA/CPR, excessive PCK1 binds to VDAC1, promoting its oligomerization and cytochrome c release which leading to neuronal apoptosis and eventually PCAS. Utilization of 3-MPA during CPR could effectively improve the survival rate and prognosis of mice after CA, which may provide a novel strategy for CA/CPR treatment.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation after cardiac surgery: A two-year study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac surgery and to find predictors of survival.
   Design: A retrospective study with data obtained by chart review.
   Setting:A university hospital 24-bed cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU).
   Participants: Between 1993 and 1994, 4,968 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at the authors' hospital were studied.
   Interventions: None.
   Main results: One hundred thirteen of these patients (2.3%) were resuscitated. Seventy-nine patients (70%) survived to be discharged from the hospital. Significant predictors of survival were the time between admission to the ICU and initiation of CPR, CPR time, and creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB values.
   Conclusions: The incidence of CPR after cardiac surgery was 2.3% with no difference between valve surgery and CABG. Best results were achieved when arrhythmias or bleeding were the predisposing causes. Further studies have to be undertaken concerning long-term results and quality of life of the discharged patients. Copyright (C) 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company.

TI  - Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Associated With Low Cardiovascular Mortality With Contemporary Management Strategies
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background Youthful age has been considered the time of greatest risk for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), largely because of the possibility of sudden death. The last 2 decades have witnessed more reliable identification of at-risk patients and utilization of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for prevention of sudden death, and other contemporary treatment options. Whether such management advances have significantly altered the considerable mortality rate for young HCM patients remains unresolved.
   Methods and Results We studied long-term outcome in 474 consecutive HCM patients between 7 and 29 years of age presenting at 2 referral institutions. Over 7.15.1 years of follow-up (6.0 [3.0, 10.0]), 452 patients (95%) survived, with 95% experiencing no or mild symptoms. HCM-related death occurred in 18 patients (3%; 0.54%/y): arrhythmic sudden death (n=12), progressive heart failure and heart transplant complications (n=5), or postoperatively (n=1). In contrast, aborted life-threatening events occurred in 63 other high-risk patients (13%) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interventions for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (n=31), resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (n=20), or heart transplant for advanced heart failure (n=12), 1.8%/y, 3-fold higher than HCM mortality. Five- and 10-year survival (considering only HCM deaths) was high (97% and 94%, respectively), virtually identical to that reported in middle-aged adult HCM patients (98% and 94%, P=0.23).
   Conclusions In a large hospital-based cohort of young HCM patients, representing an age group considered at greatest risk, low mortality rates can be achieved with the application of contemporary cardiovascular treatment strategies, largely because of reliable identification of high-risk patients who benefited from implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for sudden death prevention, thereby creating the opportunity for extended longevity and good quality of life.

AB  - Already the major cause of mortality in the United States, cardiovascular emergencies will become increasingly prevalent in the future as the geriatric population doubles. This article discusses five cardiovascular emergencies: acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, dysrythmias, aortic dissection, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The discussion focuses on the differences in presentation, management, and outcomes that characterize each disease amongst the elderly As a rule, the elderly have significantly worse outcomes than younger patients.

TI  - A Suprainstitutional Network for Remote Extracorporeal Life Support A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - JACC-HEART FAILURE
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate patient outcome within the Dusseldorf Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) Network, a suprainstitutional network for rapid-response remote ECLS and to define survival-based predictors.
   BACKGROUND Mobile venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vaECMO) used for ECLS has become a treatment option for a patient population with an otherwise fatal prognosis. However, outcome data remain scarce and institutional standards required to manage these patients are still poorly defined.
   METHODS This retrospective cohort study analyzes the outcome of 115 patients consecutively treated between July 2011 and October 2014 within the Dusseldorf ECLS Network due to refractory circulatory failure.
   RESULTS Of the 115 patients (56 +/- 15 years of age, vaECMO initiation under cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] 77%, CPR duration 45 [range 5 to 90] min), 50 patients (44%) survived to primary discharge and 38 patients (33%) were alive after a median follow-up of 1.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 1.7). Thirty-seven (97%) of the long-term survivors showed a favorable neurological outcome. Risk factors associated with mortality during vaECMO were CPR duration (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.006; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.01) and ischemic stroke (HR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.52 to 4.56). Risk factors associated with mortality after vaECMO weaning were renal failure (HR: 6.60; 95% CI: 2.72 to 16.01) and sepsis (HR: 3.6; 95% CI:1.50 to 8.69). Visceral ischemia had a negative impact (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.84) whereas assist device implantation promoted successful vaECMO weaning (HR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.65 to 5.25). Further, 3 distinct risk groups with significant differences in survival could be identified, demonstrating that in patients with no or short CPR mortality was not conditioned by age, whereas in patients with prolonged CPR young age was associated with increased survival.
   CONCLUSIONS This study illustrates the implementation of a suprainstitutional ECLS Network. Further, our data suggest that mobile vaECMO is beneficial for a larger patient population than actually expected, especially regarding young patients presenting with prolonged CPR or patients regardless of age with no or short CPR.

TI  - A prospective study of patient-physician communication about resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively seriously ill patients' characteristics, perceptions, and preferences associated with discussing resuscitation (CPR) with their physicians.
   DESIGN: Prospective cohort.
   SETTING: Five academic medical centers.
   PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments who had not communicated with their physicians about CPR at admission to a hospital for life-threatening illness (n = 1288).
   MEASUREMENTS: Baseline surveys of patients' characteristics, health status, desires for participation in medical decision making, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Two month follow-up surveys of patients' communication of resuscitation preference. Chart reviews for clinical indicators.
   RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients communicated their resuscitation preference to their physician during a 2 month-period following hospital admission. Patients whose preference was to forgo CPR (odds ratio (OR) 2.9;(95% CT, 1.94.2)) and whose preference had changed from desiring to forgoing CPR (OR 1.6; (95% CI, 1.1-2.4)) were more likely to communicate their preference than patients who continued to prefer to receive CPR. However, only 50 % of patients who maintained a preference to forgo CPR communicated this over a 2-month period. Having an advance directive and remaining in the hospital at 2-month follow-up were also independently associated with communication, whereas patients' preference for participation in decision-making, health status, and prognostic estimate were not.
   CONCLUSIONS: Communication about resuscitation preferences occurred infrequently after hospital admission for a serious illness, even among patients wishing to forgo resuscitation. Factors such as declining quality of life, which were expected to be associated with communication, were not. An invitation to communicate about CPR preference is important after hospital admission for a serious illness. Novel approaches are needed to promote physician-patient discussions about resuscitation.

TI  - Experiences of family-witnessed cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital and its impact on life: An interview study with cardiac arrest survivors and their family members
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - AimTo explore experiences of cardiac arrest in-hospital and the impact on life for the patient who suffered the arrest and the family member who witnessed the resuscitation. BackgroundGuidelines advocate that the family should be offered the option to be present during resuscitation, but little is known about family-witnessed cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital and the impact on the patient and their family. DesignA qualitative design consisting of joint in-depth interviews with patients and family members. MethodsFamily interviews were conducted with seven patients and their eight corresponding family members (aged 19-85 years) 4-10 months after a family-witnessed in-hospital cardiac arrest. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The study followed the guidelines outlined in the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. ResultsThe participants felt insignificant and abandoned following the in-hospital cardiac arrest. Surviving patients and their close family members felt excluded, alone and abandoned throughout the care process; relationships, emotions and daily life were affected and gave rise to existential distress. Three themes and eight subordinate themes were identified: (1) the intrusion of death-powerless in the face of the fragility of life, highlights what it is like to suffer a cardiac arrest and to cope with an immediate threat to life; (2) being totally exposed-feeling vulnerable in the care relationship, describes how a lack of care from healthcare staff damaged trust; (3) learning to live again-making sense of an existential threat, pertaining to the family's reactions to a difficult event that impacts relationships but also leads to a greater appreciation of life and a positive view of the future. ConclusionSurviving and witnessing a cardiac arrest in-hospital is a critical event for everyone involved. Patients and family members are vulnerable in this situation and need to be seen and heard, both in the hospital and after hospital discharge. Consequently, healthcare staff need to show compassion and attend to the needs of the family, which involves continually assessing how family members are coping during the process, and providing support and information during and after resuscitation. Relevance to clinical practiceIt is important to provide support to family members who witness the resuscitation of a loved one in-hospital. Structured follow-up care is crucial for cardiac arrest survivors and their families. To promote person-centred care, nurses need interprofessional training on how to support family members during resuscitation, and follow-up care focusing on providing resources for multiple challenges faced by survivors (emotional, cognitive, physical) and families (emotional) is needed. Patient or public contributionIn-hospital cardiac arrest patients and family members were involved when designing the study.

TI  - Infrared pupillometry to help predict neurological outcome for patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest: a systematic review protocol
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background: Despite advances in resuscitation care, mortality rates following cardiac arrest (CA) remain high. Between one-quarter (in-hospital CA) and two-thirds (out of hospital CA) of patients admitted comatose to intensive care die of neurological injury. Neuroprognostication determines an informed and timely withdrawal of life sustaining treatment (WLST), sparing the patient unnecessary suffering, alleviating family distress and allowing a more utilitarian use of resources. The latest Resuscitation Council UK (2015) guidance on post-resuscitation care provides the current multi-modal neuroprognostication strategy to predict neurological outcome. Its modalities include neurological examination, neurophysiological tests, biomarkers and radiology. Despite each of the current strategy's predictive modalities exhibiting limitations, meta-analyses show that three, namely PLR (pupillary light reflex), CR (corneal reflex) and N20 SSEP (somatosensory-evoked potential), accurately predict poor neurological outcome with low false positive rates. However, the quality of evidence is low, reducing confidence in the strategy's results. While infrared pupillometry (IRP) is not currently used as a prognostication modality, it can provide a quantitative and objective measure of pupillary size and PLR, giving a definitive view of the second and third cranial nerve activity, a predictor of neurological outcome.
   Methods: The proposed study will test the hypothesis, "in those patients who remain comatose following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after CA, IRP can be used early to help predict poor neurological outcome". A comprehensive review of the evidence using a PRISMA-P (2015) compliant methodology will be underpinned by systematic searching of electronic databases and the two authors selecting and screening eligible studies using the Cochrane data extraction and assessment template. Randomised controlled trials and retrospective and prospective studies will be included, and the quality and strength of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
   Discussion: IRP requires rudimentary skill and is objective and repeatable. As a clinical prognostication modality, it may be utilised early, when the strategy's other modalities are not recommended. Corroboration in the evidence would promote early use of IRP and a reduction in ICU bed days.

TI  - Telemedicine for the detection and management of in-hospital and out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest: Status quo and quo vadis
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL PLUS: CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB  - Telemedicine has revolutionised healthcare by enabling the remote delivery of medical services through secure communication technologies. In cardiology, telemedicine has become invaluable for early diagnosis, emergency care, and chronic disease management, addressing challenges like cost and geographic barriers. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a leading cause of mortality, represents a potential area for telemedicine application, though evidence supporting its direct impact on survival remains limited. Despite resuscitation advancements, SCA survival remains under 5 %, primarily due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Emerging tools-such as wearable sensors, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence-show promise in early warning sign detection; however, most studies remain preliminary, and large-scale validation is lacking. In cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest, telemedicine supports real-time consultations with remote experts. It facilitates adherence to clinical protocols, reduces treatment delays, and integrates cognitive aids to optimize resuscitation efforts. However, existing trials have yielded mixed results, and questions remain regarding feasibility, staffing models, and effective integration during acute events. Telemedicine strengthens the "chain of survival" for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through telecommunicator cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), boosting bystander CPR rates and improving survival chances. Nevertheless, concerns about added delays, firstresponder coordination, and variability in system infrastructure remain critical barriers. Post-resuscitation, telemedicine networks enable evidence-based interventions such as targeted temperature management, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness in emergency settings. Moreover, remote monitoring of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators ensures timely care while reducing outpatient clinic burdens. Integrating artificial intelligence enhances telemedicine's potential by enabling personalized care and predictive analytics. However, limited physical examinations, technical issues, and data privacy concerns persist. Furthermore, restricted physical examinations, infrastructure limitations, and data privacy risks continue to hinder the broader adoption of telemedicine. While telemedicine holds potential to reduce mortality in high-risk scenarios like SCA, its current utility is constrained by technological, logistical, and systemic barriers. Continued research, targeted implementation strategies, and evidence-based integration into emergency care pathways are essential to realize its transformative promise.

TI  - Targeted simulation and education to improve cardiac arrest recognition and telephone assisted CPR in an emergency medical communication centre
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Recognition of cardiac arrest and prompt activation time by emergency medical dispatch are key process measures that have been associated with improved survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The aim of this study is to improve recognition of OHCA and time to initiation of telephone assisted chest compressions in an emergency medical communication centre (EMCC).
   Methods: A prospective, interventional study implementing targeted interventions in an EMCC. Interventions included: (1) lectures focusing on agonal breathing and interrogation strategy (2) simulation training (3) structured dispatcher feedback (4) web-based telephone assisted CPR training program. All ambulance-confirmed OHCA calls in the study period were assessed and relevant process and result measures were recorded pre- and post-intervention. Cardiac arrest was reported as (1) recognised, (2) not recognised or (3) delayed recognition.
   Results: We included 331 and 230 calls pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Recognition of cardiac arrest improved significantly after intervention (89 vs. 95%, p = 0.024). Delayed recognition was significantly reduced (21 vs. 6%, p > 0.001), as was misinterpretation of agonal breathing (25 vs. 10%, p < 0.001). Telephone assisted compressions increased (71% vs. 83%, p = 0.002) whereas bystander performed ventilations decreased after intervention (23% vs. 15%, p = 0.016). Time intervals for initiation of chest compression instructions (2.6 vs. 2.3 min, p = 0.042) and delivery of telephone assisted chest compressions (3.3 vs. 2.8 min, p = 0.015) were significantly shortened after intervention.
   Conclusion: Targeted simulation, education and feedback significantly improved recognition of OHCA and reduced time to first chest compression. Continuous measurement of key quality metrics can facilitate development of targeted education and training. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - EEG reactivity in neurologic prognostication in post-cardiac arrest patients: A narrative review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG-R) is a promising early predictor of arousal in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Despite recent guidelines advocating for the integration of EEG-R into the multimodal prognostication model, EEG-R testing methods remain heterogeneous across studies. While efforts towards standardization have been made to reduce interrater variability by the development of quantitative approaches and machine learning models, future validation studies are needed to increase clinical applicability. Furthermore, the specific neurophysiological mechanisms and neuroanatomical correlates underlying EEG-R are not fully understood. In this narrative review, we explore the value and possible mechanisms of EEG-R, focusing on post-cardiac arrest comatose patients. We aim to discuss the current standard of knowledge and future directions, as well as elucidate possible implications for patient care and research.

TI  - Return of spontaneous circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by pulmonary embolism using early point-of-care ultrasound and timely thrombolytic agent application: Two case reports
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Acute pulmonary embolism is a confirmed cause of up to 5% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 5%-13% of unexplained cardiac arrest in patients. However, the true incidence may be much higher, as pulmonary embolism is often clinically underdiagnosed. Thrombolytic therapy is a recognized therapy for pulmonary embolism-associated cardiac arrest but is not routinely recommended during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Therefore, clinicians should attempt to identify patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Many point-of care ultrasound protocols suggest diagnosis of pulmonary embolism for cardiac arrest patients. Case presentation: We describe two male patients (60 years and 66 years, respectively) who presented to the emergency department with cardiac arrest within a period of 1 week. With administration of point-of care ultrasound during the ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation in both patients, fibrinolytic therapy was initiated under suspicion of cardiac arrest caused by pulmonary embolism. Both patients had return of spontaneous circulation; however, only the second patient, who received fibrinolytic therapy relatively early, was discharged with a good outcome. In this report, we discussed how to diagnose and manage patients with cardiac arrest-associated pulmonary embolism with the help of point-of care ultrasound. We also discuss the different clinical outcomes of the two patients based on the experience of the clinicians and the timing of thrombolytic agent application. Conclusions: If acute pulmonary embolism is suspected in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we recommend prompt point-of care ultrasound examination. Point-of care ultrasound may help identify patients with pulmonary embolism during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, leading to immediate treatment, although the clinical outcomes may vary.

TI  - Rat model of asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest and resuscitation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Neurologic injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the main cause of the low survival rate and poor quality of life among patients who have experienced cardiac arrest. In the United States, as the American Heart Association reported, emergency medical services respond to more than 347,000 adults and more than 7,000 children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year. In-hospital cardiac arrest is estimated to occur in 9.7 per 1,000 adult cardiac arrests and 2.7 pediatric events per 1,000 hospitalizations. Yet the pathophysiological mechanisms of this injury remain unclear. Experimental animal models are valuable for exploring the etiologies and mechanisms of diseases and their interventions. In this review, we summarize how to establish a standardized rat model of asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest. There are four key focal areas: (1) selection of animal species; (2) factors to consider during modeling; (3) intervention management after return of spontaneous circulation; and (4) evaluation of neurologic function. The aim was to simplify a complex animal model, toward clarifying cardiac arrest pathophysiological processes. It also aimed to help standardize model establishment, toward facilitating experiment homogenization, convenient interexperimental comparisons, and translation of experimental results to clinical application.

TI  - Prearrest vital sign abnormalities are associated with adverse outcomes in pediatric ICU cardiac arrest: a get with the guidelines-resuscitation analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: We aimed to quantitatively describe vital sign abnormalities prior to pediatric IHCA and evaluate whether the severity of abnormalities was independently associated with survival. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using the American Heart Association's Get with The Guidelines-Resuscitation (R) registry, children with >= 1 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 2007 to 2022 with prearrest vital signs were included. Vital signs most proximate to CPR (10-120 min prior) were classified as abnormal (HR or RR >95th, SBP or DBP <5th percentile for age). Multivariable regression adjusted for age, illness category, prearrest conditions, and prearrest interventions assessed the associations between vital sign abnormalities and outcomes (primary: survival to hospital discharge, secondary: return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC]). Results: Of 2875 IHCA patients meeting inclusion criteria, 1790 (62.3 %) had at least one abnormal vital sign. Patients with vital sign abnormalities were older, had non-surgical illness categories, and higher prevalence of prearrest illnesses and interventions. Low SBP (<5%) was the vital sign with the lowest odds of survival to hospital discharge (aOR 0.56 [95 %CI 0.46-0.68], p < 0.01) and ROSC (aOR 0.63 [95 %CI 0.54-0.73], p < 0.01). There was a stepwise decrease in the adjusted odds of survival for each additional abnormal vital sign (1 vs 0: aOR 0.62 [95 %CI 0.51-0.76], p < 0.01; 2 vs 1: 0.72 [95 %CI 0.53-0.97] p = 0.03; 3 vs 2: 0.53 [95 %CI 0.33-0.86] p < 0.01). Conclusions: Prearrest vital sign abnormalities are common in pediatric ICU IHCA and independently associated with worse outcomes, emphasizing the need for prompt detection and intervention to improve outcomes.

TI  - Attitudes of 100 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to artificial ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - One hundred clinically stable outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were surveyed at home by respiratory nurse specialists (RNS) about their views towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and in hospital ventilation. Written information about COPD, CPR and ventilation was provided and consent obtained. The breathing problem-based quality-of-life questionnaire (BP-QoL) was completed. The following information was recorded: age, sex, spirometry, hospital admissions, and antidepressant and oxygen usage in the previous year. Patients were then asked to imagine a scenario in which they were admitted to hospital and their chest condition deteriorated in spite of standard treatment. 'Having reached that stage would you wish to have noninvasive ventilation (NIV), invasive ventilation (IV) or CPR?' Three months later patients were asked to complete a postal patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Of 100 patients 41 were male and the mean age was 74.1 years. Fifty four patients had a FEV1 < 40% and 37 had a FEV1 between 40 and 59% predicted. Twenty-four patients were on long-term oxygen therapy, eight had taken antidepressants and 56 had been admitted to hospital in the previous year. Forty-eight patients wanted all additional treatments to be attempted if needed and 12 wanted none. Nineteen patients said 'no' for CPR and 10 said 'no' for CPR and IV. There was no significant statistical difference between the groups answering 'yes' or 'no'. Seventy-six per cent of patient satisfaction questionnaires were returned. All patients were satisfied with the way they had been approached and the information received, and 98% of them thought that this issue should be discussed with all patients. Conclusion: Attitudes towards resuscitation can be discussed with COPD patients by RNS without causing distress. Attitudes to resuscitation could not be predicted from parameters of respiratory disease severity or age.

TI  - Outcomes of patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest transported to an ECMO centre compared with transport to non-ECMO centres
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To compare the outcomes of patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) transported to a hospital that provides extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) with patients transported to hospitals without ECPR capability. Design, setting: Retrospective review of patient care records in a pre-hospital and hospital setting. Participants: Adult patients with OHCA who left the scene and arrived with cardiopulmonary resuscitation in progress at 16 hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, between January 2016 and December 2019. Intervention: For selected patients transported to the ECPR centre, initiation of ECMO. Main outcome measures: Survival to hospital discharge and 12-month quality of life. Results: There were 223 eligible patients during the study period. Of 49 patients transported to the ECPR centre, 23 were commenced on ECMO. Of these, survival to hospital with good neurological recovery (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] score 1/2) occurred in 4/23 patients. Four other patients developed return of spontaneous circulation in the ECPR centre before cannulation of whom one survived, giving overall good functional outcome at 12 months survival of 5/49 (10.2%). There were 174 patients transported to the 15 non-ECPR centres and 3/174 (2%) had good functional outcome at 12 months. After adjustment for baseline differences, the odds ratio for good neurological outcome after transport to an ECPR centre compared with a non-ECPR centre was 4.63 (95% CI, 0.97- 22.11; P = 0.055). Conclusion: The survival rate of patients with refractory OHCA transported to an ECPR centre remains low. Outcomes in larger cities might be improved with shorter scene times and additional ECPR centres that would provide for earlier initiation of ECMO.

TI  - Thrombolysis and cardiac arrest
T2  - BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) is a serious clinical condition that might be responsible in many cases for death, in other at least for development of irreversible multiple organ dysfunctions. During and after the CA a significant coagulopathy develops causing a decrease in proper tissue perfusion even if an early return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved (no-reflow phenomenon). Administration of thrombolytics can solve the problem by destructing the blood clot in both macrocirculation and microcirculation. Results of some clinical trials proving an effectiveness of thrombolysis were published in the literature. Generally, it was done by describing its positive influence on some important clinical outcome measures (24hour survival, number of hospital admissions, better neurological status etc.) without significant increase in the number of bleeding complications. However, recent pivotal evidence based medicine (EBM) trial represented by TROICA study did not confirm the expected positive results. Because of that and also for other reasons (cost, fear of adverse effects, little practice etc.) thrombolysis, although theoretically promising therapeutical intervention, is not overly recommended and used in routine clinical practice in both out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings (Fig. 2, Tab. 4, Ref. 24).

TI  - Practice Patterns and Trends in Temperature Control After Cardiac Arrest: A Multi-Specialty Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background/Objectives: Temperature control after cardiac arrest remains a recommended component of post-cardiac arrest care, yet substantial practice variability persists. Conflicting evidence regarding optimal temperature targets and mixed interpretations of recent trials, such as TTM2, may contribute to inconsistent bedside implementation. Understanding physician knowledge, attitudes, and practice patterns is essential for aligning post-cardiac arrest management with evolving evidence. This study aimed to characterize international physician perceptions of temperature control, patterns of use, understanding of neurologic injury, and the influence of emerging literature. Methods: A 39-item web-based survey was developed through iterative expert review and pilot testing and disseminated to members of critical care, neurology, and emergency medicine societies between September 2021 and January 2022. The instrument assessed demographics, temperature control practices, interpretation of new literature, and post-cardiac arrest management. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics in R Studio, with proportions reported for categorical variables and mode responses for ranked questions. Results: Among 501 respondents, 471 (94%) completed the survey. Most were attending-level physicians (73%), primarily practicing intensive care medicine (75%), and based in academic centers (60%). Targeted temperature management (TTM) was commonly initiated by the admitting intensivist (66%), most often because guidelines recommended it (67%). The most influential factors driving initiation were institutional protocols (21%), perceived neurologic prognosis (17%), and arrest etiology (14%). The most frequently selected temperature target was 36 degrees C (44%). Awareness of the TTM2 trial was high (70%), though only 31% reported altering their practice in response. Neurologists were more likely to individualize temperature targets and select lower temperatures, while physicians caring for higher cardiac arrest volumes also favored lower targets. Community clinicians more commonly selected lower temperature targets compared with those in academic settings. Conclusions: Substantial heterogeneity exists in the practice and rationale for temperature control after cardiac arrest. Physician specialty, cardiac arrest volume, and local practice environment influence the temperature target selection and attitudes toward emerging evidence. Despite awareness of new data, institutional protocols remain the dominant factor guiding implementation. Standardized, evidence-based institutional pathways may help reduce practice variability and promote consistent post-cardiac arrest care.

TI  - Long-term changes in depth distribution and phenology of four North Atlantic plankton species
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Plankton are highly sensitive to climate change, and understanding their shifts in behaviour, physiology, phenology, and biogeography is important for anticipating changes in ecosystem services. This study used a recently developed ecological niche model to reanalyze data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey using 8 environmental variables to build, for the first time, a CPR-based 4D data set (longitude x latitude x depth x day) of plankton abundance. First, we analyzed spatio-temporal changes in the abundance of 4 plankton species daily from 1958 to 2022: 2 diatoms (Ephemera planamembranacea and Odontella sinensis) and 2 calanoid copepods (Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus). We validated our new CPR-based 4D data set with existing in situ data and found that modeled spatio-temporal changes in abundance reproduced observations well. Then, we showed pronounced phenological and biogeographical shifts for the 4 species. Long-term latitudinal shifts in C. finmarchicus and E. planamembranacea were observed and correlated with the Atlantic subarctic gyre state, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Our results also revealed a prominent positive influence of temperature on long-term changes in the abundance of E. planamembranacea, O. sinensis and C. helgolandicus, whereas they identified a negative influence of temperature on C. finmarchicus. Interestingly, our modeled data suggest a rise in the abundance of C. finmarchicus at greater depths during peak seasons, although this depth adjustment in response to changing conditions is unlikely to overcome the overall surface decline of the species.

TI  - Pancreatic involvement in patients with inborn errors of metabolism
T2  - ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES
AB  - Background Repeated inflammation of the pancreas can cause pancreatitis or diabetes. It is well recognized that the organic acidemias may be complicated by pancreatitis but less recognized are other metabolic disorders in which pancreatitis can occur. This study shows that long-term follow-up of patients with various metabolic disorders in Korea revealed several with episodes of isolated pancreatitis or diabetes concomitantly with pancreatitis. Results and discussion In this study, two patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), two with propionic acidemia (PPA), one with fatty acid oxidation disorder (FAOD), and one with hyperornithinemia, gyrate atrophy, and juvenile onset diabetes mellitus (DM) were clinically followed for up to 10 - 21 years. Two Korean siblings with MMA showed recurrent pancreatitis from the age of 15 and 19, respectively. The frequency of admission due to pancreatitis was up to 11 times. One patient with MMA developed diabetes mellitus at the age of 20. The other patient with MMA developed recurrent pancreatitis at 4 years and diabetes at 8 years of age. One of the patients with PPA presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. The other PPA patient died of cardiac arrest at age 10. The patient with FAOD presented with pancreatitis at 10 years and died at the age of 15 years due to cardiac arrest. A 35-year-old woman with hyperornithinemia/gyrate atrophy was diagnosed with juvenile onset diabetes at the age of 7 years. No pancreatitis occurred during the follow-up period. Conclusions We conclude that various metabolic disorders can trigger acute or chronic pancreatitis. Proper and prompt multidisciplinary management of metabolic derangement is crucial for preventing pancreatic damage. Further clinical and investigational studies are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus in patients with inborn errors in metabolism.

TI  - Cardiocerebral Resuscitation Is Associated With Improved Survival and Neurologic Outcome from Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest in Elders
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background:
   Recent studies have shown that a new emergency medical services (EMS) protocol for treating patients who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR), significantly improves survival compared to standard advanced life support (ALS). However, due to their different physiology, it is unclear if all elders, or any subsets of elders who are OHCA victims, would benefit from the CCR protocol.
   Objectives:
   The objectives of this analysis were to compare survival by age group for patients receiving CCR and ALS, to evaluate their neurologic outcome, and to determine what other factors affect survival in the subset of patients who do receive CCR.
   Methods:
   An analysis was performed of 3,515 OHCAs occurring between January 2005 and September 2008 in the Save Hearts in Arizona Registry. A total of 1,024 of these patients received CCR. Pediatric patients and arrests due to drowning, respiratory, or traumatic causes were excluded. The registry included data from 62 EMS agencies, some of which instituted CCR. Outcome measures included survival to hospital discharge and cerebral performance category (CPC) scores. Logistic regression evaluated outcomes in patients who received CCR versus standard ALS across age groups, adjusted for known potential confounders, including bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), witnessed arrest, EMS dispatch-to-arrival time, ventricular fibrillation (Vfib), and agonal respirations on EMS arrival. Predictors of survival evaluated included age, sex, location, bystander CPR, witnessed arrest, Vfib/ventricular tachycardia (Vtach), response time, and agonal breathing, based on bivariate results. Backward stepwise selection was used to confirm predictors of survival. These predictors were then analyzed with logistic regression by age category per 10 years of age.
   Results:
   Individuals who received CCR had better outcomes across age groups. The increase in survival for the subgroup with a witnessed Vfib was most prominent on those < 40 years of age (3.7% for standard ALS patients vs. 19% for CCR patients, odds ratio [OR] = 5.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.82 to 19.26). This mortality benefit declined with age until the >= 80 years age group, which regained the benefit (1.8% vs. 4.6%, OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.10 to 5.97). Neurologic outcomes were also better in the patients who received CCR (OR = 6.64, 95% CI = 1.31 to 32.8). Within the subgroup that received CCR, the factors most predictive of improved survival included witnessed arrest, initial rhythm of Vfib/Vtach, agonal respirations upon arrival, EMS response time, and age. Neurologic outcome was not adversely affected by age.
   Conclusions:
   Cardiocerebral resuscitation is associated with better survival from OHCA in most age groups. The majority of patients in all age groups who survived to hospital discharge and who could be reached for follow-up had good neurologic outcome. Among patients receiving CCR for OHCA, witnessed arrest, Vfib/Vtach, agonal respirations, and early response time are significant predictors of survival, and these do not change significantly based on age.

TI  - No fate but what we make: a case of full recovery after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - An 80 years old man suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after arrival to his local health department. Basic Life Support was started promptly and nine minutes later, on evaluation by an Advanced Life Support team, the victim was defibrillated with a 200J shock. When orotracheal intubation was attempted, masseter muscle contraction was noticed: on revaluation, the victim had pulse and spontaneous breathing.
   Thirty minutes later, the patient had been transferred to an emergency department. As he complained of chest pain, the ECG showed a ST segment depression in leads V4 to V6 and laboratorial tests showed cardiac troponine I slightly elevated. A coronary angiography was performed urgently: significant left main plus three vessel coronary artery disease was disclosed.
   Eighteen hours after the cardiac arrest, a quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting operation was undertaken. During surgery, a fresh thrombus was removed from the middle left anterior descendent artery. Post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged seven days after the procedure. Twenty four months later, he remains asymptomatic.
   In this case, the immediate call for the Advanced Life Support team, prompt basic life support and the successful defibrillation, altogether, contributed for the full recovery. Furthermore, the swiftness in the detection and treatment of the acute reversible cause (myocardial ischemia in this case) was crucial for long-term prognosis.

TI  - The role of T-type calcium channels in the subiculum: to burst or not to burst?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB  - Several studies suggest that voltage-gated calcium currents are involved in generating high frequency burst firing in the subiculum, but the exact nature of these currents remains unknown. Here, we used selective pharmacology, molecular and genetic approaches to implicate Cav3.1-containing T-channels in subicular burst firing, in contrast to several previous reports discounting T-channels as major contributors to subicular neuron physiology. Furthermore, pharmacological antagonism of T-channels, as well as global deletion of CaV3.1 isoform, completely suppressed development of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1-subiculum, but not in the CA3-CA1 pathway. Our results indicate that excitability and synaptic plasticity of subicular neurons relies heavily on T-channels. Hence, T-channels may be a promising new drug target for different cognitive deficits.

TI  - Automatic external defibrillator (AED) location - seconds that save lifes
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Introduction and objectiveSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a significant cause of adult mortality, categorized into in-hospital (IHCA) and out-of-hospital (OHCA). Survival in OHCA depends on early diagnosis, alerting Emergency Medical Service (EMS), high-quality bystander resuscitation, and prompt Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) use. Accelerating technological progress supports faster AED retrieval and use, but there are barriers in real-life OHCA situations. The study assesses 6th-year medical students' ability to locate AEDs using smartphones, revealing challenges and proposing solutions.Material & MethodsThe study was conducted in 2022-2023 at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland. Respondents completed a survey on AED knowledge and characteristics, followed by a task to find the nearest AED using their own smartphones. As common sources did not list the University AEDs, respondents were instructed to locate the nearest AED outside the research site.ResultsA total of 300 6th-year medical students took part in the study. Only 3.3% had an AED locating app. Only 32% of students claimed to know where the AED nearest to their home is. All 300 had received AED training, and almost half had been witness to a resuscitation. Out of the 291 medical students who completed the AED location task, the median time to locate the nearest AED was 58 s. Most participants (86.6%) found the AED within 100 s, and over half (53%) did so in under 1 min.ConclusionsNational registration of AEDs should be mandatory. A unified source of all AEDs mapped should be created or added to existing ones. With a median of under one minute, searching for AED by a bystander should be considered as a point in the chain of survival.

TI  - Adrenaline to improve survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the PARAMEDIC2 RCT
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: Adrenaline has been used as a treatment for cardiac arrest for many years, despite uncertainty about its effects on long-term outcomes and concerns that it may cause worse neurological outcomes.
   Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate the effects of adrenaline on survival and neurological outcomes, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of adrenaline use.
   Design: This was a pragmatic, randomised, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, parallel-group superiority trial and economic evaluation. Costs are expressed in Great British pounds and reported in 2016/17 prices.
   Setting: This trial was set in five NHS ambulance services in England and Wales.
   Participants: Adults treated for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included. Patients were ineligible if they were pregnant, if they were aged < 16 years, if the cardiac arrest had been caused by anaphylaxis or life-threatening asthma, or if adrenaline had already been given.
   Interventions: Participants were randomised to either adrenaline (1 mg) or placebo in a 1 : 1 allocation ratio by the opening of allocation-concealed treatment packs.
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was survival to 30 days. The secondary outcomes were survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, survival at 3, 6 and 12 months, neurological outcomes and health-related quality of life through to 6 months. The economic evaluation assessed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. Participants, clinical teams and those assessing patient outcomes were masked to the treatment allocation.
   Results: From December 2014 to October 2017, 8014 participants were assigned to the adrenaline (n = 4015) or to the placebo (n = 3999) arm. At 30 days, 130 out of 4012 participants (3.2%) in the adrenaline arm and 94 out of 3995 (2.4%) in the placebo arm were alive (adjusted odds ratio for survival 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.97). For secondary outcomes, survival to hospital admission was higher for those receiving adrenaline than for those receiving placebo (23.6% vs. 8.0%; adjusted odds ratio 3.83, 95% confidence interval 3.30 to 4.43). The rate of favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was not significantly different between the arms (2.2% vs. 1.9%; adjusted odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.68). The pattern of improved survival but no significant improvement in neurological outcomes continued through to 6 months. By 12 months, survival in the adrenaline arm was 2.7%, compared with 2.0% in the placebo arm (adjusted odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.92). An adjusted subgroup analysis did not identify significant interactions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adrenaline was estimated at 1,693,003 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained over the first 6 months after the cardiac arrest event and 81,070 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained over the lifetime of survivors. Additional economic analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for adrenaline at 982,880 pound per percentage point increase in overall survival and 377,232 pound per percentage point increase in neurological outcomes over the first 6 months after the cardiac arrest.
   Limitations: The estimate for survival with a favourable neurological outcome is imprecise because of the small numbers of patients surviving with a good outcome.
   Conclusions: Adrenaline improved long-term survival, but there was no evidence that it significantly improved neurological outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year exceeds the threshold of 20,000-30,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year usually supported by the NHS.
   Future work: Further research is required to better understand patients' preferences in relation to survival and neurological outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and to aid interpretation of the trial findings from a patient and public perspective.Y

TI  - Increasing neurologically intact survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest among elderly: Singapore Experience
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Objectives: With more elderly presenting with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCAs) globally, neurologically intact survival (NIS) should be the aim of resuscitation. We aimed to study the trend of OHCA amongst elderly in a large Asian registry to identify if age is independently associated with NIS and factors associated with NIS. Methods: All adult OHCAs aged >= 18 years attended by emergency medical services (EMS) from April 2010 to December 2019 in Singapore was extracted from the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) registry. Cases pronounced dead at scene, non-EMS transported, traumatic OHCAs and OHCAs in ambulances were excluded. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared across four age categories (18-64, 65-79, 80-89, >= 90). Multivariable logistic regression analysis determined the factors associated with NIS. Results: 19,519 eligible cases were analyzed. OHCA incidence increased with age almost doubling in octogenarians (from 312/100,000 in 2011 to 652/100,000 in 2019) and tripling in those >= 90 years (from 458/100,000 in 2011 to 1271/100,000 in 2019). The proportion of patients with NIS improved over time for the 18-64, 65-79- and 80-89-years age groups, with the greatest improvement in the youngest group. NIS decreased with each increasing year of age and minute of response time. NIS increased in the arrests of presumed cardiac etiology, witnessed and bystander CPR. Conclusions: Survival with good outcomes has increased even amongst the elderly. Regardless of age, NIS is possible with good-quality CPR, highlighting its importance. End-of-life planning is a complex yet necessary decision that requires qualitative exploration with elderly, their families and care providers.

TI  - Salvianolic Acid B Improves Postresuscitation Myocardial and Cerebral Outcomes in a Murine Model of Cardiac Arrest: Involvement of Nrf2 Signaling Pathway
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
AB  - Survival and outcome of cardiac arrest (CA) are dismal despite improvements in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been investigated for its cardioprotective properties in cardiac remodeling and ischemic heart disease, but less is known about its role in CA. The aim of this study was to learn whether Sal B improves cardiac and neurologic outcomes after CA/CPR in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to eight minutes of CA induced by an intravenous injection of potassium chloride (KCl), followed by CPR. After 30 seconds of CPR, mice were blindly randomized to receive either Sal B (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (normal saline) intravenously. Hemodynamic variables and indices of left ventricular function were determined before CA and within three hours after CPR, the early postresuscitation period. Sal B administration resulted in a remarkable decrease in the time required for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in animals that successfully resuscitated compared to the vehicle-treated mice. Myocardial performance, including cardiac output and left ventricular systolic (dp/dt(max)) and diastolic (dp/dt(min)) function, was clearly ameliorated within three hours of ROSC in the Sal B-treated mice. Moreover, Sal B inhibited CA/CPR-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and preserved mitochondrial morphology and function. Mechanistically, Sal B dramatically promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation through the downregulation of Keap1, which resulted in the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 and NQO1, thereby counteracted the oxidative damage in response to CA/CPR. The aforementioned antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects of Sal B were impaired in the setting of gene silencing of Nrf2 with siRNA in vitro model. These improvements were associated with better neurological function and increased survival rate (75% vs. 40%,p<0.05) up to 72 hours postresuscitation. Our findings suggest that the administration of Sal B improved cardiac function and neurological outcomes in a murine model of CA via activating the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CA.

TI  - Attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction in a ventricular fibrillation swine model of cardiac arrest treated with carbon monoxide
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects over 360,000 adults in the United States each year with a 50-80% mortality. Despite aggressive supportive care and use of targeted temperature management, half of adults do not live to hospital discharge and nearly one-third of survivors have significant neurologic injury. Development of neuroprotective therapeutics is critical to improving outcomes. One promising readily available agent that has shown benefit is carbon monoxide (CO). Methods: We utilize a swine model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest to assess the therapeutic effect of CO on cellular measures. All animals underwent VF arrest followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation until achievement of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or the 20 min mark. One hour following ROSC, animals were randomized to the Cardiac Arrest group (VF alone) versus the CO group (VF treated with CO). Animals in the CO group were administered low dose CO of 200 ppm for two hours. At three hours post-ROSC period, all animals were euthanized for tissue and blood collection for mitochondrial respiration (cortical and hippocampal tissue) and the downstream biomolecular analysis. Results: The primary findings were an overall improvement in mitochondrial respiration and ATP concentrations in the brain from animals in the CO group. In addition, we also report the use of cell-free DNA as a biomarker to localize the site of tissue injury and our non-invasive optical monitoring Conclusions: CO may be a potential therapeutic to attenuate cellular injury in post-arrest.

TI  - Community Initiatives to Promote Basic Life Support Implementation-A Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Early intervention of bystanders (the first links of the chain of survival) have been shown to improve survival and good neurological outcomes of patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Many initiatives have been implemented to increase the engagement of communities in early basic life support (BLS) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially of lay people with no duty to respond. A better knowledge of the most effective initiatives might help improve survival and health system organization. Aim of the scoping review: To assess the impact of specific interventions involving lay communities on bystander BLS rates and other consistent clinical outcomes, and to identify relevant knowledge gaps. Methods: This scoping review was part of the continuous evidence evaluation process of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), and was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We performed a literature search using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until 1 February 2021. The screening process was conducted based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and for each included study, we performed data extraction focusing on the type of intervention implemented, and the impact of these interventions on the specific OHCAs outcomes. Results: Our search strategy identified 19 eligible studies, originating mainly from the USA (47.4%) and Denmark (21%). The type of intervention included in 57.9% of cases was a community CPR training program, in 36.8% bundled interventions, and in 5.3% mass-media campaigns. The most commonly reported outcome for OHCAs was bystander CPR rate (94.7%), followed by survival to hospital discharge (36.8%), proportion of people trained (31.6%), survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome (21%), and Return of Spontaneous Circulation (10.5%). Community training programs and bundled interventions improved bystander CPR in most of the included studies. Conclusion: Based on the results of our scoping review, we identified the potential benefit of community initiatives, such as community training in BLS, even as part of bundled intervention, in order to improve bystander CPR rates and patient outcomes.

TI  - The Association of Health Status and Providing Consent to Continued Participation in an Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest Trial Performed Under Exception From Informed Consent
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - ObjectivesEmergency medical research performed under federal regulation 21 CFR 50.24 provides a means to protect human subjects and investigate novel time-sensitive treatments. Although prospective individual consent is not required for studies conducted under this regulation, consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR) or the patient at the earliest feasible opportunity is required to obtain short- and long-term outcome data. The objective of this study was to determine which demographic, cardiac arrest, and patient outcome characteristics predicted the likelihood of obtaining informed consent following enrollment under exception from informed consent in a multicenter cardiac arrest study.
   MethodsThis investigation was an analysis of data collected during a multisite, randomized, controlled, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest clinical trial performed under 21 CFR 50.24. Research personnel attempted to obtain informed consent from LARs and subjects for medical records review of primary outcome data, as well as consent for neurologic outcome assessments up to 1year post-cardiac arrest. Hospital discharge and neurologic status were obtained from public records and/or medical records up until the time consent was formally denied, in accordance with federal regulations and guidance. Local institutional review boards also allowed medical records review for cases where consent was neither obtained nor declined despite multiple consent attempts. Patient demographic, cardiac arrest, and clinical outcome characteristics were analyzed in univariate multinomial regression models, with consent status (obtained, denied, neither obtained nor denied) as the dependent variable. A multivariate multinomial logistic regression was then performed. An exploratory secondary analysis following the same process was performed after assigning patients who neither consented nor declined to the declined consent group.
   <sec id="acem12613-sec-0003"> ResultsAmong a total study population of 1,655 cardiac arrest subjects, 457 were transported and had consent attempted (27.6%). The survival status and neurologic function at the time of hospital discharge were known in 440 of 457 (96%) subjects. In the multivariate analysis, initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) and survival with good neurologic outcome were strong predictors of obtaining consent (odds ratio [OR]=3.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.73 to 5.75; OR=7.64, 95% CI=2.28 to 25.63, respectively). The exploratory secondary analysis also showed initial rhythm of VF/VT and survival with good neurologic outcome as strong predictors of obtaining consent (OR=1.86, 95% CI=1.17 to 2.95; OR=4.52, 95% CI=2.21 to 9.26, respectively).
   Conclusions Initial arrest rhythm and survival with good neurologic outcome were highly predictive of obtaining consent in this cardiac arrest trial. This phenomenon could result in underrepresentation of outcome data in the study arm with the worse outcome and represents a significant potential confounder in studies performed under 21 CFR 50.24. Future revisions to the exception from informed consent regulations should allow access to critical survival data recorded as part of standard documentation, regardless of patient consent status.

TI  - GLOBAL BRAIN ISCHEMIA - REPRODUCIBLE MONKEY MODEL
T2  - STROKE
AB  - A monkey model was developed with 16 min global brain ischemia (GBI) resulting in reproducible, severe, permanent functional neurologic deficit with long term (7 days) postischemic (PI) survival made possible by standardized intensive care with 24 h coverage by trained personnel. Quantitated neurologic deficit (ND) and brain histopathological examinations were developed. GBI (15 min) resulted in rapid recovery with 12-24 h PI without residual neurologic sequelae. GBI (20 min) caused severe neurologic deficit and within 4 days PI, a delayed Cushing response eventually leading to cardiac arrest. GBI (16 min) resulted in severe neurologic deficit (monkeys unable to sit, stand, walk or feed themselves), but with long term survival. Brain histopathological analyses revealed a combination of cortical and brainstem lesions. Most severe changes were observed in the occipital (calcarine) cortex with less severe damage in the frontal and temporal regions. Oculomotor nuclei and medial longitudinal fasciculus in the midbrain were regularly affected. With this model the efficacy of promising therapies in terms of clinically relevant variables can be tested.

TI  - From asymptomatic adult patient to cardiopulmonary resuscitation - treatment of ALCAPA with total arterial myocardial revascularisation and mitral valve repair
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundAnomalous left coronary artery originating from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), is a unique congenital anomaly, comprising only 0.24-0.46% of all congenital cardiac anomalies. Late presentations, ranging from asymptomatic cases to sudden cardiac arrest, are exceptionally rare. This unique case highlights the complexity of managing ALCAPA in adulthood and underscores the necessity of a comprehensive surgical approach addressing both coronary and valvular issues.PresentationA 34-year-old female patient, who had been diagnosed with ALPACA in her early childhood, suffered sudden cardiac arrest at work, followed by out-of-hospital resuscitation. The patient had been followed-up regularly until adolescence, however, she had refused surgery. In the diagnostic work-up following successful resuscitation severe mitral valve regurgitation was additionally revealed. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgery, involving coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), using bilateral internal mammary arteries, and mitral valve repair, with an excellent postsurgical result. At 16-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and quality of life had significantly improved.ConclusionThis rare case initially presented as silent myocardial ischemia, resulting in reduced left ventricular function and secondary mitral incompetence. Surgical treatment of ALCAPA in adults poses greater challenges and a higher risk than in children. CABG procedure offers an excellent prognostic therapeutic strategy, since this procedure is a routine in adult cardiac surgery.

TI  - Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Secretome and Its Key Bioactive Metabolites Induce Long-Term Neuroprotection After Traumatic Brain Injury in Mice
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB  - The severe and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) highlight the urgent need for effective neuroprotective therapies. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show promise in TBI treatment through their secretome (conditioned media, CM). A low-molecular-weight (<700 Da) CM fraction with neuroprotective effects comparable to total CM after acute brain injury in vitro is previously identified. Here, it is aimed at identifying key bioactive factors, reconstituting them into a synthetic cocktail (SYNT), and evaluating its efficacy in TBI models. Metabolomic profiling identified three prostaglandins and kynurenine, which are used to create SYNT. The SYNT formulation reduced cell death, neuronal damage, and induced protective gene expression changes associated with neuronal protection and microglia modulation toward beneficial phenotype after TBI in vitro. In vivo, SYNT conferred similar long-term functional benefits as CM, improving sensorimotor function up to 6 months and memory preservation at 4 months compared to saline-treated animals, though only CM reduced contusion volume at 5 months. Both treatments modulated neuroinflammation, evidenced by reduced microglial activation and astrogliosis in the pericontusional tissue at 6 months. These findings demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of MSC-secretome treatment in TBI and highlight prostaglandins and kynurenine as key mediators of this response. The findings lay the groundwork for developing a standardized, cell-free therapeutic strategy for TBI based on MSC derivatives.

TI  - A REVIEW OF CHEST COMPRESSION INTERRUPTIONS DURING OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST AND STRATEGIES FOR THE FUTURE
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: It has been known for many years that interrupting chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) leads directly to negative outcomes. Interruptions in chest compressions occur for a variety of reasons, including provider fatigue and switching of compressors, performance of ventilations, placement of invasive airways, application of CPR devices, pulse and rhythm determinations, vascular access placement, and patient transfer to the ambulance. Despite significant resuscitation guideline changes in the last decade, several studies have shown that chest compressions are still frequently interrupted or poorly executed during OHCA resuscitations. Indeed, the American Heart Association has made great strides to improve outcomes by placing a greater emphasis on uninterrupted chest compressions. As highly trained health care providers, why do we still interrupt chest compressions? And are any of these interruptions truly necessary? Objectives: This article aims to review the clinical effects of both high-quality chest compressions and the effects that interruptions during chest compressions have clinically on patient outcomes. Discussion: The causes of chest compression interruptions are explored from both provider and team perspectives. Current and future methods are introduced that may prompt the provider to reduce unnecessary interruptions during chest compressions. Conclusions: New and future technologies may provide promising results, but the greatest benefit will always be a well-directed, organized, and proactive team of providers performing excellent-quality and continuous chest compressions during CPR.

TI  - Quantitative effects of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices in rural American emergency medical services: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundEmergency medical service agencies increasingly utilize medical devices which perform external chest compressions during cardiac arrest. Due to the unique staffing and budget considerations of the rural emergency medical services environment, an investigation of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this setting is warranted. Studying the effects of new technologies in the rural environment promotes improvement of the standard of rural prehospital care. This study evaluated the effect of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation use on rural out-of-hospital cardiac arrest performance measures.MethodsFive hundred eighty-five rural cardiac arrests were assessed from National Emergency Medical Services Information System 2017-2019 data. Using both linear and logistic multivariate regression analysis, the effect of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the incidence of a return of spontaneous circulation, the first defibrillation interval, and the first cardiac epinephrine administration interval was assessed.ResultsIn rural cardiac arrest with initial presentation of a shockable rhythm, the use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices delayed initial defibrillation by 21.5% (p < 0.05). A 15.1% (p < 0.05) delay in first administration of epinephrine was also found when mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation was used. Incidence of return of spontaneous circulation was unchanged between manual and mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation conditions.ConclusionsCurrent rural mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation device use can have a negative effect on prompt delivery of vital interventions. Our findings suggest that improvements to equipment training may help remedy improper utilization of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices. Delaying application of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices until time-sensitive interventions are complete may result in a better standard of care. Proper use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices may help to overcome inherent difficulties faced by rural prehospital clinicians.

A1  - Epidural & Position Trial Collabor
TI  - A multicentre, randomised controlled trial of position during the late stages of labour in nulliparous women with an epidural: clinical effectiveness and an economic evaluation (BUMPES)
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: Epidural analgesia leads to increased risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (IVD). There is debate about whether or not posture in second-stage labour influences the incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth (SVB).
   Objectives: In nulliparous women with epidural analgesia, does a policy of adopting an 'upright position' throughout second-stage labour increase the incidence of SVB compared with a policy of adopting a 'lying-down' position?
   Design: Two-arm randomised controlled trial.
   Setting: Maternity units in England and Wales.
   Participants: Nulliparous women aged >= 16 years, at >= 37 weeks' gestation with singleton cephalic presentation and intended SVB, in second-stage labour with an epidural providing effective pain relief.
   Interventions: (1) Upright position to maintain the pelvis in as vertical a plane as possible; and (2) lying-down position to maintain the pelvis in as horizontal a plane as possible.
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was incidence of SVB. Secondary outcomes included augmentation, interventions to maintain blood pressure, duration of labour, episiotomy, genital tract trauma, post-partum haemorrhage, maternal satisfaction, neonatal metabolic acidosis, 5-minute Apgar score of < 4, resuscitation at birth and admission to neonatal unit. At 1 year for (1) women: urinary or faecal incontinence, dyspareunia and health-related quality of life; (2) for infants: major morbidity. A cost-consequences analysis with a time horizon of 1 year after the birth from a NHS perspective.
   Results: Between October 2010 and January 2014, 3236 women were randomised from 41 centres in England and Wales. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of SVB between groups, with 35.2% of women achieving a SVB in the upright group, compared with 41.1% in the lying-down group (adjusted risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.94). There was no evidence of differences in most of the secondary maternal or neonatal outcomes, or in long-term outcomes at the 12-month follow-up. No significant overall cost differences were observed between upright and lying-down positions for mothers or their babies.
   Limitations: Measurement of adherence was challenging in this unmasked trial, and adherence could be influenced by midwives' beliefs about the allocated positions. If adherence was poor, this would have diluted the difference between the two groups.
   Conclusions: There is clear evidence of the benefit of adopting a lying-down position in second-stage labour in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia, with no apparent disadvantages in either short-or long-term outcomes for mother or baby, and this is cost neutral for the NHS.

TI  - Drones delivering automated external defibrillators: A new strategy to improve the prognosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a serious threat to human life and health, characterized by high morbidity and mortality. However, given the limitations of the current emergency medical system (EMS), it is difficult to immediately treat patients who experience OHCA. It is well known that rapid defibrillation after cardiac arrest is essential for improving the survival rate of OHCA, yet automated external defibrillators (AED) are difficult to obtain in a timely manner.
   Objective: This review illustrates the feasibility and advantages of AED delivery by drones by surveying current studies on drones, explains that drones are a new strategy in OHCA, and finally proposes novel strategies to address existing problems with drone systems.
   Results: The continuous development of drone technology has been beneficial for patients who experience OHCA, as drones have demonstrated powerful capabilities to provide rapid delivery of AED. Drones have great advantages over traditional EMS, and the delivery of AED by drones for patients with OHCA is a new strategy. However, the application of this new strategy in real life still has many challenges.
   Conclusion: Drones are promising and innovative tools. Many studies have demonstrated that AED delivery by drones is feasible and cost-effective; however, as a new strategy to improve the survival rate of OHCA patients, there remain problems to be solved. In the future, more in-depth investigations need to be conducted.

TI  - Sub-phenotypes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who undergo extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a retrospective observational study from a multicenter registry
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has poor survival rates, but extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) shows promise for selected patients, as a second line of therapy after failure of conventional CPR to obtain return of spontaneous circulation, despite implementation challenges. This study aimed to identify distinct sub-phenotypes among patients with OHCA who undergo ECPR and to investigate their association with clinical outcomes.MethodsThis multi-center, retrospective, observational study used the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry from 83 hospitals that performed ECPR among 91 participating centers between June 2014 and December 2020. We included adult patients with OHCA who received ECPR during cardiac arrest. Three-class latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to identify sub-phenotypes based on 15 variables, including pre- and in-hospital factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between sub-phenotypes and 30-day survival and neurological outcomes.ResultsA total of 1528 patients were included. The median low-flow time was 47 min (interquartile rage: 38-58 min). The 30-day survival rate for eligible patients was 20.9%. LCA identified three distinct sub-phenotypes: Standard ECPR Group (n = 702), Delayed ECPR Group (n = 457), and Non-shockable Rhythm Group (n = 369). The variables with high discriminative power in the LCA was low-flow time, followed by pre-hospital shock delivery and initial cardiac rhythm. Thirty-day survival rates varied significantly among the sub-phenotypes (p = 0.001): Standard ECPR Group (26.9%), Delayed ECPR Group (17.1%), and Non-shockable Rhythm Group (14.1%). Favorable neurological outcomes at 30 days also differed significantly (p = 0.004), with the Standard ECPR Group showing the highest rate (12.1%). After adjusting for covariates, both the Delayed ECPR Group (adjusted OR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.82) and Non-shockable Rhythm Group (adjusted OR: 0.47, 95% CI 0.32-0.68) had significantly lower odds of 30-day survival compared to the Standard ECPR Group.ConclusionsThree clinically meaningful sub-phenotypes were identified using simple pre-hospital and in-hospital factors, with low-flow time emerging as the most critical discriminating factor. The sub-phenotypes showed significant associations with clinical outcomes and provide a practical framework for ECPR patient stratification. These findings suggest that timing optimization may be as important as rhythm characteristics for ECPR patient selection and support the development of sub-phenotype-specific treatment strategies.

TI  - Exploring the impact of tenure arrangements and incentives on sustainable forest use: Evidence from a framed-field experiment in Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The types of tenurial arrangements and incentives appropriate for the sustainable management of common pool resources (CPRs), such as forests, remain a topic of debate. In this study, we aim to (i) investigate the extraction level of forest resources under short and long-term property rights, and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of introducing mechanisms that leverage reputation and feelings of guilt in promoting cooperation among CPR users with short-term property rights to reduce over-harvesting. We develop a simple theoretical model to predict the optimal extraction level of a shared forest resource and validate the predictions using data from a framed field experiment conducted in rural Ethiopia. Our findings demonstrate that extraction levels under short-term property rights are higher compared to long-term property rights, aligning with the model predictions. Leveraging reputation and feelings of guilt is effective in bridging the gap in extraction intensity between shortand long-term property rights. However, as implementing reputation requires reliable monitoring that can be costly and challenging in the study context, we propose extending the duration of property rights over shared forest resources as a preferred strategy for curtailing over-extraction.

TI  - Resolution of organ dysfunction as a predictor of long-term survival in necrotizing soft tissue infections: Analysis of the AB103 Clinical Composite Endpoint Study in Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections trial and a retrospective claims database-linked chart study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are an acute surgical condition with high morbidity and mortality. Timely identification, resuscitation, and aggressive surgical management have significantly decreased inpatient mortality. However, reduced inpatient mortality has shifted the burden of disease to long-term mortality associated with persistent organ dysfunction. METHODS We performed a combined analysis of NSTI patients from the AB103 Clinical Composite Endpoint Study in Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections randomized-controlled interventional trial (ATB-202) and comprehensive administrative database (ATB-204) to determine the association of persistent organ dysfunction on inpatient and long-term outcomes. Persistent organ dysfunction was defined as a modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) score of 2 or greater at Day 14 (D14) after NSTI diagnosis, and resolution of organ dysfunction defined as mSOFA score of 1 or less. RESULTS The analysis included 506 hospitalized NSTI patients requiring surgical debridement, including 247 from ATB-202, and 259 from ATB-204. In both study cohorts, age and comorbidity burden were higher in the D14 mSOFA >= 2 group. Patients with D14 mSOFA score of 1 or less had significantly lower 90-day mortality than those with mSOFA score of 2 or higher in both ATB-202 (2.4% vs. 21.5%; p < 0.001) and ATB-204 (6% vs. 16%: p = 0.008) studies. In addition, in an adjusted covariate analysis of the combined study data sets D14 mSOFA score of 1 or lesss was an independent predictor of lower 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.53; p = 0.001). In both studies, D14 mSOFA score of 1 or less was associated with more favorable discharge status and decreased resource utilization. CONCLUSION For patients with NSTI undergoing surgical management, persistent organ dysfunction at 14 days, strongly predicts higher resource utilization, poor discharge disposition, and higher long-term mortality. Promoting the resolution of acute organ dysfunction after NSTI should be considered as a target for investigational therapies to improve long-term outcomes after NSTI.

TI  - Multicentric validation of a prognostic tool for predicting brain death following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in pediatric patients is associated with high rates of mortality and neurologic injury, with no definitive evidence-based method to predict outcomes available. A prognostic scoring tool for adults, The Brain Death After Cardiac Arrest (BDCA) score, was recently developed and validated. We aimed to validate this score in pediatric patients.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients admitted to 5 PICUs after OHCA between 2011 and 2021. We extracted BDCA score elements for those who survived at least 24 hours but died as a result of their OHCA. We assessed score discrimination for the definitive outcome of brain death. Subgroup analysis was performed for infants < 12mo versus children >= 12mo, those who likely had brain death but had withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (WLST) prior to declaration, and by etiology and duration of arrest.Results: 389 subjects were identified across 5 institutions, with 282 meeting inclusion criteria. 169 (59.9%) were formally declared brain dead; 58 (20.6%) had findings consistent with brain death but had withdrawal of life sustaining therapies prior to completion of formal declaration. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the age >= 12mo cohort was 0.82 [95% CI 0.75, 0.90], which mirrored the adult subject AUCs of 0.82 [0.77, 0.86] and 0.81 [0.76, 0.86] in the development and validation cohorts. Scores demonstrated worse discrimination in the infant cohort (AUC = 0.61).Conclusions: The BDCA score shows promise in children >= 12mo following OHCA and may be considered in conjunction with existing multimodal prognostication approaches.

TI  - Capnography for monitoring response to care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - EMERGENCIAS
AB  - Objective: To analyze the usefulness of capnography to monitor patients after out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, in terms of the ability of capnography to confirm tracheal intubation and the ability of capnometry to promptly detect return of spontaneous circulation and predict patient recovery.
   Methods: Preliminary description of the first 30 cases in a prospective study of out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in elderly non-trauma patients attended by the 7 ambulance units of the SUMMA 112 emergency service in Madrid, Spain, in 2008. Clinical, evolutive and capnographic data were recorded.
   Results: Seventy percent of the 30 patients were men. The mean (SD) age was 64.5 (16.3) years. A capnogram was observed after the first intubation attempt in 28 cases. In the remaining 2 cases, the absence of a capnogram indicated esophageal intubation; correct intubation was accomplished and confirmed on the second try (positive and negative predictive values, 100%). However, no differences were observed between end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PETCO(2)) in the absence or presence of a capnogram with the first and second attempts at intubation. Eight patients recovered. In 5 of them (62.5%), a significant increase in PETCO(2) was observed before the change in the electrocardiographic signal and before detection of a carotid pulse (P<.05). Finally, PETCO(2) values after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were significantly higher in the patients who recovered (33.5 [12.7] mm Hg) than in those who died (15.3 [11.1] mm Hg) (P<.01). After 20 minutes of CPR, PETCO(2) was more than 20 mm Hg in all patients who recovered.
   Conclusions: Capnography monitoring in responding to out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest is useful for confirming correct placement of the endotracheal tube, as indicated by the presence of a capnogram. Capnometry offers the first sign of return of spontaneous circulation in some cases and can be used to predict the success of prolonged CPR. [Emergencias 2010;22:345-348]

TI  - The impact of clinical risk factors in the conversion from acute lung injury to acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe multiple trauma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are different stages of the same disease, the aggravated stage of ALI leading to ARDS. Patients with ARDS have higher hospital mortality rates and reduced long-term pulmonary function and quality of life. It is, therefore, important to prevent ALI converting to ARDS. This study evaluated 17 risk factors potentially associated with the conversion from ALI to ARDS in severe multiple trauma. The results indicate that the impact of pulmonary contusion, APACHE II score, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation may help to predict conversion from ALI to ARDS in the early phase after multiple-trauma injury. Trauma duration, in particular, strongly impacted the short- and long-term development of ALI. Being elderly (aged : 65 years) and undergoing multiple blood transfusions in the early phase were independent risk factors correlated with secondary sepsis, deterioration of pulmonary function and transfusion-related acute lung injury due to early multiple fluid resuscitation.

TI  - Improvement in process of care and outcome after a multicenter severe sepsis educational program in Spain
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Context Concern exists that current guidelines for care of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock are followed variably, possibly due to a lack of adequate education.
   Objective To determine whether a national educational program based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines affected processes of care and hospital mortality for severe sepsis.
   Design, Setting, and Patients Before and after design in 59 medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) located throughout Spain. All ICU patients were screened daily and enrolled if they fulfilled severe sepsis or septic shock criteria. A total of 854 patients were enrolled in the preintervention period (November-December 2005), 1465 patients during the postintervention period (March-June 2006), and 247 patients during the long-term follow-up period 1 year later (November-December 2006) in a subset of 23 ICUs.
   Intervention The educational program consisted of training physicians and nursing staff from the emergency department, wards, and ICU in the definition, recognition, and treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock as outlined in the guidelines. Treatment was organized in 2 bundles: a resuscitation bundle (6 tasks to begin immediately and be accomplished within 6 hours) and a management bundle (4 tasks to be completed within 24 hours).
   Main Outcome Measures Hospital mortality, differences in adherence to the bundles' process-of-care variables, ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, hospital length of stay, and ICU length of stay.
   Results Patients included before and after the intervention were similar in terms of age, sex, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. At baseline, only 3 process-of-care measurements (blood cultures before antibiotics, early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation with adequate inspiratory plateau pressure) we had compliance rates higher than 50%. Patients in the postintervention cohort had a lower risk of hospital mortality (44.0% vs 39.7%; P =.04). The compliance with process-of-care variables also improved after the intervention in the sepsis resuscitation bundle (5.3% [95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-7%] vs 10.0% [95% CI, 8%-12%]; P < .001) and in the sepsis management bundle (10.9% [95% CI, 9%-13%] vs 15.7% [95% CI, 14%-18%]; P = .001). Hospital length of stay and ICU length of stay did not change after the intervention. During long-term follow-up, compliance with the sepsis resuscitation bundle returned to baseline but compliance with the sepsis management bundle and mortality remained stable with respect to the postintervention period.
   Conclusions A national educational effort to promote bundles of care for severe sepsis and septic shock was associated with improved guideline compliance and lower hospital mortality. However, compliance rates were still low, and the improvement in the resuscitation bundle lapsed by 1 year.

TI  - Is insomnia associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors? A cross-sectional survey
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Insomnia symptoms seem to be common in cardiac arrest survivors but their associations with important outcomes such as self reported health and life satisfaction have not previously been reported during the early post-event period. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether symptoms of insomnia are associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors six months after the event.Methods: This multicentre cross-sectional survey included cardiac arrest survivors =18 years. Participants were recruited six months after the event from five hospitals in southern Sweden, and completed a questionnaire including the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale, EQ-5D-5L, Health Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, linear regression, and ordinal logistic regression. The regression analyses were adjusted for demographic and medical factors.Results: In total, 212 survivors, 76.4% males, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD = 11.9) were included, and of those, 20% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia was significantly associated with all aspects of self-reported health (p < 0.01) and life satisfaction (p < 0.001), except mobility (p = 0.093), self-care (p = 0.676), and usual activities (p = 0.073).Conclusion: Insomnia plays a potentially important role for both health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening for sleep problems should be part of post cardiac arrest care and follow-up to identify those in need of further medical examination and treatment.

TI  - A Motorcycle Paramedic Increases the Survival Rate of Patients after OHCA
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Despite advancements in modern medicine, the survival rate of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains low. The proportion of OHCA patients who could be saved under ideal circumstances is unknown. A significant portion of patients experience cardiac arrest due to irreversible conditions. The survival of patients with reversible causes depends on the prompt initiation of basic life support (BLS) and early defibrillation. In order to increase the chances of survival, the motorcycle paramedic (MP) project was implemented in Ljubljana in 2003. The MP is equipped with an AED. In the case of OHCA with a shockable rhythm, he performs defibrillation before the arrival of the emergency medical team (EMT). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the MP, by reducing response times to OHCA patients, increases the survival and outcome of these patients compared to the EMT. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of OHCA cases within the area covered by Ljubljana Emergency Medical Service (EMS) was conducted for the period from January 2003 to December 2022. Instances where the MP arrived at the scene before the EMT were considered MP interventions and classified as the MP group; all other interventions were classified as the EMT group. Results: Between January 2003 and December 2022, the EMT performed resuscitation on 3352 patients. In 316 cases, the MP was simultaneously activated and arrived at the scene before the EMT. The response time in the MP group was shorter compared to the EMT group (7.7 +/- 4.1 min vs. 9.9 +/- 6.5 min, p < 0.001). In 16 patients, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved before the arrival of the EMT. The MP group had a higher ROSC rate, a larger proportion of patients were discharged from the hospital and there were more patients with a good neurological outcome compared to the EMT group (44.3% vs. 36.9%, p = 0.009; 18.7% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.005; 15.9% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.004, respectively). Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that the implementation of the MP into the EMS in Ljubljana has resulted in shorter response times, an increased survival rate and improved neurological outcome for OHCA patients.

TI  - Predicting neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with cumulative information; development and internal validation of an artificial neural network algorithm
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundPrognostication of neurological outcome in patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest resuscitation is complex. Clinical variables, as well as biomarkers of brain injury, cardiac injury, and systemic inflammation, all yield some prognostic value. We hypothesised that cumulative information obtained during the first three days of intensive care could produce a reliable model for predicting neurological outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) using artificial neural network (ANN) with and without biomarkers.MethodsWe performed a post hoc analysis of 932 patients from the Target Temperature Management trial. We focused on comatose patients at 24, 48, and 72 h post-cardiac arrest and excluded patients who were awake or deceased at these time points. 80% of the patients were allocated for model development (training set) and 20% for internal validation (test set). To investigate the prognostic potential of different levels of biomarkers (clinically available and research-grade), patients' background information, and intensive care observation and treatment, we created three models for each time point: (1) clinical variables, (2) adding clinically accessible biomarkers, e.g., neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and (3) adding research-grade biomarkers, e.g., neurofilament light (NFL). Patient outcome was the dichotomised Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at six months; a good outcome was defined as CPC 1-2 whilst a poor outcome was defined as CPC 3-5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for all test sets.ResultsAUROC remained below 90% when using only clinical variables throughout the first three days in the ICU. Adding clinically accessible biomarkers such as NSE, AUROC increased from 82 to 94% (p<0.01). The prognostic accuracy remained excellent from day 1 to day 3 with an AUROC at approximately 95% when adding research-grade biomarkers. The models which included NSE after 72 h and NFL on any of the three days had a low risk of false-positive predictions while retaining a low number of false-negative predictions.ConclusionsIn this exploratory study, ANNs provided good to excellent prognostic accuracy in predicting neurological outcome in comatose patients post OHCA. The models which included NSE after 72 h and NFL on all days showed promising prognostic performance.

TI  - Approach to cardiopulmonary resuscitation induced consciousness, an emergency medicine perspective
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remains the key intervention following cardiac arrest because of its ability to continue circulation. Recent focus on high quality compressions during CPR has coincided with more frequent encounters of CPR Induced Consciousness (CPRIC). CPRIC represents a poorly understood patient experience during CPR and defined as signs of consciousness and pain perception during CPR.
   Methods: Articles were selected using PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus search for the keywords "cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "consciousness", "awareness", "resuscitation", "cardio-cerebral resuscitation", "agitation" and "patient experience" yielding 336 articles. Results and their references were assessed for relevance. Articles were filtered by English language and the keyword. Case reports and case series were included. All remaining articles were reviewed and findings were discussed.
   Results: A total of ten articles were selected, which included data on 123 cases. Sample size varied per study from 1 to 112. Studies included cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in hospital cardiac arrest. Compressions were manually provided in most cases. Patient total recall was reported in 40% of cases. Use of sedation was reported in 40% of cases.
   Conclusions: There is need for continued research to better describe, explain and manage the phenomena of CPRIC. From the articles reviewed here, it is clear that further investigation has the potential to properly elucidate the patient experience including lasting psychological effects of CPRIC. Importantly, there is need for more than recognition of CPRIC from national authorities. Future research efforts should focus on establishing guidelines for the use of sedation and physical restraints, as well as the potential impact of treating CPRIC on survival. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A1  - Out Hosp Cardiac Arrest Registry Steering Grp
TI  - Resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Ireland 2012-2020: Modelling national temporal developments and survival predictors
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To explore potential predictors of national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival, including health system developments and the COVID pandemic in Ireland. Methods: National level OHCA registry data from 2012 through to 2020, relating to unwitnessed, and bystander witnessed OHCA were interrogated. Logistic regression models were built by including predictors through stepwise variable selection and enhancing the models by adding pair wise interactions that improved fit. Missing data sensitivity analyses were conducted using multiple imputation. Results: The data included 18,177 cases. The final model included seventeen variables. Of these nine variables were involved in pairwise interactions. The COVID-19 period was associated with reduced survival (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.43, 0.87), as were increasing age in years (OR 0.96,95% CI 0.96, 0.97) and call response interval in minutes (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96, 0.99). Amiodarone administration (OR 3.91, 95% CI 2.80, 5.48), urban location (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.12, 1.77), and chronological year overtime (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08, 1.20) were associated with increased survival. Conclusions: National survival from OHCA has significantly increased incrementally over time in Ireland. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased survival even after accounting for potential disruption to key elements of bystander and EMS care. Further research is needed to understand and address the discrepancy between urban and rural OHCA survival. Information concerning pre-event patient health status and inpatient care process may yield important additional insights in future.

TI  - Initial capnography values and resuscitation outcomes of patients assisted by basic life support units in first instance; descriptive prospective study
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - Introduction: Understanding the key factors which affect out hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) outcomes is essential in order to promote patient treatment. The main objective of this research was to describe the correlations between the capnographic values obtained during the first minute of monitoring on cardiopulmonary resuscitation, assisted by basic life-support units, with the results as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and alive hospital admission. The secondary objectives were to describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients assisted, and to analyze any correlations between receiving basic life-support units and/or defibrillation prior to the arrival of basic life-support units, and the results of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers.
   Methods: A prospective, descriptive, observational study of adult non-traumatic out hospital cardiac arrest patients was conducted. The patients were initially assisted by basic life-support units on the island of Mallorca, with one minute of initial capnography monitoring.
   Results: From July 2018 to March 2020, fifty-nine patients meeting the inclusion criteria were assisted, 76% were men and their mean age was 64.45 (+/- 15.07) years old. The number of emergency lifesaving technicians who participated in the study was 58, they had a mean work experience of 14.05 (+/- 6.7) years. Thirty-seven (63.7%) patients underwent basic life-support by bystanders and in 91.5% of cases the semi-automatic external defibrillator was used. Capnometry values during the first minute were obtained in 34 (58.6%) patients, their mean values were 22 (+/- 19.07) mmHg, 35.5% of patients had values <10 mmHg. In 25.4% of the patients, spontaneous circulation returned during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 18.6% were admitted to hospital alive.
   Conclusion: No correlations were found between initial capnography values scoring above or below 10 mmHg and survival, however, basic life-support maneuvers, and defibrillation by bystanders and first responders, did correlate with survival rates. The average patient assisted in out of hospital cardiac arrest by the basic life-support units sampled was an adult male aged over 65 years.

TI  - Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests during Mass-Participation Endurance Events: A Case Series
T2  - WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction-Mass-participation endurance events take place throughout the United Kingdom. Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) occur during these events, little is known about them. This case series aims to describe the number, type, etiology, and outcome of OHCAs treated by a UK-based specialist sports medicine provider over a period of 8 y.Methods-The medical records of a UK-based sports medicine provider were reviewed from 2014 to 2022. Anonymized information from OHCAs during this time was recorded. This included type of event, patient demographics, details of OHCA, and patient outcomes. Results-Ten OHCAs were identified during the course of 110 sporting events. These included the cases of 9 participants and 1 spectator. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved on site in all patients. Eight survived beyond 24 h and achieved a full neurological recovery. Seventy percent of these patients achieved ROSC within 4 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation being initiated. The 2 patients who died both presented with a nonshockable rhythm.Conclusions-OHCAs during mass-participation endurance events are rare. However, medical providers must be prepared to respond promptly. Quick interventions can result in a full neurological recovery.

TI  - Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Cardiac Arrest and Emergency Care
T2  - HEART FAILURE CLINICS
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic both OHCA and IHCA have increased in incidence while outcomes among patients suffering cardiac arrest are worse. Direct effects of the COVID-19 illness as well as in-direct effects of the pandemic on patient's behavior and health care systems have contrib-uted to these changes. Understanding these po-tential factors offers the opportunity to improve future response and save lives. Fortunately, compared with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent spikes in COVID-19 inci-dence seem to show an increase of lesser magni-tude of cardiac arrest despite an overall increase in COVID-19 infections. As health care systems have adapted, experience gained from the first wave may have led to better management of patients with COVID-19, allocation of resources, and eval-uation of non-COVID medical issues. Efforts at mass vaccination continue and will reduce the severity of disease leading to less severe compli-cations for those with COVID-19. The adverse impact of delaying non-COVID medical care has become readily apparent, prompting the science and medical community to widely release public campaigns to encourage patients to pursue med-ical care despite the ongoing pandemic.

TI  - Heart rate and QRS duration as biomarkers predict the immediate outcome from pulseless electrical activity
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is commonly observed in in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Universally available ECG character-istics such as QRS duration (QRSd) and heart rate (HR) may develop differently in patients who obtain ROSC or not. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively how QRSd and HR as biomarkers predict the immediate outcome of patients with PEA.Method: We investigated 327 episodes of IHCA in 298 patients at two US and one Norwegian hospital. We assessed the ECG in 559 segments of PEA nested within episodes, measuring QRSd and HR during pauses of compressions, and noted the clinical state that immediately followed PEA. We investigated the development of HR, QRSd, and transitions to ROSC or no-ROSC (VF/VT, asystole or death) in a joint longitudinal and com-peting risks statistical model.Results: Higher HR, and a rising HR, reflect a higher transition intensity ("hazard") to ROSC (p < 0.001), but HR was not associated with the tran-sition intensity to no-ROSC. A lower QRSd and a shrinking QRSd reflect an increased transition intensity to ROSC (p = 0.023) and a reduced tran-sition intensity to no-ROSC (p = 0.002).Conclusion: HR and QRSd convey information of the immediate outcome during resuscitation from PEA. These universally available and promising biomarkers may guide the emergency team in tailoring individual treatment.

TI  - Incorporation of Drone Technology Into the Chain of Survival for OHCA: Estimation of Time Needed for Bystander Treatment of OHCA and CPR Performance
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drone-delivered automated external defibrillators (AEDs) hold promises in the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Our objective was to estimate the time needed to perform resuscitation with a drone-delivered AED and to measure cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality. METHODS: Mock out-of-hospital cardiac arrest simulations that included a 9-1-1 call, CPR, and drone-delivered AED were conducted. Each simulation was timed and video-recorded. CPR performance metrics were recorded by a Laerdal Resusci Anne Quality Feedback System. Multivariable regression modeling examined factors associated with time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock and CPR quality metrics (compression rate, depth, recoil, and chest compression fraction). Comparisons were made among those with recent CPR training (<= 2 years) versus no recent (>2 years) or prior CPR training. RESULTS: We recruited 51 research participants between September 2019 and March 2020. The median age was 34 (Q1-Q3, 23-54) years, 56.9% were female, and 41.2% had recent CPR training. The median time from 9-1-1 call to initiation of CPR was 1:19 (Q1-Q3, 1:06-1:26) minutes. A median time of 1:59 (Q1-Q3, 01:50-02:20) minutes was needed to retrieve a drone-delivered AED and deliver a shock. The median CPR compression rate was 115 (Q1-Q3, 109-124) beats per minute, the correct compression depth percentage was 92% (Q1-Q3, 25-98), and the chest compression fraction was 46.7% (Q1-Q3, 39.9%-50.6%). Recent CPR training was not associated with CPR quality or time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock. Younger age (per 10-year increase; beta, 9.97 [95% CI, 4.63-15.31] s; P<0.001) and prior experience with AED (beta, -30.0 [95% CI, -50.1 to -10.0] s; P=0.004) were associated with more rapid time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock. Prior AED use (beta, 6.71 [95% CI, 1.62-11.79]; P=0.011) was associated with improved chest compression fraction percentage. CONCLUSION: Research participants were able to rapidly retrieve an AED from a drone while largely maintaining CPR quality according to American Heart Association guidelines. Chest compression fraction was lower than expected.

TI  - Neuroimaging in Cardiac Arrest Prognostication
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Neuroimaging is commonly utilized in the evaluation of post-cardiac arrest patients, providing a unique ability to visualize and quantify structural brain injury that can complement clinical and electrophysiologic data. Despite its lack of validation, we would advocate that neuroimaging is a valuable prognostication tool, worthy of further study, and an essential part of the armamentarium when used in combination with other modalities in the assessment of the post-cardiac arrest patient. Herein, we discuss the data and its limitations for neuroimaging to date and how it is being studied prospectively. We present current guidelines recommendations for prognostication after global hypoxic ischemic injury, focusing primarily on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as they are the most widely used modalities. We present promising results from advanced neuroimaging techniques, and provide practical advice for the clinician caring for these patients in the real world.

TI  - Persistent gender gaps in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Spain from 2013 through 2018
T2  - EMERGENCIAS
AB  - Objective. To examine gender-related differences in the management and survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Spain during 2 time series.
   Methods. Analysis of data recorded in the prospective Spanish OHCA registry (OHSCAR in its Spanish acronym) for 2 time series (2013-2014 and 2017-2018). We included all 11 036 consecutive cases in which an emergency team intervened. The dependent variables were arrival at the hospital after return of spontaneous circulation, overall survival to discharge, and overall survival with good neurological outcomes. Sex was the independent variable. We report descriptive statistics, patient group comparisons, and changes over time.
   Results. Women were significantly older and less likely to experience an OHCA in a public place, receive automatic external defibrillation, have a shockable heart rhythm, and be attended by an ambulance team within 15 minutes. In addition, fewer women underwent percutaneous coronary interventions or received treatment for hypothermia on admission to the hospital. In 2013-2014 and 2017-2018, respectively, the likelihood of survival was lower for women than men on admission (odds ratio [OR], 0.52 vs OR, 0.61; P < .001 and P = .009 in the 2 time series) and at discharge (OR, 0.69 vs 0.72 for men; P = .001 in both time series). Survival with good neurological outcomes was also less likely in women (OR, 0.50 vs 0.63; P < .001 in both series).
   Conclusions. The odds for survival and survival with good neurological outcomes were lower for women in nearly all patient groups in both time series. These findings suggest the need to adopt new approaches to address gender differences in OHCA.

TI  - Association of Histones With Coagulofibrinolytic Responses and Organ Dysfunction in Adult Post-cardiac Arrest Syndrome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundPatients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest often develop organ dysfunction caused by systemic inflammation and increased coagulation, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The involvement of histones in DIC and organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis and trauma has been previously reported, raising the probability that histones may also be associated with pathophysiology in patients after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. This study evaluated the relationship between histones and organ dysfunction related to coagulofibrinolytic changes in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). MethodsThis prospective single-center observational study assessed 35 adult patients with PCAS who were divided into two groups, i.e., 15 patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and 20 patients without MODS. MODS was defined as a sequential organ failure assessment score of >= 12. The plasma levels of histones and coagulofibrinolytic markers, including soluble fibrin, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), and soluble thrombomodulin, were measured in patients with PCAS immediately after admission to the emergency department, and 3 and 24 h after arriving at the hospital. ResultsPCAS patients with MODS had higher DIC scores [4 (3.0-5.0) vs. 1 (0.0-3.0), p = 0.012] and higher mortality rates (66.7% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.013) than those without MODS. Moreover, patients with MODS exhibited higher histone levels than those without MODS during the early phase of the post-resuscitation period. Severe endothelial injury and higher thrombin and plasmin generation were observed in the MODS group. Plasma levels of histones were positively correlated with those of soluble fibrin immediately after resuscitation (rho = 0.367, p = 0.030) and PIC 3 h after arriving at the hospital (rho = 0.480, p = 0.005). This correlation was prominent in the patient population with MODS (soluble fibrin: rho = 0.681, p = 0.005, PIC: rho = 0.742, p = 0.002). ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that elevated histone levels were associated with increased levels of thrombin, and subsequent plasmin generation in PCAS patients, especially those with MODS. Further studies are required to elucidate the causal relationship between histones and organ dysfunction related to DIC in PCAS.

TI  - An airline cardiac arrest program
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background As many as 1000 lives are lost annually from cardiac arrest in commercial aircraft. Ventricular fibrillation (VF), the most common mechanism, can be treated effectively only with prompt defibrillation, whereas the current policy of most airlines is to continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation pending aircraft diversion. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of making semiautomatic external defibrillators (AEDs) available for use on airline passengers with cardiac arrest.
   Methods and Results AEDs were installed on international Qantas aircraft and at major terminals, selected crew were trained in their use, and all crew members were trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Supervision was provided by medical volunteers or (remotely) by airline physicians. During a 64-month period, AEDs were used on 109 occasions: 63 times for monitoring an acutely ill passenger and 46 times for cardiac arrest. Twenty-seven episodes of cardiac arrest occurred in aircraft, often (11 of 27 [41%]) unwitnessed, and they were usually (21 of 27 [75%]) associated with asystole or pulseless idioventricular rhythm. All 19 arrests in terminals were witnessed; VF was present in 17 (89%). Overall, defibrillation was initially successful in 21 of 23 cases (91%). Long-term survival from VF was achieved in 26% (2 of 6 in aircraft and 4 of 17 in terminals). The ability to monitor cardiac rhythm aided decisions on diversion, which was avoided in most passengers with asystole or idioventricular rhythm.
   Conclusions AEDs in aircraft and terminals, with appropriate crew training, are helpful in the management of cardiac emergencies. Survival from VF is practicable and is comparable with the most effective prehospital ambulance emergency services. Costly aircraft diversions can be avoided in clearly futile situations, enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the program.

T2  - ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN
AB  - The number of patients surviving cardiac arrest is steadily increasing thanks to the implementation of life-saving systems and the increasing the professionali-sation of pre-hospital and in-hospital care for resuscitated patients. However, survival is often associated with severe physical, cognitive, emotional and social impairments. Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest not only have an ostensible need for physical rehabilitation, but also a complex need for psychosocial and emotional -cogni-tive support. This applies to both the early phase of acute inpatient treatment and the transition to rehabilitative facili-ties and the patient's home environment. In the future, impairments that are often not immediately "visible" must be as-sessed and registered more consistently, earlier and in a more structured manner within the framework of screening pro-cedures, also in order to record treatment results in the long term and to create a corresponding evidence base. Optimised, holistic assessment methods are needed so that cognitive, emotional and social impairments in particular can be addressed therapeutically in the sense of a patient-centred and holistic

TI  - Elderly patients and intensive care: Systematic review and geriatrician's point of view
T2  - REVUE DE MEDECINE INTERNE
AB  - The global population is aging and intensive care unit admission rate of elderly patients is dramatically increasing. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the literature about the management of elderly patients in intensive care unit and more specifically about epidemiology, admission criteria, mortality, functional prognosis and ethical aspects. We also discuss the data on cardiorespiratory arrest, shock, acute respiratory failure and delirium. The mortality rate of patients over 80 years old in intensive care unit can reach up to 70% at 1 year, but is dependent on many factors, such as comorbidities or frailty. Above all, more than half of elderly patients recover their long-term autonomy. Their quality of life is comparable to that of the same age population. Considering that the first 3 months after an intensive care unit stay are the most decisive in terms of vital and functional prognosis, we will discuss strategies to improve care through the creation of dedicated intensive care-geriatrics networks.

TI  - Isolated anomalous right coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ARCAPA): incidental finding in the patient presenting with angina-a case report
T2  - AME CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background: Anomalous right coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) is one of four known anomalies of the coronary arteries originating from the pulmonary artery. ARCAPA is a rare congenital anomaly that is associated with possible long-term complications including myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction. Clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic murmur to angina, dyspnea, fatigue, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and even cardiac arrest. Case Description: We present a case of a 52-year-old male who presented to the hospital for intermittent chest pain. The patient was vitally stable and examination was unremarkable. Upon workup, electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission showed no acute ischemic changes and troponin were <0.03 ng/mL. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and had a dobutamine stress echocardiogram (ECHO) for ischemic evaluation. During the recovery phase of dobutamine stress ECHO, the patient reported having 10/10 chest pain with a drop in blood pressure to 90 mmHg systolic. He was subsequently given sublingual nitroglycerin and fluids. Pain did resolve and blood pressure improved after treatment. No wall motion abnormalities were noted on ECHO, but there were inferior ST depressions on EKG during the stress portion of the test. The patient had repeated blood work after the stress test which showed an elevated troponin level of 0.08 ng/mL. The patient was taken to the catheterization lab for diagnostic coronary angiogram. Cardiac catheterization showed a right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the pulmonary artery and diagnosis of isolated ARCAPA was made because of his intermittent chest pain. No intervention was performed as no significant lesions were found. The patient was started on medical therapy including aspirin, beta blocker and statin. The patient did not want to pursue surgery at that point and he did not want any further intervention. He was discharged home with instructions to follow up with cardiology in an outpatient setting to be referred for surgical repair. Conclusions: The purpose of writing this case is to increase awareness among physicians to be able to recognize possible anomalous coronary artery origins during cardiac catheterization and to understand the risk of long-term complications of ARCAPA and need for surgical repair.

TI  - Association between patient age and pediatric cardiac arrest recognition by emergency medical dispatchers
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) is an important prognostic factor in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The recognition of cardiac arrest by dispatcher is a key factor for successful DA-CPR. In this study, we evaluated the association between pediatric age and dispatcher recognition. Methods: A retrospective observational study was designed using a nationwide OHCA registry. Patients under 19 years of age were enrolled. Patients were categorized into four groups according to age (<1 year, 1-6 years, 7-13 years, and 14-18 years). The primary outcome was cardiac arrest recognition by dispatcher. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: A total of 2754 pediatric OHCA patients were enrolled. A negative trend was observed between age and dispatcher performance (p < 0.01). The rate of cardiac arrest recognition was highest in patients under one year of age (61.5%) and lowest in patients ages 14-18 years old (47.1%). Patients in the 7-13 years and 14-18 years age groups were both associated with a decreased rate of recognition (adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval: 0.55 (0.41-0.74) and 0.44 (0.34-0.57), respectively). In the interaction analysis, the association between age and outcomes was more prominent in patients with non-medical causes.Conclusion: Patients ages 7-18 years old were negatively associated with cardiac arrest recognition and DA-CPR instruction provision within optimal timeframes compared to those younger than one year old. Development of a tailored protocol could be considered according to age and cause of arrest for better dispatcher performance in pediatric OHCA patients.

TI  - New approaches to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) is a leading cause of mortality and the focus of significant research. Recent studies provide new evidence that may change our management of OOH-CA and improve outcomes.
   The findings of two recently published studies of OOH-CA are reviewed in this article. The first, the Public Access Defibrillation Trial, was a randomized, controlled trial of public access defibrillation in 993 community facilities in the U.S. and Canada. It demonstrated that a community strategy to train laypersons to respond to cardiac arrests significantly increased survival to hospital discharge following OOH-CA in nonresidential community units with community members trained and equipped to provide public access defibrillation, compared to community units with community members trained to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) without any capacity for defibrillation. The second, the European Resuscitation Council Vasopressor during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Study, was a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial that compared vasopressin to epinephrine as the initial pharmacological therapy for 1,219 patients who sustained OOH-CA. The study demonstrated that vasopressin is similar to epinephrine for OOH-CA due to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless electrical activity, and superior to epinephrine for the initial treatment of asystolic arrest; it also demonstrated that the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine is superior to epinephrine alone in the treatment of refractory, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Studies on alternative CPR techniques and adjunctive devices for CPR were also reviewed.
   We conclude that pre-hospital access to defibrillators and the use of vasopressin in the management of asystole hold promise for improving survival for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

The patient was promptly supported via venoarterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and Impella CP before surgical VSR repair on the 12th day of admission. Following surgery, the patient decided to be transferred to the intensive care unit under new VA-ECMO assistance. Subsequently, Impella CP removal and arterial cannula reinsertion were performed at the ipsilateral site, with no pulsatile bleeding observed from the arterial cannulation site. Emergency aortography revealed a contrast defect at the terminal aorta. Owing to the possibility of acute thrombotic occlusion, the Fogarty procedure was performed through the bilateral common femoral artery (CFA); however, no thrombus retrieved. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed complete occlusion of the bilateral common iliac arteries, extending to the abdominal aorta. The uncontrollable, rapid progression of acidemia resulted in sudden cardiac arrest. Acute arterial occlusion leading to fatal outcomes can occur because of thrombosis following long-term Impella CP use. Impella-associated thrombi can form around the shaft of a mixed area of blood flow caused by the interaction between Impella and ECMO and often develop distal to the aortic arch, which is often overlooked during routine examinations. Therefore, planning for long-term Impella with ECMO support must utilize various imaging modalities to search for thrombi and prepare several means of revascularization during Impella removal.

TI  - A call to arms to reduce premature deaths by using inexpensive resuscitation care
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Two hundred seventy thousand people in the US and 450,000 people in Europe experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year. Perceived poor prognosis and expense of care of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest remain barriers to implementation of effective therapies. In this issue of Critical Care, Graf and colleagues have provided a programmatic evaluation of the costs and consequences of intensive care after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Thirty-one percent of the cohort that survived to be cared for in the intensive care setting were still alive 5 years after hospital discharge. The health-related quality of life of this group of 5-year survivors was similar to that of matched healthy controls, and the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was similar to or less than the cost of other commonly used medical interventions. We need to change the culture of resuscitation and recognize that cardiac arrest is a treatable condition that is associated with acceptable quality of life and costs of care after resuscitation.

TI  - A Machine Learning Framework for Pulse Detection During Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - The availability of an automatic pulse detection during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) would allow the rapid identification of cardiac arrest and the prompt detection of return of spontaneous circulation. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable pulse detection algorithm using the electrocardiogram (ECG) and thoracic impedance (TI), the signals available in most defibrilators. The dataset used in the study consisted of 1140 ECG and TI segments from 187 OHCA patients, whereof 792 were labelled as pulse-generating rhythm (PR) and 348 as pulseless electrical activity (PEA) by a pool of experts in OHCA. First, an adaptive filtering scheme was used to extract the impedance circulation component and its first derivative from the TI. Then, the wavelet decomposition of the ECG was carried out to obtain the different subband components and the denoised ECG. Pulse/no-pulse (PR/PEA) discrimination features were extracted from those signals and fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that made the pulse/no-pulse decision. A quasi-stratified and patient wise nested cross validation procedure was used to select the best feature subset and to tune the SVM hyperparameters. This procedure was repeated 50 times to estimate the statistical distributions of the performance metrics of the method. The optimal solution consisted in a five feature classifier that yielded a mean (standard deviation) sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy and total accuracy of 92.4% (0.7), 93.0% (0.8), 92.7% (0.5) and 92.6% (0.5), respectively. When compared to available methods, our solution presented an improvement in balanced accuracy of at least 2.5 points. A reliable pulse detection algorithm for OHCA using the signals available in defibrillators was acomplished.

TI  - The association of gasping and outcome, in out of hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: Gasping is common after cardiac arrest, and its frequency decreases over time. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the association of gasping and survival to discharge in patients who suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Relevant studies were identified by searching in PubMed, Medline, Embase, OVID, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the association of gasping and on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes. Heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored.
   Results: Individual patient data was obtained from 10,797 participants suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in five cohort studies of 4 articles. A fixed effects model suggested that patients with gasping were 3.525 times (95% CI: 3.028-4.104; P < 0.01) more likely to survive to discharge than those without gasping, and there was no heterogeneity among studies (P = 0.564). Also it may be a favorable factor for return of spontaneous circulation (RR: 2.170; 95% CI: 1.691, 2.785) with high heterogeneity (Q = 5.26; P = 0.022).
   Conclusions: Findings of this meta-analysis demonstrated that gasping is common after cardiac arrest, and is associated with increased survival to discharge. Patients who are cardiac arrest with gasping should be promptly resuscitated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Survey of academic veterinarians' clinical practice in cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - To document the clinical practice of cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) among academic veterinarians.
   Survey.
   Eight colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States.
   Two hundred and one academic veterinarians.
   The survey was distributed by hand by the authors into the mailboxes of small animal faculty, residents, and interns. Demographic variables, questions regarding number of cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) supervised and number successful, do not attempt resuscitation discussions, and Likert-style questions about client presence during CPCR, appropriateness of CPCR, and CPCR decision-making were included. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to determine the effect of multiple questions on different target variables of interest.
   Numerous differences were noted based on institution, gender, specialty, and position. Most institutions did not have a standard resuscitation consent form. Most respondents believed the client, house officer, and senior clinician should determine whether to perform resuscitation or not. Quality of life was the most significant determinant of whether to resuscitate or not, followed by long-term prognosis, then short-term prognosis.
   Veterinarians differ in many aspects of their approach to CPA and resuscitation. Creating consensus within the veterinary profession would benefit client service and patient care.

TI  - Electrocution due to contact of industrial equipment with power lines
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Electrocution due to contact of construction equipment with power lines is not uncommon as a source of industrial injury. We report seven such cases. Two patients sustained cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated at the scene. Four patients lost consciousness and ill two cases, amnesia for the event was encountered. No long-term cardiac or neurologic effects were noted. Surgery including amputation was sometimes required.
   In all cases, the patient was on the ground touching the machinery or touching cables connected to the machinery at the time of injury. The importance of exercising due care in industrial safety measures is stressed. Prompt CPR was life saving in two cases. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd for ISBI.

TI  - One-year survival rate and healthcare costs after cardiac arrest in Taiwan, 2006-2012
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objectives
   The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.
   Methods
   This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.
   Results
   In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for > 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, beta: -23,604, p < 0.001; being widowed, beta: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, beta: 14,438, p = 0.024).
   Conclusions
   There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution. These findings add to our knowledge of the health economics and indicate future research about healthcare of cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - Recent Trends in Survival From Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the United States
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Despite intensive efforts over many years, the United States has made limited progress in improving rates of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Recently, national organizations, such as the American Heart Association, have focused on promoting bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of automated external defibrillators, and other performance improvement efforts.
   Methods and Results-Using the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), a prospective clinical registry, we identified 70 027 U.S. patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between October 2005 and December 2012. Using multilevel Poisson regression, we examined temporal trends in risk-adjusted survival. After adjusting for patient and cardiac arrest characteristics, risk-adjusted rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival increased from 5.7% in the reference period of 2005 to 2006 to 7.2% in 2008 (adjusted risk ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.43; P<0.001). Survival improved more modestly to 8.3% in 2012 (adjusted risk ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.70; P<0.001). This improvement in survival occurred in both shockable and nonshockable arrest rhythms (P for interaction=0.22) and was also accompanied by better neurological outcomes among survivors (P for trend=0.01). Improved survival was attributable to both higher rates of prehospital survival, where risk-adjusted rates increased from 14.3% in 2005 to 2006 to 20.8% in 2012 (P for trend<0.001), and in-hospital survival (P for trend=0.015). Rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator use modestly increased during the study period and partly accounted for prehospital survival trends.
   Conclusions-Data drawn from a large subset of U.S communities suggest that rates of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have improved among sites participating in a performance improvement registry.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for critically ill adults
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may provide benefit in certain populations of adults, including those with severe cardiac failure, severe respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. However, it is also associated with serious short- and long-term complications, and there remains a lack of high-quality evidence to guide practice. Recently several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, therefore, we undertook an update of our previous systematic review published in 2014.
   Objectives
   To evaluate whether venovenous (VV), venoarterial (VA), or ECMO cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) improve mortality compared to conventional cardiopulmonary support in critically ill adults.
   Search methods
   We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was March 2022. The search was limited to English language only.
   Selection criteria
   We included RCTs, quasi-RCTs, and cluster-RCTs that compared VV ECMO, VA ECMO or ECPR to conventional support in critically ill adults.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. all-cause mortality at day 90 to one year. Our secondary outcomes were 2. length of hospital stay, 3. survival to discharge, 4. disability, 5. adverse outcomes/safety events, 6. health-related quality of life, 7. longer-term health status, and 8. cost-effectiveness. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.
   Main results
   Five RCTs met our inclusion criteria, with four new studies being added to the original review (total 757 participants). Two studies were of VV ECMO (429 participants), one VA ECMO (41 participants), and two ECPR (285 participants). Four RCTs had a low risk of bias and one was unclear, and the overall certainty of the results (GRADE score) was moderate, reduced primarily due to indirectness of the study populations and interventions. E
   CMO was associated with a reduction in 90-day to one-year mortality compared to conventional treatment (risk ratio [RR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.92; P = 0.002, I-2 = 11%). This finding remained stable after performing a sensitivity analysis by removing the single trial with an uncertain risk of bias. Subgroup analyses did not reveal a significant subgroup effect across VV, VA, or ECPR modes (P = 0.73).
   Four studies reported an increased risk of major hemorrhage with ECMO (RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.90 to 5.82; P < 0.001), while two studies reported no difference in favorable neurologic outcome (RR 2.83, 95% CI 0.36 to 22.42; P = 0.32). Other secondary outcomes were not consistently reported across the studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   In this updated systematic review, which included four additional RCTs, we found that ECMO was associated with a reduction in day-90 to one-year all-cause mortality, as well as three times increased risk of bleeding. However, the certainty of this result was only low to moderate, limited by a low number of small trials, clinical heterogeneity, and indirectness across studies.

TI  - Survival and functional outcome at hospital discharge following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA): A prospective multicentre observational study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the functional outcome of patients after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and to identify associations with good functional outcome at hospital discharge.
   Method: Emergency calls were prospectively screened and data collected for IHCAs in seven Australian hospitals. Patients were included if aged > 18 years, admitted as an acute care hospital in-patient and experienced IHCA; defined by a period of unresponsiveness with no observed respiratory effort and commencement of external cardiac compressions. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical and cardiac arrest characteristics, survival and functional outcome at hospital discharge using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Katz Index of Independence in ADLs (Katz-ADL).
   Results: 152 patients suffered 159 IHCAs (male 66.4%; mean age 70.2 (+/- 13.9) years). Sixty patients (39.5%) survived, of whom 43 (71.7%) had a good functional outcome (mRS < 3) and 38 (63.3%) were independent with activities of daily living (ADLs) at hospital discharge (Katz-ADL = 6). Younger age (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.98; p = 0.003), shorter duration of CPR (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.77 +/- 0.91; p < 0.0001) and shorter duration of hospital admission prior to IHCA (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.998; p = 0.04) were independently associated with a good functional outcome at hospital discharge.
   Conclusion: The majority of survivors had a good functional outcome and were independent with their ADLs at hospital discharge. Factors associated with good functional outcome at hospital discharge were identified.

TI  - Changes in quality of life and health status in patients with extracorporeal life support: A prospective longitudinal study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) provides emergency pulmonary and cardiac assistance for patients in respiratory or cardiac failure. Most studies evaluate the success of ECLS based on patients' survival rate. However, the trajectory of health status and quality of life (QOL) should also be important considerations. The study's aim was to explore changes in health status and QOL in adult patients weaned from ECLS who survived to hospital discharge over a one-year period.
   Study design
   A prospective longitudinal study was conducted from April 2012 to September 2014. A convenience sample of patients who had undergone ECLS was followed for one-year after hospital discharge. Heath status was measured with a physical activity scale, the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and a social support scale; we assessed quality of life with the physical and mental component summary scales of the Short-Form 36 Health Survey. Changes in depression, social support, physical activity and QOL were analysed with generalized estimating equations at 3-month intervals; participants' QOL at 12 months after discharge was compared with the general population.
   Results
   A total of 231 patients received ECLS during the study period. Sixty-five patients survived to hospital discharge (28% survival rate); 32 participants completed the study. Data showed scores for physical activity increased significantly over time (p < .001), while depression and social support significantly decreased (p < .05 and p < .001, respectively). Participants with veno-venous ECLS had higher scores for depression than participants with veno-arterial ECLS (p < .05). PCS scores significantly increased at 9, and 12 months after discharge (p < .05 and p < .001, respectively). There was no significant change in MCS scores.
   Conclusions
   This was a preliminary study of patients with ECLS following hospital discharge over a oneyear period. One year following hospital discharge survivors of ECLS continued to experience physical complications and some continued to have depressive symptoms; the level of social support was significantly lower after hospital discharge. Healthcare professionals should understand the trajectory of health status and QOL after discharge, which can help developing evidence-based interventions and improve QOL for survivors of ECLS.

TI  - The Chemistry of Lyophilized Blood Products
T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
AB  - With the development of new biologics and bioconjugates, storage and preservation have become more critical than ever before. Lyophilization is a method of cell and protein preservation by removing a solvent such as water from a substance followed by freezing. This technique has been used in the past and still holds promise for overcoming logistic challenges in safety net hospitals with limited blood banking resources, austere environments such as combat, and mass casualty situations where existing resources may be outstripped. This method allows for long-term storage and transport but requires the bioconjugation of preservatives to prevent cell destabilization. Trehalose is utilized as a bioconjugate in platelet and red blood cell preservation to maintain protein thermodynamics and stabilizing protein formulations in liquid and freeze-dried states. Biomimetic approaches have been explored as alternatives to cryo- and lyopreservation of blood components. Intravascular hemostats such as PLGA nanoparticles functionalized with PEG motifs, topical hemostats utilizing fibrinogen or chitosan, and liposomal encapsulated hemoglobin with surface modifications are effectively stored long-term through bioconjugation. In thinking about the best methods for storage and transport, we are focusing this topical review on blood products that have the longest track record of preservation and looking at how these methods can be applied to synthetic systems.

TI  - Continuous Plankton Recorder database: evolution, current uses and future directions
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, operated by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS), is the largest plankton monitoring programme in the world and has spanned > 70 yr. The dataset contains information from -200 000 samples, with over 2.3 million records of individual taxa. Here we outline the evolution of the CPR database through changes in technology, and how this has increased data access. Recent high-impact publications and the expanded role of CPR data in marine management demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset. We argue that solely supplying data to the research community is not sufficient in the current research climate; to promote wider use, additional tools need to be developed to provide visual representation and summary statistics. We outline 2 software visualisation tools, SAHFOS WinCPR and the digital CPR Atlas, which provide access to CPR data for both researchers and non-plankton specialists. We also describe future directions of the database, data policy and the development of visualisation tools. We believe that the approach at SAHFOS to increase data accessibility and provide new visualisation tools has enhanced awareness of the data and led to the financial security of the organisation; it also provides a good model of how long-term monitoring programmes can evolve to help secure their future.

TI  - Preclinical management of cardiac arrest-extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - Background The chances of surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are still very low. Despite intensive efforts the outcome has remained relatively poor over many years. In specific situations, new technologies, such as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) could significantly improve survival with a good neurological outcome. Objective Does the immediate restoration of circulation and reoxygenation via eCPR influence the survival rate after OHCA? Is eCPR the new link in the chain of survival? Material and methods Discussion of current study results and guideline recommendations. Results The overall survival rates after OHCA have remained at 10-30% over many years. Despite low case numbers more recent retrospective studies showed that an improved outcome can be achieved with eCPR. In selected patient collectives survival with a favorable neurological outcome is possible in 38% of the cases. Conclusion Survival after cardiac arrest and the subsequent quality of life dependent on many different factors. The time factor, i.e. the avoidance of a no-flow phase and reduction of the low-flow phase is of fundamental importance. The immediate restoration of the circulation and oxygen supply by eCPR can significantly improve survival; however, large randomized, controlled trials are currently not available.

TI  - Immediate post-ECPR management strategies in the prehospital and critical care transport medicine environments
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Despite advancements in care, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has a low survival rate. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown improved outcomes in select cases, notably in the ARREST trial. However, ECPR is resource-intensive and limited to specialized centers, restricting access in many regions. Estimates suggest only 2-10% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients are ECPR candidates. Advanced systems initiating ECPR in prehospital environments or non-ECMO-capable centers have shown promise. As ECPR utilization increases, so does the need for transport to ECMO-capable centers. Unlike conventional out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care, high-quality evidence for post-resuscitation management of ECPR patients is lacking. This review provides suggestions for the immediate post-resuscitation management (4-6 h) of ECPR patients in prehospital settings, the critical care transport medicine environment, and at non-ECMO-capable centers. Goals include treating the precipitating cause of cardiac arrest, maintaining end-organ perfusion, optimizing oxygen delivery, promoting myocardial recovery, and preventing complications associated with V-A ECMO. Continued research is needed to establish evidence-based protocols that ensure the safe and effective management of ECPR patients.

TI  - Prognostic factors associated with favourable functional outcome among adult patients requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), has demonstrated promise in the management of refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, evidence from observational studies and clinical trials are conflicting and the factors influencing outcome have not been well established. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the association between pre-ECPR prognostic factors and likelihood of good functional outcome among adult patients requiring ECPR for OHCA. We searched Medline and Embase databases from inception to February 28, 2023 and screened studies with two independent reviewers. We performed meta-analyses of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, adjusted hazard ratios and mean differences separately. We assessed risk of bias using the QUIPS tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Findings: We included 29 observational and randomized studies involving 7,397 patients. Factors with moderate or high certainty of association with increased survival with favourable functional outcome include pre-arrest patient factors, such as younger age (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.99) and female sex (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.70), as well as intra-arrest factors, such as shockable rhythm (OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.04 to 3.80), witnessed arrest (OR 1.68 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.42), bystander CPR (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.01), return of spontaneous circulation (OR 2.81, 95% CI 2.19 to 3.61) and shorter time to cannulation (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.69 per 10 minutes). Interpretation: The findings of this review confirm several clinical concepts wellestablished in the cardiac arrest literature and their applicability to the patient for whom ECPR is considered - that is, the impact of pre-existing patient factors, the benefit of timely and effective CPR, as well as the prognostic importance of minimizing low-flow time. We advocate for the thoughtful consideration of these prognostic factors as part of a risk stratification framework when evaluating a patient's potential candidacy for ECPR.

TI  - Intraoperative crystalloid-colloid infusion ratio associated with the development of early surgical complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in ulcerative colitis: a multicenter long-term follow-up study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB  - Background Intraoperative intravenous fluid administration proves to be associated with surgical patients' postoperative outcomes. Few studies reported the relationship between intraoperative crystalloid-colloid infusion ratio and early surgical complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in ulcerative colitis (UC).
   Methods Data on patients with underwent IPAA from January 2008 to March 2022 at our three inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) surgery centers were retrospectively collected. Intraoperative anesthetic data were recorded and later evaluated by our team anesthesiologist.
   Results A total of 140 eligible patients with a median follow-up time of 6.0 years [interquartile range (IQR): 2.0-8.0] were enrolled. Among all enrolled patients, 34 (24.3%) developed early surgical complications after IPAA. Greater blood loss and lower crystalloid-colloid infusion ratio were observed in patients with early surgical complications. Crystalloid-colloid infusion ratio < 2 and blood loss >= 200 ml had the most significant area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.664 and 0.674 in predicting early surgical complications. Crystalloid-colloid infusion ratio < 2 [odds ratio (OR), 2.571; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.067-6.195, p = 0.035] and blood loss >= 200 ml (OR, 3.165; 95% CI, 1.288-7.777, p = 0.012) were independent risk factors for the development of early post-IPAA complications.
   Conclusion Intraoperative crystalloid-colloid infusion ratio < 2 and blood loss volume over 200 ml during IPAA contribute to the occurrence of early surgical complications. Early attentions and necessary interventions are warranted to avoid these risk factors during the IPAA surgery in order to prevent the development of early surgical complications.

TI  - Use of cardiocerebral resuscitation or AHA/ERC 2005 Guidelines is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective: To determine whether the use of cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) or AHA/ERC 2005 Resuscitation Guidelines improved patient outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) compared to older guidelines.
   Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases. We also hand-searched study references and consulted experts.
   Study selection: Design: randomised controlled trials and observational studies.
   Population: OHCA patients, age >17 years.
   Comparators: 'Control' protocol versus 'Study' protocol. 'Control' protocol defined as AHA/ERC 2000 Guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 'Study' protocol defined as AHA/ERC 2005 Guidelines for CPR, or a CCR protocol.
   Outcome: Survival to hospital discharge.
   Quality: High-quality or medium-quality studies, as measured by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale using predefined categories.
   Results: Twelve observational studies met inclusion criteria. All the three studies using CCR demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to use of AHA 2000 Guidelines, as did five of the nine studies using AHA/ERC 2005 Guidelines. Pooled data demonstrate that use of a CCR protocol has an unadjusted OR of 2.26 (95% CI 1.64 to 3.12) for survival to hospital discharge among all cardiac arrest patients. Among witnessed ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) patients, CCR increased survival by an OR of 2.98 (95% CI 1.92 to 4.62). Studies using AHA/ERC 2005 Guidelines showed an overall trend towards increased survival, but significant heterogeneity existed among these studies.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate an association with improved survival from OHCA when CCR protocols or AHA/ERC 2005 Guidelines are compared to use of older guidelines. In the subgroup of patients with witnessed VF/VT, there was a threefold increase in OHCA survival when CCR was used. CCR appears to be a promising resuscitation protocol for Emergency Medical Services providers in increasing survival from OHCA. Future research will need to be conducted to directly compare AHA/ERC 2010 Guidelines with the CCR approach.

TI  - Does Early Postresuscitation Stress Hyperglycemia Affect 72-Hour Neurologic Outcome?? Preliminary Observations in the Swine Model
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background. Hyperglycemia is common in the early period following resuscitation from cardiac arrest and has been shown to be a predictor of neurologic outcome in retrospective studies. Objective. To evaluate neurologic outcome and early postarrest hyperglycemia in a swine cardiac arrest model. Methods. Electrically induced ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest was induced in 22 anesthetized and instrumented swine. After 7 minutes, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support were initiated. Twenty-one animals were resuscitated and plasma glucose concentration was measured at intervals for 60 minutes after resuscitation. The animals were observed for 72 hours and the neurologic score was determined at 24-hour intervals. Results. Ten animals had a peak plasma glucose value >= a parts per thousand yen226 mg/dL during the initial 60 minutes after resuscitation. The neurologic scores at 72 hours in these animals (mean score == 0, mean overall cerebral performance category == 1) were the same as those in the animals with a peak plasma glucose value < 226 mg/dL. The end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) values measured during CPR, times to restoration of spontaneous circulation, and epinephrine doses were not significantly different between the animals with a peak glucose concentration >= a parts per thousand yen226 mg/dL and those with lower values. The sample size afforded a power of 95%% to detect a 50-point difference from the lowest score (0 points) of the porcine neurologic outcome scale. Conclusion. In this standard porcine model of witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, early postresuscitation stress hyperglycemia did not appear to affect neurologic outcome. During the prehospital phase of treatment and transport, treatment of hyperglycemia by emergency medical services providers may not be warranted.

TI  - Are they trained? Prevalence, motivations and barriers to CPR training among cohabitants of patients with a coronary disease
T2  - INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurs most often at home and often in the presence of family members of the patient who witness the event. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training of the next of kin of at-risk patients is thus potentially beneficial. The aim of our study was to document the prevalence of appropriate training among cardiac patients' cohabitants, as well as the motivations or obstacles to seeking training. 153 cohabitants of 127 patients who were hospitalized 1 year prior for confirmed coronary disease in a cardiology department (Paris, France) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire between October 2013 and March 2014. 38 % of interrogated cohabitants had received CPR training, and in two-thirds of the cases, their training was undertaken prior to the onset of the patient's heart disease. The training received was often a single instruction session. Half took place more than 5 years prior to the interview. For two-thirds of interrogated families, the reasons they sought training were related to professional or military duties. Training undertaken solely due to cohabitation with a patient affected by coronary disease represented only 3.5 % of the trained respondents. A lack of information regarding existing training programs and a lack of concrete propositions were given as the main barriers to seeking training. The families of patients who are at-risk for cardiac arrests that were interrogated in our study are inadequately trained in CPR. The creation of dedicated training programs at cardiac rehabilitation services for patients' next of kin or the use of alternative methods such as self-instruction kits could potentially remedy this situation.

TI  - Current and Future Status of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Numerous series, propensity-matched trials, and meta-analyses suggest that appropriate use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) for in-hospital cardiac arrest (INCA) can be lifesaving. Even with an antecedent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) duration in excess of 45 minutes, 30-day survival with favourable neurologic outcome using E-CPR is approximately 35%-45%. Survival may be related to age, duration of CPR, or etiolcigy. Associated complications include sepsis, renal failure, limb and neurologic complications, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. However, methodological biases including small sample size, selection bias, publication bias, and inability to control for confounders-in these series prevent definitive conclusions. As such, the 2015 American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines update recommended E-CPR as a Level of Evidence IIb recommendation in appropriate cases. The absence of high-quality evidence presents an opportunity for clinician/scientists to generate practice-defining data through collaborative investigation and prospective trials. A multidisciplinary dialogue is required to standardize the field and promote multicentre investigation of E-CPR with data sharing and the development of a foundation for high-quality trials. The objectives of this review are to (1) provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of currently available studies investigating the use of E-CPR in patients with IHCA and highlight knowledge gaps; (2) create a framework for the standardization of terminology, clinical practice, data collection, and investigation of E-CPR for patients with IHCA that will help ensure congruence in future work in this area; and (3) propose suggestions to guide future research by the cardiovascular community to advance this important field.

TI  - Mechanisms linking advanced airway management and cardiac arrest outcomes
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Advanced airway management - such as endotracheal intubation (ETI) or supraglottic airway (SGA) insertion - is one of the most prominent interventions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation. While randomized controlled trials are currently in progress to identify the best advanced airway technique in OHCA, the mechanisms by which airway management may influence OHCA outcomes remain unknown. We provide a conceptual model describing potential mechanisms linking advanced airway management with OHCA outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - From Public Access Defibrillator to Personal Access Defibrillator: Proposal of Prompts to Optimize Automated External Defibrillation Use by Laypeople
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to assess whether integrating additional prompts to the automated external defibrillator (AED) interface could reduce common errors among untrained laypeople. Materials and Methods: An observational before-after design was employed. The Control group (pre-cohort) consisted of 36 participants from previous research, whereas the after cohort included 36 participants with similar characteristics. All participants were evaluated in a simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) scenario. After one minute of chest compressions, an AED was used to deliver shock. In the follow-up cohort, a smartphone provided voice prompts encouraging proper chest compressions and advising against removing the pads or turning off the AED. Results: In the Control group, six participants turned off the AED (p=0.010), and four removed the pads (p=0.040), while none in the aftercohort group made these errors. Regarding other mistakes, no participants in the after cohort performed compressions in the stomach (two participants in the Control group), two participants did not find the sticky part of the pads (three in the Control group), and two placed the pads in the wrong place (four in the Control group). Conclusions: Simple voice prompts during the 2-minute interval between AED analyses improved the performance of untrained laypeople in a simulated OHCA scenario.

TI  - A Second Chance for Survival: Clinical Trial Evidence, Eligibility, and Barriers to Implementation of ECPR for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Unfortunately, < 10% out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) survive to hospital discharge. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-assisted cardiopulmo-nary resuscitation (ECPR), providing emergent cardio-pulmonary support, is a promising but resource-intensive and logistically complex therapy that may improve OHCA outcomes. Until recently, available evidence was limited to observational studies. However, 2 randomized clinical trials now provide supporting data for experienced ECMO centres to consider offering this treatment.

TI  - A Standardized Multimodal Neurological Monitoring Protocol-Guided Cerebral Protection Therapy for Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Supported Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundThe main objective of this study was to investigate the role of a multimodal neurological monitoring (MNM)-guided protocol in the precision identification of neural impairment and long-term neurological outcomes in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) supported patients. MethodsWe performed a cohort study that examined adult patients who underwent VA-ECMO support in our center between February 2010 and April 2021. These patients were retrospectively assigned to the "with MNM group" and the "without MNM group" based on the presence or absence of MNM-guided precision management. The differences in ECMO-related characteristics, evaluation indicators (precision, sensitivity, and specificity) of the MNM-guided protocol, and the long-term outcomes of the surviving patients were measured and compared between the two groups. ResultsA total of 63 patients with VA-ECMO support were retrospectively assigned to the without MNM group (n = 35) and the with MNM group (n = 28). The incidence of neural impairment in the without MNM group was significantly higher than that in the with MNM group (82.1 vs. 54.3%, P = 0.020). The MNM group exhibited older median ages [52.5 (39.5, 65.3) vs. 31 (26.5, 48.0), P = 0.008], a higher success rate of ECMO weaning (92.8 vs. 71.4%, P = 0.047), and a lower median duration of building ECMO [40.0 (35.0, 52.0) vs. 58.0 (48.0, 76.0), P = 0.025] and median ECMO duration days [5.0 (4.0, 6.2) vs. 7.0 (5.0, 10.5), P = 0.018] than the group without MNM. The MNM-guided protocol exhibited a higher precision rate (82.1 vs. 60.0%), sensitivity (95.7 vs. 78.9%), and specificity (83.3 vs. 37.5%) in identifying neural impairment in VA-ECMO support patients. There were significant differences in the long-term outcomes of survivors at 1, 3 and 6 months after discharge between the two groups (P < 0.05). However, the results showed no significant differences in ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, survival to discharge, or 28-day mortality between the two groups (P > 0.05). ConclusionThe MNM-guided protocol is conducive to guiding intensivists in the improvement of cerebral protection therapy for ECMO-supported patients to detect and treat potential neurologic impairment promptly, and then improving long-term neurological outcomes after discharge.

TI  - Economic evaluations for intensive care unit randomised clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand: Practical recommendations for researchers
T2  - AUSTRALIAN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Objectives: Economic evaluations of intensive care unit (ICU) interventions have specific considerations, including how to cost ICU stays and accurately measure quality of life in survivors. The aim of this article was to develop best practice recommendations for economic evaluations alongside future ICU randomised controlled trials (RCTs).Review methods: We collated our experience based on expert consensus across several recent economic evaluations to provide best-practice, practical recommendations for researchers conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs in the ICU. Recommendations were structured according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) Task Force Report.Results: We discuss recommendations across the components of economic evaluations, including: types of economic evaluation, the population and sample size, study perspective, comparators, time horizon, choice of health outcomes, measurement of effectiveness, measurement and valuation of quality of life, estimating resources and costs, analytical methods, and the increment cost-effectiveness ratio. We also provide future directions for research with regard to developing more robust economic evaluations for the ICU. Conclusion: Economic evaluations should be built alongside ICU RCTs and should be designed a priori using appropriate follow-up and data collection to capture patient-relevant outcomes. Further work is needed to improve the quality of data available for linkage in Australia as well as developing costing methods for the ICU and appropriate quality of life measurements.(c) 2022 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

TI  - Adding video-debriefing to Helping-Babies-Breathe training enhanced retention of neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills among health workers in Uganda: a cluster randomized trial
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB  - Background Skilled birth attendants must be competent to provide prompt resuscitation to save newborn lives at birth. Both knowledge and skills (competence) decline with time after training but the optimal duration for refresher training among frontline-skilled birth attendants in low-resource settings is unknown. Objectives We assessed the effect of an innovative Helping-Babies-Breathe simulation-based teaching method using video-debriefing compared to standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training on 1) neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills attainment and 2) competence retention among skilled birth attendants in Northern Uganda. Methods A total of 26 health facilities with 86 birth attendants were equally randomised to intervention and control arms. The 2nd edition of the American Association of Pediatrics Helping-Babies-Breathe curriculum was used for training and assessment. Knowledge and skills were assessed pre- and post-training, and during follow-up at 6 months. A mixed effects linear regression model for repeated measures was used to assess the short and long-term effects of the intervention on neonatal resuscitation practices while accounting for clustering. Results Eighty-two (95.3%) skilled birth attendants completed follow-up at 6 months. Approximately 80% of these had no prior Helping-Babies-Breathe training and 75% reported practicing neonatal resuscitation routinely. Standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training with video-debriefing improved knowledge and skills attainment post-training [adjusted mean difference: 5.34; 95% CI: 0.82-10.78] and retention [adjusted mean difference: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.52-4.41] over 6 months post-training compared to standard training after adjusting for confounding and clustering. Factors that reduced knowledge and skills retention among birth attendants were monthly resuscitation of one neonate or more and being in service for more than 5 years. Conclusion Adding video-debriefing to standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training had an effect on birth attendants' competence attainment and retention over 6 months in Uganda. However, more research is needed to justify the proposed intervention in this context.

TI  - The influence of age and chronic medical conditions on neurological outcomes in out of hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: It is unknown whether older patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have worse outcomes because of aging itself, or because age can be a marker for overall health status. We aimed to study the prognostic utility of age and pre-arrest comorbidities.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, reviewing electronic health records of all adults treated for non-traumatic OHCA in the University of Michigan Emergency Department (N= 588). Primary covariates included age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and a combined Charlson-age index. The primary dichotomized outcome was favorable neurological outcome (cerebral performance category, 1-2), evaluated by logistic regressions.
   Results: Dementia (p = 0.01), witnessed arrest (p = 0.03), bystander CPR (p < 0.001), presenting rhythm (p < 0.001), and mild therapeutic hypothermia (p < 0.001) were associated with the primary outcome. Increasing age (unadjusted OR for each decade of life, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.70-0.88; adjusted 0.79, 0.67-0.94) was negatively associated with likelihood of a favorable neurological outcome. CCI and combined Charl son-age index significantly predicted outcome in the unadjusted, but not adjusted analysis. Composite variables were stronger predictors in patients with shockable than non-shockable presenting rhythms (interaction terms: age and rhythm [p = 0.004], CCI and rhythm [p = 0.01]).
   Conclusion: Age, but not CCI, was significantly associated with less favorable neurological outcomes in patients with OHCA after adjusting important covariates. Age appears to be an independent predictor of prognosis rather than a marker for comorbidity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ethical issues in termination of resuscitation decision-making: an interview study with paramedics and relatives of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest non-survivors
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Background In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), decisions to terminate resuscitation or transport the patient to hospital are ethically fraught. However, little is known about paramedics' ethical concerns in these decision-making processes. Objective To develop an understanding of how paramedics experience ethical concerns in OHCA decision-making processes, and how this relates to the ethical concerns of patients' relatives. Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with paramedics and relatives of OHCA non-survivors. Setting Two ambulance trusts in England. Participants Thirty-one paramedics, identified as decision-makers in adult OHCA events in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had been initiated, were interviewed. Fourteen interviews with relatives of OHCA non-survivors were also conducted. Analysis The interviews were analysed thematically, using a coding framework and following an empirical ethics approach. Results Four themes were developed: preventing harm to patients, best interests, caring for the patient's family and moral distress. Paramedics conceptualised preventing harm both as saving lives and as preventing an undignified death or a life with severe brain damage. Paramedics' and relatives' views of best interests were influenced by values such as patient dignity and assumptions about age and quality of life. Paramedics expressed a duty of care towards the patient's family. Relatives conveyed the importance of clear communication and acts of care performed by the ambulance crew, underscoring the ethical commitment that paramedics had towards patients' families. Paramedics described decision-making processes that relied on clinical guidelines, rather than personal values and beliefs; this sometimes led to moral distress. Conclusion Non-protocolised ethical considerations are important in paramedic decision-making about terminating CPR in OHCA events. While paramedics use established guidelines and processes to reach decisions that prevent patient harm, they experience moral distress when personal convictions clash with guidelines. Training around ethical reasoning and decision making may help paramedics reduce their moral distress and provide consistent and transparent decisions for patients and their families.

TI  - Vigilance, awareness and a phone line: 20 years of expediting CPR for enhancing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest The 'SHL'-Telemedicine experience in Israel
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: The only large-scale report (1988) by the Israeli national. ambulance service Magen David Adorn (MDA) on the outcome of cardiac arrest victims who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by paramedics called for more frequent and more promptly initiated CPR and shorter time to arrival of paramedic care to improve survival. We report the 1987-2007 experience of resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims who were 'SHL'-Tetemedicine subscribers and who underwent CPR by SHL-Telemedicine mobile intensive care units (MICUs) personnel or under their instructions.
   Methods: 'SHL's records of MICU reports and specifics of CPR maneuvers and outcome of resuscitated patients, as recorded by its MICU physicians, were analyzed to determine whether the system enhanced survival.
   Results: A total of 1810 'SHL'-Telemedicine subscribers (mean age 76 +/- 12 years [16-104], 67% mates) were resuscitated after cardiac arrest, 597 (33%) were hospitalized and 279 (15.4%) were discharged alive. Factors associated with successful resuscitation included witnessed collapse and documented ventricular fibrillation upon MICU arrival. A history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, stroke or advanced age adversely affected the outcome. Time from collapse to CPR initiation and duration of CPR correlated significantly with survival. Laymen instructed telephonically by the 'SHL'-Telemedicine center performed CPR on 121 patients: 13 (10%) survived to hospital discharge.
   Conclusions: 'SHL'-Telemedicine's policy of bi-monthly contact with its subscribers led to heightened awareness of warning signs and need for rapid summoning of medical assistance in the setting of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Innate Immunity in the Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome and Its Implications for Therapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Clinical and technological advances promoting early hemorrhage control and physiologic resuscitation as well as early diagnosis and optimal treatment of sepsis have significantly decreased in-hospital mortality for many critically ill patient populations. However, a substantial proportion of severe trauma and sepsis survivors will develop protracted organ dysfunction termed chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as >= 14 days requiring intensive care unit (ICU) resources with ongoing organ dysfunction. A subset of CCI patients will develop the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and these individuals are predisposed to a poor quality of life and indolent death. We propose that CCI and PICS after trauma or sepsis are the result of an inappropriate bone marrow response characterized by the generation of dysfunctional myeloid populations at the expense of lympho- and erythropoiesis. This review describes similarities among CCI/PICS phenotypes in sepsis, cancer, and aging and reviews the role of aberrant myelopoiesis in the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS. In addition, we characterize pathogen recognition, the interface between innate and adaptive immune systems, and therapeutic approaches including immune modulators, gut microbiota support, and nutritional and exercise therapy. Finally, we discuss the future of diagnostic and prognostic approaches guided by machine and deep-learning models trained and validated on big data to identify patients for whom these approaches will yield the greatest benefits. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS and continued investigation into novel therapies harbor the potential to improve the current dismal long-term outcomes for critically ill post-injury and post-infection patients.

TI  - Clinical paper Evaluating neurocognitive outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors: A comparative study of performance-based and reported measures
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: To (1) describe the prevalence of cognitive dysfunctions using performance-based and reported measures, and (2) explore the correlations between selected performance-based, patient-reported, and observer-reported neurocognitive outcome measures three months after hospital discharge in a population of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Methods: Data from 193 OHCA survivors was derived from the Danish multicenter REVIVAL cohort study. At three months, four subtests of the performance-based Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) (Trail making, Color-word interference, Verbal fluency, and Figure design), the patient-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A), and the observer-reported 16-item Short Form (SF) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline after Cardiac Arrest (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) were collected. Spearman's rank coefficient correlation analysis was performed to examine correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A, and SF-16 IQCODE-CA. Results: Overall, 21% of survivors exhibited impairment in executive functioning using the D-KEFS subtest Color-word interference, while only 9% self-reported executive impairment (BRIEF-A) and 7% of relatives reported cognitive decline (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) in survivors at three months postarrest. All correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A and SF-16 IQCODE-CA were negligible to low. Conclusion: The results of this REVIVAL substudy suggest that although the performance-based and reported measures did not correlate, dual neurocognitive screening tools containing both a self-reported and an informant-reported version may have the potential to detect executive discrepancies in the return to everyday life and guide targeted neurorehabilitation after OHCA.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of a Community First Responder System for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Poland
T2  - CLINICOECONOMICS AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH
AB  - Objective: Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue in Poland, with only an 8.4% survival rate to hospital discharge. Early initiation of Basic Life Support and defibrillation through a Community First Responder (CFR) system can markedly improve survival rates and neurological outcomes. Methods: A decision tree and Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness of three scenarios against standard care by estimating costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Scenario 1 involved raising public awareness and educating on the 30:2 CPR protocol. Scenario 2 added equipping blue-light service vehicles with Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) and training personnel. Scenario 3 implemented a full CFR system with integrated AEDs, dispatch centers, and trained citizen responders. The analysis included survival to hospital discharge, with sensitivity analyses assessing robustness. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were <euro>15,221 for Scenario 1, <euro>30,659 for Scenario 2, and <euro>16,205 for Scenario 3 per QALY gained-all below the threshold of <euro>50,197. Improvements were observed in all stages, including survival to hospital discharge and neurologically intact survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: Implementing a CFR system in Poland is a cost-effective strategy that enhances survival rates after OHCA at an acceptable cost per QALY. The study emphasizes the importance of AED accessibility, trained CFRs, and streamlined emergency responses to improve survival and quality of life for OHCA patients. These findings support policy development and resource allocation to Poland's medical to OHCA.

TI  - Mild cardiopulmonary arrest promotes synaptic dysfunction in rat hippocampus
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) patients exhibit learning and memory disabilities. These deficits suggest that synaptic dysfunction may underlie such disabilities. The hypothesis of the present study was that synaptic dysfunction occurs following CA and that this precedes cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used histopathological and electrophysiological markers in the hippocampus of rats subjected to CA. Evoked potentials (EP) were determined in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices harvested from animals subjected to CA or sham-operated rats by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals and recording in the CA1 pyramidal region. EP amplitudes were significantly attenuated by approximately 60% in hippocampal slices harvested from animals subjected to CA. Hippocampal slices harvested from sham rats exhibited normal long-term potentiation (LTP). In contrast, hippocampal slices harvested 24 h after CA exhibited no LTP response, even when no histopathological abnormalities were observed. These data suggest that synaptic dysfunction occurs before and without overt histopathology. We suggest that the synaptic dysfunction precedes and may be an early marker for delayed. neuronal cell death in the hippocampus after CA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Outcome and cost implications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit of a comprehensive cancer center
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
AB  - Intensive care unit (ICU) resources are frequently utilized in the supportive care of hospitalized patients with cancer. Patients with cancer reportedly have poor outcomes from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and patient care costs of CPR applied to patients already receiving life support in an ICU. The medical records of patients who developed cardiac arrest and underwent CPR in the ICU of a comprehensive cancer center between 1993 and 2000 were reviewed. ICU charges after the first episode of CPR were analyzed. There were 5,196 admissions to the ICU during this time; 406 (8%) of the patients underwent CPR; 67% had hematologic malignancies or had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: 256 patients (63%) died at the time of the arrest, and in 150 (37%) spontaneous circulation was restored. There were 104 patients (26%) who survived more than 24 hours but ultimately died during their hospitalization; their mean time to death was 4.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-5.6), and mean ICU charges were $45,877 (95% Cl $24,802-$66,952). Seven patients (2%) survived to be discharged. Patients who survived after CPR and were discharged from the hospital were those who had acute ventricular dysrhythmias and were resuscitated promptly. The application of CPR to cancer patients receiving life support is costly and typically does not lead to long-term survival. Cancer patients requiring admission to an ICU should receive full supportive care short of resuscitation. Providing assurances that care will remain appropriate, aggressive, and in accordance with the patient's and family's wishes can optimize compassionate care while avoiding futile life-sustaining interventions.

TI  - Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome: Update on Brain Injury Management and Prognostication
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Treatment of cardiac arrest should focus on maximizing neurologic recovery as well as systemic recovery to ensure the best possible functional outcome. This article focuses on the neurologic care of patients after they have been resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Maximizing neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest requires attention to prevention of primary and secondary brain injury. Primary brain injury such as hypoperfusion and hypoxic injury should be avoided by optimizing hemodynamic goals to maximize cerebral perfusion and maintain normoxia and normocarbia. Secondary brain injury mediated by excitotoxicity and the inflammatory cascade may be mitigated by therapeutic hypothermia. Other strategies that may be beneficial include the treatment of seizures and maintaining normoglycemia. Finally, accurate and timely prognostication is crucial because it influences withdrawal of care and overall mortality. With the adoption of therapeutic hypothermia, the classic prognostic paradigm that was previously used needs to be reexamined. The application of our knowledge of risk factors for poor outcome, serial physical examinations, neurophysiological tests, neuroimaging, and biochemical markers may need to be delayed until after rewarming. We emphasize the importance of a shift in physicians' approach to the management of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, not only in prognostication, but also in the early and aggressive therapies that have been shown to improve survival and quality of life.

TI  - Brugada syndrome associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
AB  - BACKGROUND Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disease characterized by an electrocardiogram (ECG) with a coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3), which predisposes to sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in the absence of structural heart disease. We report the case of a 29-year-old man with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. BrS is associated with a high incidence of SCD in adults, and increasing the awareness of BrS and prompt recognition of the Brugada ECG pattern can be lifesaving.
   CASE SUMMARY A 29-year-old man suffered from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and after defibrillation, his ECG demonstrated a coved-type elevated ST segment in V1 and V2. These findings were compatible with type 1 Brugada pattern, and ECG of his brother showed a type 2 Brugada pattern. The diagnosis was BrS, NYHF IV, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sepsis, and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The patient had no arrhythmia episodes after discharge throughout a follow-up period of 36 mo.
   CONCLUSION Increasing awareness of BrS and prompt recognition of the Brugada ECG pattern can be lifesaving.

TI  - Intensify, resuscitate or palliate: Decision making in the critically ill patient with haematological malignancy
T2  - BLOOD REVIEWS
AB  - The survival prospects of critically ill patients with haematological malignancy (HM) are reviewed, as are the variables which might influence decisions about the limitation of life sustaining therapies (LLST). Approximately 40% of patients with HM admitted to ICU survive to hospital discharge and a broad admission policy is warranted. Short term survival is predicted by the severity of the underlying physiological disturbance rather than cancer specific characteristics, although the prognostic importance of neutropenia and prior stem cell transplantation remains to be clarified. Survival to hospital discharge in cancer patients following cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is only 6-8%. Poor performance status and progressive deterioration despite ICU support appear to predict worse outcome. Patients Should be provided with realistic information in order to make an informed decision about CPR. Decisions about LLST must be individualised. Consideration should be given to the patient's wishes and prognosis, the immediate clinical circumstances and their potential reversibility. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Manganese Porphyrin Promotes Post Cardiac Arrest Recovery in Mice and Rats
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Although heart failure is a long-term chronic disease, it can also lead to arrhythmia, triggering cardiac arrest, and eventually death. Our study is a randomized and blinded preclinical assessment of the efficacy of the Mn porphyrin compound, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BMX-001), commonly known as a superoxide dismutase mimic, in both mouse and rat models of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our study indicates that MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ improves survival, neurologic function recovery, and behavioral performance in animals suffering from cardiac arrest. The results support the development of Mn Porphyrin-based therapeutics for the treatment of heart failure and cardiac arrest. Introduction Cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation induces global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, causing neurologic deficits or death. Manganese porphyrins, superoxide dismutase mimics, are reportedly able to effectively reduce ischemic injury in brain, kidney, and other tissues. This study evaluates the efficacy of a third generation lipophilic Mn porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, Mn(III) ortho meso-tetrakis (N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnBuOE, BMX-001), in both mouse and rat models of CA. Methods Forty-eight animals were subjected to 8 min of CA and resuscitated subsequently by chest compression and epinephrine infusion. Vehicle or MnBuOE was given immediately after resuscitation followed by daily subcutaneous injections. Body weight, spontaneous activity, neurologic deficits, rotarod performance, and neuronal death were assessed. Kidney tubular injury was assessed in CA mice. Data were collected by the investigators who were blinded to the treatment groups. Results Vehicle mice had a mortality of 20%, which was reduced by 50% by MnBuOE. All CA mice had body weight loss, spontaneous activity decline, neurologic deficits, and decreased rotarod performance that were significantly improved at three days post MnBuOE daily treatment. MnBuOE treatment reduced cortical neuronal death and kidney tubular injury in mice (p < 0.05) but not hippocampus neuronal death (23% MnBuOE vs. 34% vehicle group, p = 0.49). In rats, they had a better body-weight recovery and increased rotarod latency after MnBuOE treatment when compared to vehicle group (p < 0.01 vs. vehicle). MnBuOE-treated rats had a low percentage of hippocampus neuronal death (39% MnBuOE vs. 49% vehicle group, p = 0.21) and less tubular injury (p < 0.05) relative to vehicle group. Conclusions We demonstrated the ability of MnBuOE to improve post-CA survival, as well as functional outcomes in both mice and rats, which jointly account for the improvement not only of brain function but also of the overall wellbeing of the animals. While MnBuOE bears therapeutic potential for treating CA patients, the females and the animals with comorbidities must be further evaluated before advancing toward clinical trials.

TI  - Laryngeal tube use in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by paramedics in Norway
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Although there are numerous supraglottic airway alternatives to endotracheal intubation, it remains unclear which airway technique is optimal for use in prehospital cardiac arrests. We evaluated the use of the laryngeal tube (LT) as an airway management tool among adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated by our ambulance services in the Haukeland and Innlandet hospital districts.
   Methods: Post-resuscitation forms and data concerning airway management in 347 adult OHCA victims were retrospectively assessed with regard to LT insertion success rates, ease and speed of insertion and insertion-related problems.
   Results: A total of 402 insertions were performed on 347 OHCA patients. Overall, LT insertion was successful in 85.3% of the patients, with a 74.4% first-attempt success rate. In the minority of patients (n = 46, 13.3%), the LT insertion time exceeded 30 seconds. Insertion-related problems were recorded in 52.7% of the patients. Lack of respiratory sounds on auscultation (n = 100, 28.8%), problematic initial tube positioning (n = 85, 24.5%), air leakage (n = 61, 17.6%), vomitus/aspiration (n = 44, 12.7%), and tube dislocation (n = 17, 4.9%) were the most common problems reported. Insertion difficulty was graded and documented for 95.4% of the patients, with the majority of insertions assessed as being "Easy" (62.5%) or "Intermediate" (24.8%). Only 8.1% of the insertions were considered to be "Difficult".
   Conclusions: We found a high number of insertion related problems, indicating that supraglottic airway devices offering promising results in manikin studies may be less reliable in real-life resuscitations. Still, we consider the laryngeal tube to be an important alternative for airway management in prehospital cardiac arrest victims.

TI  - Kidney transplantation: indications, results, limitations, and perspectives
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - In France, kidney transplantation is port of - and is reimbursed as - treatment for chronic kidney disease.
   Long-term survival and quality of life ore better for transplant recipients than for dialysis patients.
   Stagnation in the survival rate of transplants over the post 10 years has led to the development of new immunosuppressive drugs to minimize the use of corticosteroids and anticalcineurins and to induce tolerance of the transplanted kidney.
   The scarcity and lower quality of kidneys for transplantation is also leading to the development of new transplantation sources: donors with cardiac arrest and elderly living and ABO-incompatible donors.

TI  - Cognitive dysfunction and health-related quality of life after a cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background
   Evidence-based treatment protocols including therapeutic hypothermia have increased hospital survival to over 50% in unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors. In this study we estimated the incidence of cognitive dysfunctions in a group of cardiac arrest survivors with a high functional outcome treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Secondarily, we assessed the cardiac arrest group's level of cognitive performance in each tested cognitive domain and investigated the relationship between cognitive function and age, time since cardiac arrest and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
   Methods
   We included 26 patients 13-28 months after a cardiac arrest. All patients were scored using the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Twenty-five of the patients were tested for cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). These patients were tested using four cognitive tests: Motor Screening Test, Delayed Matching to Sample, Stockings of Cambridge and Paired Associate Learning from CANTAB. All patients filled in the Short Form-36 for the assessment of HRQOL.
   Results
   Thirteen of 25 (52%) patients were classified as having a cognitive dysfunction. Compared with the reference population, there was no difference in the performance in motor function and delayed memory but there were significant differences in executive function and episodic memory. We found no associations between cognitive function and age, time since cardiac arrest or HRQOL.
   Conclusion
   Half of the patients had a cognitive dysfunction with reduced performance on executive function and episodic memory, indicating frontal and temporal lobe affection, respectively. Reduced performance did not affect HRQOL.

TI  - Quantitative pupillometry in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: A post-hoc analysis of the TTH48 trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background Quantitative pupillometry is an objective method to examine pupil reaction and subsequently grade the response on a neurological pupil index (NPi) scale from 0 to 5. The aim of the present sub-study was to explore the long-term prognostic value of NPi in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients undergoing targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods This planned sub-study of the "Targeted temperature management for 48 versus 24 h and neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomized clinical trial." NPi was assessed from admission and throughout day 3 and linked to the Cerebral Performance Categories score at 6 months. We compared the prognostic performance of NPi in 65 patients randomized to a target temperature of 33 +/- 1 degrees C for 24 or 48 h. Results The NPi values were not different between TTM groups (p > .05). When data were pooled, NPi was strongly associated with neurological outcome at day 1 with a mean NPi of 3.6 (95% CI 3.4-3.8) versus NPi 3.9 (3.6-4.1) in the poor versus good outcome group, respectively (p < .01). At day 2, NPi values were 3.6 (3.1-4.0) and 4.1 (3.9-4.2) (p = .01) and at day 3, the values were 3.3 (2.6-4.0) and 4.3 (4.1-4.6), respectively (p < .01). The prognostic ability of NPi, defined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was best at day three. Conclusion Quantitative pupillometry measured by NPi was not different in the two TTM groups, but overall, significantly associated with good and poor neurological outcomes at 6 months. NPI has a promising diagnostic accuracy, but larger studies are warranted.

TI  - Improved outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated by emergency life-saving technicians compared with basic emergency medical technicians: A JCS-ReSS study report
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Emergency life-saving technicians (ELSTs) are specially trained prehospital medical providers believed to provide better care than basic emergency medical technicians (BEMTs). ELSTs are certified to perform techniques such as administration of advanced airways or adrenaline and are considered to have more knowledge; nevertheless, ELSTs' effectiveness over BEMTs regarding out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains unclear. We investigated whether the presence of an ELST improves OHCA patient outcomes.
   Methods: In a retrospective study of adult OHCA patients treated in Japan from 2011 to 2015, we compared two OHCA patient groups: patients transported with at least one ELST and patients transported by only BEMTs. The primary outcome measure was one-month favorable neurological outcomes, defined as Cerebral Performance Category <= 2. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effect of ELSTs.
   Results: Included were 552,337 OHCA patients, with 538,222 patients in the ELST group and 14,115 in the BEMT group. The ELST group had a significantly higher odds of favorable neurological outcomes (2.5% vs. 2.1%, adjusted OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17-1.66), one-month survival (4.9% vs. 4.1%, adjusted OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.54), and return of spontaneous circulation (8.1% vs. 5.1%, adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.72-2.11) compared with the BEMT group. However, ELSTs' limited procedure range (adrenaline administration or advanced airway management) did not promote favorable neurological outcomes.
   Conclusions: Compared with the BEMT group, transport by the ELST group was associated with better neurological outcomes in OHCA.

TI  - Severe Myocardial Dysfunction after Non-Ischemic Cardiac Arrest: Effectiveness of Percutaneous Assist Devices
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Despite the improvements in standardized cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival remains low, mainly due to initial myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. Our goal was to compare the efficacy of two left ventricular assist devices on resuscitation and hemodynamic supply in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest. Methods: Seventeen anaesthetized pigs had 12 min of untreated VF followed by 6 min of chest compression and boluses of epinephrine. Next, a first defibrillation was attempted and pigs were randomized to any of the three groups: control (n = 5), implantation of an percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella, n = 5) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 7). Hemodynamic and myocardial functions were evaluated invasively at baseline, at return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), after 10-30-60-120-240 min post-resuscitation. The primary endpoint was the rate of ROSC. Results: Only one of 5 pigs in the control group, 5 of 5 pigs in the Impella group, and 5 of 7 pigs in the ECMO group had ROSC (p < 0.05). Left ventricular ejection fraction at 240 min post-resuscitation was 37.5 +/- 6.2% in the ECMO group vs. 23 +/- 3% in the Impella group (p = 0.06). No significant difference in hemodynamic parameters was observed between the two ventricular assist devices. Conclusion: Early mechanical circulatory support appeared to improve resuscitation rates in a shockable rhythm model of cardiac arrest. This approach appears promising and should be further evaluated.

TI  - Managed primary care of nursing home residents
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the rates of hospital use and mortality of nursing homes residents who received their primary care from nurse practitioner-physician teams.
   DESIGN: A cohort study.
   SETTING: Thirty nursing homes in Southern California.
   PATIENTS: Older, long-term residents of nursing homes enrolled in a Medicare HMO (n = 307).
   INTERVENTION: Primary care by an accessible interdisciplinary team supported by clinical guidelines, continuous quality improvement techniques, and increased availability of clinical services at the nursing homes.
   RESULTS: The residents (mean age 83.5 years, 69.0% women) had a high prevalence of dementia (83.5%) and functional disability (87.2% were dependent in two or more activities of daily living). About half (50.8%) expressed a preference for "no hospitalization and no resuscitation." Compared with other nursing homes populations, this cohort experienced a lower annual rate of hospital use (518 days/ 1000 residents) and a similar rate of mortality (23.8%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Integration of the efforts of physicians, nurse practitioners, and nursing home staff can lead to low rates of hospital use by nursing home residents. The effects on residents' quality of life and mortality require further study.

TI  - Performance of the MRI lesion pattern score in predicting neurological outcome after out of hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective cohort analysis
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundDespite advances in resuscitation practice, patient survival following cardiac arrest remains poor. The utilization of MRI in neurological outcome prognostication post-cardiac arrest is growing and various classifications has been proposed; however a consensus has yet to be established. MRI, though valuable, is resource-intensive, time-consuming, costly, and not universally available. This study aims to validate a MRI lesion pattern score in a cohort of out of hospital cardiac arrest patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Switzerland.MethodsThis cohort study spanned twelve months from February 2021 to January 2022, encompassing all unconscious patients aged >= 18 years who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of any cause and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. We included patients who underwent the neuroprognostication process, assessing the performance and validation of a MRI scoring system.ResultsOver the twelve-month period, 137 patients were admitted to the ICU, with 52 entering the neuroprognostication process and 47 undergoing MRI analysis. Among the 35 MRIs indicating severe hypoxic brain injury, 33 patients (94%) experienced an unfavourable outcome (UO), while ten (83%) of the twelve patients with no or minimal MRI lesions had a favourable outcome. This yielded a sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.83 for predicting UO with the proposed MRI scoring system. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.53 and 0.07, respectively, resulting in an accuracy of 91.49%.ConclusionWe demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLP scoring scheme in predicting neurological outcome in patients following cardiac arrest. However, to ensure a comprehensive neuroprognostication, MRI results need to be combined with other assessments. While neuroimaging is a promising objective tool for neuroprognostication, given the absence of sedation-related confounders-compared to electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical examination-the current lack of a validated scoring system necessitates further studies. Incorporating standardized MRI techniques and grading systems is crucial for advancing the reliability of neuroimaging for neuroprognostication.Trial Registration: Registry of all Projects in Switzerland (RAPS) 2020-01761.ConclusionWe demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLP scoring scheme in predicting neurological outcome in patients following cardiac arrest.

T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Utstein-style guidelines contribute to improved public health internationally by providing a structured framework with which to compare emergency medical services systems. Advances in resuscitation science, new insights into important predictors of outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and lessons learned from methodological research prompted this review and update of the 2004 Utstein guidelines. Representatives of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation developed an updated Utstein reporting framework iteratively by meeting face to face, by teleconference, and by Web survey during 2012 through 2014. Herein are recommendations for reporting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data elements were grouped by system factors, dispatch/recognition, patient variables, resuscitation/postresuscitation processes, and outcomes. Elements were classified as core or supplemental using a modified Delphi process primarily based on respondents' assessment of the evidence-based importance of capturing those elements, tempered by the challenges to collect them. New or modified elements reflected consensus on the need to account for emergency medical services system factors, increasing availability of automated external defibrillators, data collection processes, epidemiology trends, increasing use of dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emerging field treatments, postresuscitation care, prognostication tools, and trends in organ recovery. A standard reporting template is recommended to promote standardized reporting. This template facilitates reporting of the bystander-witnessed, shockable rhythm as a measure of emergency medical services system efficacy and all emergency medical services system-treated arrests as a measure of system effectiveness. Several additional important subgroups are identified that enable an estimate of the specific contribution of rhythm and bystander actions that are key determinants of outcome.

TI  - Opportunities and Risks of Resuscitation Attempts in Nursing Homes
T2  - DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: Data supporting decision-making regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in German nursing homes is insufficient.
   Methods: A retrospective evaluation of pre-hospital CPR was carried out with data from the German Resuscitation Registry (Deutsches Reanimationsregister) for the years 2011-2018. Patients under age 65 were excluded, as were patients from districts in which long-term data was available for less than 60% of patients. Subgroups were analyzed based on age and certain prehospital situations: patients treated outside nursing homes were used for comparison.
   Results: The study group consisted of 2900 patients. whose mean age was 83.7 years (standard deviation. 7.5 years). 1766 (60.9%) were women and 1134 (39.1%) were men. 118 patients (4.0%) were discharged alive, including 64 (2.2%) with a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2, 30 (1.0%) with an unknown CPC, and 24 (0.8%) with a CPC of 3 or 4. 902 patients (31.1%) died in the hospital, including five (0.2%) who died more than 30 days after resuscitation, 279 (9.6%) between 24 hours and 30 days. and 618 (21.3%) within 24 hours. 1880 patients (64.8%) died at the site of attempted resuscitation. In 1056 cases (36.4%). CPR was initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services. In the "initially shockable - subgroup. 13 of 208 patients (6.3%) were discharged alive with a CPC of 1 or 2.
   Conclusion: CPR can lead to a good neurological outcome in rare cases even when carried out in a nursing home. The large percentage of CPR attempts that were initiated only after a delay indicates that nursing home staff may often be uncertain how to proceed. Uncertainty among caregivers points to a potential for advance care planning.

TI  - Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol improves diagnosis and resuscitation recommendations for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
AB  - Objective: Despite recent efforts, most people are not trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which has a major impact on survival following cardiac arrest (CA). We have set up a dispatcher-assisted CPR protocol at our call centre, based on international guidelines issued in 2010. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of this protocol on CA diagnosis and quantity of recommendations given by telephone dispatchers to untrained witnesses.
   Methods: We performed a 'before and after' monocentric observational study. Data were compared before and a short time after (2 months) implementation of the protocol. We included patients presenting as an out-of-hospital CA in the presence of a witness untrained in CPR. Fisher's test was used to compare periods. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: During the 8 month period before the protocol, 115 victims were potentially eligible for CPR. Diagnosis was achieved in 63.5% of cases and CPR recommendations given in 6.1%. After implementation of the protocol, 130 victims were potentially eligible for CPR. Frequency of CA diagnosis was significantly higher after the protocol with 76% of cases (P = 0.0359). Frequency of CPR recommendations given to witnesses was also significantly higher after the protocol, with a fivefold increase up to 29.2% (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Implementation of a dispatcher-assisted CPR protocol was efficient in improving both CA diagnosis and CPR recommendations given to untrained witnesses for out-of-hospital CA with a very short time of dispatcher training. It is a simple and efficacious measure, at no additional cost and with the promises of improving prognosis following cardiac arrest in a centre not equipped with computerised dispatcher support programmes.

TI  - Smartwatch based automatic detection of out-of- hospital cardiac arrest: Study rationale and protocol of the HEART-SAFE project
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality. Immediate detection and treatment are of paramount importance for survival and good quality of life. The first link in the 'chain of survival' after OHCA - the early recognition and alerting of emergency medical services - is at the same time the weakest link as it entirely depends on witnesses. About one half of OHCA cases are unwitnessed, and victims of unwitnessed OHCA have virtually no chance of survival with good neurologic outcome. Also in case of a witnessed cardiac arrest, alerting of emergency medical services is often delayed for several minutes. Therefore, a technological solution to automatically detect cardiac arrests and to instantly trigger an emergency response has the potential to save thousands of lives per year and to greatly improve neurologic recovery and quality of life in survivors. The HEART-SAFE consortium, consisting of two academic centres and three companies in the Netherlands, collaborates to develop and implement a technical solution to reliably detect OHCA based on sensor signals derived from commercially available smartwatches using artificial intelligence. In this manuscript, we describe the rationale, the envisioned solution, as well as a protocol outline of the work packages involved in the development of the technology.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of a telephone intervention after an ICD
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term benefits of participating in a structured, 8-week educational telephone intervention delivered by expert cardiovascular nurses post-ICD. The intervention was aimed to (1) increase physical functioning, (2) increase psychological adjustment, (3) improve self-efficacy in managing the challenges of ICD recovery, and (4) lower levels of health care utilization over usual care in the first 12 months post-ICD, This article reports on the 6- and 12-month outcomes of the nursing intervention trial.
   Methods and Results: A two-group (N = 168) randomized control group design was used to evaluate intervention efficacy with persons receiving an ICD for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest. Measures were obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 months post hospitalization. Outcomes included (1) physical functioning (Patient Concerns Assessment [PCA], Short Form Health Survey [SF-12], ICD shocks), (2) psychological adjustment (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression [CES-D], fear of dying), (3) self-efficacy (Sudden Cardiac Arrest-Self-Efficacy [SCA-SE], Sudden Cardiac Arrest-Behavior [SCA-B], Sudden Cardiac Arrest-Knowledge [SCA-K]), and(4)health care utilization (emergency room [ER] visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). Using repeated measures ANOVA, the 6- and 12-month benefits of the intervention over usual care were in reductions in physical concerns (P = 0.006), anxiety (P = 0.04), and fear of dying (P = 0.01), with enhanced self-confidence (P = 0.04) and knowledge (P = 0.001) to manage ICD recovery There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on total outpatient visits, hospitalizations, or ER visits over 12 months.
   Conclusion: A structured 8-week post-hospital telephone nursing intervention after an ICD had sustained 12-month improvements on patient concerns, anxiety, fear of dying, self-efficacy, and knowledge. Results may not apply to individuals with congestive heart failure who receive an ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest.

AB  - When I began experiencing chest pain that was different from my usual heartburn symptoms, I denied I could possibly be having a heart attack, but chewed 4 baby aspirin just in case. Despite years of community education about the need to call 911 and seek immediate emergency care when experiencing signs and symptoms of a heart attack, more than 350,000 individuals experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2016. Of those, only 12% survived. Bystander recognition of cardiac arrest and prompt intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid defibrillation is essential for out-of-hospital survival. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have the right people with the right equipment in the right place at the right time. I don't know why, but I was one of the lucky ones.

TI  - Temperature Control in Acute Brain Injury: An Update
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Temperature control in severe acute brain injury (SABI) is a key component of acute management. This manuscript delves into the complex role of temperature management in SABI, encompassing conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and hypoxemic/ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest. Fever is a common complication in SABI and is linked to worse neurological outcomes due to increased inflammatory responses and intracranial pressure (ICP). Temperature management, particularly hypothermic temperature control (HTC), appears to mitigate these adverse effects primarily by reducing cerebral metabolic demand and dampening inflammatory pathways. However, the effectiveness of HTC varies across different SABI conditions. In the context of post-cardiac arrest, the impact of HTC on neurological outcomes has shown inconsistent results. In cases of TBI, HTC seems promising for reducing ICP, but its influence on long-term outcomes remains uncertain. For AIS, clinical trials have yet to conclusively demonstrate the benefits of HTC, despite encouraging preclinical evidence. This variability in efficacy is also observed in ICH, aSAH, bacterial meningitis, and status epilepticus. In pediatric and neonatal populations, while HTC shows significant benefits in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, its effectiveness in other brain injuries is mixed. Although the theoretical basis for employing temperature control, especially HTC, is strong, the clinical outcomes differ among various SABI subtypes. The current consensus indicates that fever prevention is beneficial across the board, but the application and effectiveness of HTC are more nuanced, underscoring the need for further research to establish optimal temperature management strategies. Here we provide an overview of the clinical evidence surrounding the use of temperature control in various types of SABI.

TI  - Effect of Therapeutic Hypothermia on Survival and Neurologic Outcome in the Elderly
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Old age is considered a negative prognostic factor after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The purpose of this study was to assess the benefit of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) on survival and neurologic outcome in the elderly. This is a retrospective study of patients treated for OHCA from April 2011 to August 2013 in a regional cardiac system. Patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are directed to designated cardiac receiving centers with established TH protocols. The decision to initiate TH is determined by the treating physician. All patients 65 years or older were identified. Patients were excluded if awake and responsive in the emergency department, died before hospital admission, or had preexisting coma. The adjusted odds ratio for survival with good neurologic outcome (defined as cerebral performance category [CPC] 1 or 2) was calculated for patients who received TH compared to a reference group without TH. There were 1612 patients, of whom 552 (34%) received TH. Median age was 78 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 71-85); 56% was male. 493 (31%) patients survived to hospital discharge, 266 (17%) with CPC of 1 or 2. Of 1292 patients considered for TH, 192 (25%) of 552 patients who received TH survived to hospital discharge and 97 (18%) with good neurologic outcome compared to 150 (20%) and 57 (8%), respectively, without TH. The adjusted odds ratio for survival with good neurologic outcome for TH was 2.0 (95% CI 1.3-3.3). TH is associated with improved neurologic outcome in the elderly population.

TI  - Types of brain dysfunction in critical illness
T2  - NEUROLOGIC CLINICS
AB  - Cerebral dysfunction and injury in the ICU presents as focal neurologic deficits, seizures, coma, and delirium. These syndromes may result from a primary brain insult, such as stroke or trauma, but commonly are a complication of a systemic insult, such as cardiac arrest, hypoxemia, sepsis, metabolic derangements, and pharmacologic exposures. Many survivors of critical illness have cognitive impairment, which is believed to underlie the poor long-term functional status and quality of life observed in many critical illness survivors. Although progress has been made in characterizing the epidemiology of cerebral dysfunction in the ICU, more research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms that might represent targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Interaction effects between highly-educated neighborhoods and dispatcher-provided instructions on provision of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Socioeconomic factors of a community are associated with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) rates and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study aimed to test whether dispatcher-provided CPR instruction modifies the association between education level of a community and provision of BCPR.
   Methods: A population-based observational study was conducted with OHCAs of cardiac etiology who were witnessed by laypersons between 2012 and 2013. Exposure variable was the proportion of highly-educated residents (high school graduates and higher) in a community categorized into quartile groups. Endpoints were provision of BCPR and early chest compression (<= 4 min of collapse, ECC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. A final model with an interaction term was evaluated to test interactive effects of community education level with dispatcher-provided CPR instruction.
   Results: A total of 10,694 OHCAs were analyzed. BCPR was performed in 5112 (47.8%), and early CPR was done in 3080 (28.8%). Compared with the highest educated communities, AORs (95% CIs) for BCPR were 0.84 (0.74-0.95) in higher, 0.78 (0.66-0.92) in lower, and 0.71 (0.60-0.85) in the lowest educated communities. For ECC, AORs (95% CIs) were 0.81 (0.66-0.99) in lower and 0.62 (0.50-0.76) in the lowest. In an interaction model of 4122 OHCA patients who received dispatcher-provided CPR instruction, OHCAs occurring in higher (AOR: 0.80 (0.67-0.96)), lower (AOR: 0.67 (0.52-0.87)), and the lowest (AOR: 0.59 (0.43-0.82)) were less likely to receive BCPR compared with the highest educated communities.
   Conclusion: OHCA patients in communities with a higher proportion of highly-educated residents were more likely to receive BCPR, and the disparity was more prominent in the group that received dispatcherprovided CPR instruction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neurological outcome after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for in-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundIn-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a major adverse event with a high mortality rate if not treated appropriately. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), as adjunct to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR), is a promising technique for IHCA treatment. Evidence pertaining to neurological outcomes after ECPR is still scarce.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive systematic search of all studies up to December 20, 2019. Our primary outcome was neurological outcome after ECPR at any moment after hospital discharge, defined by the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score. A score of 1 or 2 was defined as favourable outcome. Our secondary outcome was post-discharge mortality. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed.ResultsOur search yielded 1215 results, of which 19 studies were included in this systematic review. The average survival rate was 30% (95% CI 28-33%, I-2 =0%, p=0.24). In the surviving patients, the pooled percentage of favourable neurological outcome was 84% (95% CI 80-88%, I-2 =24%, p=0.90).ConclusionECPR as treatment for in-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with a large proportion of patients with good neurological outcome. The large proportion of favourable outcome could potentially be explained by the selection of patients for treatment using ECPR. Moreover, survival is higher than described in the conventional CPR literature. As indications for ECPR might extend to older or more fragile patient populations in the future, research should focus on increasing survival, while maintaining optimal neurological outcome.

TI  - Brain Monitoring in Critically Neurologically Impaired Patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Assessment of neurologic injury and the evolution of severe neurologic injury is limited in comatose or critically ill patients that lack a reliable neurologic examination. For common yet severe pathologies such as the comatose state after cardiac arrest, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), critical medical decisions are made on the basis of the neurologic injury. Decisions regarding active intensive care management, need for neurosurgical intervention, and withdrawal of care, depend on a reliable, high-quality assessment of the true state of neurologic injury, and have traditionally relied on limited assessments such as intracranial pressure monitoring and electroencephalogram. However, even within TBI there exists a spectrum of disease that is likely not captured by such limited monitoring and thus a more directed effort towards obtaining a more robust biophysical signature of the individual patient must be undertaken. In this review, multimodal monitoring including the most promising serum markers of neuronal injury, cerebral microdialysis, brain tissue oxygenation, and pressure reactivity index to access brain microenvironment will be discussed with their utility among specific pathologies that may help determine a more complete picture of the neurologic injury state for active intensive care management and long-term outcomes. Goal-directed therapy guided by a multi-modality approach appears to be superior to standard intracranial pressure (ICP) guided therapy and should be explored further across multiple pathologies. Future directions including the application of optogenetics to evaluate brain injury and recovery and even as an adjunct monitoring modality will also be discussed.

TI  - Late results of primary Esophageal repair for spontaneous rupture of the Esophagus (Boerhaave's syndrome)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SURGERY
AB  - Surgical management of Boerhaave's syndrome remains controversial. If left untreated, this is often a fatal condition. This was a retrospective review of cases operated on by one surgeon between 1981 and 1997. Eleven patients (8 males and 3 females), mean age of 63 years (range, 49-74 years), with Boerhaave's syndrome were treated surgically. A history of vomiting (10/11) and/or chest pain (11/11) was elicited in most cases, but only 3 of 11 cases were diagnosed correctly at presentation. From the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, the median delay was 30 hours (range, 6-1440 hours), and in 8 of 11 cases, the diagnosis was made >24 hours after the onset of symptoms. In all 11 cases, site of rupture was the lower one-third of the esophagus (9 to the left pleural cavity and 2 to the right pleural cavity). All cases were treated surgically after active initial resuscitation. The repair was further augmented by either a diaphragmatic flap (n = 1), bovine pericardial patch (n = 2), or Grillo pleural wrap (n = 8). A feeding jejunostomy was used in every case. Although the mean postoperative intensive care unit stay was only 1.8 days, the mean hospital stay was 37.5 days (range, 15-70 days). There were two hospital deaths (18%). After a mean follow-up of 12.5 years (range, 5-20 years), 7 of 11 patients (63%) are alive and asymptomatic. There was one death that was unrelated to the esophageal surgery. Only one patient reported dysphagia to solid food 5 years following primary esophageal repair. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical management has acceptable in-hospital mortality. This condition is associated with significant morbidity, but the long-term outlook for the survivors is very favorable.

TI  - Building a Cardiac Emergency Response Plan in a Large School District: Guide for Providers, Administrators, and Policymakers
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
AB  - Background Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in young athletes and a rare but devastating event in youth, often caused by undiagnosed structural cardiac anomalies, cardiomyopathies, or heritable channelopathies. Early detection, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are critical for improving survival and neurological outcomes.Contributions to Practice Grassroots organizations like Project ADAM, founded in 1999 at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, have been instrumental in raising awareness and guiding schools and communities in developing cardiac emergency response plans (CERPs) over the past two decades. Project ADAM was successfully implemented within Miami-Dade County Public Schools. In under 2 years, 100% of schools in the district achieved Heart Safe School recognition, with eight cardiac arrest incidents reported on Project ADAM-affiliated campuses. Seven victims survived without neurological impairment due to the prompt activation of Cardiac Emergency Response Teams (CERT).Implications for School Health Policy, Practice, and Equity Annual implementation of CERPs, including hands-on, in-person drills supported by school administrators, can significantly improve survival rates during cardiac emergencies.Conclusions The successful implementation of Project ADAM within Miami-Dade County Public Schools highlights the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, strategic planning, and ongoing education to overcome challenges and ensure long-term program sustainability.

TI  - Future directions in cardiocerebral resuscitation
T2  - PEDIATRIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is back. The science of resuscitation research has shown remarkable progress in the past several decades. A PubMed search with "resuscitation" as a keyword shows 1256 peer-reviewed manuscripts published in the year 1987, 2026 In 1997, and 2864 in 2007. Key studies now appear in top-tier journals, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, New; England Journal of Medicine, British Medical Journal, and Lancet. This progress was accompanied by an unprecedented growth of federal funding opportunities and an increase in the number of young investigators interested in and Supported to investigate the discipline of resuscitation science.
   The specific phase of cardiac arrest and resuscitation should dictate the timing, intensity, duration, and focus of interventions. Emerging data suggest that interventions that can improve short-term outcome during one phase may be deleterious during another. For instance, intense vasoconstriction during the low-flow phase of cardiac arrest may improve coronary perfusion pressure and probability of return of spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), but the same intense vasoconstriction during the postresuscitation phase may increase left ventricular afterload and worsen myocardial strain and dysfunction. Current Understanding of the physiology of cardiac arrest and recovery only enables the titration of blood pressure, global oxygen delivery and consumption. body temperature, inflammation, coagulation, and other physiologic parameters in all attempt to optimize outcome. Future strategies are likely to take advantage of emerging discoveries and knowledge of cellular inflammation, thrombosis, reperfusion, mediator cascades, cellular markers of injury and recovery, and transplantation technology.
   Important recent advances in resuscitation science include increased awareness of the importance of recognizing and preventing the progression of shock and respiratory failure to cardiac arrest; effective training and high-quality performance of CPR, deployment of CPR and early effective defibrillation using automated external defibrillator programs in public settings; applications of therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective strategy; and the implementation of goal-directed therapies, including extracorporeal therapies in selected postresuscitation settings. Most of these interventions result ill slow, stepwise, incremental progress contributing to improved survival outcomes for victims of sudden cardiac arrest. This progress is certainly likely to grow and evolve in the future. What are the emerging "hot topics" oil the horizon that represent paradigm shifts and "break-throughs" that could potentially provide a "quantum leap" in the quality of life outcomes for critically ill and injured children who require resuscitation? In this article, the authors highlight some of the plausible and potential future directions for pediatric resuscitation science. As Yogi Berra suggests, predicting the future is difficult and Subjective. Thus, an important objective of this review is to communicate the exciting potential for resuscitation science researchers, educators, clinicians, and communities to work together to save more lives. By working together. we can move from simply predicting the future to creating a practical yet evidence-based and personalized formula for survival.

TI  - Neurofilament Light Chain and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein as early prognostic biomarkers after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) are proteins released into the bloodstream upon hypoxic brain injury. We evaluated the biokinetics and examined the prognostic performance of serum NfL and GFAP in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. Furthermore, we compared the prognostic performance to that of serum Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE).Methods: This is a sub-study of the "Targeted temperature management for 48 vs 24 hours" (NCT01689077) trial. NfL and GFAP serum values from 82 patients were examined in blood samples collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours (h) after reaching target temperature of 33 +/- 1 degree celsius. This temperature was reached within a median of 281-320 minutes after intensive care unit admission. GFAP was analysed at 48 and 72 h. The neuroprognostic performance of NfL and GFAP was evaluated after 6 months follow-up.Results: NfL and GFAP values were significantly higher in patients with a poor outcome (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score 3-5) vs. good outcome (CPC 1-2). NfL 24 h: 1371.5 (462.0; 2125.1) vs. 24.8 (14.0; 61.6). GFAP 48 h: 1285.3 (843.9; 2236.7) vs. 361.2 (200.4; 665.6) (both p < 0.001). Both biomarkers were promising markers of poor functional outcome at 24 and 48 h respectively: NfL 24 h: AUROC 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91- 1.00). GFAP 48 h: AUROC 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.96). NfL and GFAP both predicted outcome better than NSE at 48 h (both p < 0.01). At 72 h NfL but butnot GFAP outperformed NSE (p= 0.01).Conclusion: Serum NfL and GFAP may be strong biomarkers of poor functional outcome after OHCA from an early timepoint.

TI  - The optic nerve sheath diameter as a useful tool for early prediction of outcome after cardiac arrest: A prospective pilot study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement could detect increased intracranial pressure, and might predict outcome in post-cardiac arrest (CA) patients. We assessed the ability of bedside ONSD ultrasonographic measurement performed within day 1 after CA occurrence to predict in-hospital survival in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
   Methods: In two French ICUs, a prospective study included all consecutive patients with CA without traumatic or neurological etiology, successfully resuscitated and TH-treated. ONSD measurements were performed on day 1, 2, and 3 (ONSD1, 2, 3 respectively) after return of spontaneous circulation. All records were registered according to Utstein style.
   Results: ONSD1, 2, 3 were assessed in 36, 21, and 14 patients respectively. 19/36 patients (53%) were discharged alive from hospital, including 14/36 (39%) with favorable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] score 1-2). Survivors and non-survivors were similar regarding age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, location and etiology of CA, simplified acute physiology score II, occurrence of post-CA shock, and clinical parameters collected during ONSD measurements. Median ONSD1 was significantly larger in non-survivors versus survivors (7.2 mm [interquartile: 6.8-7.4] versus 6.5 mm [interquartile: 6.0-6.8]; p = 0.008). After adjustment on predictive factors, ONSD1 was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 6.3; 95% CI [1.05-40] per mm of ONSD1 above 5.5 mm; p = 0.03), and CPC score (OR for 1 point increase in CPC score: 3.2; 95% CI [1.2-9.4] per mm of ONSD1 above 5.5 mm; p = 0.03). ONSD1 was significantly correlated with brain edema assessed by the cerebrum gray matter attenuation to white matter attenuation ratio, measured by the brain computed tomography scan performed on admission in 20 patients (Spearman rho = -0.5, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: ONSD seems a promising tool to early assess outcome in post-CA patients treated with TH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ACTIVATION OF PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY BY DICHLOROACETATE IMPROVES SURVIVAL AND NEUROLOGIC OUTCOMES AFTER CARDIAC ARREST IN RATS
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - No pharmacological interventions are currently available to provide neuroprotection for patients suffering from cardiac arrest. Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, which activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and increases cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production by promoting influx of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on post-resuscitation neurological injury in an asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model. Asphyxial cardiac arrest was established by endotracheal tube clamping. A total of 111 rats were randomized into three groups: Sham group, Control group, and DCA intervention group. Animals in DCA intervention group were intraperitoneally administered DCA with a loading dose of 80 mg/kg at 15 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whereas rats in the Control group received equivalent volume of saline. DCA treatment increased 3-day survival time, and reduced neurologic deficit scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after ROSC. It also attenuated cellular apoptosis and neuronal damage in the hippocampal cornuammonis one region by hematoxylin-eosin staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. In addition, DCA reduced the messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin 1 beta in brain hippocampus and cortex after ROSC. Furthermore, DCA treatment significantly increased ATP production, PDH activity, and decreased blood glucose, lactate, and brain pyruvate levels after ROSC. Our results suggested that DCA has neuroprotective effects on brain injury after cardiac arrest, and its salutary effects were associated with an increase of mitochondrial energy metabolism in the brain through activation of PDH activity.

   Methods: In the original cohort of 50 refractory angina patients treated with Reducer at San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) between March 2015 and August 2016, we reassessed angina symptoms, quality of life and recorded adverse events at 2-year (mean +/- SD: 748 +/- 84 days) follow-up.
   Results: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) score improved of >= 1 class in 34 patients (75.6%), and of >= 2 classes in 16 patients (35.6%), translating into a significant mean CCS score reduction at 2-year follow-up (1.74 +/- 0.86 vs. 2.98 +/- 0.52; p < 0.001). Four out of five Seattle Angina Questionnaire items improved significantly (p < 0.001 for all). Ten patients (22%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during follow-up, three for acute coronary syndromes. Five patients died, two for cardiovascular causes (stroke and cardiac arrest).
   Conclusions: Safety and efficacy observed in the short follow-up period after Reducer implantation are maintained at two years. Ten patients underwent PCI during follow-up, underlining that Reducer does not affect coronary artery disease progression. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - How effective is extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has gained increasing as a promising but resource-intensive intervention for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). There is little data to quantify the impact of this intervention and the patients likely to benefit from its use. We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the survival benefit associated with ECPR for OHCA. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify relevant observational studies and randomized control trials. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to assess studies' quality. We performed random-effects meta-analysis for the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge and used meta-regressions to assess heterogeneity. Results: We identified 1287 articles, reviewed the full text of 209 and included 44 in our meta-analysis. Our analysis included 3097 patients with OHCA. Patients' mean age was 52, 79% were male, and 60% had primary ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest. We identified a survival-to-discharge rate of 24%; 18% survived with favorable neurologic function. 30-and 90-days survival rates were both around 18%. The majority of included articles were high quality studies. Conclusions: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a promising but resource-intensive intervention that may increase rates of survival to hospital discharge among patients who experience OHCA.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes towards performing resuscitation among seniors - a population-based study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Cardiac arrest constitutes a critical medical emergency necessitating swift intervention to reinstate normal heart rhythm and prevent harm to vital organs. The pivotal role of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in influencing survival rates is well recognized. With older adults being the most common group to witness such events, it's curcial to understand their attitudes and knowledge about performing CPR. Additionally, understanding if health status has an influence can help in tailoring education for specific seniors needs.Methods A cross-sectional survey was sent to University of the Third Age (UTA) students. The survey comprised sections focusing on demographic data, CPR knowledge, automated external defibrillator (AED) knowledge, first aid training, and readiness to perform CPR and use AEDs. Participants' health conditions were also assessed through multiple-choice options.Results We received 456 responses. Significant awareness of emergency numbers and cardiac arrest recognition was revealed. However, knowledge gaps persisted, particularly in compression rates. Most participants comprehended AED usage, yet training primarily relied on theoretical approaches. Health conditions notably affected CPR readiness, with associations between specific chronic diseases and willingness to perform CPR.Conclusions Addressing knowledge gaps and tailoring education for elderly needs are crucial for improving survival rates. Future research should explore barriers to bystander CPR during out-of-hospital cardiac arrests to further enhance survival prospects.

TI  - Compression-Only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Course for Primary School Students: A Malaysian Pilot Study
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - The Malaysian national school curriculum currently lacks resources and tools to enforce CPR education. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator course among primary school students to increase their knowledge and technical skills and improve their attitudes. A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a pre-post non-equivalent design involving 38 students aged 10-12. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) knowledge, technical skills, and attitude towards CPR were assessed in a post test with three-month follow-up. Results of the MANOVA analysis showed significant differences in the level of knowledge (F = 10.29, p < 0.001) and attitude (F = 13.87, p < 0.001) based on the students' age group at the time of the post test. The proportion of students who passed the technical skills component differed significantly by age (chi(2) = 12.12; p = 0.002) and BMI (chi(2) = 6.34; p = 0.041). No significant decay was reported in the total mean scores for knowledge, technical skills, and attitude (F = 0.727, p = 0.54) at 3-month follow-up. The course helped students perform CPR and utilize AED effectively while promoting a positive attitude with up to 3 months of retention, demonstrating the feasibility of extending the course within the Malaysian primary school curriculum.

TI  - Narrative Review: Research Progress and Future Directions of Presepsin in Neurological Prognostication of Adult Post-Return of Spontaneous Circulation (Post-ROSC) Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION RESEARCH
AB  - The assessment of neurological prognosis in patients after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical challenge in critical care medicine. Current prognostic tools (eg, clinical scales, imaging, or traditional biomarkers) have limitations in early accuracy and specificity, leading to uncertainties in treatment decision-making and prognostic communication. Presepsin (soluble CD14 subtype), an emerging inflammation- and infection-related biomarker, has gained increasing attention due to its potential association with post-CPR neurological injury and functional recovery. To address the lack of a systematic synthesis of evidence in this field, this narrative review aims to summarize the biological characteristics of presepsin, its role in neurological prognostic assessment post-CPR, and the underlying mechanisms linking presepsin to neuroinflammation and brain injury. We conducted a narrative synthesis of clinical studies retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to (December 2025, focusing on studies correlating presepsin levels with validated neurological outcome scales. Core findings from synthesized evidence indicate that elevated presepsin levels, particularly within 24-72 hours after return of ROSC, show a consistent and significant association with poor neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 3-5) and higher mortality, and presepsin may serve as an independent prognostic factor complementary to existing tools. Major clinical implications include presepsin's potential utility in multimodal prognostic protocols, aiding in early and more accurate outcome prediction. However, significant research gaps persist, including a lack of large-scale, multicenter validation studies, standardized measurement timepoints, and consensus on optimal cutoff values. In conclusion, current evidence supports presepsin as a promising inflammatory biomarker for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest (CA). Future research must prioritize prospective validation in diverse cohorts and investigate its dynamic changes to establish its definitive role in clinical decision-making.

TI  - A Novel Assessment Using a Panoramic Video Camera of Resuscitation Quality in Patients following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - The assessment of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and teamwork quality in prehospital settings has always been challenging. Currently, commercialized quality-monitored chest pads and single-angle cameras are being used to monitor prehospital the resuscitation quality in patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, both these methods have drawbacks. In New Taipei City, we introduced the panoramic video camera as a novel method to assess the resuscitation quality of OHCA patients to monitor both technical skills and teamwork. The panoramic video camera enabled a comprehensive evaluation of prehospital resuscitation, thereby allowing team members to evaluate their performance by reviewing the video after resuscitation. This is the first step toward improving the evaluation of prehospital resuscitation. Using this panoramic video camera and a high-speed internet connection, real-time resuscitation feedback from the dispatch center or medical directors can be provided promptly, thus, making prehospital resuscitation safe and efficient.

TI  - Economic evaluation of nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing long-term psychosocial outcome: a comparison to care-as-usual
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To examine the cost-effectiveness of nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing psychosocial outcome at 6 months post stroke, compared with care-as-usual. Design Economic evaluation within a comparative effectiveness research design. Setting Primary care (2016-2017) and community settings (2011-2013) in the Netherlands. Participants Persons who suffered from ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or a transient ischaemic attack and were discharged home after visiting the emergency department, hospitalisation or inpatient rehabilitation. Interventions Nurse-led stroke aftercare at 6 months post stroke addressing psychosocial functioning by providing screening, psycho-education, emotional support and referral to specialist care when needed. Care-as-usual concerned routine follow-up care including secondary prevention programmes and a consultation with the neurologist at 6 weeks post stroke. Primary and secondary outcome measures Main outcome measure of cost-effectiveness was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated by the quality of life measured by the five-dimensional, three-level EuroQol. Costs were assessed using a cost-questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and social participation (Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation) restrictions subscale. Results Health outcomes were significantly better in stroke aftercare for QALYs (Delta=0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09) and social participation (Delta=4.91; 95% CI 1.89 to 7.93) compared with care-as-usual. Total societal costs were euro1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95% CI -euro3881 to euro6057). Healthcare costs were in total euro1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95% CI -euro3881 to euro6057). Average costs of stroke aftercare were euro91 (SD=euro3.20) per person. Base case cost-effectiveness analyses showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro24 679 per QALY gained. Probability of stroke aftercare being cost-effective was 64% on a euro50 000 willingness-to-pay level. Conclusions Nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing psychosocial functioning showed to be a low-cost intervention and is likely to be a cost-effective addition to care-as-usual. It plays an important role by screening and addressing psychosocial problem, not covered by usual care.

TI  - Minimizing pre- and post-shock pauses during the use of an automatic external defibrillator by two different voice prompt protocols. A randomized controlled trial of a bundle of measures
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Previous large retrospective analyses have found an association between duration of peri-shock pauses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and survival. In a randomized trial, we tested whether shortening these pauses improves survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Methods: Patients with OHCA between May 2006 and January 2014 with shockable initial rhythm, treated by first responders, were randomized to two automated external defibrillator (AED) treatment protocols. In the control protocol AEDs performed post-shock analysis and prompted rescuers to a pulse check (Guidelines 2000). In the experimental protocol a 15 s period of CPR during and after charging of the AED was added to the voice prompts and CPR was resumed immediately after defibrillation (modification of the Guidelines 2005). Survival was assessed at hospital admission and discharge.
   Results: Of 1174 OHCA patients, 456 met the inclusion criteria: 227 were randomly assigned to the experimental protocol and 229 to the control protocol. The experimental group experienced shorter pre-shock pauses (6 [5-11] s vs. 20 [18-23] s; P < 0.001), and shorter post-shock pauses (7 [6-9] s vs. 27 [16-34] s; P < 0.001). Similar proportions of patients survived to hospital admission (experimental: 62% vs. control: 65%; RR [95% CI] 0.96 [0.83-1.10], P = 0.51), and hospital discharge (experimental: 42% vs. control: 38%; RR [95% CI] 1.09 [0.87-1.37], P = 0.46).
   Conclusion: In patients with OHCA and shockable initial rhythms, treatment with AEDs with the experimental protocol shortened pre-shock and post-shock CPR pauses, and increased overall CPR time, but did not improve survival to hospital admission or discharge.

TI  - Chest Compressions Cause Recurrence of Ventricular Fibrillation After the First Successful Conversion by Defibrillation in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background-Unlike Resuscitation Guidelines (GL) 2000, GL2005 advise resuming cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately after defibrillation. We hypothesized that immediate CPR resumption promotes earlier recurrence of ventricular fibrillation (VF).
   Methods and Results-This study used data of a prospective per-patient randomized controlled trial. Automated external defibrillators used by first responders were randomized to either (1) perform postshock analysis and prompt rescuers to a pulse check (GL2000), or (2) resume CPR immediately after defibrillation (GL2005). Continuous recordings of ECG and impedance signals were collected from all patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to whom a randomized automated external defibrillator was applied. We included patients with VF as their initial rhythm in whom CPR onset could be determined from the ECG and impedance signals. Time intervals are presented as median (Q1-to-Q3). Of 361 patients, 136 met the inclusion criteria: 68 were randomly assigned to GL2000 and 68 to GL2005. Rescuers resumed CPR 30 (21-to-39) and 8 (7-to-9) seconds, respectively, after the first shock that successfully terminated VF (P<0.001); VF recurred after 40 (21-to-76) and 21 (10-to-80) seconds, respectively (P<0.001). The time interval between start of CPR and VF recurrence was 6 (0-to-67) and 8 (3-to-61) seconds, respectively (P=0.88). The hazard ratio for VF recurrence in the first 2 seconds of CPR was 15.5 (95% confidence interval, 5.63 to 57.7) compared with before CPR resumption. After more than 8 seconds of CPR, the hazard of VF recurrence was similar to before CPR resumption.
   Conclusions-Early CPR resumption after defibrillation causes early VF recurrence.

TI  - Cerebral oxygenation monitoring in patients during and after cardiac arrest-- a narrative review of current methods and evidence
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is a leading cause of mortality in post-cardiac arrest (post-CA) patients who successfully survive the initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but later die in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Therefore, a key priority of post-resuscitation ICU care is to prevent and limit the impact of HIBI by optimizing the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and demand. Traditionally, an optimal systemic oxygen balance is considered to ensure the brain's oxygen balance. However, the validity of this assumption is uncertain, as the brain constitutes only 2% of the body mass while accounting for approximately 20% of basal oxygen consumption at rest. Hence, there is a real need to monitor cerebral oxygenation realistically. Several imaging and bedside monitoring methods are available for cerebral oxygenation monitoring in post-CA patients. Unfortunately, each of them has its limitations. Imaging methods require transporting a critically ill unstable patient to the scanner. Moreover, they provide an assessment of the oxygenation state only at a particular moment, while brain oxygenation is dynamic. Bedside methods, specifically near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2), and jugular venous oxygen saturation monitoring (SjvO2), have not often been used in studies involving post-CA patients. Hence there is ambiguity regarding clear recommendations for using these bedside monitors. Presently, the most promising option seems to be using the NIRS as an indicator of effective CPR. We present a narrative review focusing on bedside methods and discuss the evidence for their use in adult patients after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Contemporary Practices in Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Narrative Review
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains a major cause of adult mortality worldwide, with survival to hospital discharge rates around 10%. Despite advances in prehospital care, rapid recognition and high-quality chest compressions are the primary interventions, while early defibrillation is one of the few measures shown to improve survival. This literature review examines novel interventions for patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, focusing on double sequential defibrillation, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Evidence suggests that double sequential defibrillation may improve survival to discharge in refractory ventricular fibrillation, but consensus and large-scale validation are lacking. Beta-blockers show promise for increasing the rates of return of spontaneous circulation and favourable neurological outcomes, yet robust evidence is still needed. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, particularly when initiated rapidly in selected patients, can enhance survival and neurological outcomes, though studies show mixed results and highlight the importance of patient selection and system readiness. Overall, while these interventions offer potential, their widespread adoption requires further high-quality research to determine efficacy, optimal protocols, and resource implications in both prehospital and emergency department settings.

TI  - Canagliflozin Pretreatment Attenuates Myocardial Dysfunction and Improves Postcardiac Arrest Outcomes After Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Mice
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS AND THERAPY
AB  - Objective The SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, not only reduces glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes but also exerts cardioprotective effects in individuals without diabetes. However, its potential beneficial effects in cardiac arrest have not been characterized. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of canagliflozin pretreatment on postresuscitation-induced cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Methods Male C57/BL6 mice were randomized to vehicle (sham and control) or canagliflozin treatment groups. All mice except for the sham-operated mice were subjected to potassium chloride-induced cardiac arrest followed by chest compressions and intravenous epinephrine for resuscitation. Canagliflozin therapy efficacies were evaluated by electrocardiogram, echocardiography, histological analysis, inflammatory response, serum markers of myocardial injury, protein phosphorylation analysis, and immunohistological assessment. Results Canagliflozin-pretreated mice exhibited a higher survival rate (P < 0.05), a shorter return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) time (P < 0.01) and a higher neurological score (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001) than control mice after resuscitation. Canagliflozin was effective at improving cardiac arrest and resuscitation-associated cardiac dysfunction, indicated by increased left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening (P < 0.001). Canagliflozin reduced serum levels of LDH, CK-MB and alpha-HBDH, ameliorated systemic inflammatory response, and diminished the incidence of early resuscitation-induced arrhythmia. Notably, canagliflozin promoted phosphorylation of cardiac STAT-3 postresuscitation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of STAT-3 by Ag490 blunted STAT-3 phosphorylation and abolished the cardioprotective actions of canagliflozin. Conclusions Canagliflozin offered a strong cardioprotective effect against cardiac arrest and resuscitation-induced cardiac dysfunction. This canagliflozin-induced cardioprotection is mediated by the STAT-3-dependent cell-survival signaling pathway.

TI  - Intranasal post-cardiac arrest treatment with orexin-A facilitates arousal from coma and ameliorates neuroinflammation
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) entails significant risks of coma resulting in poor neurological and behavioral outcomes after resuscitation. Significant subsequent morbidity and mortality in post-CA patients are largely due to the cerebral and cardiac dysfunction that accompanies prolonged whole-body ischemia post-CA syndrome (PCAS). PCAS results in strong inflammatory responses including neuroinflammation response leading to poor outcome. Currently, there are no proven neuroprotective therapies to improve post-CA outcomes apart from therapeutic hypothermia. Furthermore, there are no acceptable approaches to promote cortical or cognitive arousal following successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hypothalamic orexinergic pathway is responsible for arousal and it is negatively affected by neuroinflammation. However, whether activation of the orexinergic pathway can curtail neuroinflammation is unknown. We hypothesize that targeting the orexinergic pathway via intranasal orexin-A (ORXA) treatment will enhance arousal from coma and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in improved functional outcome after resuscitation. We used a highly validated CA rat model to determine the effects of intranasal ORXA treatment 30-minute post resuscitation. At 4hrs post-CA, the mRNA levels of proinflammatory markers (IL1 beta, iNOS, TNF-alpha, GFAP, CD11b) and orexin receptors (ORX1R and ORX2R) were examined in different brain regions. CA dramatically increased proinflammatory markers in all brain regions particularly in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Post-CA intranasal ORXA treatment significantly ameliorated the CA-induced neuroinflammatory markers in the hypothalamus. ORXA administration increased production of orexin receptors (ORX1R and ORX2R) particularly in hypothalamus. In addition, ORXA also resulted in early arousal as measured by quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) markers, and recovery of the associated behavioral neurologic deficit scale score (NDS). Our results indicate that intranasal delivery of ORXA post-CA has an anti-inflammatory effect and accelerates cortical EEG and behavioral recovery. Beneficial outcomes from intranasal ORXA treatment lay the groundwork for therapeutic clinical approach to treating post-CA coma.

TI  - Clinical outcome after surgical correction of mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is an infrequent but catastrophic complication of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although always considered, surgical treatment is often denied because of high operative mortality. Moreover, the effects of surgery for PMR on long-term outcome, particularly compared with expected outcome after MI, are undefined.
   Methods and Results-Fifty-four consecutive patients (age, 70 +/- 8 years; 74% male) underwent mitral surgery for post-MI PMR from January 1980 through December 2000. Severe presentation (cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, or cardiac arrest) was noted in 91% preoperatively. Performance of coronary artery bypass graft was associated with lower operative mortality (odds ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.83; P = 0.011), whereas there was a trend for lower mortality after surgery after 1990 (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.3). Thus, operative mortality (overall, 18.5%) decreased from 67% up to 1990 without coronary artery bypass graft to 8.7% after 1990 with coronary artery bypass graft. Overall 5-year survival was 65 +/- 7%, and survival free of congestive heart failure was 52 +/- 7%. Five-year survival of 30-day operative survivors was 79 +/- 4%, identical (P = 0.24) to that of matched controls with MI (similar age, sex, ejection fraction, MI location, and MI year). Survival free of congestive heart failure was similar in PMR cases and MI controls (10-year survival, 28 +/- 8% versus 36 +/- 6%; P = 0.46).
   Conclusions-Surgery for post-MI PMR involves a notable operative mortality, but there are recent trends for lower operative risk, particularly with associated coronary artery bypass graft. Long term after surgery, outcome is restored to that of similar MI without PMR. These encouraging observations emphasize the importance of prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapeutic approach for patients incurring PMR after MI.

TI  - Prediction of cognitive dysfunction after resuscitation - a systematic review
T2  - POSTEPY W KARDIOLOGII INTERWENCYJNEJ
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) due to cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries. It is estimated that over 350,000 people in Europe suffer from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. According to the literature, the longer the episode of cardiac arrest, the greater the risk of cognitive impairment, especially short-term memory, as well as immediate and delayed recall. Other common dysfunctions include attention deficits and executive function disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize current research on cognitive impairment in patients after sudden cardiac arrest. The electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, OVID, Web of Science, and EBSCO were searched using the following key words: 'sudden cardiac arrest', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment', 'functional outcome', 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation'. The most recent studies from the last 7 years (2011-2018) were included. Cognitive disorders occurred in a broad range of cases: from 13% to even 100%. In one study, cognitive deficits did not occur at all. Amongst the reviewed articles only two studies were carried out on a large group of patients. The remaining studies were conducted on a small group of respondents; therefore there was no possibility to generalize the results to the entire population. The areas in which the most cognitive impairment occurred were memory, executive functions and visual-motor skills. One of the conclusions derived from the reviewed literature is the importance of continuous training of cognitive functions, especially for people with cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Lay Bystanders' Perspectives on What Facilitates Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Use of Automated External Defibrillators in Real Cardiac Arrests
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background-Many patients who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest will fail to receive bystander intervention (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] or defibrillation) despite widespread CPR training and the dissemination of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). We sought to investigate what factors encourage lay bystanders to initiate CPR and AED use in a cohort of bystanders previously trained in CPR techniques who were present at an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods and Results-One-hundred and twenty-eight semistructured qualitative interviews with CPR-trained lay bystanders to consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, where an AED was present were conducted (from January 2012 to April 2015, in Denmark). Purposive maximum variation sampling was used to establish the breadth of the bystander perspective. Twenty-six of the 128 interviews were chosen for further in-depth analyses, until data saturation. We used cross-sectional indexing (using software), and inductive in-depth thematic analyses, to identify those factors that facilitated CPR and AED use. In addition to prior hands-on CPR training, the following were described as facilitators: prior knowledge that intervention is crucial in improving survival, cannot cause substantial harm, and that the AED will provide guidance through CPR; prior hands-on training in AED use; during CPR performance, teamwork (ie, support), using the AED voice prompt and a ventilation mask, as well as demonstrating leadership and feeling a moral obligation to act.
   Conclusions-Several factors other than previous hands-on CPR training facilitate lay bystander instigation of CPR and AED use. The recognition and modification of these factors may increase lay bystander CPR rates and patient survival following an out-ofhospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Outcome Reports: Update of the Utstein Resuscitation Registry Templates for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest A Statement for Healthcare Professionals From a Task Force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (American Heart Association, European Resuscitation Council, Australian and New Zealand Council on Resuscitation, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, InterAmerican Heart Foundation, Resuscitation Council of Southern Africa, Resuscitation Council of Asia); and the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the Council on Cardiopulmonary, Critical Care, Perioperative and Resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Utstein-style guidelines contribute to improved public health internationally by providing a structured framework with which to compare emergency medical services systems. Advances in resuscitation science, new insights into important predictors of outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and lessons learned from methodological research prompted this review and update of the 2004 Utstein guidelines. Representatives of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation developed an updated Utstein reporting framework iteratively by meeting face to face, by teleconference, and by Web survey during 2012 through 2014. Herein are recommendations for reporting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data elements were grouped by system factors, dispatch/recognition, patient variables, resuscitation/postresuscitation processes, and outcomes. Elements were classified as core or supplemental using a modified Delphi process primarily based on respondents' assessment of the evidence-based importance of capturing those elements, tempered by the challenges to collect them. New or modified elements reflected consensus on the need to account for emergency medical services system factors, increasing availability of automated external defibrillators, data collection processes, epidemiology trends, increasing use of dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emerging field treatments, postresuscitation care, prognostication tools, and trends in organ recovery. A standard reporting template is recommended to promote standardized reporting. This template facilitates reporting of the bystander-witnessed, shockable rhythm as a measure of emergency medical services system efficacy and all emergency medical services system-treated arrests as a measure of system effectiveness. Several additional important subgroups are identified that enable an estimate of the specific contribution of rhythm and bystander actions that are key determinants of outcome.

TI  - Fuzzy and Sample Entropies as Predictors of Patient Survival Using Short Ventricular Fibrillation Recordings during out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ENTROPY
AB  - Optimal defibrillation timing guided by ventricular fibrillation (VF) waveform analysis would contribute to improved survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients by minimizing myocardial damage caused by futile defibrillation shocks and minimizing interruptions to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recently, fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) tailored to jointly measure VF amplitude and regularity has been shown to be an efficient defibrillation success predictor. In this study, 734 shocks from 296 OHCA patients (50 survivors) were analyzed, and the embedding dimension (m) and matching tolerance (r) for FuzzyEn and sample entropy (SampEn) were adjusted to predict defibrillation success and patient survival. Entropies were significantly larger in successful shocks and in survivors, and when compared to the available methods, FuzzyEn presented the best prediction results, marginally outperforming SampEn. The sensitivity and specificity of FuzzyEn were 83.3% and 76.7% when predicting defibrillation success, and 83.7% and 73.5% for patient survival. Sensitivities and specificities were two points above those of the best available methods, and the prediction accuracy was kept even for VF intervals as short as 2s. These results suggest that FuzzyEn and SampEn may be promising tools for optimizing the defibrillation time and predicting patient survival in OHCA patients presenting VF.

TI  - Post Cardiac Arrest Care in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Cardiac arrests constitute a leading cause of mortality in the adult population and cardiologists are often tasked with the management of patients following cardiac arrest either as a consultant or primary provider in the cardiac intensive care unit. Familiarity with evidence-based practice for post-cardiac arrest care is a requisite for optimizing outcomes in this highly morbid group. This review will highlight important concepts necessary to managing these patients.
   Recent Findings Emerging evidence has further elucidated optimal care of post-arrest patients including timing for routine coronary angiography, utility of therapeutic hypothermia, permissive hypercapnia, and empiric aspiration pneumonia treatment.
   Summary The complicated state of multi-organ failure following cardiac arrest needs to be carefully optimized by the clinician to prevent further neurologic injury and promote systemic recovery. Future studies should be aimed at understanding if these findings extend to specific patient populations, especially those at the highest risk for poor outcomes.

TI  - Community first responders for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and children (Review)
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Mobilization of community first responders (CFRs) to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) event has been proposed as a means of shortening the interval from occurrence of cardiac arrest to performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, thereby increasing patient survival.
   Objectives
   To assess the effect of mobilizing community first responders (CFRs) to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in adults and children older than four weeks of age, in terms of survival and neurological function.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases for relevant trials in January 2019: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, and we scanned the abstracts of conference proceedings of the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials (RCTs and q-RCTs) that compared routine emergency medical services (EMS) care versus EMS care plus mobilization of CFRs in instances of OHCA.Trials with randomization by cluster were eligible for inclusion, including cluster-design studies with intervention cross-over.
   In some communities, the statutory ambulance service/EMS is routinely provided by the local fire service. For the purposes of this review, this group represents the statutory ambulance service/EMS, as distinct from CFRs, and was not included as an eligible intervention.
   We did not include studies primarily focused on opportunistic bystanders. Individuals who were present at the scene of an OHCA event and who performed CPR according to telephone instruction provided by EMS call takers were not considered to be CFRs.
   Studies primarily assessing the impact of specific additional interventions such as administration of naloxone in narcotic overdose or adrenaline in anaphylaxis were also excluded.
   We included adults and children older than four weeks of age who had experienced an OHCA.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently reviewed all titles and abstracts received to assess potential eligibility, using set inclusion criteria. We obtained and examined in detail full-text copies of all papers considered potentially eligible, and we approached authors of trials for additional information when necessary. We summarized the process of study selection in a PRISMA flowchart.
   Three review authors independently extracted relevant data using a standard data extraction form and assessed the validity of each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus.
   We synthesized findings in narrative fashion due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. We used the principles of the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes and to construct a 'Summary of findings' table.
   Main results
   We found two completed studies involving a total of 1136 participants that ultimately met our inclusion criteria. We also found one ongoing study and one planned study. We noted significant heterogeneity in the characteristics of interventions and outcomes measured or reported across these studies, thus we could not pool study results.
   One completed study considered the dispatch of police and fire service CFRs equipped with automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in an EMS system in Amsterdam and surrounding areas. This study was an RCT with allocation made by cluster according to non overlapping geographical regions. It was conducted between 5 January 2000 and 5 January 2002. All participants were 18 years of age or older and had experienced witnessed OHCA. The study found no difference in survival at hospital discharge (odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.2; 1 RCT; 469 participants; low-certainty evidence), despite the observation that all 72 incidences of defibrillation performed before EMS arrival occurred in the intervention group (OR and 95% CI - not applicable; 1 RCT; 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This study reported increased survival to hospital admission in the intervention group (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0; 1 RCT; 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
   The second completed study considered the dispatch of nearby lay volunteers in Stockholm, Sweden, who were trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This represented a supplementary CFR intervention in an EMS system where police and fire services were already routinely dispatched to OHCA in addition to EMS ambulances. This study, an RCT, included both witnessed and unwitnessed OHCA and was conducted between 1 April 2012 and 1 December 2013. Participants included adults and children eight years of age and older. Researchers found no difference in 30-day survival (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.29; 1 RCT; 612 participants; low-certainty evidence), despite a significant increase in CPR performed before EMS arrival (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.03; 1 RCT; 665 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
   Neither of the included completed studies considered neurological function at hospital discharge or at 30 days, measured by cerebral performance category or by any other means. Neither of the included completed studies considered health-related quality of life. The overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes of included studies was low to moderate.
   Authors' conclusions
   Moderate-certainty evidence shows that context-specific CFR interventions result in increased rates of CPR or defibrillation performed before EMS arrival. It remains uncertain whether this can translate to significantly increased rates of overall patient survival. When possible, further high-quality RCTs that are adequately powered to measure changes in survival should be conducted.
   The included studies did not consider survival with good neurological function. This outcome is likely to be important to patients and should be included routinely wherever survival is measured.
   We identified one ongoing study and one planned trial whose results once available may change the results of this review. As this review was limited to randomized and quasi-randomized trials, we may have missed some important data from other study types.
   PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
   Community first responders for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and children
   Review question
   To assess the effect of mobilizing community first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in adults and children older than four weeks of age, in terms of survival and neurological function.
   Background
   Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a major cause of death. It occurs when a person's heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, and it is often caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. A person who suffers cardiac arrest will die within minutes unless this rhythm can be reversed.
   A safe, portable, and affordable device called a 'defibrillator' can be used to terminate ('defibrillate') the abnormal rhythm causing cardiac arrest, allowing the heart to restart. A defibrillator can be used by almost anyone, even without training. To be effective, a defibrillator must be used within minutes of a cardiac arrest.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a technique where a bystander can compress and release the chest of a person who has suffered cardiac arrest, thus artificially pumping blood throughout the body. CPR can keep a cardiac arrest victim alive until a defibrillator arrives, but again it is effective only if started very soon after cardiac arrest occurs.
   CPR and defibrillation are the most important interventions following cardiac arrest. Even the most advanced emergency medical systems in the world struggle to reach cardiac arrest victims in time to save life by providing CPR and defibrillation.
   To shorten the time from cardiac arrest to CPR and defibrillation, healthcare systems have started to mobilize community first responders to provide these treatments. Community first responders are fellow citizens who are present in the community and have received minimum basic training in CPR/defibrillator use. They are generally alerted to cardiac arrest by the emergency medical services.
   Study characteristics
   This review searched for high-quality research studies that considered whether mobilizing community first responders could improve survival or neurological outcome, or both, following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and children. We last searched available databases in January 2019.
   Key results
   We found two eligible research studies with a total of 1136 participants.
   One study conducted in Stockholm, Sweden, and funded by the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, Laerdal Foundation, and Stockholm County, found that mobilizing community first responders increased the rate of CPR performed before arrival of emergency medical services (data on 665 participants). The other study was conducted in Amsterdam and surrounding areas (the Netherlands) and was funded by the Netherlands Heart Foundation and Medtronic Physio-Control. Study authors reported that when community first responders were mobilized, more patients received defibrillation before emergency medical services arrived and survived to be admitted to hospital (data on 469 participants).
   Neither study found that dispatching community first responders resulted in significantly more overall survivors (data on 612 participants in one study and on 469 participants in the other). Neither study reported on the neurological function of survivors or on their health related quality of life.
   Further research is needed to establish whether mobilizing community first responders can yield more survivors of cardiac arrest. Future research should consider both survival and the neurological function of survivors.
   Certainty of the evidence
   The certainty of available evidence in terms of overall patient survival was considered low. The certainty of available evidence in terms of performance of CPR and defibrillation before arrival of emergency medical services and in terms of survival to hospital admission was considered moderate. This evidence is current to January 2019.

TI  - Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral performance after cardiac arrest-A pilot study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: Prognosticationmaybe difficult in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is potentially useful in the prediction of neurological outcome, and it may detect acute ischemia at an early stage. In a pilot setting we determined the prevalence and development of cerebral ischemia using serial MRI examinations and neurological assessment.
   Methods: Ten witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were included. MRI was carried out approximately 2 h after admission to the hospital, repeated after 24 h of therapeutic hypothermia and 96 h after the arrest. The images were assessed for development of acute ischemic lesions. Neurophysiological and cognitive tests as well as a self-reported quality-of-life questionnaire, Short Form-36 (SF-36), were administered minimum 12 months after discharge.
   Results: None of the patients had acute cerebral ischemia on MRI at admission. Three patients developed ischemic lesions after therapeutic hypothermia. There was a change in the apparent diffusion coefficient, which significantly correlated with the temperature (p < 0.001). The neurophysiological tests appeared normal. The patients scored significantly better on SF 36 than the controls as regards both bodily pain (p = 0.023) and mental health (p = 0.016).
   Conclusions: MRI performed in an early phase after cardiac arrest has limitations, as MRI performed after 24 and 96 h revealed ischemic lesions not detectable on admission. ADC was related to the core temperature, and not to the volume distributed intravenously. Follow-up neurophysiologic tests and self-reported quality of life were good. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Solving fatigue-related problems with cardiac arrest survivors living in the community
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The aim was to describe fatigue-related problems reported by post-cardiac arrest adults with chronic fatigue and energy conservation strategies generated using an Energy Conservation plus Problem Solving Therapy intervention.
   Methods: Following an introduction to the intervention process outlined in a Participant Workbook, participants engaged in the telephone intervention by identifying one to two fatigue-related problems. They then brainstormed with the interventionist to identify potential strategies to reduce fatigue, tested them, and either modified the strategies or moved to the next problem over three to five sessions.
   Results: Eighteen cardiac arrest survivors with chronic fatigue identified instrumental activities of daily living and leisure activities as fatigue-related activities more frequently than basic activities of daily living. Energy Conservation strategies used most frequently were: plan ahead, pace yourself, delegate to others, and simplify the task.
   Conclusion: Post-cardiac arrest adults living in the community with chronic fatigue can return to previous daily activities by using energy conservation strategies such as planning ahead, pacing tasks, delegating tasks, and simplifying tasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Challenges with Formulating Accurate Prognosis for Patients with Severe Acute Brain Injury
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Prognostication is fundamental to determining the intensity of care offered for many critically ill patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI). Inherent uncertainties linked to predicting outcomes for patients with SABI primarily arise from a lack of complete data regarding the natural disease/injury progression that follows various forms of SABI, stemming from early withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. This potential bias has led to limitations in using outcome data associated with clinical grading scales and a risk of perpetuating high mortality following SABI, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. The aims of this article are to (1) review contemporary prognostication practices among clinicians for patients with SABI, (2) discuss inherent challenges in prognosticating outcomes following SABI, (3) summarize statements and guidelines from professional societies regarding SABI prognostication, and (4) identify directions for future research in prognostication after SABI.

TI  - Location of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and the awareness time interval: a nationwide observational study
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Aims A short awareness time interval (ATI, time from witnessing the arrest to calling for help) and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are important factors affecting neurological recovery after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study investigated the association of the location of OHCA with the length of ATI and bystander CPR.
   Methods This population-based observational study used the nationwide Korea OHCA database and included all adults with layperson-witnessed OHCA with presumed cardiac aetiology between 2013 and 2017. The exposure was the location of OHCA (public places, private housing and nursing facilities). The primary outcome was short ATI, defined as <4 min from witnessing to calling for emergency medical service (EMS). The secondary outcome was the frequency of provision of bystander CPR. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of location of OHCA with study outcomes.
   Results Of 30 373 eligible OHCAs, 66.6% occurred in private housing, 24.0% occurred in public places and 9.4% occurred in nursing facilities. In 67.3% of the cases, EMS was activated within 4 min of collapse, most frequently in public places (public places 77.0%, private housing 64.2% and nursing facilities 64.8%; p<0.01). The overall rate of bystander CPR was 65.5% with highest in nursing facilities (77.0%), followed by public places (70.1%) and private housing 62.3%; p<0.01). Compared with public places, the adjusted ORs (AORs) (95% CIs) for a short ATI were 0.58 (0.54 to 0.62) in private housing and 0.62 (0.56 to 0.69) in nursing facilities. The AORs (95% CIs) for bystander CPR were 0.75 (0.71 to 0.80) in private housing and 1.57 (1.41 to 1.75) in nursing facilities.
   Conclusion OHCAs in private housing and nursing facilities were less likely to have immediate EMS activation after collapse than in public places. A public education is needed to increase the awareness of necessity of prompt EMS activation.

TI  - The ventricular fibrillation waveform in relation to shock success in early vs. late phases of out-of-hospital resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) of the ventricular fibrillation (VF) waveform predicts shock success and clinical outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Recently, also AMSA-changes demonstrated prognostic value. Until now, most studies focused on early shocks, while many patients require prolonged resuscitations. We studied AMSA and its changes in relation to shock success, for both the early and later phase of resuscitation.
   Methods: Per-shock VF-waveform analysis of a prospective OHCA-cohort (Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The absolute AMSA and relative AMSA-changes (DAMSA) were calculated from three-second VF-segments prior to defibrillation. Shocks were categorised as early (# 1-3) or late (# 4-8). Shock success was defined as return of organised rhythm.
   Results: Shock success was 46% for early (131/286) and 52% for late shocks (85/162), p = 0.18. Early shock success varied from 23% to 70% with increasing quartiles of AMSA (p-trend<0.001). For late shocks, there also was an association with AMSA, with a narrower range in shock success from 43% to 68% (p-trend = 0.04). Higher values of DAMSA were associated with shock success in the early, but not in the later phase.
   Conclusion: AMSA relates to shock success during the entire resuscitation, but associations were most apparent for early shocks. AMSA-changes were also associated with shock success, but only in the early phase of resuscitation. In an era of smart defibrillators, absolute AMSA and relative changes hold promise for studies on early guidance of resuscitation, whereas additional studies are warranted to further characterize shock prediction in the later phase.

TI  - Increasing first responder CPR during resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using automated external defibrillators
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: Evidence supports that increasing the balance of "hands-on" CPR may improve survival in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We assessed whether training and/or AED reconfiguration was associated with an increase in the proportion of time during which CPR was performed between first and second stacks of shocks.
   Methods: The investigation was a cohort study of 291 persons who suffered ventricular fibrillation OHCA and were treated with at least two stacks of AED shocks by emergency medical services (EMS) first-tier responders. In January 2003, first-tier providers were retrained regarding the importance of CPR. In addition, a subset of AEDs was reconfigured to remove continuous fibrillation detection and its associated voice prompts as to be comparable with other AED models. The amount of time spent on CPR was assessed through review of AED electronic and audio recordings to compare the pre-intervention (n = 241) and post-intervention periods (n = 50). Results: The proportion of time spent performing hands-on CPR between first and second stacks of shocks was 0.40 in the pre-intervention period compared to 0.51 in the post-intervention period (p=0.001). The difference was greatest for AEDs where EMS was retrained and the AED reconfigured (0.33 versus 0.50, p=0.01). No difference in survival was detected between the pre- and post-interve ntion periods (24.9% versus 28. 0%, p = 0.65).
   Conclusions: An intervention consisting of retraining and AED reconfiguration was associated with an increase in the proportion of time spent performing CPR between first and second stacks of shocks by first-tier EMS. Whether this increase improves patient outcomes requires additional study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automated external defibrillators and the link to first responder systems
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Automated external defibrillators are a very effective treatment to convert ventricular fibrillation (VF) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The purpose of this paper is to review recent publications related to automated external defibrillators (AEDs).
   Recent findings
   Much of the recent research focus on ways to utilize publicly available AEDs included in different national/regional registers. More and more research present positive associations between engaging volunteers to increase the use of AEDs. There are only a few recent studies focusing on professional first responders such as fire fighters/police with mixed results. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) lacks clinical data and is therefore difficult to evaluate. On-site use of AED shows high survival rates but suffers from low incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Summary
   The use of public AEDs in OHCA are still low. Systems focusing on engaging volunteers in the cardiac arrest response have shown to be associated with higher AED usage. Dispatching drones equipped with AEDs is promising, but research lacks clinical data. On-site defibrillation is associated with high survival rates but is not available for most cardiac arrests.

TI  - Release velocity ImprovemenT with a new Metronome guIding chest COmpressions: The RITMICO simulation study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background and trial design: Outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest vary significantly, often due to the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provided. Automated real-time feedback devices have been explored to enhance CPR skills, but few devices currently ensure proper chest recoil. This study aimed to assess whether a double-click metronome could improve chest compressions (CC) metrics and particularly CC release velocity (CCRV) during CPR manikin simulation. Methods: We developed and tested a double-click metronome for CPR, where the first click signals the compression and the second click marks the end of chest release. We performed a multicenter non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial including volunteers with different levels of CPR expertise. Three CC metrics-depth, rate, and CCRV-were measured using an automated external defibrillator equipped with pads for CPR quality analysis. Results: 503 volunteers participated in the study, with 54% being male and a mean age of 34 +/- 12 years. The median CCRV and CC depth achieved with the double-click metronome were significantly higher compared to the standard metronome (median difference 6 mm/s, IQR-15.2, 28.5, +1.5%, p < 0.001; median difference 0.1 cm, +2.5%, IQR -0.1, 0.4, p < 0.001). The double-click metronome led to significant improvements in CC depth and CCRV across all volunteer categories, with the greater effect observed in first responders and in non-specialized healthcare personnel. Conclusions: Compared to a standard metronome, the double-click metronome significantly enhances CPR quality. If further validated in real resuscitations, this new audio prompt could be a valuable tool for integration into devices designed for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation, as well as a training tool to improve CPR quality.

TI  - A shift towards targeted post-ICU treatment: Multidisciplinary care for cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivorship comprises a burgeoning area of critical care medicine, largely due to our improved understanding of and concern for patients' recovery trajectory, and efforts to mitigate the post-acute complications of critical illness. Expansion of care beyond hospitalization is necessary, yet evidence for postICU clinics remains limited and mixed, as both interventions and target populations studied to date are too heterogenous to meaningfully demonstrate efficacy. Here, we briefly present the existing evidence and limitations related to post-ICU clinics, identify cardiac arrest survivors as a unique ICU subpopulation warranting further investigation and treatment, and propose a clinical framework that addresses the multifaceted needs of this well-defined patient population.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of a national public access defibrillation programme
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Proposed Irish legislation aimed at increasing survival from out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest (OHCA) mandates the provision of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in a comprehensive range of publicly accessible premises in urban and rural areas. This study estimated the clinical and cost effectiveness of the legislation, compared with alternative programme configurations involving more targeted AED placement.
   Methods: We used a cost-utility analysis to estimate the costs and consequences of public access defibrillation (PAD) programmes from a societal perspective, based on AED deployment by building type. Comparator programmes ranged from those that only included building types with the highest incidence of OHCA, to the comprehensive programme outline in the proposed legislation. Data on OHCA incidence and outcomes were obtained from the Irish Out-of-Hospital-Cardiac-Arrest Register (OHCAR). Costs were obtained from the Irish health service, device suppliers and training providers.
   Results: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the most comprehensive PAD scheme was (sic)928,450/QALY. The ICER for the most scaled-back programme involving AED placement in transport stations, medical practices, entertainment venues, schools (excluding primary) and fitness facilities was (sic)95,640/QALY. A 40% increase in AED utilisation when OHCAs occur in a public area could potentially render this programme cost effective.
   Conclusion: National PAD programmes involving widespread deployment of static AEDs are unlikely to be cost-effective. To improve cost-effectiveness any prospective programmes should target locations with the highest incidence of OHCA and be supported by efforts to increase AED utilisation, such as improving public awareness, increasing CPR and AED training, and establishing an EMS-linked AED register.

TI  - Cost Analysis From a Randomized Comparison of Immediate Versus Delayed Angiography After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - BACKGROUND In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation, immediate coronary angiography did not improve clinical outcomes when compared with delayed angiography in the COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) trial. Whether 1 of the 2 strategies has benefits in terms of health care resource use and costs is currently unknown. We assess the health care resource use and costs in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 538 patients were randomly assigned to a strategy of either immediate or delayed coronary angiography. Detailed health care resource use and cost-prices were collected from the initial hospital episode. A generalized linear model and a gamma distribution were performed. Generic quality of life was measured with the RAND-36 and collected at 12-month follow-up. Overall total mean costs were similar between both groups (EUR 33 575 +/- 19 612 versus EUR 33 880 +/- 21 044; P=0.86). Generalized linear model: (beta, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.894-1.099; P=0.86). Mean procedural costs (coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft) were higher in the immediate angiography group (EUR 4384 +/- 3447 versus EUR 3028 +/- 4220; P<0.001). Costs concerning intensive care unit and ward stay did not show any significant difference. The RAND-36 questionnaire did not differ between both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS The mean total costs between patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest randomly assigned to an immediate angiography or a delayed invasive strategy were similar during the initial hospital stay. With respect to the higher invasive procedure costs in the immediate group, a strategy awaiting neurological recovery followed by coronary angiography and planned revascularization may be considered.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors need both cardiological and neurological rehabilitation!
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Most survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) suffer from cardiologic symptoms and approximately half of them experience cognitive problems because of hypoxic brain damage. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are also common. This review aims to give an overview of recent literature on rehabilitation treatment aiming at improvement of quality of life after OHCA.
   Recent findings
   Existing cognitive screening tools are now validated for OHCA survivors. OHCA patients with cognitive deficits may have lower exercise capacity. Cardiac rehabilitation seems to be well tolerated for OHCA survivors, with outcomes comparable to myocardial infarction patients. Many caregivers suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder and emotional stress. Interventions for them are available. Implementation of integrated programs covering both cognitive and cardiac rehabilitation is hampered by lack of knowledge and organizational barriers.
   Summary
   OHCA survivors should be routinely screened for cognitive and emotional problems. When patients with mild cognitive deficits participate in cardiac rehabilitation, their program should be adjusted to their cognitive abilities. For patients with severe cognitive or emotional problems, individualized rehabilitation seems favorable. Integrated rehabilitation treatment between cardiac and cognitive rehabilitation departments is recommended. Attention should be paid to the burden of caregivers.

TI  - Clinical value of miR-191-5p in predicting the neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background The diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNAs (miRNA) in human disease has been confirmed in a number of clinical studies. Aims The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of miR-191-5p in the neurological outcome of patients recovering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods A total of 260 patients undergoing the target temperature management trial were analyzed. The expression level of serum miR-191-5p was detected by qRT-PCR at 48 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). ROC curve was established to evaluate the ability of miR-191-5p as a biomarker for predicting adverse neurological outcomes after OHCA. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were used for survival analysis. Results One hundred eighteen patients (45%) had poor neurological outcomes at 6 months. The expression level of serum miR-191-5p in patients with poor neurological outcomes was significantly lower than that in patients with good neurological prognosis (P < 0.001) and was not associated with TTM trial. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the ROC curve were 0.899, 84.7%, and 82.4%, respectively, suggesting that the level of miR-191-5p had the ability to predict neurological outcome. By the end of the experiment, 88 patients (34%) were dead. Results of survival analysis showed that lower miR-191-5p expression level was significantly associated with lower survival rate (HR: 0.344, 95% CI = 0.208-0.567, P < 0.001). Conclusions The level of miR-191-5p was down-regulated in patients with poor neurological outcomes, and it could be used as a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome and survival after OHCA.

TI  - Better prognostic value with combined optic nerve sheath diameter and grey-to-white matter ratio on initial brain computed tomography in post-cardiac arrest patients
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and grey-to-white matter (GWR) either alone or in combination in patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest (CA).
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective single centre study of post cardiac arrest patients treated with TTM. ONSD and GWR on brain computed tomography (CT) was measured by two emergency physicians. We analysed the prognostic performance and cut offs of GWR and ONSD, singly and in combination in predicting poor neurologic outcome (CPC 3-5).
   Results: Of the 119 patients studied, 74 patients showed poor outcome. The combination of ONSD and GWR significantly (p = 0.002) improved prognostic performance (AUROC 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58-0.76, p < 0.001) in predicting poor neurologic outcomes rather than each ONSD (AUROC 0.59, 95% CI: 0.50-0.68, p = 0.08) or GWR (AUROC 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.74, p = 0.002) alone. A combined cut off of 'GWR and ONSD (1.16 and 4.9)' and 'GWR or ONSD (1.13 or 6.5)' improved the sensitivity for predicting poor outcome while maintaining high specificity compared to GWR alone.
   Conclusion: The combination of ONSD and GWR yielded improved prognostic value for predicting poor neurologic outcomes in post cardiac arrest patients treated with TTM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The offer they can't refuse: parents and perinatal treatment decisions
T2  - SEMINARS IN FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
AB  - Despite a widespread myth of parental autonomy in decision-making for extremely preterm neonates, families in the United States are often not given access to accurate information about the consequences of preterm birth, resuscitation and treatment, or about their ethical options. Professional, philosophical, and financial incentives for hospitals and neonatologists to provide intensive treatment may trump parental wishes in delivery rooms and neonatal units. Parents may also be intimidated by the atmosphere of intensive care and by the behavior of committed staff. Prenatal advance directives allow parents to receive information on outcomes, treatments, and options, including palliative care, 'on their own turf' and as a part of routine prenatal counseling. The use of directives and other techniques for transparency in obstetric and neonatal care could improve the process of informed parental choice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: In addition to the directly attributed mortality, COVID-19 is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this systematic review, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Methods: We searched PubMed, BioMedCentral, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during the pandemic and a non-pandemic period. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints were bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favourable neurological outcome. Results: We identified six studies. In two studies, rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge decreased significantly during the pandemic. Especially in Europe, bystander-witnessed cases, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation attempted by emergency medical services were reduced during the pandemic. Also, ambulance response times were significantly delayed across all studies and patients presenting with non-shockable rhythms increased in two studies. In 2020, 3.9-5.9% of tested patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4.8-26% had suggestive symptoms (fever and cough or dyspnoea). Conclusions: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had worse short-term outcomes during the pandemic than a non-pandemic period suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from lockdown and disruption of healthcare systems. Patients at high risk of deterioration should be identified outside the hospital to promptly initiate treatment and reduce fatalities. Study registration PROSPERO CRD42020195794.

TI  - Pre-arrest predictors of survival after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the elderly a systematic review
T2  - BMC GERIATRICS
AB  - Background: To enable older people to make decisions about the appropriateness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), information is needed about the predictive value of pre-arrest factors such as comorbidity, functional and cognitive status on survival and quality of life of survivors. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify pre-arrest predictors for survival, quality of life and functional outcomes after out-of-hospital (OHC) CPR in the elderly.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE (through May 2011) and included studies that described adults aged 70 years and over needing CPR after OHC cardiac arrest. Prognostic factors associated with survival to discharge and quality of life of survivors were extracted. Two authors independently appraised the quality of each of the included studies. When possible a meta-analysis of odd's ratios was performed.
   Results: Twenty-three studies were included (n = 44,582). There was substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity and reporting was often inadequate. The pooled survival to discharge in patients > 70 years was 4.1% (95% CI 3.0-5.6%). Several studies showed that increasing age was significantly associated with worse survival, but the predictive value of comorbidity was investigated in only one study. In another study, nursing home residency was independently associated with decreased chances of survival. Only a few small studies showed that age is negatively associated with a good quality of life of survivors. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of possible predictors due to a wide variety in reporting and statistical methods.
   Conclusions: Although older patients have a lower chance of survival after CPR in univariate analysis (i.e. 4.1%), older age alone does not seem to be a good criterion for denying patients CPR. Evidence for the predictive value of comorbidities and for the predictive value of age on quality of life of survivors is scarce. Future studies should use uniform methods for reporting data and pre-arrest factors to increase the available evidence about pre arrest factors on the chance of survival. Furthermore, patient-specific outcomes such as quality of life and post-arrest cognitive function should be investigated too.

TI  - Reduced effectiveness of hypothermia in patients lacking the wave V in auditory brainstem responses immediately following resuscitation from cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: Therapeutic hypothermia appears to improve the outcome of pre-hospital cardio-pulmonary arrest (COA) in patients with an initial cardiac rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or nonperfusing ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT). Notwithstanding, the outcome of this procedure is certainly difficult to predict based solely on the initial rhythm. The aim of the present study was to predict the outcome using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) in CPA patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
   Design and setting: A prospective observational study in the intensive care unit of a university hospital.
   Patients: The study included 26 patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital CPA.
   Interventions: Basic and advanced cardiac life support, intensive care and post-resuscitative hypothermia.
   Measurement and results: ABRs were recorded immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An ABR wave V was recorded in 16 patients. Among 8 patients with a favourable outcome, the initial rhythms were VF/VT in 6 patients and other rhythms in 2. All 10 patients without a detectable ABR wave V had an unfavourable outcome. The VF/VT as the initial arrest rhythm and the presence of wave V were significantly (p=0.0095) correlated with a favourable outcome. The presence of wave V had a 100% sensitivity to a favourable outcome.
   Conclusion: The absence of the ABR wave V in the early phase after ROSC wave indicated a reduced effect of therapeutic hypothermia, even in cases that underwent hypothermia promptly after out-of-hospital CPA. Measurement of ABRs appears to be useful as a predictor of effectiveness and as a criterion for determining the indication for therapeutic hypothermia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE CLINICAL-STUDY MECHANISM FOR RESUSCITATION RESEARCH
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Recent experimental and [human] clinical studies of cardiac arrest, suggesting a brain damage ameliorating effect of thiopental loading, stimulated the development of an international randomized clinical trial of brain resuscitation. Twelve collaborating hospitals in 9 countries tested the efficacy of post-cardiac arrest thiopental loading (30 mg/kg body wt). The methodology for assessing insult and outcome data, as well as risk and benefit monitoring, is described. This clinical trial will be completed in 1983 and is expected to provide valuable data about the efficacy of thiopental loading. The study mechanism is now well-established and ready for the evaluation of future promising brain resuscitation therapies.

TI  - Cardiac arrest and resuscitation with an automatic mechanical chest compression device (LUCAS) due to anaphylaxis of a woman receiving caesarean section because of pre-eclampsia
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - We report a case of anaphylaxis with pulseless electrical activity (PEA)(verified by ECG and a radial intra-arterial line) in a 30-year-old woman who received 3G Promiten (dextran-1) and a prophylactic intra-venous infusion of Macrodex (dextran) for postoperative thromboembolism during caesarean section for pre-eclampsia in the 24th week of gestation. Manual chest compressions, followed by mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS, Jotife, Lund, Sweden), were performed for 50min before restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). She awoke the next day with no sequelae. She had some suction cup marks on the sternum but otherwise no complications of the chest compressions. At follow up by phone 1 month later, she and her baby were doing well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Epilepsy-related deaths: An Australian survey of the experiences and needs of people bereaved by epilepsy
T2  - SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY
AB  - Purpose: This study explores the experiences and needs of bereaved family and friends following an epilepsy-related death in Australia.
   Method: An online survey was used to collect demographic details of the person with epilepsy, epilepsy status, time since the death, satisfaction with service providers at the time of death, follow-up support, perceptions on how well the death was explained, and gaps in support or services.
   Results: The survey was completed by 101 respondents describing 90 deceased individuals. Mean age at death was 32.1 years, with causes of death including SUDEP, epilepsy, drowning, cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, and motor vehicle accidents. Over half of the respondents indicated that they did not know, prior to the death, people could die of epilepsy. In addition, 38% indicated the death had not been adequately explained to them. Comments revealed services and supports which should be available following a death, and recommendations for existing epilepsy support services which might help to prevent future deaths.
   Conclusion: Findings highlight the need to improve community understanding and support for those affected by epilepsy and to promote informed risk assessment and communication amongst patients, families and health professionals. People bereaved by epilepsy require both immediate and long-term epilepsy-specific information and support from professionals, informal communities and peer supporters.

TI  - Life-sustaining treatment limitation in intensive care for very old patients
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
AB  - Old patients have higher risk of death during the ICU stay, in the hospital and after discharge. When they survive, they may suffer from long-term sequel, including loss of functional autonomy and poor quality of life, and they often represent a heavy burden for the caregivers. All these factors contribute to more frequent decisions to limit and stop treatment (LST) in old patients compared to younger patients. The work-up of this decision has an impact on the ICU team and the family members. Collegiality, timing, transparency, objectivity are keys to prevent conflict, complicated griefs, and allow for the grieving process. This review explores limitation of life-sustaining treatments in the ICU: determinants, timing, impact. The shared decision-making model between the patient, his family and the healthcare team should be promoted. In a situation of prognostic uncertainty, the doubt must benefit the patient and an admission decision must be taken. After a few days, additional information could be col-lected and the evolution under treatment evaluated. During a family conference, it is decided collectively whether or not to continue active treatments. It is the concept of time-limited trial that applies particularly well to elderly patients.

TI  - The Future of Emergency Medicine (EM) Sim Cases: A Modified Massive Online Needs Assessment
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - ObjectiveEmergency Medicine (EM) Sim Cases was initially developed in 2015 as a free open-access simulation resource. To ensure the future of EM Sim Cases remains relevant and up to date, we performed a needs assessment to better define our audience and facilitate long-term goals.MethodsWe delivered a survey using a modified massive-online-needs-assessment methodology through an iterative process with simulation experts from the EM Simulation Educators Research Collaborative. We distributed the survey via email and Twitter and analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. ResultsWe obtained 106 responses. EM Sim Cases is commonly used by physicians primarily as an educational resource for postgraduate level trainees. Perceived needs included resuscitation, pediatrics, trauma, and toxicology content. Prompted needs included non-simulation-case educational resources, increased case database, and improved website organization.ConclusionsData collected from our needs assessment has defined our audience allowing us to design our long-term goals and strategies.

TI  - Management of ECMO
T2  - EKSTRAKORPORAL MEMBRAN OKSIJENIZASYONU-EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION
AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used to promote circulation in patients with heart failure who do not respond to known therapies. In patients who have undergone ECMO because of congenital heart disease, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and other causes, the survival rate is 23-71%. Anticoagulation should be managed by ECMO specialists in the patient undergoing ECMO. Differences between adult and pediatric cardiac ECMO management should be well known. In order to perform ECMO safely and successfully, extreme care, expertise, long-term clinical care and patience are required. Patient selection depends on both the patient's condition and the adequacy of the team and clinic to perform this task. Early consultation, transport and the expert team are crucial for the survival of the patient. Ideally, ECMO should be performed in experienced centers.

TI  - Medical Management of Left Ventricular Assist Device Patients: A Practical Guide for the Nonexpert Clinician
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide short- or long-term circulatory support to improve survival and reduce morbidity in selected patients with advanced heart failure. LVADs are being used increasingly and now have expanded indications. Health care providers across specialties will therefore not only encounter LVAD patients but play an integral role in their care. To accomplish that, they need to understand the elements of LVAD function, physiology and clinical use. This article provides a concise overview of the medical management of LVAD patients for nonexpert clinicians. Our presentation includes the basics of LVAD physiology, design, and operation, patient selection and assessment, medical management, adverse event identification and management, multidisciplinary care, and management of special circumstances, such as noncardiac surgery, cardiac arrest, and end-of-life care. The clinical examination of LVAD patients is unique in terms of blood pressure and heart rate assessment, LVAD "hum" auscultation, driveline and insertion site inspection, and device parameter recording. Important potential device-related adverse events include stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematologic disorders, device infection, LVAD dysfunction, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Special considerations include the approach to the unconscious or pulseless patient, noncardiac surgery, and palliative care. An understanding of the principles presented in this paper will enable the nonexpert clinician to be effective in collaborating with an LVAD center in the assessment, medical management, and follow-up of LVAD patients. Future opportunities and challenges include the improvement of device designs, greater application of minimally invasive surgical implantation techniques, and management of health economics in cost-constrained systems like those of Canada and many other jurisdictions.

TI  - QUALITY-OF-LIFE AFTER CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Objectives: This study evaluates the influence of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) on the components of quality of life (QOL) of patients after discharge from the hospital.
   Design: Extracted from a prospective national survey on Dutch intensive care units (ICUs).
   Setting: Thirty-six ICUs of both university and nonuniversity hospitals, spread throughout the country.
   Methods: For a period of 6 months, 9,803 consecutive ICU admissions entered the study. Outcome in connection with in-hospital CPR was analyzed by comparing the CPR group (n=477) with a standardized control group without CPR (n=500).
   Interventions: Activities of daily living were registered at the time of hospital admission. A record was kept of each patient for demographics, severity of illness,length of stay, daily use of manpower and ICU technology, and mortality. Six months after hospital discharge, the QOL of 69 patients in both the CPR and control groups was measured with the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP).
   Results: CPR was performed in 4.8 percent of the patients, mainly from the general ward. These patients were older, had a higher severity of illness, and a higher daily consumption of nursing resources. The QOL did not correlate with severity of illness on admission, length of stay, or consumption of resources in the ICU. On the whole, the SIP scores of both CPR and control groups did not differ much: 11.7 vs 10.7, and circulatory arrest did not appear to impair the self-sufficiency in the study group significantly in comparison with the controls. An increased dysfunction was found in the CPR group of patients concerning their work and their psychosocial functioning.
   Conclusion: Patients who have recovered from a circulatory arrest after CPR resuscitation find their capacity for resuming work diminished after discharge from the hospital, while they seem to experience a postponed negative effect on their mental functioning, especially the functions connected with the awareness of their environment.

TI  - Acute Kidney Injury in Children: Current Understanding and Future Directions
T2  - CURRENT PEDIATRICS REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewAcute kidney injury (AKI) in children is a common and serious condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality and risk of long-term adverse outcomes. Although historically under-recognized, pediatric AKI is now better defined using standardized international criteria, including pRIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO, which have improved epidemiologic insights and early detection. However, despite the advances in AKI detection and management, there continues to be a high burden of both short and long term morbidity in AKI survivors.Recent FindingsKey developments in the sphere of AKI centre around earlier detection and institution of management. This has been advanced through novel biomarkers, including CysC, NGAL, TIMP-2 and IGFBP7. Furthermore, genetic susceptibility of AKI is an emerging field with recent genome-wide association studies. Timely recognition and supportive management remain the cornerstone of therapy, with escalation to kidney replacement therapy (KRT), particularly continuous modalities.SummaryThis review aims to highlight the important advances in pediatric AKI epidemiology, diagnosis, management and prognosis.
   Pediatric Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) management requires a comprehensive, targeted approach that takes into consideration the hemodynamic stability, metabolic and electrolyte derangements, and nutritional requirements to promote recovery. Fluid management is fundamental, noting resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids is warranted in hypovolemic patients. The clinical goal is for euvolemia while avoiding fluid overload, which can worsen the outcome. Dynamic clinical assessment, in combination with serum biomarkers, is key to effective therapy. Electrolyte abnormalities, notably hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis, necessitate prompt correction to prevent life-threatening complications. Supportive management includes potassium binders, bicarbonate therapy, judicious use of diuretics in volume overloaded states and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Nutritional support addresses the catabolic states of AKI. Increasing caloric intake and protein provision to at least 3g/kg/day in critically ill patients is essential to meet the high catabolic state and to maintain nitrogen balance despite elevated urea levels. Electrolyte restricted diet and binders may also be required for hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, fluid overload unresponsive to diuretics, or overt uremic complications (e.g., encephalopathy, pericarditis).

TI  - Evaluation of Confidence and Knowledge Regarding Chest Compression Training Among Children at a Health Promotion Event
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) significantly increases out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates. Early CPR implementation and public education are essential for everyone, including children. Despite challenges such as ensuring proper chest compression depth in children, early CPR training at school is beneficial and supported by various studies. However, few studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CPR training for children in environments outside of school, such as health festivals. We conducted chest compression training for children under 15 years who attended a hospital festival and evaluated the changes in their confidence and knowledge of the training. Methods This study evaluated chest compression training in children under 15 years old at a hospital festival. Participants included preschoolers to junior high school students. Training effectiveness was assessed using pre- and post-training questionnaires to measure confidence in and knowledge of chest compressions. Data were analyzed using the chi 2 test to compare responses before and after training, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The training involved a 10-minute hands-only session using CPR mannequins conducted by paramedics, doctors, and nursing students. Results The study included 180 children (51% male, 49% female). Only 14% had prior CPR training. After CPR training, significant improvements in confidence and knowledge regarding chest compressions were observed among preschool and elementary school students. The overall correct response rate increased from 51% to 97% for the location and from 59% to 92% for the depth of chest compressions. Discussion This study evaluated CPR training for children at a hospital festival and showed that few children have experience with CPR training. Our CPR training improved children's confidence and knowledge of chest compressions. Despite concerns about the strength of younger children in effective chest compressions, preschool, and elementary school children showed high motivation and capability. This study highlights the importance of early CPR education supported by both school and health festival initiatives. The limitations include the short training duration and lack of automated external defibrillator instructions. Conclusion We confirmed that CPR training at a hospital festival improves children's knowledge and confidence. Future large-scale studies are needed to evaluate long-term retention and broader age ranges.

TI  - Higher versus lower mean arterial blood pressure after cardiac arrest and resuscitation (MAP-CARE): A protocol for a randomized clinical trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - BackgroundIn patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest, a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) may increase cerebral perfusion and attenuate hypoxic brain injury. Here we present the protocol of the mean arterial pressure after cardiac arrest and resuscitation (MAP-CARE) trial aiming to investigate the influence of MAP targets on patient outcomes.MethodsMAP-CARE is one component of the Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation (STEPCARE) 2 x 2 x 2 factorial randomized trial. The MAP-CARE trial is an international, multicenter, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, superiority trial designed to test the hypothesis that targeting a higher (>85 mmHg) (intervention) versus a lower (>65 mmHg) (comparator) MAP after resuscitation from cardiac arrest reduces 6-month mortality (primary outcome). Trial participants are adults with sustained return of spontaneous circulation who are comatose following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The two other components of the STEPCARE trial evaluate sedation and temperature control strategies. Apart from the STEPCARE trial interventions, all other aspects of general intensive care will be according to the local practices of the participating site. Neurological prognostication will be performed according to European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines by a physician blinded to allocation group. The sample size of 3500 participants provides 90% power with an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 5.6 absolute risk reduction in 6-month mortality, assuming a mortality of 60% in the control group. Secondary outcomes will be poor functional outcome 6 months after randomization, patient-reported overall health 6 months after randomization, and the proportion of participants with predefined severe adverse events.ConclusionThe MAP-CARE trial will investigate if targeting a higher MAP compared to a lower MAP during intensive care of adults who are comatose following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest reduces 6-month mortality.

TI  - Incidence and impact of urogenital sequelae in women following pelvic-ring injuries: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
AB  - Purpose Pelvic-ring injuries in women often result in urinary dysfunction owing to the proximity of pelvic organs to the urinary tract, significantly affecting quality of life. However, detailed research on urinary sequelae remains limited. This study aimed to assess the incidence of urinary dysfunction in women after pelvic-ring injuries and to identify risk factors influencing urinary function. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent osteosynthesis for pelvic-ring injuries between January 2022 and June 2023 with >= 12 months of follow-up. Urinary dysfunction was evaluated using the Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis and Female Urinary Symptom Score at one, three, six and 12 months postoperatively. Results Fifty-eight patients (mean age, 43.2 years) were included, with motor-vehicle collisions being the most common cause for pelvic-ring injuries (74.1%). Most injuries (84.5%) were classified as Type B. Nearly half of the patients reported urinary symptoms one month post-surgery, which significantly improved over 12 months (P < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, greater injury severity was independently associated with urinary dysfunction at six months (adjusted odds ratio: 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.12, p = 0.049), while no other clinical or procedural factors, including age, arterial embolisation, or surgical approach, stayed significant. Functional recovery correlated with reduced symptoms over time. Conclusion Urinary dysfunction is a frequent but under-recognised complication after pelvic-ring injuries. Although most patients experience gradual improvement over time, greater injury severity is independently associated with early urinary symptoms. Continuous monitoring and timely rehabilitation may help optimise long-term functional recovery.

TI  - Informal caregivers' roles and needs regarding shared decision-making in severe aortic stenosis
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
AB  - Objective: To provide insight into experiences, preferences and needs of informal caregivers (ICs) regarding shared decision-making (SDM) in severe aortic stenosis (AS) of patients >= 70 years, and the effect of the level of perceived SDM on ICs' quality of life (QOL) and distress. Methods: Multiple methods study consisting of a questionnaire at baseline and 3-month follow-up and focus groups. Results: Ninety-nine ICs (67.6 +/- 11.7 years) completed the baseline questionnaire, eighty-two ICs the follow-up questionnaire, ten ICs (70.6 +/- 12.6 years) participated in two focus groups. ICs perceived that identifying them as discussion partners and addressing patients' daily lives were least discussed with professionals (26.3 %; 59.6 %). Most ICs (63.9 %) preferred a collaborative decision-making (DM) role. The level of perceived SDM was positively associated with baseline QOL social relations (p = .038), and follow-up QOL psychological health (p = .048) and environment (p = .024). ICs experienced three roles in SDM: supporters in DM, stimulators in clarifying patient's personal context, and DM partners. Conclusion: ICs play valuable roles in SDM for severe AS, but feel professionals do not consistently identify them as discussion partners. Practice implications: Professionals should involve ICs in SDM for discussing older patient's QOL and personal context, which can inform personalized decisions regarding severe AS treatment.

TI  - Carbon monoxide as a cellular protective agent in a swine model of cardiac arrest protocol
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects over 360,000 adults in the United States each year with a 50-80% mortality prior to reaching medical care. Despite aggressive supportive care and targeted temperature management (TTM), half of adults do not live to hospital discharge and nearly one-third of survivors have significant neurologic injury. The current treatment approach following cardiac arrest resuscitation consists primarily of supportive care and possible TTM. While these current treatments are commonly used, mortality remains high, and survivors often develop lasting neurologic and cardiac sequela well after resuscitation. Hence, there is a critical need for further therapeutic development of adjunctive therapies. While select therapeutics have been experimentally investigated, one promising agent that has shown benefit is CO. While CO has traditionally been thought of as a cellular poison, there is both experimental and clinical evidence that demonstrate benefit and safety in ischemia with lower doses related to improved cardiac/neurologic outcomes. While CO is well known for its poisonous effects, CO is a generated physiologically in cells through the breakdown of heme oxygenase (HO) enzymes and has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. While CO has been studied in myocardial infarction itself, the role of CO in cardiac arrest and post-arrest care as a therapeutic is less defined. Currently, the standard of care for post-arrest patients consists primarily of supportive care and TTM. Despite current standard of care, the neurological prognosis following cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) remains poor with patients often left with severe disability due to brain injury primarily affecting the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, investigations of novel therapies to mitigate post-arrest injury are clearly warranted. The primary objective of this proposed study is to combine our expertise in swine models of CO and cardiac arrest for future investigations on the cellular protective effects of low dose CO. We will combine our innovative multi-modal diagnostic platform to assess cerebral metabolism and changes in mitochondrial function in swine that undergo cardiac arrest with therapeutic application of CO.

TI  - Prognostic value of automated pupillometry: an unselected cohort from a cardiac intensive care unit
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Background: Patients admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit are often unconscious with uncertain prognosis. Automated infrared pupillometry for neurological assessment in the intensive care unit may provide early prognostic information. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of automated pupillometry in different subgroups of patients in a cardiac intensive care unit with 30-day mortality as the primary endpoint and neurological outcome as the secondary endpoint.
   Methods: A total of 221 comatose patients were divided into three groups: out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, in-hospital cardiac arrest and others (i.e. patients with cardiac diagnoses other than cardiac arrest). Automated pupillometry was serially performed until discharge or death and pupil measurements were analysed using the neurological pupil index algorithm. We applied receiver operating characteristic curves in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models and a calculated Youden index identified neurological pupil index cut-off values at different specificities.
   Results: In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients higher neurological pupil index values were independently associated with lower 30-day mortality. The univariable model for 30-day mortality had an area under the curve of 0.87 and the multivariable model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94. The Youden index identified a neurological pupil index cut-off in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients of 2.40 for a specificity of 100%. For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest and other cardiac diagnoses, we found no association between neurological pupil index values and 30-day mortality, and the univariable models showed poor predictive values.
   Conclusion: Automated infrared pupillometry has promising predictive value after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but poor predictive value in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest or cardiac diagnoses unrelated to cardiac arrest. Our data suggest a possible neurological pupil index cut-off of 2.40 for poor outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Predicting Outcomes in the Very Preterm Infant
T2  - ETHICAL DILEMMAS FOR CRITICALLY ILL BABIES
AB  - Extremely preterm infants have a high mortality and increased long term morbidity compared to babies born at term or later in gestation. They may have delays in motor, cognitive or developmental domains or persistent impairments. Frequently, in the NICU, investigations or evaluations are performed with the goal of trying to predict the long term outcomes for many different purposes. The characteristics of a test required for such predictions differ according to the different purposes. Individual prediction of profoundly abnormal outcome, based on any currently available test, is severely limited, and the use of any test in order to limit or redirect intensive care is difficult to justify, particularly because survivors of neonatal intensive care have almost universally good quality of life.
   Extremely preterm infants have a high mortality and increased long term morbidity compared to babies born at term or later in gestation. They may have delays in motor, cognitive or developmental domains or persistent impairments. Frequently, in the NICU, investigations or evaluations are performed with the goal of trying to predict whether an individual infant is likely to be impaired.
   According to the widely followed WHO definitions 'An impairment is any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function; whereas a disability is any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being; and a handicap is a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that prevents the fulfilment of a role that is considered normal (depending on age, sex and social and cultural factors) for that individual'.
   Although many publications speak blithely of handicap, we should preferably refer to attempts to predict impairment, as whether or not an impairment leads to significant disability starts to imply societal values, such as, what are our expectations? Two children with the same impairment, may have different disabilities. Handicap, using this definition, can often be minimized depending on how we define the roles of individuals with impairments, and on whether society seeks to integrate or to marginalize those with disabilities.

TI  - Foreign body airway obstruction resulting in out-ofhospital cardiac arrest in Denmark - Incidence, survival and interventions
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background : Foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) stands as an important contributor to accidental fatalities, yet prompt bystander interventions have been shown to improve survival. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, interventions, and survival outcomes of patients with out -ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) related to FBAO in comparison to patients with non-FBAO OHCA. Methods : In this population -based cohort study, we included all OHCAs in Denmark from 2016 to 2022. Cases related to FBAO were identified and linked to the patient register. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors potentially influencing survival. Results : A total of 30,926 OHCA patients were included. The incidence rate of FBAO-related OHCA was 0.78 per 100,000 person -years. Among FBAO cases, 24% presented with return of spontaneous circulation upon arrival of the emergency medical services. The 30 -day survival rate was higher in FBAO patients (30%) compared to non-FBAO patients (14%). Bystander interventions were recorded in 26% of FBAO cases. However, no statistically significant association between bystander interventions or EMS personnels' use of Magill forceps and survival was shown, aOR 1.47 (95 % CI 0.6-3.6) and aOR 0.88 (95% CI 0.3-2.1). Conclusion : FBAO-related OHCA was rare but has a higher initial survival rate than non-FBAO related OHCA, with a considerable proportion of patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation upon arrival of the emergency medical service personnel. No definitive associations were established between survival and specific interventions performed by bystanders or EMS personnel. These findings highlight the need for further research in this area.

TI  - LONG NONCODING RNA UPREGULATES ADAPTER SHCA PROTEIN EXPRESSION TO PROMOTE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AFTER CARDIAC ARREST AND RESUSCITATION
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Aim: More patients are resuscitated from cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) due to advances in medical care. However, the burden now lies with post-cardiac arrest cognitive impairment in CA/CPR survivors. Based on our previous study, we aimed to further confirm the correlation between the long noncoding RNA-promoting ShcA (lncRNA-PS)/Src homology and collagen A (ShcA) axis and CA/CPR-induced cognitive impairment in molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Methods and Results: The in vivo experiments were based on a mouse model of CA/CPR, while oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation was used as a cell model in vitro. Conditional ShcA suppression in neurons of the hippocampal CA1 region was achieved by cyclization recombinase of bacteriophage P1 recognizing DNA fragment locus of x-over P1 site (Cre/LoxP recombination system). Genetic manipulation of HT22 was achieved by lentivirus targeting lncRNA-PS and ShcA. Neurological function score was remarkably decreased, and cognitive function was affected after restoration of spontaneous circulation. LncRNA-PS and ShcA overexpression after CA/CPR, mainly happened in neurons of hippocampal CA1 region, was observed by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. Neuronal ShcA knockdown in hippocampal CA1 region before CA/CPR attenuated cognitive impairment after CA/CPR. ShcA deficiency protected HT22 cell line against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation by inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis. In vitro upregulation of lncRNA-PS elevated ShcA expression, which was reversed by knockdown of ShcA. Conclusions: This study revealed that lncRNA-PS/ShcA axis is critically involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment after CA/CPR. By inhibiting ShcA expression in neurons of the hippocampal CA1 region could improve the survival outcomes in mice after CA/CPR.

TI  - Prehospital randomised assessment of a mechanical compression device in cardiac arrest (PaRAMeDIC) trial protocol
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is closely linked to the quality of CPR, but in real life, resuscitation during prehospital care and ambulance transport is often suboptimal. Mechanical chest compression devices deliver consistent chest compressions, are not prone to fatigue and could potentially overcome some of the limitations of manual chest compression. However, there is no high-quality evidence that they improve clinical outcomes, or that they are cost effective. The Prehospital Randomised Assessment of a Mechanical Compression Device In Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC) trial is a pragmatic cluster randomised study of the LUCAS-2 device in adult patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods/design: The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of chest compression using LUCAS-2 on mortality at 30 days post out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, compared with manual chest compression. Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effects of LUCAS-2 on survival to 12 months, cognitive and quality of life outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Methods: Ambulance service vehicles will be randomised to either manual compression (control) or LUCAS arms. Adult patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, attended by a trial vehicle will be eligible for inclusion. Patients with traumatic cardiac arrest or who are pregnant will be excluded. The trial will recruit approximately 4000 patients from England, Wales and Scotland. A waiver of initial consent has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees. Consent will be sought from survivors for participation in the followup phase.
   Conclusion: The trial will assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of the LUCAS-2 mechanical chest compression device. Trial Registration: The trial is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry (ISRCTN08233942).

TI  - Factors associated with health-related quality of life among cardiac arrest survivors treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To explore factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among cardiac arrest (CA) survivors treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in relation to gender, and to compare their HRQoL with a general population.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 990 adults treated with an ICD after suffering CA. All participants received a questionnaire including demographics, comorbidities and instruments to measure HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L and HADS), ICD-related concerns (ICDC), perceived control (CAS), and type D personally (DS-14). HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) was compared to a general Swedish population, matched for age and gender. Linear regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with HRQoL.
   Results: The CA survivors reported better HRQoL in EQ index and less pain/discomfort compared to the general population (p < 0.001). In contrast, they reported more problems in mobility and usual activities (p < 0.01). Problems with anxiety and depression were reported by 15.5% and 7.4% respectively. The following factors were independently associated with all aspects of worse HRQoL: being unemployed, suffering more comorbidity, perceiving less control, and having a type D personally. Further, being female and suffering ICD-related concerns were independently associated with worse HRQoL in three of the four final regression models.
   Conclusions: This extensive population-based study showed that most CA survivors living with an ICD rate their HRQoL as acceptable. In addition, their HRQoL is similar to a general population. Women reported worse HRQoL compared to men. Several factors associated with HRQoL were identified, and might be used when screening patients for health problems and when developing health promoting interventions.

TI  - Quality of life effects of automatic external defibrillators in the home: Results from the Home Automatic External Defibrillator Trial (HAT)
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Public access automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) can save lives, but most deaths from out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest occur at home. The Home Automatic External Defibrillator Trial (HAT) found no survival advantage for adding a home AED to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for 7,001 patients with a prior anterior wall myocardial infarction. Quality of life (QOL) outcomes for both the patient and spouse/companion were secondary end points.
   Methods A subset of 1,007 study patients and their spouse/companions was randomly selected for ascertainment of QOL by structured interview at baseline and 12 and 24 months after enrollment. The primary QOL measures were the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form psychological well-being (reflecting anxiety and depression) and vitality (reflecting energy and fatigue) subscales.
   Results For patients and spouse/companions, the psychological well-being and vitality scales did not differ significantly between those randomly assigned an AED plus CPR training and controls who received CPR training only. None of the other QOL measures collected showed a clinically and statistically significant difference between treatment groups. Patients in the AED group were more likely to report being extremely or quite a bit reassured by their treatment assignment. Spouse/companions in the AED group reported being less often nervous about the possibility of using AED/CPR treatment than those in the CPR group.
   Conclusions Adding access to a home AED to CPR training did not affect QOL either for patients with a prior anterior myocardial infarction or their spouse/companion but did provide more reassurance to the patients without increasing anxiety for spouse/companions.

TI  - Retention of Critical Procedural Skills After Simulation Training: A Systematic Review
T2  - AEM EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Objective: While short-term gains in performance of critical emergency procedures are demonstrated after simulation, long-term retention is relatively uncertain. Our objective was to determine whether simulation of critical emergency procedures promotes long-term retention of skills in nonsurgical physicians.
   Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases using a peer-reviewed strategy. Eligible studies 1) were observational cohorts, quasi-experimental or randomized controlled trials; 2) assessed intubation, cricothyrotomy, pericardiocentesis, tube thoracostomy, or central line placement performance by nonsurgical physicians; 3) utilized any form of simulation; and 4) assessed skill performance immediately after and at >= 3 months after simulation. The primary outcome was skill performance at or above a preset performance benchmark at >= 3 months after simulation. Secondary outcomes included procedural skill performance at 3, 6, and >= 12 months after simulation.
   Results: We identified 1,712 citations, with 10 being eligible for inclusion. Methodologic quality was moderate with undefined primary outcomes; inadequate sample sizes; and use of nonstandardized, unvalidated tools. Three studies assessed performance to a specific performance benchmark. Two demonstrated maintenance of the minimum performance benchmark while two demonstrated significant skill decay. A significant decline in the mean performance scores from immediately after simulation to 3, 6, and >= 12 months after simulation was observed in four of four, three of four, and two of five studies, respectively. Scores remained significantly above baseline at 3, 6, and >= 12 months after simulation in three of four, three of four, and four of four studies, respectively.
   Conclusion: There were a limited number of studies examining the retention of critical skills after simulation training. While there was some evidence of skill retention after simulation, overall most studies demonstrated skill decline over time.

TI  - Preoperative Predictors of Adverse Clinical Outcome in Emergent Repair of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in 15 Year Follow Up
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) has high mortality. Improvements in surgical technique have lowered mortality but postoperative functional status and decreased quality of life due to debilitating deficits remain of concern. Our study aims to identify preoperative conditions predictive of undesirable outcome to help guide perioperative management. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of 394 cases of AAAD who underwent repair in our institution between 2001 and 2018. A combined endpoint of parameters was defined as (1) 30-day versus hospital mortality, (2) new neurological deficit, (3) new acute renal insufficiency requiring postoperative renal replacement, and (4) prolonged mechanical ventilation with need for tracheostomy. Results: Total survival/ follow-up time averaged 3.2 years with follow-up completeness of 94%. Endpoint was reached by 52.8%. Those had higher EuroSCORE II (7.5 versus 5.5), higher incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (9.2% versus 3.2%), neurological deficit (ND) upon presentation (26.4% versus 11.8%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (14.4% versus 1.6%) and intubation (RF) before surgery (16.9% versus 4.8%). 7-day mortality was 21.6% versus 0%. Hospital mortality 30.8% versus 0%. Conclusions: This 15-year follow up shows, that unfavorable postoperative clinical outcome is related to ND, CAD, CPR and RF on arrival.

T2  - BRAIN DISORDERS IN CRITICAL ILLNESS: MECHANISMS, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT
AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition in which the entire brain is almost completely deprived of its oxygen supply because of inadequate blood flow or oxygenation. Brain damage that is observed following resuscitation from cardiac arrest is considered to be the most representative pattern of HIE.
   Although complex, the pathophysiology of HIE is well understood. Cerebral ischemia triggers a complex cascade of pathways that will result in the peroxidation of lipids with cell membrane layers, protein oxidation, and DNA fragmentation, all contributing to brain cell death. Following this initial insult, brain injury continues even after restoration of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, in a process known as "reperfusion injury." Particularly, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the early depletion of antioxidant reserves, such as glutathione, will lead to an oxidative stress that will promote damage to membrane, cytoskeletal proteins, and nucleic acids, thereby causing diffuse neuronal necrosis. Finally, even after the restoration of adequate blood supply and cellular energy stores, there can be a global hypoperfusion state that may further lead to secondary brain injury and aggravate neurological impairment after initial ischemia.
   Initial clinical manifestations of HIE include: disorders of consciousness, movement disorders, seizures, and myoclonus status epilepticus (MSE). Autonomic impairment, such as respiratory abnormalities, temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure variability may also be observed. In survivors, mid- and long-term symptoms include memory and cognitive impairment, late-onset seizures, and cerebral palsy. Disorders of consciousness range from mild confusion and delirium to coma. Most severe patients will evolve towards a severely cognitively disabling and fully dependent state as a consequence of HIE. Some of them will remain in a minimally conscious or vegetative state, but very few will awake in a neurologically intact state.
   At the early stage, a rigorous clinical evaluation that includes an exhaustive neurological examination remains the cornerstone of the prognostication process. In addition, various methods can be used to refine the neurological prognosis of comatose cardiac arrest victims, including mainly electrophysiological tests and marginally neuroimaging techniques and biochemical markers.
   Regarding treatments, the existence of further cerebral damage during the reperfusion phase has encouraged intense research on the benefit of treatments aimed at limiting the neurological consequences of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Currently, induced hypothermia is the only treatment that is demonstrated to be associated with an increase in the rate of neurologically preserved patients after cardiac arrest. Despite numerous attempts, no drug has clearly demonstrated an ability to reduce the consequences of cerebral anoxo-ischemia after CA. In the future, new pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments might contribute to further improve the prognosis of these patients.

TI  - Breaking down barriers: Call-taker strategies to address caller perception of inappropriateness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the emergency ambulance call
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Ambulance call-takers perform the critical role of prompting callers to initiate and continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for patients with suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study aimed to identify call-taker strategies to address callers' perceptions of CPR 'inappropriateness' (perceiving the patient as dead and beyond help, or as showing signs of life). Methods: Using a linguistic approach, we analysed 31 calls previously identified as having an inappropriateness barrier to CPR initiation or continuation. In Phase 1, we listened to call recordings and studied call transcripts to identify the strategies and linguistic features used by call-takers. Phase 2 was a discourse analysis of transcript extracts to describe how certain strategies, identified in Phase 1, were used in the caller-call-taker interactions. Results: Call-takers used various strategies when responding to callers who considered CPR inappropriate. Calltakers rarely used a single strategy or linguistic feature in isolation, tending to use combinations of minimal tokens of alignment (e.g. caller name or encouragements statements), with deontics (including directives/ commands and statements of obligation e.g. "do this for me") and provision of either context (e.g. "the ambulance is on its way") or a rationale ("he's not breathing effectively so we need to perform CPR to help him"). Most call-taker attempts were successful, with callers overcoming 71% of initiation barriers and 88% of continuation barriers. Conclusions: Call-takers used a combination of linguistic features (minimal/symbolic tokens, deontics) and strategies (providing unscripted statements about the context or a rationale for CPR) to overcome barriers of perceived inappropriateness to CPR.

TI  - Save-a-life at the ballpark: 10-min spectator training achieves proficiency in cardiac arrest response
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To determine immediate recall, feasibility, and efficiency of a brief out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) bystander response training session at a large sporting event. We introduce two new measures of efficiency for training: (i) cardiac arrest training yield (CATY), i.e., number trained/number of spectators, and (ii) the training efficiency index for cardiac arrest (TEICA), i.e., persons trained per volunteer hours.
   Methods: A convenience sample of baseball fans participated in a 10-min training on OHCA recognition, CPR and automatic external defibrillator (AED) use and completed post-training knowledge surveys.
   Results: Out of 20,000 spectators, 198 participated for a CATY of 1%. Seventy-five volunteers over 3 h of training generated a TEICA of 0.88. 90% of respondents identified the proper rate of chest compressions. 90% of respondents recognized an AED's function; 98% recognized it was easy to use. 83% recognized chest compressions as the next step after calling 911 and 62% included AED as part of the OHCA response.
   Conclusions: A 10-min training session is feasible and can achieve good recall in cardiac arrest response. However, participant recruitment dominated most of our volunteer effort. Our results can serve as a framework in the development of future health promotion campaigns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Occult Ventricular Fibrillation Visualized by Echocardiogram During Cardiac Arrest: A Retrospective Observational Study From the Real-Time Evaluation and Assessment for Sonography-Outcomes Network (REASON)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS OPEN
AB  - Objectives: Cardiac arrest patients with a shockable rhythm are more likely to survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) compared with a non- shockable rhythm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common way to identify a shockable rhythm, but it can miss patients with clinically significant ventricular fibrillation (vfib). We sought to determine the percentage of non- shockable OHCA patients that demonstrated vfib on echo. Methods: Secondary analysis of echo images recorded from a prior study from our group, Real-Time Evaluation and Assessment for Sonography-Outcomes Network (REASON), a multicenter, observational study of OHCA patients presenting to the emergency department with nonshockable rhythms. Using ECG and echocardiogram images recorded during the initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) pause, 2 independent emergency physicians determined the presence of vfib. Two experienced emergency physicians (R.G. and T.G.) reviewed echo images with adjudication by a third if necessary. ECG interpretation was unblinded to patient information. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in occult vfib. Results: During the first CPR pause, reviewers noted occult vfib in 22/685 (3.2%; 95% CI, 2.1%-4.8%) subjects. Patients with ECG vfib (n = 55) were defibrillated immediately during the first pause in CPR, but no patients with occult vfib during the first pause in CPR were defibrillated. Subsequently, 50% (11 of 22) of occult vfib patients were defibrillated when ECG vfib was recognized during an ensuing pause in CPR. Conclusion: One in 33 OHCAs with a nonshockable ECG rhythm exhibits VF on echocardiogram. Patients presenting to the emergency department in a presumed nonshockable rhythm following OHCA may benefit from prompt defibrillation if personnel recognize occult vfib on echo.

TI  - Latex-induced Anaphylactic Reaction in a Patient Undergoing Open Appendectomy. Case Report
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ANESTESIOLOGIA
AB  - The Summary: Machado JA, Cunha RC, Oliveira BH, Silva J - Latex-Induced Anaphylactic Reaction in a Patient Undergoing Open Appendectomy. Case Report.
   Background and objective: Despite the increase of latex allergy in general population, severe anaphylactic events during some surgical procedures are still rare; however, they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients affected by this event represent a challenge for anesthesiologists. The objective of this report was to describe a case of severe latex-induced anaphylactic reaction and discuss its diagnosis and treatment.
   Case report: This is a 39-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a diagnostic suspicion of appendicitis, who underwent an emergency surgery under spinal anesthesia. Approximately 30 minutes after beginning the surgery, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction with cardiorespiratory arrest, which was reversed after treatment. Possible causative agents were isolated and, posteriorly, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, evolving without sequelae. Latex-specific IgE-RAST (Radioallergosorbent Test) was positive. The patient was referred to an allergist for follow-up.
   Conclusions: Anesthesiologists should focus on patient's history, even in urgent procedures, being aware of the limitations arising on these situations. The prognosis of anaphylaxis depends on prompt initiation of adequate treatment; diagnosis is not limited to the event occasion, but to the determination of the causative factor. Creating the means of following-up these patients, similar to other international centers, seems to be the example to be followed.

TI  - Gender differences in mortality and quality of life after septic shock: A post-hoc analysis of the ARISE study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose: To assess the impact of gender and pre-menopausal state on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with septic shock.
   Material and methods: Cohort study of the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trial, an international randomized controlled trial comparing early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) to usual care in patients with early septic shock, conducted between October 2008 and April 2014. The primary exposure in this analysis was legal gender and the secondary exposure was pre-menopausal state defined by chronological age (<= 50 years).
   Results: 641 (40.3%) of all 1591 ARISE trial participants in the intention-to-treat population were females and overall, 337 (21.2%) (146 females) patients were 50 years of age or younger. After risk-adjustment, we could not identify any survival benefit for female patients at day 90 in the younger (<= 50 years) (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 0.91 (0.46-1.89), p = .85) nor in the older (>50 years) age-group (aOR: 1.10 (0.81-1.49), p = .56). Similarly, there was no gender-difference in ICU, hospital, 1-year mortality nor quality of life measures.
   Conclusions: This post-hoc analysis of a large multi-center trial in early septic shock has shown no short- or long-term survival effect for women overall as well as in the pre-menopausal age-group. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combined use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Symbol Digit Modalities Test improves neurocognitive screening accuracy after cardiac arrest: A validation sub-study of the TTM2 trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To assess the merit of clinical assessment tools in a neurocognitive screening following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: The neurocognitive screening that was evaluated included the performance-based Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the patient-reported Two Simple Questions (TSQ) and the observer-reported Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest (IQCODE-CA). These instruments were administered at 6-months in the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM2) trial. We used a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery from a TTM2 trial sub-study as a gold standard to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the neurocognitive screening. Results: In our cohort of 108 OHCA survivors (median age = 62, 88% male), the most favourable cut-off scores were: MoCA < 26; SDMT z <=-1; IQCODE-CA >= 3.04. The MoCA (sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.85) and SDMT (sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.83) had a higher classification accuracy than the TSQ (sensitivity 0.28, specificity 0.74) and IQCODE-CA (sensitivity 0.42, specificity 0.60). When using the cut-points for MoCA or SDMT in combination to identify neurocognitive impairment, sensitivity improved (0.81, specificity 0.74), area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI [0.69, 0.85]. The most common unidentified impairments were within the episodic memory and executive functions domains, with fewer false negative cases on the MoCA or SDMT combined. Conclusion: The MoCA and SDMT have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for screening for neurocognitive impairment in an OHCA population, and when used in combination the sensitivity improves. Patient and observer-reports correspond poorly with neurocognitive performance.

TI  - A case report of type II Floyd tracheal agenesis with staged tracheal and alimentary reconstructions
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - BackgroundTracheal agenesis is a rare and lethal congenital airway anomaly. In particular, very few patients with type II Floyd tracheal agenesis experience long-term survival. We present the case of a male infant who was diagnosed with type II disease, underwent staged reconstruction and was discharged home with a tolerance for oral intake.Case presentationThe patient was delivered via emergency cesarean section at 33 week gestation due to fetal distress. Initial attempts to intubate the trachea failed, but ventilation was successfully achieved through esophageal intubation, prompting suspicion of tracheal agenesis with a tracheoesophageal fistula. The diagnosis was confirmed via CT and laryngoesophagoscopy. On the same day, abdominal esophageal banding and gastrostomy were performed. For long-term management, staged operations, including pseudotracheostomy, internal and external stenting of the trachealized esophagus, and reconstruction of the alimentary tract, were performed. Despite being discharged home with a tolerance for oral intake, the patient experienced cardiac arrest at 41 months due to tracheal tube displacement.ConclusionsEarly detection of tracheal agenesis in postnatal patients experiencing respiratory distress is crucial. Type II Floyd tracheal agenesis remains challenging because of the absence of a trachea and the narrow diameter of the tracheoesophageal fistula.

TI  - An insight regarding the article 'Predictors and rate of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.'
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have led to a remarkable reduction in the morbidity and mortality rates associated with a variety of diseases. In the context of acute ischemic heart disease, significant milestones have been achieved, beginning with the establishment of cardiac ICUs. These were pivotal in providing specialized care for patients with severe heart conditions. Subsequent to this development, methods to restore blood flow in areas compromised by arterial blockages were introduced. Initially, systemic thrombolysis was the primary method used, but it has since been largely supplanted by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as primary coronary angioplasty, which is now the preferred treatment due to its effectiveness and safety. The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) where resuscitation attempts have been made, whether successful or not, is significant and presents a considerable challenge. Unfortunately, the mortality rate among these patients remains distressingly high, and efforts to reduce it are fraught with difficulty. It is crucial to acknowledge that survival from an OHCA does not automatically equate to a favorable clinical outcome, as serious neurological impairments are common sequelae of such events. In addition to mortality rates, the term "survival with favorable neurologic outcome" has emerged as another critical measure of the success of resuscitation efforts. This parameter underscores the importance of not only saving lives but also preserving the quality of life for survivors. The ability to restore both life and cognitive function is a testament to the comprehensiveness of care provided to OHCA patients.

TI  - Rewarming Young Children After Drowning-Associated Hypothermia and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Analysis Using the CAse REport Guideline
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is recommended in adults with drowning-associated hypothermia and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Our experience of managing a drowned 2-year-old girl with hypothermia (23 & DEG;C) and cardiac arrest (58 min) prompted this summary using the CAse REport (CARE) guideline to address the question of optimal rewarming procedure in such patients.DESIGN/PATIENTS:Following the CARE guideline, we identified 24 reports in the "PubMed database" describing children less than or equal to 6 years old with a temperature less than or equal to 28 & DEG;C who had been rewarmed using conventional intensive care & PLUSMN; ECMO. Adding our patient, we were able to analyze a total of 57 cases.MAIN RESULTS:The two groups (ECMO vs non-ECMO) differed with respect to submersion time, pH and potassium but not age, temperature or duration of cardiac arrest. However, 44 of 44 in the ECMO group were pulseless on arrival versus eight of 13 in the non-ECMO group. Regarding survival, 12 of 13 children (92%) undergoing conventional rewarming survived compared with 18 of 44 children (41%) undergoing ECMO. Among survivors, 11 of 12 children (91%) in the conventional group and 14 of 18 (77%) in the ECMO group had favorable outcome. We failed to identify any correlation between "rewarming rate" and "outcome."CONCLUSIONS:In this summary analysis, we conclude that conventional therapy should be initiated for drowned children with OHCA. However, if this therapy does not result in return of spontaneous circulation, a discussion of withdrawal of intensive care might be prudent when core temperature has reached 34 & DEG;C. We suggest further work is needed using an international registry.

AB  - Precise criteria for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) are still lacking in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We aimed to investigate whether adopting our hypothesized criteria for ECPR to patients with refractory OHCA could benefit. This before-after study compared 4.5 years after implementation of ECPR for refractory OHCA patients who met our criteria (Jan, 2015 to May, 2019) and 4 years of undergoing conventional CPR (CCPR) prior to ECPR with patients who met the criteria (Jan, 2011 to Jan, 2014) in the emergency department. The primary and secondary outcomes were good neurologic outcome at 6-months and 1-month respectively, defined as 1 or 2 on the Cerebral Performance Category score. A total of 70 patients (40 with CCPR and 30 with ECPR) were included. For a good neurologic status at 6-months and 1-month, patients with ECPR (33.3%, 26.7%) were superior to those with CCPR (5.0%, 5.0%) (all Ps<0.05). Among patients with ECPR, a group with a good neurologic status showed shorter low-flow time, longer extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration and hospital stays, and lower epinephrine doses used (all Ps<0.05). The application of the detailed indication before initiating ECPR appears to increase a good neurologic outcome rate.

TI  - Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) PRIMED cardiac arrest trial methods - Part 2: Rationale and methodology for "Analyze Later vs. Analyze Early" protocol
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The primary objective of the trial is to compare survival to hospital discharge with modified Rankin score (MRS) <= 3 between a strategy that prioritizes a specified period of CPR before rhythm analysis (Analyze Later) versus a strategy of minimal CPR followed by early rhythm analysis (Analyze Early) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Design-Cluster randomized trial with cluster units defined by geographic region, or monitor/defibrillator machine.
   Population-Adults treated by emergency medical service (EMS) providers for non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest not witnessed by EMS.
   Setting-EMS systems participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium and agreeing to cluster randomization to the Analyze Later versus Analyze Early intervention in a crossover fashion.
   Sample size-Based on a two-sided significance level of 0.05, a maximum of 13,239 evaluable patients will allow statistical power of 0.996 to detect a hypothesized improvement in the probability of survival to discharge with MRS <= 3 rate from 5.41% after Analyze Early to 7.45% after Analyze Later (2.04% absolute increase in primary outcome).
   Conclusion: If this trial demonstrates a significant improvement in survival with a strategy of Analyze Later, it is estimated that 4000 premature deaths from cardiac arrest would be averted annually in North America alone. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Associations between cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) knowledge, self-efficacy, training history and willingness to perform CPR and CPR psychomotor skills: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To determine whether training history (including number of times and duration since last training), knowledge, self-efficacy or willingness are associated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) psychomotor skills.
   Methods: Eight databases were systematically searched from January 2005 to February 2018 for articles that involved adult layperson participants and explored an association between training history, knowledge, self-efficacy or willingness and CPR psychomotor skills or survival outcomes after real CPR attempts.
   Results: Thirty-four articles with a total of 35,421 participants were included. CPR training was found to improve psychomotor skills, compared to no training, and any previous training was associated with better skills, compared to no previous training, however only the use of a popular song promoted meaningful retention of a specifically targeted skill, compared to standard training methods. Skills deteriorated within 3 months, then plateaued from 3 to 6 months. Self-efficacy was weakly associated with skill level, however knowledge was not associated with skill level. No studies assessed the association between willingness and psychomotor skills.
   Conclusion: All laypeople should attend an instructor-led CPR training session with real-time or delayed feedback to improve CPR skills. Training sessions should utilise combinations of validated skill-specific training strategies, preferably including popular songs and feedback to help ensure skills retention. Refresher training, which focusses on skills and self-confidence rather than knowledge, should be undertaken every 3-6 months, although this timeframe needs further validation. All future studies assessing CPR psychomotor skills should adhere to a standardised reporting outcome list (proposed in this paper) to ensure consistency and comparability of results.

TI  - International variation in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A validation study of the Utstein template
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival varies greatly between communities. The Utstein template was developed and promulgated to improve the comparability of OHCA outcome reports, but it has undergone limited empiric validation. We sought to assess how much of the variation in OHCA survival between emergency medical services (EMS) across the globe is explained by differences in the Utstein factors. We also assessed how accurately the Utstein factors predict OHCA survival.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patient-level prospectively collected data from 12 OHCA registries from 12 countries for the period 1 Jan 2006 through 31 Dec 2011. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the variation in survival between EMS agencies (n = 232).
   Results: Twelve registries contributed 86,759 cases. Patient arrest characteristics, EMS treatment and patient outcomes varied across registries. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 10% (range, 6% to 22%). Overall survival with Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2 (available for 8/12 registries) was 8%(range, 2% to 20%). The area-under-the-curve for the Utstein model was 0.85 (Wald CI: 0.85-0.85). The Utstein factors explained 51% of the EMS agency variation in OHCA survival.
   Conclusions: The Utstein factors explained 51%. of the variation in survival to hospital discharge among multiple large geographically separate EMS agencies. This suggests that quality improvement and public health efforts should continue to target modifiable Utstein factors to improve OHCA survival. Further study is required to identify the reasons for the variation that is incompletely understood.

TI  - Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest: data from the Joint Theatre Trauma Registry
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS
AB  - Background Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) in children is associated with a low probability of survival and poor neurological outcome in survivors. Since 2003, over 600 seriously injured local national children have been treated at deployed UK military medical treatment facilities during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. A number of these were in cardiac arrest after sustaining traumatic injuries. This study defined outcomes from paediatric TCA in this cohort.
   Methods A retrospective database review was undertaken using the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. This includes UK military, coalition military, civilians and local security forces personnel who prompted trauma team activation. All children in this series were local nationals. Patients aged less than 18years who presented between January 2003 and April 2014, and who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, were included.
   Results 27 children with TCA were included. Four children survived to discharge from the medical treatment facility (14.8%), though limited data are available regarding the long-term neurological outcome in these patients.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates that the outcomes for paediatric TCA in our military field hospitals were similar to other paediatric civilian and adult military studies, despite patients being injured by severe blast injuries. Further work is needed to define the optimal management of paediatric TCA.

TI  - Impact of drone-specific dispatch instructions on the safety and efficacy of drone-delivered emergency medical treatments: A randomized simulation pilot study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Medical drones have potential for improving the response times to out-of-hospital emergencies. However, widespread adoption is hindered by unanswered questions surrounding medical dispatch and bystander safety. This study evaluated the impact of novel drone-specific dispatch instructions (DSDI) on bystanders' ability to interact effectively with a medical drone and provide prompt, safe, and high-quality treatment in a simulated emergency scenario.1 We hypothesized DSDI would improve bystanders' performance and facilitate safer bystander-drone interactions. Methods: Twenty-four volunteers were randomized to receive either DSDI and standard Medical Priority Dispatch (MPD) instructions or MPD alone in a simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) or pediatric anaphylaxis.,23 Participants in the DSDI group received detailed instructions on locating and interacting with the drone and its enclosed medical kit. The simulations were video recorded. Participants completed a semi Results: The addition of DSDI did not lead to statistically significant changes to the overall time to provide care in either the anaphylaxis or OHCA simulations. However, DSDI did have an impact on bystander safety. In the MPD only group, 50% (6/12) of participants ignored the audio and visual safety cues from the drone instead of waiting for it to be declared safe compared to no DSDI participants ignoring these safety cues. Conclusions: All participants successfully provided patient care. However, this study indicates that DSDI may be useful to ensure bystander safety and should be incorporated in the continued development of emergency medical drones.

TI  - Long-term effects of brief hypoxia due to cardiac arrest: Hippocampal reductions and memory deficits
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To examine the effects of brief hypoxia (< 7 min) due to cardiac arrest on the integrity of the brain and performance on memory and executive functions tasks.
   Methods: Patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) (n = 9), who were deemed neurologically intact on discharge, were compared to matched patients with myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 9). A battery of clinical and experimental memory and executive functions neuropsychological tests were administered and MRI scans for all patients were collected. Measures of subcortical and cortical volumes and cortical thickness were obtained using FreeSurfer. Manual segmentations of the hippocampus were also performed. APACHE-II scores were calculated based on metrics collected at admission to ICCU for all patients.
   Results: Significant differences between the two groups were observed on several verbal memory tests. Both hippocampi were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the CA patients, relative to MI patients. Hippocampal subfields segmentation showed significantly reduced presubiculum volumes bilaterally. CA patients had on average 10% reduction in volumes bilaterally across hippocampal subfields. No cortical thickness differences survived correction. Significant correlations were observed in the CA group only between the hippocampal volumes and performance on verbal memory tasks, including recollection. Hippocampal volumes and several memory measures (but not other cognitive domains) were strongly correlated with APACHE-II scores on admission in the CA group, but not in the MI group
   Conclusions: Chronic patients with cardiac arrest who were discharged from hospital in "good neurological condition" showed an average of 10% reduction in hippocampal volume bilaterally and significant verbal memory deficits relative to matched controls with myocardial infarction, suggesting even brief hypoxic periods suffice to lead to specific hippocampal damage.

TI  - Secondary prevention of sudden death: The Dutch Study, the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillator Trial, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg, and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
CP  - Symposium on New Frontiers in the Electrical Management of Cardiac Disorders
AB  - Although indisputably effective in the prevention of sudden death, use of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy may not necessarily affect all-cause mortality, as most patients at risk also present with severely depressed left ventricular dysfunction. Correction of the sudden death risk in these patients creates a new clinical condition in need of a careful assessment. Should all-cause mortality be affected by the expected reduction in sudden death rate associated with ICD therapy, issues of critical importance such as the time extent of life prolongation and the associated quality of life, still remain to established. To investigate the potential benefit of ICD therapy compared with antiarrhythmic drug treatment, 4 prospective studies-the Dutch trial, the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) study, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH), and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS)-have been conducted in which patients with documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia were randomized to 1 of these 2 treatment strategies. The enrollment criteria differed in these 4 studies: (1) in the Dutch trial, they included cardiac arrest secondary to a ventricular arrhythmia, old (>4 weeks) myocardial infarction, and inducible ventricular arrhythmia; (2) in AVID and CIDS, ventricular fibrillation or poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia; and (3) in CASH, cardiac attest secondary to a ventricular arrhythmia regardless of the underlying disease. With regard to the antiarrhythmic drugs, the Dutch trial tested class I and III agents, whereas AVID and CIDS compared ICD therapy with class III agents (mostly amiodarone). In CASH, 3 drug subgroups were investigated: propafenone, amiodarone, and metoprolol. All trials used all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint. Data from these trials provide support for ICD as a therapy superior to antiarrhythmic drugs in prolonging survival in patients meeting the entry criteria. This review briefly summarizes the methods, results, limitations, and clinical implications of these 4 studies. (C) 1999 by Excerpta Medico, Inc.

TI  - Two simple questions to assess neurologic outcomes at 3 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Experience from the Public Access Defibrillation Trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Two simple questions have been used to classify neurologic outcome in patients with stroke. Could they be similarly applied to patients with cardiac arrest?
   Methods: As part of a randomized trial, study personnel interviewed by telephone survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to assess their outcomes 3 months after discharge. They asked two simple questions: (1) In the last 2 weeks, did you require help from another person for your everyday activities? and (2) Do you feel that you have made a complete mental recovery form your heart arrest? Next they administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from the Adult Lifestyles and Function Interview (ALFI) to assess cognition on a scale from 0 to 22 and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) to assess quality of life on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).
   Results: Based on responses to the two simple questions, 32 survivors were classified as dependent (n = 5, 16%), independent (n = 3, 9%) and full recovery (n = 24, 75%). The mean ALFI-MMSE score was 19.1 (standard deviation 5.1), and the mean HUI3 score was 0.76 (standard deviation 0.28). The classification based on the two simple questions was significantly correlated with ALFI-MMSE (p = 0.002) and HUI3 (p = 0.001). Scores for the HUI3 were missing in eight survivors.
   Conclusions: Neurologic outcomes based on the two simple questions after cardiac arrest can be easily determined, sensibly applied, and readily interpreted. These preliminary findings justify further evaluation of this simple and practical approach to classify neurologic outcome in survivors of cardiac arrest. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - The Australian New Zealand Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (ANZ-SCAD) Registry - A Multi-Centre Cohort Study: Protocol, Background and Significance
T2  - HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION
AB  - Introduction Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an under-recognised cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with a strong female predominance. There are currently limited prospective studies and no randomised controlled trials that inform on SCAD's best clinical care. Little is also known about predictors of acute SCAD deterioration or recurrence. We describe the study design of a multi-centre prospective and historical cohort study recruiting patients with SCAD across 15-20 sites in Australia/New Zealand (NZ). The primary aim is to describe the clinical presentation, management and outcomes along with predictors of acute deterioration and recurrence in a large Australian/NZ SCAD cohort, with international data pooling.
   Methods and Analysis Consented patients diagnosed with SCAD during a hospital admission for an ACS will be prospectively followed at 30 days then yearly, for up to 5 years. Each recruiting site will also retrospectively identify historical cases of SCAD from the proceeding 10 years, with a waiver of consent. For historical cases, data will be collected in a de-identified manner with date of last follow-up or death obtained from the medical records. All cases undergo core laboratory adjudication of coronary angiography and any accompanying imaging to confirm SCAD diagnosis. The primary endpoint will be occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events; a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction (including SCAD recurrence), stroke/transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmia, heart transplantation and, repeat/unplanned revascularisation. Secondary endpoints will include each individual primary outcome as well as acute SCAD extension and quality of life/Seattle Angina Score in prospectively recruited participants. Endpoints will be assessed at the end of the hospital admission and at 30-days, 1 year, and median long-term follow-up.
   Ethics Multicentre ethics approval has been granted from the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (2021/ETH00040).
   Dissemination of Results The analysed results will be published in peer-reviewed journals on completion of the historical data collection and then on completion of the prospective data collection.
   Registration Details The ANZ-SCAD registry has been prospectively registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621000824864).

TI  - CPCR results in cardiac arrested patients in Nemazee Hospital, Iran
T2  - IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background: During recent-years, in-hospital-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), management has received much attention. However, the rate of survival after in-hospital resuscitation in Nemazee Hospital is not known. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the outcome of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in Shiraz, Iran.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on all cases of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Age and sex of patients, shift, time from the onset of cardiac arrest to the initiation of CPR, and also defibrillation, duration and result of CPR were recorded in a checklist.
   Results: 459 cases of CPR (62.3% males and 37.7% females) were enrolled. The survival rate was similar for both sexes. 1(st) hr survival was observed in 10.6% of cases and only 0.4% survived to discharge. The key predictors of survival to hospital discharge were CPR duration, time from the onset of cardiac arrest to the initiation of CPR, and defibrillation within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions: More attention must be paid to cardiopulmonary resuscitation managements to promote the survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and provide accurate data on our performance with regards to the chain of survival.

TI  - Effect of the AutoPulse™ automated band chest compression device on hemodynamics in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Guidelines for advanced life support of cardiac arrest (CA) emphasize continuous and effective chest compressions as one of the main factors of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) success. The use of an automated load distributing chest compression device for CPR is promising but initial studies on survival show contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of AutoPulse (TM) on blood pressure (BP) in out-of-hospital CA patients.
   This prospective study included adult patients presenting with in refractory out-of-hospital CA. Invasive arterial BP produced by AutoPulse (TM) was compared to BP generated by manual CPR (Active Compression Decompression). Systolic, diastolic and mean BP and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after initiating the automated band device for each patient. The comparison of diastolic BP produced by manual CPR versus automated chest compressions was the primary end point.
   Hemodynamics in 29 patients are reported and analyzed. Median diastolic BP increased after starting AutoPulse (TM) from 17[11-25] mmHg to 23[18-28] mmHg (P < 0.001). Median systolic BP increased from 72[55-105] mmHg to 106[78-135] mmHg (P = 0.02). Mean BP increased from 29[25-38] mmHg to 36[30-15] mmHg (P = 0.002). On the other hand, End-Tidal CO2 did not increase significantly with AutoPulse (TM) (21[13-36] vs. 22[12-35] mmHg, P = 0.80).
   In patients with out-of-hospital CA, the use of AutoPulse (TM) is associated with an increased diastolic BP compared to manual chest compressions. While its benefit to survival has yet to be demonstrated, the increase in diastolic and mean BP is a promising outcome for AutoPulse (TM) use.

AB  - Background: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requires early recognition, prompt and quality clinical interventions, and coordination between different clinicians to improve outcomes. Clinical team leaders and clinical teams have high levels of cognitive burden. We aimed to investigate the effect of a dedicated Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Quality Officer role on team performance. Methods: This multi-centre randomised control trial used simulation in universities from the UK, Poland, and Norway. Student Paramedics participated in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest scenarios before randomisation to either traditional roles or assigning one member as the CPR Quality Officer. The quality of CPR was measured using QCPR (R) and Advanced Life Support (ALS) elements were evaluated. Results: In total, 36 teams (108 individuals) participated. CPR quality from the first attempt (72.45%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 64.94 to 79.97) significantly increased after addition of the CPR Quality role (81.14%, 95% CI 74.20 to 88.07, p = 0.045). Improvement was not seen in the control group. The time to first defibrillation had no significant difference in the intervention group between the first attempt (53.77, 95% CI 36.57-70.98) and the second attempt (48.68, 95% CI 31.31-66.05, p = 0.84). The time to manage an obstructive airway in the intervention group showed significant difference (p = 0.006) in the first attempt (168.95, 95% CI 110.54-227.37) compared with the second attempt (136.95, 95% CI 87.03-186.88, p = 0.1). Conclusion: A dedicated CPR Quality Officer in simulated scenarios improved the quality of CPR compressions without a negative impact on time to first defibrillation, managing the airway, or adherence to local ALS protocols.

TI  - VALIDATION OF A DISPATCH PROTOCOL WITH CONTINUOUS QUALITY CONTROL FOR CARDIAC ARREST: A BEFORE-AND-AFTER STUDY AT A CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT-BASED DISPATCH CENTER
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: An optimized protocol to help dispatchers identify potential cases of cardiac arrest and provide phone instructions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may increase the provision of bystander CPR, further improving the survival rate and neurological outcomes. Objective: We assessed a revised dispatcher-assisted (DA)-CPR protocol with a continuous qualityimprovement feature in a county fire department-based emergency medical services system. Methods: This was a before-and-after intervention prospective study conducted in Taoyuan City, Taiwan. The participants were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients from November 2014 to February 2016. Interventional quality control started in August 2015. Approximately 10% of the telephone calls from these OHCA patients were reviewed. Results: In total, 66 and 64 cases were included in the before-and after-intervention groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in sex, age, day, and time of events, or languages spoken by the callers. After the intervention, we found significant improvements in the rates at which cardiac arrests were recognized (54.5% vs. 68.8%; p = 0.007) and normal breathing was checked (51.5% vs. 76.6%, p = 0.003). Moreover, the frequency with which DA-CPR was provided by the dispatchers improved significantly (50.0% vs. 72.7%; p = 0.046). Significant improvement in patient outcomes was observed with regard to 24-h survival (7.6% vs. 20.3%, p = 0.036) but not with regard to survival to discharge (3.0% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.076). Conclusions: The study found this DA- CPR protocol, which includes continuous quality control, is promising as it improved the successful recognition of cardiac arrests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Continuous chest compression versus interrupted chest compression for cardiopulmonary resuscitation of non-asphyxial out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Review)
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of death worldwide. Cardiac arrest can be subdivided into asphyxial and non asphyxial etiologies. An asphyxia arrest is caused by lack of oxygen in the blood and occurs in drowning and choking victims and in other circumstances. A non asphyxial arrest is usually a loss of functioning cardiac electrical activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a well-established treatment for cardiac arrest. Conventional CPR includes both chest compressions and 'rescue breathing' such as mouth-to-mouth breathing. Rescue breathing is delivered between chest compressions using a fixed ratio, such as two breaths to 30 compressions or can be delivered asynchronously without interrupting chest compression. Studies show that applying continuous chest compressions is critical for survival and interrupting them for rescue breathing might increase risk of death. Continuous chest compression CPR may be performed with or without rescue breathing.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of continuous chest compression CPR (with or without rescue breathing) versus conventional CPR plus rescue breathing (interrupted chest compression with pauses for breaths) of non-asphyxial OHCA.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1 2017); MEDLINE (Ovid) (from 1985 to February 2017); Embase (1985 to February 2017); Web of Science (1985 to February 2017). We searched ongoing trials databases including controlledtrials.com and clinicaltrials.gov. We did not impose any language or publication restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized and quasi-randomized studies in adults and children suffering non-asphyxial OHCA due to any cause. Studies compared the effects of continuous chest compression CPR (with or without rescue breathing) with interrupted CPR plus rescue breathing provided by rescuers (bystanders or professional CPR providers).
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors extracted the data and summarized the effects as risk ratios (RRs), adjusted risk differences (ARDs) or mean differences (MDs). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.
   Main results
   We included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one cluster-RCT(with a total of 26,742 participants analysed). We identified one ongoing study. While predominantly adult patients, one study included children.
   Untrained bystander-administered CPR
   Three studies assessed CPR provided by untrained bystanders in urban areas of the USA, Sweden and the UK. Bystanders administered CPR under telephone instruction from emergency services. There was an unclear risk of selection bias in two trials and low risk of detection, attrition, and reporting bias in all three trials. Survival outcomes were unlikely to be affected by the unblinded design of the studies.
   We found high-quality evidence that continuous chest compression CPR without rescue breathing improved participants' survival to hospital discharge compared with interrupted chest compression with pauses for rescue breathing (ratio 15: 2) by 2.4% (14% versus 11.6%; RR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.46; 3 studies, 3031 participants).
   One trial reported survival to hospital admission, but the number of participants was too low to be certain about the effects of the different treatment strategies on survival to admission(RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.48; 1 study, 520 participants; moderate-quality evidence).
   There were no data available for survival at one year, quality of life, return of spontaneous circulation or adverse effects.
   There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of the different strategies on neurological outcomes at hospital discharge (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.66; 1 study, 1286 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The proportion of participants categorized as having good or moderate cerebral performance was 11% following treatment with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing compared with 10% to 18% for those treated with continuous chest compression CPR without rescue breathing.
   CPR administered by a trained professional
   In one trial that assessed OHCA CPR administered by emergency medical service professionals (EMS) 23,711 participants received either continuous chest compression CPR (100/minute) with asynchronous rescue breathing (10/minute) or interrupted chest compression with pauses for rescue breathing (ratio 30: 2). The study was at low risk of bias overall.
   After OHCA, risk of survival to hospital discharge is probably slightly lower for continuous chest compression CPR with asynchronous rescue breathing compared with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing (9.0% versus 9.7%) with an adjusted risk difference (ARD) of -0.7%; 95% CI (-1.5% to 0.1%); moderate-quality evidence.
   There is high-quality evidence that survival to hospital admission is 1.3% lower with continuous chest compression CPR with asynchronous rescue breathing compared with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing (24.6% versus 25.9%; ARD -1.3% 95% CI (-2.4% to -0.2%)).
   Survival at one year and quality of life were not reported.
   Return of spontaneous circulation is likely to be slightly lower in people treated with continuous chest compression CPR plus asynchronous rescue breathing (24.2% versus 25.3%; -1.1% (95% CI -2.4 to 0.1)), high-quality evidence.
   There is high-quality evidence of little or no difference in neurological outcome at discharge between these two interventions (7.0% versus 7.7%; ARD -0.6% (95% CI -1.4 to 0.1).
   Rates of adverse events were 54.4% in those treated with continuous chest compressions plus asynchronous rescue breathing versus 55.4% in people treated with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing compared with the ARD being-1% (-2.3 to 0.4), moderate-quality evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   Following OHCA, we have found that bystander-administered chest compression-only CPR, supported by telephone instruction, increases the proportion of people who survive to hospital discharge compared with conventional interrupted chest compression CPR plus rescue breathing. Some uncertainty remains about how well neurological function is preserved in this population and there is no information available regarding adverse effects.
   When CPR was performed by EMS providers, continuous chest compressions plus asynchronous rescue breathing did not result in higher rates for survival to hospital discharge compared to interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing. The results indicate slightly lower rates of survival to admission or discharge, favourable neurological outcome and return of spontaneous circulation observed following continuous chest compression. Adverse effects are probably slightly lower with continuous chest compression.
   Increased availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and AED use in CPR need to be examined, and also whether continuous chest compression CPR is appropriate for paediatric cardiac arrest.

TI  - Neurologic Function and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients Following Targeted Temperature Management at 33°C vs 36°C After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NEUROLOGY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Brain injury affects neurologic function and quality of life in survivors after cardiac arrest.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of 2 target temperature regimens on long-term cognitive function and quality of life after cardiac arrest.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this multicenter, international, parallel group, assessor-masked randomized clinical trial performed from November 11, 2010, through January 10, 2013, we enrolled 950 unconscious adults with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause from 36 intensive care units in Europe and Australia. Eleven patients were excluded from analysis for a total sample size of 939.
   INTERVENTIONS Targeted temperature management at 33 degrees C vs 36 degrees C.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cognitive function was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and assessed by observers through the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Patients reported their activities in daily life and mental recovery through Two Simple Questions and their quality of life through the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2.
   RESULTS In the modified intent-to-treat population, including nonsurvivors, the median MMSE score was 14 in the 33 degrees C group (interquartile range [IQR], 0-28) vs 17 in the 36 degrees C group (IQR, 0-29) (P = .77), and the IQCODE score was 115 (IQR, 79-130) vs 115 (IQR, 80-130) (P = .57) in the 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C groups, respectively. The median MMSE score for survivors was within the reference range and similar (33 degrees C group median, 28; IQR, 26-30; vs 36 degrees C group median, 28; IQR, 25-30; P = .61). The median IQCODE score was within the minor deficit range (33 degrees C group median, 79.5; IQR, 78.0-85.9; vs 36 degrees C group median, 80.7; IQR, 78.0-86.9; P = .04). A total of 18.8% vs 17.5% of survivors reported needing help with everyday activities (P = .71), and 66.5% in the 33 degrees C group vs 61.8% in the 36 degrees C group reported that they thought they had made a complete mental recovery (P = .32). The mean (SD) mental component summary score was 49.1 (12.5) vs 49.0 (12.2) (P = .79), and the mean (SD) physical component summary score was 46.8 (13.8) and 47.5 (13.8) (P = .45), comparable to the population norm.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Quality of life was good and similar in patients with cardiac arrest receiving targeted temperature management at 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C. Cognitive function was similar in both intervention groups, but many patients and observers reported impairment not detected previously by standard outcome scales.

TI  - Surgical results in acute type A aortic dissection with preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation: Survival and neurological outcome
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening disease that requires emergent surgical intervention. This retrospective study aimed to clarify the individual characteristics, short-term and mid-term outcomes, and prognostic factors of patients who underwent surgical repair of ATAAD with preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods Between January 2007 and January 2020, 656 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution; 22 (3.4%) of these patients underwent CPR prior to surgery. Patients who underwent preoperative CPR were classified as the survivor group (n = 9) and non-survivor group (n = 13), according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. Clinical features, surgical information, and postoperative complications were analyzed and compared. Three-year cumulative survival rates and cerebral performance categories (CPC) scores are presented. Results In patients undergoing CPR prior to ATAAD surgery, the in-hospital mortality rate was 59.1%. A total of 72.7% of patients underwent concomitant surgical resuscitation procedures during CPR such as emergent subxiphoid pericardiotomy and/or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass. The survivor group had a higher rate of return of spontaneous heartbeat (ROSB) compared to the non-survivor group (100% versus 53.8%;P= 0.017). The 3-year cumulative survival rates were 35.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.6%-42.6%) and 85.7% (95% CI, 81.9%-88.8%) for overall patients and for survivors, respectively. As for the neurological outcome, 77.8% (7/9) of patients had full cerebral performance (CPC-1) at the 3-month follow-up examination after discharge. Conclusions Patients with ATAAD undergoing preoperative CPR, especially those without ROSB after CPR, are at high risk for in-hospital mortality. However, the short-term and mid-term outcomes, including the cerebral performance after discharge and 3-year survival rate, are promising for patients who survived to discharge.

TI  - Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for eCPR in the emergency room in patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) refractory to conventional high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be rescued by extracorporeal CPR (eCPR) using veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). Even when trying to identify eCPR candidates based on criteria assumed to be associated with a favourable neurological outcome, reported survival rates are frequently below 10%.
   Methods
   All patients undergoing implantation of V-A ECMO for eCPR between January 2018 and December 2019 (N = 40) were analysed (age 53 +/- 13 years; 75% male). Patients with refractory OHCA and potentially favourable circumstances (initial shockable rhythm, witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, absence of limiting comorbidities, age <75 years) were transported under mechanical chest compression. Candidates for eCPR should have a pH >= 6.9, arterial lactate <= 15 mmol/L and time-to-ECMO should be <= 60 minutes.
   Results
   Overall 30-day survival was 12.5%, with 3 of 5 survivors having a favourable neurological outcome (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2), representing 7.5% of the total eCPR population. No patient selected for eCPR met all pre-defined criteria (median of unfavourable criteria: 3). Importantly, time-to-ECMO most often (39/40) exceeded 60 minutes (mean 102 +/- 32 min.), and lactate was >15mmol/L in 30 out of 40 patients. Moreover, 22 out of 40 patients had a non-shockable rhythm on the first ECG.
   Conclusions
   Despite our intention to select patients with potentially advantageous circumstances to achieve acceptable eCPR outcomes, the imminent deadly consequence of withholding eCPR obviously prompted individual physicians to perform the procedure also in presumably more unfavourable settings, resulting in similar mortality rates of eCPR as reported before.

TI  - The long-term health impact and potential predictors of cardiopulmonary arrest in patients with childhood-onset psychomotor impairments
T2  - BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to understand the long-term health issues and potential predictors of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) in patients with severe childhood-onset psychomotor impairments.
   Method: In this single-center, retrospective observational study, the medical records of 140 patients with severe childhood-onset psychomotor impairments were reviewed. The medical interventions and functional status of patients with a history of CPA (n = 22: 14 M/8F; mean +/- SD age: 26.6 +/- 12.4 years) were compared with age- and sex-matched patients without a history of CPA (n = 44: 28 M/16F; mean +/- SD age: 26.5 +/- 12.3 years).
   Results: The prevalence of CPA was 15.7%. The most frequent cause was respiratory issues, and CPA occurred most frequently between 0 and 5 years old. The patients who had a history of CPA were more likely to have required a feeding tube (p = 0.0007), tracheostomy (p < 0.0001), and ventilator (p = 0.002) compared to the non-CPA patients, while the prevalence of tracheostomy or ventilator treatment during early infancy was comparable between both groups. Although statistically non-significant, patients who used antiepileptics or feeding tubes during the neonatal period had higher odds of a future CPA.
   Interpretation: This single-center study indicated that the prevalence of CPA could be high among individuals with severe childhood-onset psychomotor impairments, and patients who experience CPA have more health issues. The potential predictors for a future CPA are young age (0-5 years), respiratory issues, and antiepileptic or feeding tube usage during the neonatal period. These patients may require extra attention in medical managements. (c) 2015 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quality of life after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients over the age of 80 years
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives
   Success of in-hospital resuscitation decreases with age; however, national data show that 11.3% of patients over 80 years survive to discharge. There are few published qualitative data about the quality of life for these patients postsuccessful resuscitation. We aimed to investigate postresuscitation quality of life in patients over the age of 80 through a series of case studies.
   Methods
   All patients over the age of 80 years, who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at our district general hospital in 2015-2016, were included. Success of resuscitation, survival at day 1 and to discharge were recorded. For patients who survived to 1 day and beyond, case reports were written to create individual patient stories.
   Results
   47 patients over the age of 80 years received CPR at Musgrove Park Hospital over a 2-year period. Five (10.6%) survived to discharge. Of those surviving to discharge, two had substantial functional decline, requiring discharge to nursing homes having previously been independent. Of the five families/patients who commented on their experience, only one expressed a positive view. When discussed, the majority of patients/families opted for a Do Not Attempt CPR.
   Conclusion
   Our results have shown that there is a risk of substantial functional decline associated with successful CPR in those patients over the age of 80 years. The majority of patients and relatives contacted after successful resuscitation expressed a negative view of the experience. Our study highlights the importance of having early informed discussions with patients and families about CPR in order to avoid detrimental outcomes and ensure patient wishes are correctly represented.

TI  - Seasonal Variation in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Victoria 2008-2017: Winter Peak
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background: Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) incidence and survival rates are known to vary between seasons in some locations. The winter of 2017 saw the highest ever incidence and lowest survival rate of OHCA recorded in Victoria at the time. Seasonal variation of OHCA has not previously been examined in Australia and there may be a significant effect. We aimed to describe the seasonal incidence of OHCA and examine seasonal differences in survival to discharge and 12-month quality of life outcomes. In addition, we investigated whether recent respiratory infection or pre existing respiratory disease influenced OHCA outcomes. Methods: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) was used to identify OHCA occurring in Victoria between 2008 and 2017. We examined OHCA characteristics and outcomes between seasons. We then used multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for the Utstein factors, to examine if season, recent respiratory infection or preexisting respiratory disease is associated with survival to discharge and 12-month quality of life. Results: There were 44 973 OHCA cases of which 22 209 received an attempted resuscitation (49.4%). The incidence of OHCA was highest during winter (22 per 100 000 vs. 18 per 100 000 in summer). In winter, survival to discharge was lower for OHCA patients (12.2% vs. 15.9% in summer). Both recent respiratory infection (AOR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52 - 0.87) and OHCA occurring during winter (AOR: 0.79 95% CI: 0.70 - 0.91) were associated with lower odds of survival to discharge. Preexisting respiratory disease was associated with lower odds of moderate to good recovery at 12 months (AOR:0.60 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.89). Conclusion: In winter the incidence of OHCA was at its highest and survival to discharge was at its lowest compared to other seasons. Recent respiratory infection was associated with lower odds of survival to discharge. Measures targeted to vulnerable groups, such as preventative public health measures for respiratory infections and the influenza vaccine may reduce the incidence of OHCA and improve survival rates.

TI  - Comparison of Medical Priority Dispatch (MPD) and Criteria Based Dispatch (CBD) relating to cardiac arrest calls
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Prompt emergency medical service (EMS) system activation with rapid delivery of pre-hospital treatment is essential for patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The two most commonly used dispatch tools are Medical Priority Dispatch (MPD) and Criteria Based Dispatch (CBD). We compared cardiac arrest call processing using these two dispatch tools in two different dispatch centres.
   Methods: Observational study of adult EMS confirmed (non-EMS witnessed) OHCA calls during one year in Richmond, USA (MPD) and Oslo, Norway (CBD). Patients receiving CPR prior to call, interrupted calls or calls where the caller did not have access to the patients were excluded from analysis. Dispatch logs, ambulance records and digitalized dispatcher and caller voice recordings were compared.
   Results: The MPDS-site processed 182 cardiac arrest calls and the CBD-site 232, of which 100 and 140 calls met the inclusion criteria, respectively. The recognition of cardiac arrest was not different in the MPD and CBD systems; 82% vs. 77% (p = 0.42), and pre-EMS arrival CPR instructions were offered to 81% vs. 74% (p = 0.22) of callers, respectively. Time to ambulance dispatch was median (95% confidence interval) 15 (13, 17) vs. 33 (29, 36) seconds (p < 0.001) and time to chest compression delivery; 4.3 (3.7, 4.9) vs. 3.7 (3.0, 4.1) min for the MPD and CBD systems, respectively (p = 0.05).
   Conclusion: Pre-arrival CPR instructions were offered faster and more frequently in the CBD system, but in both systems chest compressions were delayed 3-4 min. Earlier recognition of cardiac arrest and improved CPR instructions may facilitate earlier lay rescuer CPR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cerebral resuscitation from cardiac arrest: Treatment potentials
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - International Resuscitation Research Conference (IRRC 94)
AB  - In 1961, in Pittsburgh, PA, ''cerebral'' was added to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation system (CPR --> CPCR). Cerebral recovery is dependent on arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation times, and numerous factors related to basic, advanced, and prolonged life support. Postischemic-anoxic encephalopathy (the cerebral postresuscitation disease or syndrome) is complex and multifactorial. The prevention or mitigation of this syndrome requires that there be development and trials of special, multifaceted, combination treatments. The selection of therapies to mitigate the postresuscitation syndrome should continue to be based on mechanistic rationale. Therapy based on a single mechanism, however, is unlikely to be maximally effective. For logistic reasons, the limit for neurologic recovery after 5 mins of arrest must be extended to achieve functionally and histologically normal human brains after 10 to 20 mins of circulatory arrest. This goal has been approached, but not quite reached. Treatment effects on process variables give clues, but long-term outcome evaluation is needed for documentation of efficacy and to improve clinical results. Goals have crystallized for clinically relevant cardiac arrest-intensive care outcome models in large animals. These studies are expensive, but essential, because positive treatment effects cannot always be confirmed in the rat forebrain ischemia model. Except for a still-elusive breakthrough effect, randomized clinical trials of CPCR are limited in their ability to statistically document the effectiveness of treatments found to be beneficial in controlled outcome models in large animals. Clinical studies of feasibility, side effects, and acceptability are essential. Hypertensive reperfusion overcomes multifocal no-reflow and improves out come. Physical combination treatments, such as mild resuscitative (early postarrest) hypothermia (34 degrees C) plus cerebral blood flow promotion (e.g., with hypertension, hemodilution, and normocapnia), each having multiple beneficial effects, achieved complete functional and near complete histologic recovery of the dog brain after 11 mins of normothermic, ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Calcium entry blockers appear promising as a treat ment for postischemic anoxic encephalopathy. However, the majority of single or multiple drug treatments explored so far have failed to improve neurologic outcome. Assembling and evaluating combination treatments in further animal studies and determining clinical feasibility inside and outside hospitals are challenges for the near future. Treatments without permanent beneficial effects may at least extend the therapeutic window. All of these investigations will require coordinated efforts by multiple research groups, pursuing systematic, multilevel research-from cell cultures to rats, to large animals, and to clinical trials. There are still many gaps in our knowledge about optimizing extracerebral life support for cerebral outcome.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF THE IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR ON QUALITY-OF-LIFE
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an established treatment for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. While it clearly reduces the incidence of-death from recurrent arrhythmia, little is known about the impact on patients' quality-of-life. In this prospective study, quality-of-life was assessed by questionnaire before and after ICD implantation. The ''Sickness Impact Profile'' (SIP), which evaluates physical, psychosocial, and other activities, as well as functions of daily life, was used. Employment and rehospitalization rates were also examined. Twenty-one of 23 consecutive patients, aged 58 +/- 11 years, undergoing ICD implantation at Royal Perth Hospital were studied. During the 14 +/- 8 month follow-up, 4 patients died. Functional capacity was unchanged in all but one of the survivors in whom it improved from New York Heart Association Class III to II. Four of 8 survivors employed before implant have since retired. Six patients required rehospitalization on 23 occasions, problems related to arrhythmias or the ICD. Overall SIP scores preimplant (22.2 +/- 9.3; P < 0.05) were significantly worse at 6-month follow-up (21.7 +/- 18.2), but returned to preimplant levels by 12-month follow-up (8.8 +/- 10.8; NS). This was primarily due to transient problems in the areas of emotional behavior, alertness, and social interaction. SIP psychosocial dimension scores: preimplant: 7.2 +/- 9.0; 6-month: 17.8 +/- 28.2 (P < 0.05); and 12-month: 8.6 +/- 10.3 (NS). Early retirement and hospitalizations due to arrhythmias may still be expected even after implantation of an ICD; however, quality-of-life appears only to temporarily decline.

TI  - Medium and long-term aortic remodeling following aortic valve replacement combined with anticoagulation for DeBakey I aortic dissection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Background Total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk has achieved promising outcomes for DeBakey type I aortic dissection. However, the effects of anticoagulation on the distal false lumen and unfavorable remodeling of the distal aorta after aortic valve replacement remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to assess the impact of anticoagulation following aortic valve replacement on medium and long-term vascular remodeling outcomes in DeBakey type I aortic dissection.Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk for DeBakey Type I aortic dissection from September 2013 to December 2024. Seventy-two patients with preoperative and at least six months postoperative aortic computed tomography angiography images were included and stratified into a valve replacement group (n = 30) and a non-valve replacement group (n = 42). Various parameters of the residual dissected aorta were analyzed at six specific levels to evaluate late aortic remodeling, aortic diameter, and false lumen thrombosis.Results The median follow-up period was 17 (interquartile range IQR = 9-27) months. Preoperative characteristics and complications did not significantly differ between the two groups, except for body mass index, blood pressure, and severity of aortic regurgitation. The valve replacement group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamping time, cardiac arrest time, larger trunk diameter, and higher intraoperative red blood cells transfusion volume compared to the non-valve replacement group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in concomitant procedures, postoperative complications, or length of hospital stay. Regarding postoperative changes in the diameter of aortic lumen and true lumen, there were statistically significant difference in the true lumen on level 1 and the aortic lumen on level 3-5 of the valve replacement group. Additionally, the aortic lumen and true lumen on level 1 and true lumen on level 2 of the non-valve replacement group were statistically difference. There were no significant differences in the rate of aortic remodeling at each level or overall between the two groups. The postoperative false lumen thrombosis rate was higher in the mid-descending thoracic aorta and lower in the distal abdominal aorta.Conclusions Anticoagulation following aortic valve replacement for Debakey I aortic dissection has been shown to influence aortic diameter and the false lumen thrombosis rate, but it does not significantly affect the aortic remodeling rate. Overall, anticoagulation appears to be a viable treatment strategy for Debakey I aortic dissection.

TI  - One-year outcomes in individual domains of the cerebral performance category extended
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Physical and cognitive impairments are common after cardiac arrest, and recovery varies. This study assessed recovery of individual domains of the Cerebral Performance Category- Extended (CPC-E) 1-year after cardiac arrest. We hypothesized patients would have recovery in all CPC-E domains 1-year after the index cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study of cardiac arrest survivors evaluating outcome measures mRS, CPC, and CPC-E. Outcomes were assessed at discharge, 3-months, 6-months, and 1-year. We defined recovery of a CPC-E domain when >90% of patients had scores of 1-2 in that domain.
   Results: Of 156 patients discharged, 57 completed the CPC-E at discharge, and were included in the analysis. 37 patients had follow-up at 3-months, and 23 patients had follow-up at 6 and 12 months. Only 16 patients had assessments at all four timepoints. Domains of alertness (N = 56, 98%) logical thinking (N = 56; 98%), and attention (N = 55; 96%) recovered by hospital discharge. BADL (N = 34; 92%) and motor skills (N = 36; 97%) recovered by 3-months. Most patients (N = 20; 87%) experienced slight-to-no disability or symptoms (mRS 0-2/CPC 1-2) at 1-year follow up. CPC-E domains of short term memory (78%), mood (87%), fatigue (22%), complex ADL (78%), and return to work (65%) did not recover by 1-year.
   Conclusions: CPC-E domains of alertness, logical thinking, and attention recover rapidly, while domains of short term memory, mood, fatigue, complex ADL and return to work remain chronically impaired 1-year after cardiac arrest. These deficits are not detected by mRS and CPC. Interventions to improve recovery in these domains are needed.

TI  - Multimodal Neurologic Monitoring in Children With Acute Brain Injury
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Children with acute neurologic illness are at high risk of mortality and long-term neurologic disability. Severe traumatic brain injury, cardiac arrest, stroke, and central nervous system infection are often complicated by cerebral hypoxia, hypoperfusion, and edema, leading to secondary neurologic injury and worse outcome. Owing to the paucity of targeted neuroprotective therapies for these conditions, management emphasizes close physiologic monitoring and supportive care. In this review, we will discuss advanced neurologic monitoring strategies in pediatric acute neurologic illness, emphasizing the physiologic concepts underlying each tool. We will also highlight recent innovations including novel monitoring modalities, and the application of neurologic monitoring in critically ill patients at risk of developing neurologic sequelae.

TI  - Gas Therapies for Neuro-Protection
T2  - CRITICAL CARE CLINICS
AB  - Neuroprotection after CA remains a significant challenge. Despite advances in resuscitation and therapeutic strategies, survival with favorable neurologic outcome remains poor, emphasizing the need for novel treatment approaches. Gas therapy has emerged as a promising neuroprotective intervention, offering a unique strategy to mitigate PCABI through multiple gases with distinct and specific mechanisms of action. Indeed, Xe, Ar, H-2, and NO, represent a new frontier in improving neurologic outcomes following CA. These gases have consistently shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical models and, when combined with other interventions, such as MTH, may enhance recovery and reduce brain injury. However, challenges, such as manufacturing costs, logistical constraints, study design complexities, and the optimization of dosing and synergy, with other therapies persist. Although early clinical trials offer encouraging results, further rigorous research is needed to establish the safety, efficacy, and long-term benefits of these treatments in humans. Indeed, only limited clinical evidence from small pilot trials is currently available. Larger, well-designed clinical trials are essential to establish their therapeutic potential and guide future clinical application of these innovative and promising treatments.

TI  - Brain imaging after cardiac arrest
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of reviewMany patients who survive a cardiac arrest have a disorder of consciousness in the period after resuscitation, and prediction of long-term neurologic outcome requires multimodal assessments. Brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) and MRI is a key component. We aim to provide an overview of the types of neuroimaging available and their uses and limitations.Recent findingsRecent studies have evaluated qualitative and quantitative techniques to analyze and interpret CT and MRI to predict both good and poor outcomes. Qualitative interpretation of CT and MRI is widely available but is limited by low inter-rater reliability and lack of specificity around which findings have the highest correlation with outcome. Quantitative analysis of CT (gray-white ratio) and MRI (amount of brain tissue with an apparent diffusion coefficient below certain thresholds) hold promise, though additional research is needed to standardize the approach.Brain imaging is important for evaluating the extent of neurologic injury after cardiac arrest. Future work should focus on addressing previous methodological limitations and standardizing approaches to qualitative and quantitative imaging analysis. Novel imaging techniques are being developed and new analytical methods are being applied to advance the field.

TI  - Sudden cardiac arrest in, intercollegiate athletes: Detailed analysis and outcomes of resuscitation in nine cases
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - Background Public access defibrillation programs have demonstrated a survival benefit in persons with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, little is known about the effectiveness of early defibrillation in young competitive athletes with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).
   Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the details and outcomes of resuscitation in a cohort of intercollegiate athletes with SCA.
   Methods Nine cases of SCA in intercollegiate athletes occurring between 1999 and 2005 were identified through prior research and public media. A detailed questionnaire was completed by the certified athletic trainer involved in the resuscitation, and direct phone follow-up was achieved in every case.
   Results Nine intercollegiate athletes with SCA (4 basketball, 2 football, 2 lacrosse, and 1 swimming) had an average age of 21 years (range 18-30 years). All 9 athletes had a witnessed collapse, 7 occurred during practice, 1 during competition, and 1 during organized weight training. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated within 30 seconds after cardiac arrest in 6 cases and by 1 minute in 2 additional cases. An automated external defibrillator (AED) was provided by an athletic trainer in 5 cases and by arriving emergency medical services (EMS) in 4 cases. The initial cardiac rhythm was confirmed or suspected ventricular fibrillation in 7 athletes, pulseless idioventricular rhythm in 1 case, and unknown in 1 case. In 7 cases a shock was deployed, with an average time from cardiac arrest to defibrillation of 3.1 minutes (range 1-7.5 minutes). The average time from arrest to defibrillation decreased significantly if an AED was provided by an athletic trainer as compared with the responding EMS (1.6 vs 5.2 minutes; P=.046). Eight of the 9 athletes died. The underlying cause of sudden cardiac death was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 5, commotio cordis in 2, and myocardial infarction in 1. Diagnostic studies in the survivor demonstrated no structural heart disease or precise cause of SCA.
   Conclusion Despite witnessed collapse, immediate CPR, and prompt AED use in most cases, early defibrillation showed limited success, and survival was less than expected in this small cohort of intercollegiate athletes. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of early defibrillation and factors that affect survival in young athletes with SCA.

TI  - Perimortem Cesarean delivery following severe maternal penetrating injury
T2  - YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The case of a severely traumatized pregnant patient, in whom a perimortem cesarean section, in the emergency department, led to the birth of a viable baby, with long-term survivor, is described. A postmortem cesarean section, resulting in fetal survival, performed after 45 minutes of maternal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is reported in a patient with multiple penetrating injuries. A 27-year-old primigravida suffered cardiopulmonary arrest at the 34(th) week of gestation following multiple knife injuries. Although extensive advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 45 minutes, her vital signs did not return to normal levels. A low segment cesarean delivery was performed, and a female baby was delivered.
   The time interval between cardiopulmonary arrest and delivery, prior maternal health status, and continued cardiopulmonary resuscitation are important determinants of fetal survival. A perimortem cesarean section is advised in case of multiple penetrating injuries, even after 45 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, since it may result in fetal salvage.

T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Germany with an incidence of more than 100 deaths per year and 100,000 of population. The survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and resuscitation is not always inevitable, because emergency medical services (EMS) systems in Germany and Europe differ strikingly in terms of their quality of care.
   Analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry of the DGAI and of clinical trials.
   The best results can be achieved only if the entire chain of survival has been optimized. This begins with layperson- and telephone-CPR, adherence to a medically defined response time, the optimized implementation of basic life support measures and optimal emergency medical care by physicians before reaching the hospital. If it is possible to stabilize the patient prior to reaching the hospital, he or she should be transported to a "Cardiac Arrest Centre", so that both the therapeutic hypothermia and percutaneous coronary intervention can be carried out promptly. The German Resuscitation Registry (GRR) of the DGAI (German Association for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine) was developed as an important tool for total quality management in the treatment of OHCA. It is addressed to the responsible medical director of the EMS systems. Analysis of the GRR allows conclusions to be made concerning the structure, process and outcome of the participating EMS system compared to forecast parameters and the results of other participants.
   This enables a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis for the EMS system to be performed and should result in the initiation of targeted measures that both increase survival rates after OHCA and the quality of care.

TI  - Lifesaving Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Pilot Evaluation of a Targeted Educational Intervention to Improve Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Provision in Volunteer Surf Lifesavers
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Approximately 26,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in Australia each year, and only 13% of patients survive their event and return home. Survival variability from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests can be explained by a range of factors. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education quality-improvement programs focusing on identified elements of basic life support provision in concert with resuscitation system interventions have been associated with significant improvements in survival after cardiac arrest. Surf Life Saving Australia members respond to approximately 65 cardiac arrests per year in the community while on duty and have successfully resuscitated many beachgoers over the years. In addition to this, members frequently respond to cardiac arrest events in community settings as first responders. Objective: The objective of this research was to measure CPR improvements in Australian surf lifesavers after a targeted education intervention. Methods: Recruiting Australian surf lifesavers, we conducted a multicenter before-and-after educational intervention, consisting of theory and practical CPR instruction with quantitative measurement, cohort study of those who had previously been trained in CPR. Results: Statistically significant improvements in quality of CPR by laypersons were observed as measured by the chest compression fraction, depth, and release, as well as a reduction in time off the chest, improved ventilation, and a reduction in the longest pause during 2 min of CPR. Conclusions: This study was the first to evaluate the impact of a targeted CPR quality-improvement educational initiative on a sample of volunteer CPR providers from a large national first responder organization. The results showed that focused education using evidence-based interventions supports substantial improvement in most CPR metrics measured. A targeted education intervention has the potential to improve laypersons CPR performance. The results should prompt community CPR training providers to evaluate the quality of CPR being provided by the staff members they train and consider implementing a quality-improvement program if results are below the desired thresholds.

TI  - 'Do not resuscitate me in Barbados'
T2  - BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - New ways of encouraging discussion and education around the topic of do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions in healthcare can prove challenging. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is still portrayed as an intervention that is successful even in people with multiple long-term conditions. In 2020, during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a letter from a palliative care doctor to his patient was read out as part of an online campaign entitled #ReadALetter, organised by the organisation Letters Live. The letter addresses misconceptions regarding DNACPR decisions and encourages thoughtful dialogue. In particular, it promotes an individualised approach for clinicians, and investigates one patient's journey: from initially rejecting the concept, to later on fully embracing it as part of his holistic care. A journey that took him to Barbados, amongst other places.

TI  - External validation of simplified out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest hospital prognosis scores in a Japanese population: a multicentre retrospective cohort study
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background The novel simplified out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (sOHCA) and simplified cardiac arrest hospital prognosis (sCAHP) scores used for prognostication of hospitalised patients have not been externally validated. Therefore, this study aimed to externally validate the sOHCA and sCAHP scores in a Japanese population.
   Methods We retrospectively analysed data from a prospectively maintained Japanese database (January 2012 to March 2013). We identified adult patients who had been resuscitated and hospitalised after intrinsic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) (n=2428, age >= 18 years). We validated the sOHCA and sCAHP scores with reference to the original scores in predicting 1-month unfavourable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance categories 3-5) based on the discrimination and calibration measures of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test with a calibration plot, respectively.
   Results In total, 1985/2484 (82%) patients had a 1-month unfavourable neurological outcome. The original OHCA, sOHCA, original cardiac arrest hospital prognosis (CAHP) and sCAHP scores were available for 855/2428 (35%), 1359/2428 (56%), 1130/2428 (47%) and 1834/2428 (76%) patients, respectively. The AUCs of simplified scores did not differ significantly from those of the original scores, whereas the AUC of the sCAHP score was significantly higher than that of the sOHCA score (0.88 vs 0.81, p<0.001). The goodness of fit was poor in the sOHCA score (v=8, chi(2) =19.1 and Hosmer-Lemeshow test: p=0.014) but not in the sCAHP score (v=8, chi(2 )=( )13.5 and Hosmer-Lemeshow test: p=0.10).
   Conclusion The performances of the original and simplified OHCA and CAHP scores in predicting neurological outcomes in successfully resuscitated OHCA patients were acceptable. With the highest availability, similar discrimination and good calibration, the sCAHP score has promising potential for clinical implementation, although further validation studies to evaluate its clinical acceptance are necessary.

TI  - Mid-term outcomes with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiopulmonary failure secondary to massive pulmonary embolism
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
CP  - 33rd Annual Meeting of the European-Association-for-Cardio-Thoracic-Surgery (EACTS)
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There has been increasing interest in using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to rescue patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) in the advanced stages of respiratory or haemodynamic decompensation. We examined mid-term outcomes and risk factors for in-hospital mortality.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 36 patients who required ECMO placement (32 veno-arterial ECMO, 4 veno-venous) following acute PE. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Functional status and quality of life were assessed by phone questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Overall survival to hospital discharge was 44.4% (16/36). Two-year survival conditional to discharge was 94% (15/16). Twoyear survival after veno-arterial ECMO was 39% (13/32). In patients supported with veno-venous ECMO, survival to discharge was 50%, and both patients were alive at follow-up. In univariable analysis, a history of recent surgery (P = 0.064), low left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.029), right ventricular dysfunction >= moderate at weaning (P = 0.083), on-going cardiopulmonary resuscitation at ECMO placement (P = 0.053) and elevated lactate at weaning (P = 0.002) were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. In multivariable analysis, recent surgery (P = 0.018) and low left ventricular ejection fraction at weaning (P = 0.013) were independent factors associated with inhospital mortality. At a median follow-up of 23 months, 10 patients responded to our phone survey; all had acceptable functional status and quality of life.
   CONCLUSIONS: Massive acute PE requiring ECMO support is associated with high early mortality, but patients surviving to hospital discharge have excellent mid-term outcomes with acceptable functional status and quality of life. ECMO can provide a stable platform to administer other intervention with the potential to improve outcomes. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality after PE and veno-arterial ECMO support were identified.

TI  - Effects of buffer agents on postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Earlier studies demonstrated that hypertonic buffer agents administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) altered neither myocardial pH nor cardiac resuscitability. The rationale for the routine use of buffer agents for CPR has therefore been challenged. However, when these buffer agents are administered during CPR, they may have favorable effects on the postresuscitation course. Postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction has more recently emerged as a potentially fatal complication after successful cardiac resuscitation. Options for prevention and management of this complication have prompted the present stud ies, in which the effects of buffer agents administered during CPR are evaluated as to their effects on postresuscitation myocardial function and survival.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study.
   Setting: University animal laboratory.
   Subjects: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats (450 to 570 g).
   Interventions: Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically.
   Mechanical Ventilation and precordial compression were initiated after either a 4- or an 8-min interval of untreated cardiac arrest. Sodium bicarbonate as a CO2-generating buffer, Carbicarb(R) and tromethamine as CO2 consuming buffers, or hypertonic saline placebo were injected as a bolus into the right atrium during CPR. Defibrillation after 10 mins of cardiac arrest and CPR was successful in each instance. No differences in the electric power required for successful resuscitation were documented. Left ventricular pressure, rate of left Ventricular pressure increase measured at a left ventricular pressure of 40 mm Hg (dP/dt(40)), rate of left ventricular pressure decline (-dP/dt), and end-tidal PCO2 were continuously measured for 240 mins after successful resuscitation.
   Measurements and Main Results: Decreases in coronary per fusion pressure were observed after each buffer or placebo injection. As anticipated, end-tidal PCO2 increased after bicarbonate and decreased after Carbicarb or tromethamine. Postresuscitation left Ventricular function was significantly decreased in all animals. However, there was significantly less depression in rate of left Ventricular pressure increase measured at a left ventricular pressure of 40 mm Hg (dP/dt(40)), rate of left ventricular pressure decline (-dP/dt), and a lower left Ventricular diastolic pressure with both Carbicarb and tromethamine in association with significant increases in postresuscitation survival rate. When the duration of untreated cardiac arrest was increased to 8 mins, the severity of postresuscitation left ventricular dysfunction was magnified and postresuscitation myocardial function and survival were significantly improved with both CO2-generating and CO2-consuming buffer agents.
   Conclusion: Although buffer agents may not improve the success of resuscitation when administered during CPR, they may ameliorate postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and thereby improve postresuscitation survival.

TI  - Analysis during chest compressions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, a cross/sectional study: The DEFI 2022 study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: During out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), an automatic external defibrillator (AED) analyzes the cardiac rhythm every two minutes; however, 80% of refibrillations occur within the first minute post-shock. We have implemented an algorithm for Analyzing cardiac rhythm While performing chest Compression (AWC). When AWC detects a shockable rhythm, it shortens the time between analyses to one minute. We investigated the effect of AWC on cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality. Method: In this cross-sectional study, we compared patients treated in 2022 with AWC, to a historical cohort from 2017. Inclusion criteria were OHCA patients with a shockable rhythm at the first analysis. Primary endpoint was the chest compression fraction (CCF). Secondary endpoints were cardiac rhythm evolution and survival, including survival analysis of non-prespecified subgroups. Results: In 2017 and 2022, 355 and 377 OHCAs met the inclusion criteria, from which we analyzed the 285 first consecutive cases in each cohort. CCF increased in 2022 compared to 2017 (77% [72-80] vs 72% [67-76]; P < 0.001) and VF recurrences were shocked more promptly (53 s [32-69] vs 117 s [90-132]). Survival did not differ between 2017 and 2022 (adjusted hazard-ratio 0.96 [95% CI, 0.78-1.18]), but was higher in 2022 within the sub-group of OHCAs that occurred in a public place and within a short time from call to AED switch-on (adjusted hazard ratio 0.85[0.76-0.96]). Conclusions: OHCA patients treated with AWC had higher CCF, shorter time spent in ventricular fibrillation, but no survival difference, except for OHCA that occurred in public places with short intervention time.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation with temperature management could improve the neurological outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective analysis of a nationwide multicenter observational study in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background Target temperature management (TTM) is an effective component of treating out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) after return of spontaneous circulation in conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, therapeutic hypothermia (32-34 degrees C TTM) is not recommended based on the results of recent studies. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is another promising therapy for OHCA, but few studies have examined the effectiveness of ECPR with TTM. Therefore, we hypothesized that ECPR with TTM could have the effectiveness to improve the neurological outcomes for adults following witnessed OHCA, in comparison to ECPR without TTM. Methods We performed retrospective subanalyses of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry. We focused on adults who underwent ECPR for witnessed OHCA. We performed univariate (the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test), multivariable (logistic regression analyses), and propensity score analyses (the inverse probability of the treatment-weighting method) with to compare the neurological outcomes between patients with or without TTM, among all eligible patients, patients with a cardiogenic cause, and patients divided into subgroups according to the interval from collapse to pump start (ICPS) (> 30, > 45, or > 60 min). Results We analyzed data for 977 patients. Among 471 patients treated with TTM, the target temperature was therapeutic hypothermia in 70%, and the median interval from collapse to target temperature was 249 min. Propensity score analysis showed a positive association between TTM and favorable neurological outcomes in all patients (odds ratio 1.546 [95% confidence interval 1.046-2.286], P = 0.029), and in patients with ICPS of > 30 or > 45 min, but not in those with ICPS of > 60 min. The propensity score analysis also showed a positive association between TTM and favorable neurological outcomes in patients with a cardiogenic cause (odds ratio 1.655 [95% confidence interval 1.096-2.500], P = 0.017), including in all ICPS subgroups (> 30, > 45, and > 60 min). Conclusion Within patients who underwent ECPR following OHCA, ECPR with TTM could show the potential of improvement in the neurological outcomes, compared to ECPR without TTM.

TI  - The lay descriptors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Western Cape province, South Africa
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) is a time-sensitive emergency requiring prompt identification and emergency care to reduce morbidity and mortality. The first step in managing OHCA is rapid identification by the emergency dispatch centre. Identification of these patients remains challenging in South Africa due to multiple languages and widely differing levels of education. This study aimed to identify the key descriptors (words and phrases) of OHCA used by callers in the Western Cape when contacting the provincial Emergency Medical Services' emergency call centre.
   Methodology: Computer-aided dispatch data with a corresponding "patient unresponsive" incident type were drawn for a 12-month period (January-December 2018). Corresponding patient care records were extracted to verify OHCA. The original voice recordings between the caller and emergency call taker at the time of the emergency were extracted and transcribed verbatim. Transcriptions were subjected to inductive, qualitative content analysis to the manifest level. Descriptors of OHCA in isiXhosa, English and Afrikaans calls were coded, categorised, and quantified.
   Results: A total of 729 confirmed OHCA cases were identified, of which 38 (5.2%) Afrikaans, 24 (3.3%) isiXhosa and a random sample of 50 (6.8%) English calls were transcribed. Following content analysis, five distinct categories were identified. The most prevalent categories were descriptors related to ill health (medical history and suspected diagnosis; 35.5%), level of consciousness (unresponsive; 18.6%) and cardiac activity (pulselessness and suspected death; 17.2%).
   Conclusion: The vast majority of callers within the Western Cape province of South Africa use consistent descriptors across languages when requesting an ambulance for OHCA. Future studies should focus on the development and validation of OHCA recognition algorithms, based on these findings.

TI  - Validity of the IQCODE-CA: An informant questionnaire on cognitive decline modified for a cardiac arrest population
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To examine the psychometric properties of a modified version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), for a cardiac arrest population (IQCODE-CA).
   Methods: The IQCODE-CA, a 26-item observer-reported questionnaire, was completed by informants, defined as relatives or close friends, of 268 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors who participated in the Target Temperature Management trial in a scheduled follow-up 180 +/- 14 days after OHCA. Survivors completed the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). An exploratory factor analysis was performed. Associations between IQCODE-CA results and demographic variables along with other instruments were calculated. Area under the curve (AUC) ratios were evaluated to examine discrimination.
   Results: The IQCODE-CA measured one factor, global cognitive decline, with high internal consistency (ordinal alpha = 0.95). Age, gender or education did not influence the IQCODE-CA score. Associations with performance-based measures of global cognitive function as well as anxiety and depression ranged from small to moderate (rs = -0.29 to 0.38). AUC ratios ranged from fair to good (0.72-0.81). According to the MMSE and RBMT, the optimal cut-off score to identify cognitive decline on the IQCODE-CA was 3.04. Using this value, 53% of the survivors were under the cut-off.
   Conclusions: The IQCODE-CA identified a large amount of survivors with possible cognitive problems, making it useful when screening for cognitive decline post-CA. Due to lower AUC ratios than desired, additional performance-based measures should be used to improve the overall screening methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of hypertonic saline on myocardial blood flow in a porcine model of prolonged cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of hypertonic saline (HS) on myocardial reperfusion pressure (MPP) and blood flow (MBF), and cardiac index (CI) during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods: In 21 domestic swine (16-23 kg) open chest cardiac massage was initiated after 10 min of ventricular fibrillation. With the onset of CPR animals randomly received HS (7.2%; 2 ml/kg per 10 min or 4 ml/kg per 20 min) or normal saline ((NS); 2 ml/kg per 10 min). Haemodynamic variables were monitored continuously, and coloured microspheres were used to measure MBF and CI before cardiac arrest (CA), during CPR and 5, 30 and 120 min after the return of spontaneous circulation. Results: During CPR HS significantly increased MPP, MBF, and CI in comparison to NS (P < 0.05, resp., MANOVA). Doubling the volume of HS did not improve the haemodynamic effects seen after application of 2 ml/kg per 10 min. HS-infusion significantly increased the survival rate at 120 min, 6/7 and 5/7 animals receiving 2 ml/kg per 10 min or 4 ml/kg per 20 min versus 2/7 after NS-infusion (P < 0.05, chi(2)-test). Conclusions: HS applied during open chest cardiac massage enhanced MBF and CI, and significantly increased resuscitation success and survival rate. The positive effects of this promising new approach need to be confirmed in clinical studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contemporary national utilization of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
AB  - Objective The utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has demonstrated promising evidence for the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We aim to describe contemporary utilization and predictors of survival of patients receiving ECPR for OHCA. Methods The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify hospital discharge records of patients aged >= 18 years who underwent ECPR from 2012 to 2017. Patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of cardiac arrest, admitted urgently and placed on ECMO on Day 0 of hospitalization, were selected. Patients with a primary diagnosis indicative of veno-venous ECMO were excluded. Predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariable analyses. Results There were 1675 cases of ECPR, increasing from 185 cases in 2012 to 400 in 2017 (p < .001). Overall mortality was 63.3%, which remained stable over time (p = .441). Common diagnoses included ST-elevation myocardial infarction (39.1%), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (9.3%), and pulmonary embolism (13.7%). Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 495 patients (29.6%); coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 125 patients (7.5%). In multivariable analysis, decreased age, female gender, and left ventricular (LV) decompression were associated with reduced mortality. Conclusion Utilization of ECPR is increasing nationally with stable mortality rates. Younger age, female gender, and utilization of LV decompression were associated with increased survival.

TI  - TWEAK Knockdown Alleviates Post-Cardiac Arrest Brain Injury via the p38 MAPK/NF-?B Pathway
T2  - DISCOVERY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest (CA) and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause brain injury, which is one of the factors affecting the recovery of brain function in CA patients. There is increasing evidence that tumor necrosis factor -like weak apoptosis-inducing factor (TWEAK) is associated with the brain injury diseases. This study was aimed to investigate the modulation mechanism of TWEAK involved in brain injury after cardiac arrest/subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR).Materials and Methods: For in vivo experiments, healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were applied to establish CA/CPR model, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-stimulated neurons model was established in vitro. TWEAK short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were injected into the lateral ventricle of CA/CPR rats or transfected into OGD/R cell culture to analyze the consequent alteration in neurological scores, behavioral tests, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and neuroinflammation through immunofluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: There were high expressions of TWEAK and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) in the cerebral cortex of CA/CPR rats and OGD/R-stimulated neuronal cells. TWEAK knockdown attenuated cell apoptosis, inflammation and showed better behavioral tests in CA/CPR rats. Furthermore, TWEAK shRNAs obviously facilitated cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis and inflammation after OGD/R injury. Western blotting results stated that TWEAK silencing promoted phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) expressions.Conclusions: TWEAK might be involved in the pathogenesis of CA/CPR through inhibiting p38 MAPK/NF-?B pathway.

TI  - Feasibility of resuscitative transesophageal echocardiography at out-of-hospital emergency scenes of cardiac arrest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Guidelines recommend the use of ultrasound in cardiac arrest. Transthoracic echocardiography, has issues with image quality and by increasing hands-off times during resuscitation. We assessed the feasibility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which does not have both problems, at out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) emergency scenes. Included were 10 adults with non-traumatic OHCA in Vienna, Austria. An expert in emergency ultrasound was dispatched to the scenes in addition to the resuscitation team. Feasibility was defined as the ability to collect specific items of information by TEE within 10 min. Descriptive statistics were compiled and hands-off times were compared to a historical control group. TEE examinations were feasible in 9 of 10 cases and prompted changes in clinical management in 2 cases (cardiac tamponade: n = 1; right ventricular dilatation: n = 1). Their mean time requirement was 5.1 +/- 1.7 (2.8-8.0) min, and image quality was invariably rated as excellent or good during both compressions and pauses. No TEE-related complications, or interferences with activities of advanced life support were observed. The hands-off times during resuscitation were comparable to a historical control group not involving ultrasound (P = 0.24). Given these feasibility results, we expect that TEE can be used routinely at OHCA emergency scenes.

TI  - Uncontrolled Donation After Circulatory Determination of Death: A Systematic Ethical Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) refers to organ donation after a refractory cardiac arrest. We analyzed ethical issues raised by the uDCDD protocols of France, Madrid, and New York City. We recommend: (I) Termination of resuscitation (TOR) guidelines need refinement, particularly the minimal duration of resuscitation efforts before considering TOR; (2) Before enrolling in an uDCDD protocol, physicians must ascertain that additional resuscitation efforts would be ineffective; (3) Inclusion in an uDCDD protocol should not be made in the outpatient setting to avoid error and conflicts of interest; (4) The patient's condition should be reassessed at the hospital and reversible causes treated; (5) A no-touch period of at least 10 minutes should be respected to avoid the risk of autoresuscitation; (6) Once death has been determined, no procedure that may resume brain circulation should be used, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial ventilation, and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation; (7) Specific consent is required prior to entry into an uDCDD protocol; (8) Family members should be informed about the goals, risks, and benefits of planned uDCDD procedures; and (9) Public information on uDCDD is desirable because it promotes public trust and confidence in the organ donation system.

TI  - Beyond Survival: Pediatric Critical Care Interventional Trial Outcome Measure Preferences of Families and Healthcare Professionals
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To identify, in addition to survival, preferred outcome measures of PICU family care providers and PICU healthcare professionals for interventional trials enrolling critically ill children, and to describe general attitudes of family care providers and healthcare professionals regarding research in the PICU.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey examining subject experience with clinical research and personal preferences for outcome measures for a hypothetical interventional clinical trial.
   Setting: PICUs within four academic children's hospitals in the United States and Canada.
   Subjects: Two cohorts including family members of critically ill children in PICUs (family care providers) and multidisciplinary staff working in the PICUs (healthcare professionals).
   Interventions: Administration of a short, deidentified survey.
   Measurements: Demographic data were collated for the two subject groups. Participants were queried regarding their attitudes related to research conducted in the PICU. In addition to survival, each group was asked to identify their three most important outcomes for an investigation examining whether or not an intervention helps seriously ill children recover.
   Main Results: Demographics for family care providers (n = 40) and healthcare professionals (n = 53) were similarly distributed. Female respondents (79.8%) predominated. Participants (98.9%) ascertained the importance of conducting research in the PICU, but significant challenges associated with this goal in the high stress PICU environment. Both quality of life and functioning after leaving the hospital were chosen as the most preferred outcome measure, with 77.5% of family care providers and 84.9% of healthcare professionals indicating this choice. Duration of organ dysfunction was identified by 70.0% of family care providers and 40.7% of healthcare professionals as the second most preferred outcome measure.
   Conclusions: In addition to survival, long-term quality of life/functional status and duration of organ dysfunction represent important interventional trial outcome measures for both families of critically ill children, as well as the multidisciplinary team who provides critical care.

TI  - Impact of an emergency medical dispatch system on survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a population-based study
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In countries where a single public emergency telephone number is not in operation, different emergency telephone numbers corresponding to multiple dispatch centres (police, fire, emergency medical service) may create confusion for the population about the most appropriate service to call. In particular, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) requires a prompt and effective response. We compare two different dispatch systems on OHCA patient survival at 30 days in a national system with multiple emergency telephone numbers.
   Methods: We conducted an observational retrospective study of 6871 patients aged 18 years or older with presumed OHCA of cardiac origin between 2005 and 2013 in three counties of the Northern French Alps region. One county had a single dispatch centre combining medical and fire emergencies, and two had multiple dispatch centres. Propensity score matching analyses were performed to compare patient survival at 30 days.
   Results: A total of 2257 emergency calls for OHCA were managed by a single dispatch centre and 4614 by a multiple dispatch centre. A single dispatch centre was associated with an increase in survival (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for all patients: 1.7; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-2.2; p < 0.001; adjusted OR for propensity-matched patients: 2.0; 95 % CI = 1.2-3.4; p = 0.012).
   Conclusions: A single dispatch centre was associated with a markedly improved increase of survival among OHCA patients at 30 days in a system with several emergency telephone numbers.

TI  - V-A ECMO for neonatal coxsackievirus B fulminant myocarditis: a case report and literature review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Background Neonatal (enteroviral) myocarditis (NM/NEM) is rare but unpredictable and devastating, with high mortality and morbidity. We report a case of neonatal coxsackievirus B (CVB) fulminant myocarditis successfully treated with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). Case presentation A previously healthy 7-day-old boy presented with fever for 4 days. Progressive cardiac dysfunction (weak heart sounds, hepatomegaly, pulmonary edema, ascites, and oliguria), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS), transient ventricular fibrillation, dramatically elevated creatine kinase-MB (405.8 U/L), cardiac troponin I (25.85 ng/ml), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP > 35,000 ng/L), and positive blood CVB ribonucleic acid indicated neonatal CVB fulminating myocarditis. It was refractory to mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, inotropes, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and diuretics during the first 4 days of hospitalization (DOH 1-4). The deterioration was suppressed by V-A ECMO in the next 5 days (DOH 5-9), despite the occurrence of bilateral grade III intraventricular hemorrhage on DOH 7. Within the first 4 days after ECMO decannulation (DOH 10-13), he continued to improve with withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, LVEF > 60%, and FS > 30%. In the subsequent 4 days (DOH 14-17), his LVEF and FS decreased to 52% and 25%, and further dropped to 37%-38% and 17% over the next 2 days (DOH 18-19), respectively. There was no other deterioration except for cardiomegaly and paroxysmal tachypnea. Through strengthening fluid restriction and diuresis, and improving cardiopulmonary function, he restabilized. Finally, notwithstanding NT-proBNP elevation (>35,000 ng/L), cardiomegaly, and low LVEF (40%-44%) and FS (18%-21%) levels, he was discharged on DOH 26 with oral medications discontinued within 3 weeks postdischarge. In nearly three years of follow-up, he was uneventful, with interventricular septum hyperechogenic foci and mild mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. Conclusions Dynamic cardiac function monitoring via real-time echocardiography is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of NM/NEM. As a lifesaving therapy, ECMO may improve the survival rate of patients with NM/NEM. However, the "honeymoon period" after ECMO may cause the illusion of recovery. Regardless of whether the survivors of NM/NEM have undergone ECMO, close long-term follow-up is paramount to the prompt identification and intervention of abnormalities.

TI  - Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio in heart failure: Systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The meta-analysis is to evaluate the predictive value of the blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio (BCR) for long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies from inception to October 2023. STATA SE 14.0 software was used for statistical analysis. A total of 2036 reports were identified with 14 studies meeting pre-designed inclusion criteria. Three long-term outcomes were investigated. In patients with HF, the increase of BCR level indicated a greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.38-2.00; I2 = 90.8%, P = 0.000). The acute HF (AHF) subgroup demonstrated a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.15-2.79; I2 = 93.9%, P = 0.000) as did the non-AHF subgroup (HR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.34-1.71; I2 = 37.1%, P = 0.122). The subgroup (<= 70 years old) demonstrated a lower risk of all-cause mortality in patients with HF (HR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.35-1.94; I2 = 68.3%, P = 0.004) as did the subgroup (> 70 years old) (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.19-2.34; I2 = 88.3%, P = 0.000). In addition, this study did not support the predictive value of BCR in CVD mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 0.91-2.43; I2 = 63%, P = 0.100) and HF hospitalization (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.73-2.24; I2 = 77.5%, P = 0.035). Sensitivity analysis showed that all the results were robust. In summary, the results showed that the blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio (BCR) had a significant predictive value for all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure and was a fairly promising predictor obviously. Moreover, more studies are needed to further determine the predictive value of BCR in other long-term outcomes such as CVD mortality, HF hospitalization or aborted cardiac arrest.

TI  - In-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - To review the current management of in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify variables that influence outcomes, OLDMED-LINE from 1950 to 1966 and MEDLINE from 1966 to March 2005 were searched using the keywords cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiac arrest, in hospital, and adult. Secondary sources were derived from review publications and personal communications by one of the authors. There is no secure evidence that the ultimate outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in settings of in-hospital cardiac arrest have improved in the > 40 yrs that followed the landmark report by Kouwenhoven, Jude, and Knickerbocker, which launched the modern era of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A paucity of objective measurements preclude secure protocols for sequencing of interventions and, even more, when to initiate and discontinue cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The preparedness of both physicians and nursing professionals to implement the published guidelines has itself been questioned. Whereas early access defibrillation with automated external defibrillators may be of benefit in out-of-hospital settings, there has as yet been no secure evidence that automated external defibrillators have had a favorable impact on in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation when used on infrequent occasions by first responders. This contrasts with the much greater success of advanced life support providers and especially when electrical defibrillation is promptly performed by expertly trained personnel after onset of cardiac arrest. Outcomes are therefore improved in critical care settings and especially in coronary care units in which patients are continuously monitored.

TI  - Predictors of mortality after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a promising adjunct to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in refractory cardiac arrest (CA). Factors associated with outcome are incompletely characterised. The aim of our study was to identify pre-ECMO factors associated with in hospital mortality after extracorporeal CPR (ECPR).
   Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of patients.
   Setting: Academic quaternary referral hospital.
   Participants: All patients who underwent ECPR from January 2012 through April 2017.
   Interventions: A retrospective chart review was performed for CPR and ECMO. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with mortality after EC PR.
   Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was in hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included survival with favourable neurologic outcome, days on ECMO, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.
   Results: During the study period, 75 patients received ECPR. Median age was 59 years, 81% were male, 51% had out-of-hospital CA, and 57% had an initial shockable rhythm. Median time from arrest to ECMO was 91 minutes (IQR, 56-129) for non-survivors and 51 minutes (IQR, 37-84) for survivors (P = 0.02). Twenty-six patients (39%) were successfully separated from ECMO, with 31% surviving to hospital discharge and 29% with a cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2. In multivariable analysis, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were ongoing CPR at the time of ECMO initiation (P < 0.01) and arrest to ECMO cannulation time (P = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Following ECPR, the factors most strongly associated with mortality were ongoing CPR at the time of ECMO initiation and arrest to ECMO cannulation time. Interventions aimed at reducing time to ECMO initiation may lead to improved outcomes.

TI  - Copeptin as a marker of outcome after cardiac arrest: a sub-study of the TTM trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Arginine vasopressin has complex actions in critically ill patients, involving vasoregulatory status, plasma volume, and cortisol levels. Copeptin, a surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, has shown promising prognostic features in small observational studies and is used clinically for early rule out of acute coronary syndrome. The objective of this study was to explore the association between early measurements of copeptin, circulatory status, and short-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods Serial blood samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h as part of the target temperature management at 33 degrees C versus 36 degrees C after cardiac arrest trial, an international multicenter randomized trial where unconscious survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were allocated to an intervention of 33 or 36 degrees C for 24 h. Primary outcome was 30-day survival with secondary endpoints circulatory cause of death and cardiovascular deterioration composite; in addition, we examined the correlation with extended the cardiovascular sequential organ failure assessment (eCvSOFA) score. Results Six hundred ninety patients were included in the analyses, of whom 203 (30.3%) developed cardiovascular deterioration within 24 h, and 273 (39.6%) died within 30 days. Copeptin measured at 24 h was found to be independently associated with 30-day survival, hazard ratio 1.17 [1.06-1.28], p = 0.001; circulatory cause of death, odds ratio 1.03 [1.01-1.04], p = 0.001; and cardiovascular deterioration composite, odds ratio of 1.05 [1.02-1.08], p < 0.001. Copeptin at 24 h was correlated with eCvSOFA score with rho 0.19 [0.12-0.27], p < 0.001. Conclusion Copeptin is an independent marker of severity of the post cardiac arrest syndrome, partially related to circulatory failure.

TI  - Further Studies on the Hypothesis of PARP-1 Inhibition as a Strategy for Lessening the Long-Term Effects Produced by Perinatal Asphyxia: Effects of Nicotinamide and Theophylline on PARP-1 Activity in Brain and Peripheral Tissue
T2  - NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH
AB  - Oxygen interruption leads to death when re-oxygenation is not promptly re-established. Re-oxygenation triggers a cascade of biochemical events for restoring function at the cost of improper homeostasis. The effects observed long after perinatal asphyxia (PA) have been explained by over-expression of sentinel proteins, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), competing for NAD(+) during re-oxygenation, leading to the idea that sentinel protein inhibition constitutes a therapeutic strategy. We studied the effects of nicotinamide and theophylline on PARP-1 activity assayed in brain and peripheral (heart) rat tissue 1-24 h after birth, as well as on changes in behaviour and monoamine neurotransmission in adult rats. PA was induced by immersing rat foetuses into a water bath for 0 or 21 min. After resuscitation, the pups were treated with nicotinamide (0.8 mmol/kg, i.p.), theophylline (0.14 mmol/kg, i.p.) or saline (0.9% NaCl) and nurtured by surrogate dams, pending behavioural and microdialysis experiments, or euthanised after birth for assaying PARP-1 activity. To estimate the in vivo distribution of a single dose of nicotinamide or theophylline into brain and peripheral compartment, a series of animals were implanted with microdialysis probes, one into the brain and other subcutaneously, 1 h after birth, assaying the drugs with a HPLC-UV system. Nicotinamide, but not theophylline prevented the long-term effects induced by PA. Only nicotinamide produced a consistent decrease in PARP-1 activity in brain and heart, whether assayed in control or asphyxia-exposed pups. The present results support the idea that the long-term effects induced by PA imply PARP-1 over-activation.

TI  - Buffer administration during CPR promotes cerebral reperfusion after return of spontaneous circulation and mitigates post-resuscitation cerebral acidosis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - To explore the effects of alkaline buffers on cerebral perfusion and cerebral acidosis during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 45 anaesthetized piglets were studied. The animals were subjected to 5 min non-interventional circulatory arrest followed by 7 min closed chest CPR and received either 1 mmol/kg of sodium bicarbonate, I mmol/kg of tris buffer mixture, or the same volume of saline (n = 15 in all groups), adrenaline (epinephrine) boluses and finally external defibrillatory shocks. Systemic haemodynamic variables, cerebral cortical blood flow, arterial, mixed venous, and internal jugular bulb blood acid-base status and blood gases as well as cerebral tissue pH and PCO2 were monitored. Cerebral tissue acidosis was recorded much earlier than arterial acidaemia. After restoration of spontaneous circulation, during and after temporary arterial hypotension, pH in internal jugular bulb blood and in cerebral tissue as well as cerebral cortical blood flow was lower after saline than in animals receiving alkaline buffer. Buffer administration during CPR promoted cerebral cortical reperfusion and mitigated subsequent post-resuscitation cerebral acidosis during lower blood pressure and flow in the reperfusion phase. The arterial alkalosis often noticed during CPR after the administration of alkaline buffers was caused by low systemic blood flow, which also results in poor outcome.

TI  - Effect of preliminary stresses on the induction of viable but non-culturable Escherichia coli O157:H7 NCTC 12900 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538
T2  - FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - As a novel non-thermal pasteurization technology, high pressure carbon dioxide (HPCD) has been used in food processing. However, it could induce microorganisms into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, posing a potential risk to food safety and public health. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effect of various preliminary stresses including cold, heat, osmosis, acidity and oxidation on HPCD-induced VBNC formation. The results indicated that there was no effect of preliminary stresses on VBNC Staphylococcus aureus induction. However, heat, acidity and long-term (24 h) cultivation preadaptation could significantly increase the VBNC E. coli production induced by HPCD. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes involved in ATP production were significantly decreased in these three stress-treated cells, and further ATP levels determination revealed that the ATP levels of the cell were significantly decreased after heat, acidity and long-term cultivation preadaptation, implying the decrease of ATP level caused by these stresses might be the reason for increasing VBNC production. To further study the relationship between ATP level and VBNC cell ratios after preadaptation. We artificially decreased the ATP levels, and detect their VBNC ratios after HPCD treatment. We found that with the ATP concentration decreasing after exposure to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP), the VBNC ratios were increased after HPCD treatment, indicating that the ATP contents were highly negatively correlated with VBNC ratios. This study proved that the preadaptation of heat, acidity and long-term cultivation could promote VBNC induction by decreasing the intracellular ATP level. In general, the obtained result gave the instruction about the storage environment for food materials, helped to further develop and optimize the HPCD processing to prevent VBNC formation and accelerate the development of HPCD technology in food industry.

TI  - Proteomics identify pathogenesis and novel biomarkers for monitoring and early prognostication of brain injury after cardiac arrest: a randomized animal study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is the leading cause of death and disability after resuscitation. This study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis and novel biomarkers for monitoring the progression and early prognostication of PCABI. Methods: Mouse model of PCABI was induced by hyperkalemia-induced asystole and successful resuscitation. Young adult male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into sham-operation or asystole/resuscitation. The sham-operated mice were selected as control. Neurological examinations were performed at 24 h after resuscitation, and three groups were set: control (n = 4), severe PCABI (n = 3), and mild PCABI (n = 3). Cerebral cortexes were collected for data-independent acquisition-proteomic analyses. The pathogenesis and potential biomarkers were identified through the pairwise comparisons of three subgroups and subsequent bioinformatics analyses. Human serum proteomes profiles, extracted from a published work of the second analysis of TTM-trial, were used for joint analyses to identify the common and clinically relevant biomarkers at the same timepoint. Experimental and external validation were performed to verify the association between novel biomarkers and neural death in PCABI. Results: The proteomic analysis identified and quantified 7,745 proteins. The most prominent proteomic changes were related to response to external stimulus, stress response, regulation of biological and metabolic process, endomembrane system, and inflammatory response in the PCABI progression. 10 potential biomarkers were identified by the pairwise comparisons of three groups, and lipocalin-2 and angiotensinogen are common biomarkers with human studies at 24 h after resuscitation. Experimental validation verified that lipocalin-2 was closely associated with neurodegeneration in PCABI. Conclusions: Stress, inflammatory, and metabolic responses play important roles in the progression of PCABI. Lipocalin-2 is a novel biomarker for monitoring and early neuroprognostication at 24 h after resuscitation.

TI  - Public knowledge and expectations about dispatcher assistance in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim To assess the factors associated with the knowledge and expectations among the general public about dispatcher assistance in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidents. Background In medical dispatch centres, emergency calls are frequently operated by specially trained nurses as dispatchers. In cardiac arrest incidents, efficient communication between the dispatcher and the caller is vital for prompt recognition and treatment of the cardiac arrest. Design A cross-sectional observational survey containing six questions and seven demographic items. Method From January-June 2017 we conducted standardized interviews among 500 members of the general public in Norway. In addition to explorative statistical methods, we used multivariate logistic analysis. Results Most participants expected cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructions, while few expected "help in deciding what to do." More than half regarded the bystanders present to be responsible for the decision to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Most participants were able to give the correct emergency medical telephone number. The majority knew that the emergency call would not be terminated until the ambulance arrived at the scene. However, only one-third knew that the emergency telephone number operator was a trained nurse. Conclusion The public expect cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructions from the emergency medical dispatcher. However, the majority assume it is the responsibility of the bystanders to make the decision to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation or not. Based on these findings, cardiopulmonary resuscitation training initiatives and public campaigns should focus more on the role of the emergency medical dispatcher as the team leader of the first resuscitation team in cardiac arrest incidents.

TI  - Targeted Temperature Management in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest With Shockable Rhythm: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest Trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The optimal targeted temperature in patients with shockable rhythm is unclear, and current guidelines recommend targeted temperature management with a correspondingly wide range between 32 degrees C and 36 degrees C. Our aim was to study survival and neurologic outcome associated with targeted temperature management strategy in postarrest patients with initial shockable rhythm. DESIGN: Observational substudy of the Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest without ST-segment Elevation trial. SETTING: Nineteen hospitals in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: The Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest trial randomized successfully resuscitated patients with shockable rhythm and absence of ST-segment elevation to a strategy of immediate or delayed coronary angiography. In this substudy, 459 patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia (32.0-34.0 degrees C) or targeted normothermia (36.0-37.0 degrees C) were included. Allocation to targeted temperature management strategy was at the discretion of the physician. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 90 days, 171 patients (63.6%) in the mild therapeutic hypothermia group and 129 (67.9%) in the targeted normothermia group were alive (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.62-1.18]; log-rank p = 0.35; adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.45-1.72). Patients in the mild therapeutic hypothermia group had longer ICU stay (4 d [3-7 d] vs 3 d [2-5 d]; ratio of geometric means, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51), lower blood pressures, higher lactate levels, and increased need for inotropic support. Cerebral Performance Category scores at ICU discharge and 90-day follow-up and patient-reported Mental and Physical Health Scores at 1 year were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm and no ST-elevation, treatment with mild therapeutic hypothermia was not associated with improved 90-day survival compared with targeted normothermia. Neurologic outcomes at 90 days as well as patient-reported Mental and Physical Health Scores at 1 year did not differ between the groups.

TI  - The Lived Experience of Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - BackgroundSurvival rates after cardiac arrest have steadily increased over the past few decades because of the adoption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, public access to automated external defibrillators, and an increase in public education on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The lived experiences of post-cardiac arrest survival have been underexplored. The themes that resulted from the analysis in this scoping review can inform clinical practice and propose strategies to improve the patients' quality of life.ObjectiveThe objective of this scoping review was to map out qualitative literature that explores the lived experience of individuals who have survived cardiac arrest.MethodIn this scoping review, the authors examined peer-reviewed qualitative studies identified in the PubMed, CINAHL, and MEDLINE databases. Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting a scoping study was followed.ResultsThe search yielded 174 articles, with 16 meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Initially, 14 articles were selected, and 2 additional articles were identified through references. Themes extracted from these 16 articles include the need for support and information, emotional challenges, and acceptance of a new reality.ConclusionCardiac arrest survivors often experience loss of control, vulnerability, and insecurity. These emotional changes can be significant and may include physical challenges, cognitive impairments, and psychological distress, which can cause individuals to reevaluate their perspectives on life and accept a new reality, potentially leading to changes in their future outlook.

TI  - A Meta-ethnography of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors' Meanings on Life and Death
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors' physiological outcomes have been addressed, less is known on the holistic needs of individuals after OHCA, which hinders our ability to prioritize care around what really matters to survivors. Aim: The aim of this study was to interpretatively synthesize qualitative findings on OHCA survivors' perceptions and meanings of life and death and existential issues. Methods: We used a meta-ethnographic synthesis of published qualitative studies addressing the experiences of OHCA survivors based on a systematic literature search (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed). Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The identified studies were subjected to a quality appraisal based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Results: Based on eligibility criteria, 6 phenomenological studies were included, of overall medium to high quality. One core theme, "the reality of death," and 4 main themes were identified: "redefining existence"; "revaluing death"; "being familiar with, yet oblivious of death"; and "living consciously." Emerging from the realization of death, the themes appeared to describe a gradual progression toward living consciously. Conclusions: An existential trajectory and a need for meaning are central in the experience of OHCA survivors. When existential issues are not addressed, the ongoing suffering may interfere with survivors' recovery and quality of life. Future research needs to address specific needs and ways to support survivors' meaning-making.

TI  - Transvenous versus subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators in young cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are indicated in young patients presenting with aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) because of ventricular arrhythmias. Transvenous-ICDs (TV-ICDs) are effective, established therapies supported by evidence. The significant morbidity associated with transvenous leads led to the development of the newer subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD). This review discusses the clinical considerations when selecting an ICD for the young patient presenting with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The major benefits of TV-ICDs are their ability to pace (antitachycardia pacing [ATP], bradycardia support and cardiac resynchronisation therapy [CRT]) and the robust evidence base supporting their use. Other benefits include a longer battery life. Significant complications associated with transvenous leads include pneumothorax and tamponade during insertion and infection and lead failure in the long term. Comparatively, S-ICDs, by virtue of having no intravascular leads, prevent these complications. S-ICDs have been associated with a higher incidence of inappropriate shocks. Patients with an indication for bradycardia pacing, CRT or ATP (documented ventricular tachycardia) are seen as unsuitable for a S-ICD. If venous access is unsuitable or undesirable, S-ICDs should be considered given the patient is appropriately screened. There is a need for further randomised controlled trials to directly compare the two devices. TV-ICDs are an effective therapy for preventing SCD limited by significant lead-related complications. S-ICDs are an important development hindered largely by an inability to pace. Young patients stand to gain the most from a S-ICD as the cumulative risk of lead-related complications is high. A clinical framework to aid decision-making is presented.

TI  - Delayed versus immediate defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Human studies over the last decade have indicated that delaying initial defibrillation to allow a short period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may promote a more responsive myocardial state that is more likely to respond to defibrillation and result in increased rates of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and/or survival. Out-of-hospital studies have produced conflicting results regarding the benefits of CPR prior to defibrillation in relation to survival to hospital discharge. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of delayed defibrillation preceded by CPR with immediate defibrillation on survival to hospital discharge.
   Methods: A systematic literature search of key electronic databases including Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was conducted independently by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials meeting the eligibility criteria were critically appraised according to the Cochrane Group recommended methodology. Meta-analyses were conducted for the outcomes of survival to hospital discharge overall and according to response time of emergency medical services.
   Results: Three randomised controlled trials were identified which addressed the question of interest. All included studies were methodologically appropriate to include in a meta-analysis. Pooled results from the three studies demonstrated no benefit from providing CPR prior to defibrillation compared to immediate defibrillation for survival to hospital discharge (OR 0.94 95% CI 0.46-1.94). Meta-analysis of results according to ambulance response time (<= 5 min or >5 min) also showed no difference in survival rates.
   Conclusion: Delaying initial defibrillation to allow a short period of CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF demonstrated no benefit over immediate defibrillation for survival to hospital discharge irrespective of response time. There is no evidence that CPR before defibrillation is harmful. Based on the existing evidence, EMS jurisdictions are justified continuing with current practice using either defibrillation strategy.

TI  - Massive Pulmonary Embolism Causing Cardiac Arrest Managed with Systemic Thrombolytic Therapy. A Case Report
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
AB  - Objective: Rare disease
   Background: Approximately 290 000 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest occur annually, the majority of which are due to cardiac or respiratory causes. Cardiac arrest due to acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with a 90% incidence of mortality and, if identified, it can be treated with systemic thrombolytics. Here, we describe a case in which the outcome for such an event was favorable.
   Case Report: A 66-year-old woman was admitted with multiple rib and left ankle fractures due to accidental trauma. Before undergoing orthopedic surgery, she experienced a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity, which was witnessed. She had refractory hypoxia and hypotension following intubation and a brief initial return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before a second cardiac arrest. A 100-mg bolus dose of systemic thrombolytic therapy was promptly administered, with rapid achievement of sustained ROSC. The results of a subsequent electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and computed tomography scan further supported the diagnosis of acute PE with right heart strain. Supportive care in the Intensive Care Unit resulted in full neurological recovery and she was discharged to a physical rehabilitation facility 12 days after her cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions: Systemic thrombolytic therapy is beneficial for cardiac arrest due to acute PE.

TI  - Psychological and behavioral dimensions in cardiac arrest survivors and their families: A state-of-the-art review
T2  - NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - This article aims to highlight high-quality observational and intervention studies focused on promoting psychological well-being among cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and their families. Following CA, many patients experience significant psychological distress, including depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Recent studies indicate that this distress can narrow patients' focus, resulting in heightened awareness of cardiac signals-such as fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure-that lead to constant monitoring and increased anxiety. This anxiety, compounded by behavioral avoidance toward cardioprotective behaviors and physiological hyperarousal, may elevate the risk of secondary cardiovascular diseases and adversely affect the quality of life. Current research is exploring behavioral interventions aimed at reducing this psychological distress, strategies to enhance coping mechanisms, and improving overall health in the survivor-family dyad. Unlike other cardiovascular conditions, no clinical practice guidelines exist for assessing or treating the psychological consequences of CA. Future research should prioritize identifying and treating modifiable psychological factors using targeted therapies and behavioral interventions.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) Retrospective analysis of a load and go strategy under the aspect of golden hour of eCPR
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - Background Survival rates after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remain low. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) has been introduced as an attempt to increase survival in selected patients and observational studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, inclusion criteria and timing of eCPR remain undefined. Objective The current study analyzed a load and go strategy with respect to the golden hour of eCPR as a cut-off time for survival and favorable neurological outcome. Material and methods This retrospective cohort study included 32 patients who underwent eCPR treatment due to an OHCA between January 2017 and September 2019. Routinely taken patient demographic data (age, BMI, sex) were analyzed. The main focus was set on processing times in the preclinical and clinical setting. Time intervals including OHCA until ambulance arrival, time on scene, transportation times and door to eCPR were extracted from emergency medical service (EMS) and resuscitation protocols. Low-flow times, survival and neurological outcome were analyzed. Results The use of eCPR in OHCA was associated with survival to hospital discharge in 28% and a good neurological outcome in 19% of the cases. Both groups (survivor and nonsurvivor) did not differ in patient demographics except for age. Survivors were significantly younger (47 (30-60) vs. 59 (50-68) years, p = 0.035). Processing times as well as low-flow times were not significantly different (OHCA-eCPR survivor 64 (50-87) vs. non-survivor 74 (51-85) min; p-value 0.64); however, median low-flow times were outside the golden hour of eCPR (69 (52-86)). Conclusion Despite low-flow times of more than 60 min, eCPR was associated with survival in 28% after OHCA. Hence, exceeding the golden hour of eCPR cannot act as a definitive exclusion criterion for eCPR.

TI  - Small Area Variations in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Does the Neighborhood Matter?
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The incidence and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest vary widely across cities. It is unknown whether similar differences exist at the neighborhood level.
   Objective: To determine the extent to which neighborhoods have persistently high rates of cardiac arrest but low rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Design: Multilevel Poisson regression of 1108 cardiac arrests from 161 census tracts as captured by the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES).
   Setting: Fulton County, Georgia, between 1 October 2005 to 30 November 2008.
   Measurements: Incidence of cardiac arrest, by census tract and year and by rates of bystander CPR.
   Results: Adjusted rates of cardiac arrest varied across neighborhoods (interquartile range [IQR], 0.57 to 0.73 per 1000 persons; mean, 0.64 per 1000 persons [SD, 0.11]) but were stable from year to year (intraclass correlation, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.50]; P < 0.001). Adjusted bystander CPR rates also varied by census tract (IQR, 19% to 29%; mean, 25% [SD, 10%]).
   Limitation: Analysis was based on data from a single county.
   Conclusion: Surveillance data can identify neighborhoods with a persistently high incidence of cardiac arrest and low rates of bystander CPR. These neighborhoods are promising targets for community-based interventions.
