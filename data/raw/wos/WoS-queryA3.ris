TI  - Role of perfusion medium, oxygen and rheology for endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death after hypothermic machine preservation of the liver
T2  - TRANSPLANT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Recently, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been disclosed as subcellular target reactive to ischaemia/reperfusion and possibly influenced by hypothermic machine preservation. Here, the respective role of perfusate, perfusion itself, and the effect of continuous oxygenation to trigger ER-stress in the graft should be investigated. Livers were retrieved 30 min after cardiac arrest of male Wistar rats and preserved by cold storage (CS) in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) for 18 h at 4 degrees C. Other organs were subjected to aerobic conditions either by oxygenated machine perfusion with HTK (MP-HTK) or Belzer solution (MP-Belzer) at 4 degrees C or by venous insufflation of gaseous oxygen during cold storage (VSOP). Viability of livers was evaluated upon reperfusion in vitro according to previously validated techniques for 120 min at 37 degrees C. Oxygenation during preservation (MP-HTK, MP-Belzer or VSOP) concordantly improved functional recovery (bile flow, ammonia clearance), reduced parenchymal enzyme leakage and histological signs of necrosis and significantly attenuated mitochondrial induction of apoptosis (cleavage of caspase 9) compared to CS. However, MP with either medium produced about 500% elevated protein expression of CHOP/GADD153, suggesting pro-apoptotic ER-stress responses, paralleled by a significant elevation of caspase-12 enzyme activity compared to CS or VSOP. Although MP also promoted a slight (20%) induction of the cytoprotective ER-protein Bax inhibitor protein (BI-1), prevailing of proapoptotic reactions was seen by increased cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-Ribase)-polymerase (PARP) in both MP-groups. Endoplasmic stress activation is conjectured a specific side effect of long-term machine preservation irrespective of the medium, actually promoting cellular apoptosis via activation of caspase-12. The simple insufflation of gaseous O-2 may be considered a feasible alternative, apparently indifferent to the endoplasmic reticulum.

TI  - The effect of sodium thiosulfate on immune cell metabolism during porcine hemorrhage and resuscitation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), an H2S releasing agent, was shown to be organ-protective in experimental hemorrhage. Systemic inflammation activates immune cells, which in turn show cell type-specific metabolic plasticity with modifications of mitochondrial respiratory activity. Since H2S can dose-dependently stimulate or inhibit mitochondrial respiration, we investigated the effect of Na2S2O3 on immune cell metabolism in a blinded, randomized, controlled, long-term, porcine model of hemorrhage and resuscitation. For this purpose, we developed a Bayesian sampling-based model for C-13 isotope metabolic flux analysis (MFA) utilizing 1,2-C-13(2)-labeled glucose, C-13(6)-labeled glucose, and C-13(5)-labeled glutamine tracers.Methods: After 3 h of hemorrhage, anesthetized and surgically instrumented swine underwent resuscitation up to a maximum of 68 h. At 2 h of shock, animals randomly received vehicle or Na2S2O3 (25 mg/kg/h for 2 h, thereafter 100 mg/kg/h until 24 h after shock). At three time points (prior to shock, 24 h post shock and 64 h post shock) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and granulocytes were isolated from whole blood, and cells were investigated regarding mitochondrial oxygen consumption (high resolution respirometry), reactive oxygen species production (electron spin resonance) and fluxes within the metabolic network (stable isotope-based MFA).Results: PBMCs showed significantly higher mitochondrial O-2 uptake and lower O-2(center dot-) production in comparison to granulocytes. We found that in response to Na2S2O3 administration, PBMCs but not granulocytes had an increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption combined with a transient reduction of the citrate synthase flux and an increase of acetyl-CoA channeled into other compartments, e.g., for lipid biogenesis.Conclusion: In a porcine model of hemorrhage and resuscitation, Na2S2O3 administration led to increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption combined with stimulation of lipid biogenesis in PBMCs. In contrast, granulocytes remained unaffected. Granulocytes, on the other hand, remained unaffected. O-2(center dot-) concentration in whole blood remained constant during shock and resuscitation, indicating a sufficient anti-oxidative capacity. Overall, our MFA model seems to be is a promising approach for investigating immunometabolism; especially when combined with complementary methods.

TI  - Physical Activity, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: Part 2
T2  - PULSE
AB  - Background: In this second section of our 2-part review on the role of physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in preventing and treating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), we expand on topics covered in part 1, including a comparison of moderate-intensity continuous training versus high-intensity interval training, the beneficial role of PA and CRF in heart failure, potential mal-adaptations that may result from extreme endurance exercise regimens, and the incidence of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death during marathon running and triathlon participation. Further, we review the principles of exercise prescription for patients with known or suspected CVD, with specific reference to exercise modalities, contemporary guidelines, the minimum exercise training intensity to promote survival benefits, and long-term goal training intensities, based on age-, sex-, and fitness-adjusted targets. Finally, we provide practical "prescription pearls" for the clinician, including a simple rule to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) during level and graded treadmill walking, research-based exercise training recommendations, using steps per day, MET-minutes per week, and personal activity intelligence to achieve beneficial treatment outcomes, as well as the heart rate index equation to estimate energy expenditure, expressed as METs, during recreational and leisure-time PA. Summary: This review compares moderate-intensity continuous training and high-intensity interval training, examines the role of PA and CRF in managing heart failure, and discusses the cardiovascular risks associated with extreme endurance exercise. It also provides practical guidelines for exercise prescription tailored to patients with CVD, highlighting advanced exercise prescription strategies to optimize cardiovascular health. Key Messages: Physicians and healthcare providers should prioritize referring patients to home-based or medically supervised exercise programs to leverage the cardioprotective benefits of regular PA. For most inactive patients, an exercise prescription is essential for improving overall health.

TI  - Prolonged Deficits in Parvalbumin Neuron Stimulation-Evoked Network Activity Despite Recovery of Dendritic Structure and Excitability in the Somatosensory Cortex following Global Ischemia in Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Relatively few studies have examined plasticity of inhibitory neuronal networks following stroke in vivo, primarily due to the inability to selectively monitor inhibition. We assessed the structure of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons during a 5 min period of global ischemia and reperfusion in mice, which mimicked cerebral ischemia during cardiac arrest or forms of transient ischemic attack. The dendritic structure of PV-neurons in cortical superficial layers was rapidly swollen and beaded during global ischemia, but recovered within 5-10 min following reperfusion. Using optogenetics and a multichannel optrode, we investigated the function of PV-neurons in mouse forelimb somatosensory cortex. We demonstrated pharmacologically that PV-channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation evoked activation in layer IV/V, which resulted in rapid current sinks mediated by photocurrent and action potentials (a measure of PV-neuron excitability), which was then followed by current sources mediated by network GABAergic synaptic activity. During ischemic depolarization, the PV-ChR2-evoked current sinks (excitability) were suppressed, but recovered rapidly following reperfusion concurrent with repolarization of the DC-EEG. In contrast, the current sources reflecting GABAergic synaptic network activity recovered slowly and incompletely, and was coincident with the partial recovery of the forepaw stimulation-evoked current sinks in layer IV/V 30 min post reperfusion. Our in vivo data suggest that the excitability of PV inhibitory neurons was suppressed during global ischemia and rapidly recovered during reperfusion. In contrast, PV-ChR2 stimulation-evoked GABAergic synaptic network activity exhibited a prolonged suppression even similar to 1 h after reperfusion, which could contribute to the dysfunction of sensation and cognition following transient global ischemia.

TI  - Helicopter rescue and prehospital care for drowning children: two summer season case studies
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - Background. Drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in children <14 years of age and is one of the most important causes of accidental injury between the ages of 1 and 4 years. In this study, the characteristics of non-fatal unintentional drownings in a small series of pediatric victims were examined.
   Methods. We retrospectively analyzed data collected by the rescue team form May to October in two consecutive years (2006, 2007).
   Results. Nine accidents occured in public waters, while 5 occured in lakes and rivers. The submersion time reported ranged from approximately 5 to 15 min. The ground emergency service with basic life support rescue experts intervented within a mean of 12 min. The ground emergency service with basic life support rescue experts intervented within a mean of 12 min. Advanced cardiac life support maneuvers were implemented by the helicopter medical crew for all victims. Ten of the 14 children remained in cardiocirculatory arrest despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was <8 in all cases. Field resuscitation ultimately proved successful for every child. Thus, none was transported by the helicopter with ongoing CPR. All submersion-injured children survived. No postanoxic cerebral injury or major neurological complications were detected.
   Conclusion. Assuring safe tracheal ventilation, achieving intravenous access, and stabilizing both respiratory and hemodynamic disturbances on the ground before transferring the patient are the keys to out-of-hospital management. Our 100% survival rare likely results from adequate primary out of-hospital care. Promptly dispatching a helicopter with a specialized medical crew is very expensive, but is worth the cost because it offers a better chance of survival.

TI  - Metabolic acidosis in restraint-associated cardiac arrest: A case series
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - The mechanism of death in patients struggling against restraints remains a topic of debate. This article presents a series of five patients with restraint-associated cardiac arrest and profound metabolic acidosis. The lowest recorded pH was 6.25; this patient and three others died despite aggressive resuscitation. The survivor's pH was 6.46; this patient subsequently made a good recovery. Struggling against restraints may produce a lactic acidosis. Stimulant drugs such as cocaine may promote further metabolic acidosis and impair normal behavioral regulatory responses. Restrictive positioning of combative patients may impede appropriate respiratory compensation for this acidemia. Public safety personnel and emergency providers must be aware of the life threat to combative patients and be careful with restraint techniques. Further investigation of sedative agents and buffering therapy for this select patient group is suggested.

TI  - Outcomes of Infants Born at 21 Weeks' Gestational Age
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - QuestionWhat are the outcomes of infants born alive at 21 weeks' gestational age in a center that attempts resuscitation in selected cases?FindingsIn this case series of 22 infants born alive at 21 weeks' gestational age, resuscitation was attempted in 17 infants during the study period. Of these, 6 (35%) survived to discharge, and none required tracheostomy or neurosurgical intervention.MeaningThese findings suggest that some infants born at 21 weeks' gestational age can survive, some with minimal morbidities, and that prospective study and outcome reporting may be warranted in this population.
   This case series presents survival and morbidity outcomes for infants born alive and resuscitated at 21 weeks' gestational age at a center that attempts resuscitation in selected cases.
   ImportanceAdvances in medical care and clinician experience have lowered the gestational age at which resuscitation is considered for extremely premature infants. Some centers now offer trials of resuscitation at 21 weeks' gestational age. Minimal data are available to guide this practice.ObjectiveTo describe morbidities and outcomes of resuscitated infants at 21 weeks' gestational age.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective case series included all infants born at 21 weeks' gestational age in a single-center level IV academic neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the University of Iowa from January 1, 2020, through February 28, 2025. Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 15, 2025.ExposureExtremely preterm birth at a gestational age of 21 weeks.Main Outcomes and MeasuresDemographic characteristics, therapies, morbidities, and test results were collected throughout hospitalizations from electronic medical records for extremely premature infants who received any attempted resuscitation and their mothers, including hourly cardiorespiratory data for the first 72 hours for infants admitted to the NICU. Postdischarge outcomes through the end of the study period were collected as available.ResultsTwenty-two infants were born alive at 21 weeks' gestational age during the study period, and an additional 230 were stillborn. Resuscitation was attempted in 17 (77%) of the infants born alive; of these, 6 (35%) survived to discharge from the NICU (earliest in 2021; youngest, 21 weeks, 0 days; birth weight, 285-430 g), 1 (6%) remained hospitalized, and 10 (59%) died. All births were inborn vaginal deliveries. Infants who survived (including the infant who remained hospitalized) were less likely part of a multiple gestation compared with those who did not (1 of 7 [14%] vs 6 of 10 [60%]) and more likely exposed to a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids (3 of 7 [43%] vs 0 of 10). Most of the infants who survived had early cardiorespiratory instability treated with vasoactive medications and/or inhaled nitric oxide (5 [71%]). Three (43%) had no or grade 1 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), 2 (29%) had grade 2 IVH, and 2 had severe (grade 3) IVH (29%); none required neurosurgical intervention. The 6 infants who were discharged received low-flow supplemental oxygen, and none required tracheostomy. Rates of resuscitation increased during the study period.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this case series of infants born alive at 21 weeks' gestational age, selective resuscitation resulted in 35% survival to discharge, in some cases with minimal morbidities. These descriptive data may prompt prospective study and reporting at this gestational age. Long-term outcome data are needed.

TI  - Combined sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter and cerebral oximeter for predicting neurological outcome after cardiac arrest
T2  - BIOMOLECULES AND BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) remains a critical global health issue with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Accurate prediction of neurological outcomes in post-CA patients is essential for optimizing management strategies. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are emerging as promising tools for evaluating brain oxygenation and intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the potential benefits of combining these methods for improved prognostic accuracy have not been thoroughly explored. This study investigates whether the combined use of ultrasonographic ONSD and NIRS measurements enhances the prediction of neurological outcomes after CA. In this prospective study, ONSD measurements were obtained three times at 24-h intervals, while regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO2) using NIRS was recorded twice. Neurological outcomes were assessed using the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) and Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scores for both early and late evaluations. Results indicated that 47.5% of patients had poor outcomes and 52.5% had good outcomes based on the FOUR score, while 65% had poor outcomes and 35% had good outcomes according to the CPC score. The combination of ONSD and NIRS measurements showed superior prognostic performance compared to either method alone. While standalone NIRS measurements taken after 24 h exhibited limited predictive value, combining ONSD and NIRS provided a more reliable approach for neurological assessment in the short term following CA. This integrated method may improve prognostic accuracy and support better clinical decision making.

TI  - Multi-Modality Imaging for Accurate Valvular Lesion Diagnosis: A Case Report of Catastrophic Outcomes From Unrecognized Severe Aortic Regurgitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASES
AB  - Aortic regurgitation (AR) can be difficult to accurately quantify on echocardiography alone, potentially leading to erroneous grading. A 52-year-old male presented following resuscitation after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. He had been followed in the cardiology outpatient clinic for a number of years for monitoring of bicuspid aortic valve and associated AR. Regular transthoracic echocardiography and one transesophageal echocardiogram had shown moderate range AR. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging reported the AR as severe with associated severely dilated left ventricle. Echocardiography grading and the patient's lack of symptoms supported a strategy of active surveillance. The presentation with cardiac arrest prompted re-evaluation of the severity of this patient's AR. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance imaging re-affirmed severe AR, and the patient proceeded to surgical aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve. Post-operatively, the patient had heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction. During hospital stay, he developed thyrotoxicosis secondary to amiodarone. This case demonstrates the discrepancy in assessing severity between different imaging techniques and highlights the potential complications in delayed intervention in AR.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children with bacterial tracheitis
T2  - ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE
AB  - Bacterial tracheitis is a severe cause of acute infectious upper-airway obstruction. Its characteristics include thick purulent secretions with or without plaques or pseudomembrane formation. Fatal complications are infrequent if an appropriate treatment is conducted.
   Case report. We report on 2 cases of bacterial tracheitis revealed by out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. At presentation in winter, both children first had the symptoms of viral croup. However, no response to the appropriate therapy for this disease was observed. A cardiac arrest occurred on the second day. Bronchoscopy allowed diagnosis. Findings on initial examination were erythema, edema and purulent secretions. Bacterial cultures of tracheal secretions were positive with Staphylococcus aureus. Serology with influenza A virus was also positive. Despite antibiotics and mechanical ventilation, both children died in the pediatric intensive care unit, consecutively to irreversible ischemic brain injury.
   Conclusion. Bacterial tracheitis remains a life-threatening upper-airway infection. Prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis could lead to decreased mortality. It is essential to reassess any croup whose outcome is not rapidly favourable. Such patients should be monitored in a pediatric intensive care unit. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Balloon arterioplasty of recurrent coarctation after the modified Norwood procedure in infants
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
AB  - Coarctation of Be reconstructed aorta after the modified Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a relatively common occurrence that can have significant adverse effects. From 1992-98, 65 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome or variants thereof underwent a modified Norwood procedure. Of the 50 survivors of Stage I palliation, 10 (20%) were subsequently diagnosed with clinically significant obstruction of the aortic arch at a median age of 5.1 months. Eight of these patients underwent coarctation balloon arterioplasty. All 8 patients underwent successful dilation of the coarctation, with a decrease in the pressure gradient from 43 +/- 20 to 4 +/- 5 mmHg and an increase in aortic diameter at the site of obstruction from 3.5 +/- 0.5 to 7.0 +/- 1.0 mm (both P < 0.001). There was also a significant increase in lower extremity systolic blood pressure. Although there was no immediate increase in cardiac output after dilation in most patients, ventricular function was improved in 3 patients within 24-48 hr of the procedure and in all but 2 at the most recent follow-up (median 2 years). Two patients developed bradycardia during wire placement that required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Two others died suddenly during the follow-up period. All surviving patients have undergone subsequent palliative procedures; none have required repeat intervention for arch obstruction. We found a 20% incidence of coarctation in survivors of the modified Norwood procedure. Balloon arterioplasty is effective in relieving this obstruction, and should be carried out promptly upon diagnosis to minimize its deleterious effects on ventricular function. Balloon dilation, however, should be considered a high-risk procedure in these fragile infants, and special attention must be given to cardiovascular support. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Early resuscitation with lyophilized plasma provides equal neuroprotection compared with fresh frozen plasma in a large animal survival model of traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - 46th Annual Meeting of the Western-Trauma-Association
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combined traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS) is highly lethal. In previous models of combined TBI + HS, we showed that early resuscitation with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) improves neurologic outcomes. Delivering FFP, however, in austere environments is difficult. Lyophilized plasma (LP) is a logistically superior alternative to FFP, but data are limited regarding its efficacy for treatment of TBI. We conducted this study to determine the safety and long-term outcomes of early treatment with LP in a large animal model of TBI + HS.
   METHODS: Adult anesthetized swine underwent TBI and volume-controlled hemorrhage (40% blood volume) concurrently. After 2 hours of shock, animals were randomized (n = 5 per /group) to FFP or LP (1x shed blood) treatment. Serial blood gases were drawn, and thromboelastography was performed on citrated, kaolin-activated whole-blood samples. Five hours after treatment, packed red blood cells were administered, and animals recovered. A 32-point Neurologic Severity Score was assessed daily for 30 days (0 = normal, 32 = most severe injury). Cognitive functions were tested by training animals to retrieve food from color-coded boxes. Brain lesion size was measured on serial magnetic resonance imaging, and an autopsy was performed at 30 days.
   RESULTS: The severity of shock and the degree of resuscitation were similar in both groups. Administration of FFP and LP was well tolerated with no differences in reversal of shock or thromboelastography parameters. Animals in both groups displayed the worst Neurologic Severity Score on postoperative Day 1 with rapid recovery and return to baseline within 7 days of injury. Lesion size on Day 3 in FFP-treated animals was 645 +/- 85 versus 219 +/- 20 mm(3) in LP-treated animals (p < 0.05). There were no differences in cognitive functions or delayed treatment-related complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with LP in TBI + HS is safe and provides neuroprotection that is comparable to FFP. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prevalence, Timing, and Predictors of Patients Who Had New and/or Updated Goals of Care While in the ICU: A Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives:Timely documentation of patient-concordant goals of care (GOC) in the ICU aims to promote patient autonomy and patient-centered care where the harms of interventions outweigh the potential benefits. This study examined the prevalence, timing, and predictors of ICU patients undergoing new and updated GOC documentation events while in the ICU.Design:Multicenter retrospective study.Setting and Patients:All adults admitted to four ICUs from July 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.Interventions:None.Main Outcomes:The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence, timing, and predictors of new-GOC and updated-GOC documentation events following ICU admission.Measurements and Main Results:We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors for new-GOC or updated-GOC documentation events using a backward stepwise elimination. Of the 2130 patients included, 13.3% (n = 284) had a new-GOC documentation event, and 16.3% (n = 346) had an updated-GOC documentation event. New-GOC events occurred sooner than updated-GOC events (median [interquartile range]: 18.3 [7.8-70.5] vs 73.7 [22.7-157.8] hr). Factors associated with GOC documentation events included age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.03), frailty (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.46), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) (OR = 1.23, 95% CI, 1.17-1.29), metastatic cancer (OR = 3.69, 95% CI, 2.17-6.26), ICU admission post medical emergency team review (OR = 1.94, 95% CI, 1.40-2.69), and cardiac arrest (OR = 2.23, 95% CI, 1.22-4.06) and if pre-ICU GOC had established treatment limitations, namely selective treatment goals (OR = 4.33, 95% CI, 3.18-5.90) or comfort-based treatment goals (OR = 7.66, 95% CI, 2.72-21.61). Apart from SOFA, all other factors remained significantly associated with GOC documentation events, even after accounting for ICU mortality as a competing outcome.Conclusions:Almost 30% of patients had new- or updated-GOC documentation events while in ICU. Increasing age, higher SOFA scores, metastatic cancer, frailty, cardiac arrest, and ICU admission post-MET review predicted GOC changes while in ICU.

TI  - Investigating Users' Attitudes Toward Automated Smartwatch Cardiac Arrest Detection: Cross-Sectional Survey Study
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality in the developed world. Timely detection of cardiac arrest and prompt activation of emergency medical services (EMS) are essential, yet challenging. Automated cardiac arrest detection using sensor signals from smartwatches has the potential to shorten the interval between cardiac arrest and activation of EMS, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival. Objective: This cross-sectional survey study aims to investigate users' perspectives on aspects of continuous monitoring such as privacy and data protection, as well as other implications, and to collect insights into their attitudes toward the technology. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey in the Netherlands among 2 groups of potential users of automated cardiac arrest technology: consumers who already own a smartwatch and patients at risk of cardiac arrest. Surveys primarily consisted of closed-ended questions with some additional open-ended questions to provide supplementary insight. The quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and a content analysis of the open-ended questions was conducted. Results: In the consumer group (n=1005), 90.2% (n=906; 95% CI 88.1%-91.9%) of participants expressed an interest in the technology, and 89% (n=1196; 95% CI 87.3%-90.7%) of the patient group (n=1344) showed interest. More than 75% (consumer group: n= 756; patient group: n=1004) of the participants in both groups indicated they were willing to use the technology. The main concerns raised by participants regarding the technology included privacy, data protection, reliability, and accessibility. Conclusions: The vast majority of potential users expressed a strong interest in and positive attitude toward automated cardiac arrest detection using smartwatch technology. However, a number of concerns were identified, which should be addressed in the development and implementation process to optimize acceptance and effectiveness of the technology.

TI  - A 14-Year-Old Boy With Neck Pain, Fevers, and Diffuse Erythematous Rash
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - A previously healthy 14-year-old boy developed right-sided neck pain, tachycardia, a diffuse erythematous rash, and subjective fevers over 2 days. He sought medical attention in a local urgent care clinic, where he had a negative Sars-CoV-2 antigen test and was referred to the local emergency department (ED) for persistent tachycardia and further workup. After fluid resuscitation, his tachycardia was not improved, so he was admitted to the Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service. Physical examination showed large areas of erythema and erythroderma of multiple body sites, perioral sparing, increased erythema in flexor skin folds, posterior soft palate petechiae, and a white strawberry tongue. There was a small, tender lesion with surrounding erythema without discharge on his right neck thought to be a possible entry point for infection. Laboratory results showed thrombocytopenia, normal white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin concentration, absolute lymphopenia, and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) to 130 mg/L. He was started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics for a presumed infectious cause of the rash and laboratory findings. The next morning, an expanded diagnostic workup was undertaken including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, ferritin, triglycerides, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), brain natriuretic peptide, coagulation studies, and fibrinogen. With treatment and supportive care, his tachycardia and energy improved, so he was discharged with oral antibiotics and follow-up with the Infectious Disease Clinic in 2 days. When seen in follow-up, he was immediately admitted to the hospital for worsening fatigue, tachycardia, and new findings that prompted multiple consultations, and transfer to pediatric critical care services.

TI  - Plasma metabolite score correlates with Hypoxia time in a newly born piglet model for asphyxia
T2  - REDOX BIOLOGY
AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) secondary to perinatal asphyxia is a leading cause of mortality and acquired long-term neurologic co-morbidities in the neonate. The most successful intervention for the treatment of moderate to severe HIE is moderate whole body hypothermia initiated within 6 h from birth. The objective and prompt identification of infants who are at risk of developing moderate to severe HIE in the critical first hours still remains a challenge. This work proposes a metabolite score calculated based on the relative intensities of three metabolites (choline, 6,8-dihydroxypurine and hypoxanthine) that showed maximum correlation with hypoxia time in a consolidated piglet model for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. The metabolite score's performance as a biomarker for perinatal hypoxia and its usefulness for clinical grading and decision making have been assessed and compared to the performance of lactate which is currently considered the gold standard. For plasma samples withdrawn before and directly after a hypoxic insult, the metabolite score performed similar to lactate. However, it provided an enhanced predictive capacity at 2 h after resuscitation. The present study evidences the usefulness of the metabolite score for improving the early assessment of the severity of the hypoxic insult based on serial determinations in a minimally invasive biofluid. The applicability of the metabolite score for clinical diagnosis and patient stratification for hypothermia treatment has to be confirmed in multicenter trials involving newborns suffering from HIE.

TI  - Long-Term Impact of Global Pediatrics Curriculum, Experience, and Mentorship in Pediatric Residency
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Global health education is offered increasingly during residency training. The University of Minnesota has offered a global pediatrics track to residents since 2005. This study aimed to understand the impacts of a global pediatrics track on graduates' career choices, skills, and current engagement in global health. An electronic survey was sent to 110 track graduates in February to April 2020. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Content analysis of written comments was conducted. The response rate was 62% overall, varying by question. Overall, 75% of responding graduates reported global pediatrics track participation affected their career choices. Eighty-four percent recalled plans to work in global health after graduation and 64% of respondents reported working in global health abroad or at home at the time of the survey. Incorporation of public health and global research represented the greatest percentage change in career plans from the time of enrollment to graduation (24% and 27%, respectively). Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that track participation improved their ability to elicit information about cultural beliefs and practices, and 86% reported improvement in cost-conscious care. An increase in global health knowledge and skills was the most common category of impact cited by respondents. Neonatal resuscitation, bubble continuous positive airway pressure, and homemade spacers for metered-dose inhalers were the most used global health-adapted skills. Our study found that graduates of the global pediatrics track perceive their participation affected their knowledge, skills, and attitudes positively, with the potential to improve clinical care and promote health equity locally and globally.

TI  - DIVERGENT EFFECTS OF HYPERTONIC FLUID RESUSCITATION ON RENAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS IN RAT MODEL OF LOWER BODY ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION-INDUCED STERILE INFLAMMATION
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - The pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by the deterioration of tissue perfusion and oxygenation and enhanced inflammation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the hemodynamic and inflammatory effects of hypertonic saline (HS) protect the kidney by promoting renal microcirculatory oxygenation and possible deleterious effects of HS due to its high sodium content on renal functional and structural injury following ischemia/reperfusion. Mechanically ventilated and anesthetized ratswere randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group): a sham-operated control group; a group subjected to renal ischemia for 45 min by supra-aortic occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion (I/R); and I/R group treated with a continuous i.v. infusion (5 mL/kg/h) of either % 0.9 NaCl (IR+NS) or % 10 NaCl (I/R+HS) after releasing the clamp. Systemic and renal hemodynamic, renal cortical (C mu PO2), and medullar microcirculatory pO(2) (M mu PO2) are measured by the oxygen-dependent quenching of the phosphorescence lifetime technique. Renal functional, inflammatory, and tissues damage parameters were also assessed. HS, but not NS, treatment restored I/R-induced reduced mean arterial pressure, C mu PO2, renal oxygen deliver (DO2ren), and consumption (VO2ren). HS caused a decrease in tubular sodium reabsorption (TNa+) that correlated with an elevation of fractional sodium excretion (EFNa+) and urine output. HS had an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the levels TNF-alpha, IL-6, and hyaluronic acid in the renal tissue samples as compared with the I/R and I/R+NS groups (P < 0.05). HS treatment was also associated with mild acidosis and an increased renal tubular damage. Despite HS resuscitation improving the systemic hemodynamics, microcirculatory oxygenation, and renal oxygen consumption as well as inflammation, it should be limited or strictly controlled for long-term use because of provoking widespread renal structural damage.

TI  - Euglycemic DKA in a DPP-4 inhibitor patient following traumatic brain injury: A complex ICU glucose management challenge
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is a rare variant of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterized by normal or near-normal glucose levels despite severe metabolic acidosis and ketosis. This condition poses a diagnostic challenge as it mimics DKA without the hallmark hyperglycemia. Recent studies have suggested an association between EuDKA and newer antidiabetic medications, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Patient concern:A 57-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis developed EuDKA following a traumatic brain injury. Despite a blood glucose of 134 mg/dL, he exhibited classic features of DKA, including severe metabolic acidosis, low bicarbonate levels, an elevated anion gap, and positive urinary ketones. Diagnosis:Despite the blood glucose level being within normal range, the patient's clinical presentation, including severe acidosis (pH 7.16), low bicarbonate (2.8 mmol/L), elevated anion gap (24.9 mmol/L), and urinary ketones, pointed to EuDKA. The patient's use of Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, was identified as a likely precipitating factor. Interventions:Timely interventions, including fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte correction, were promptly administered to manage the patient's metabolic abnormalities. Outcome:After receiving intensive treatment, the patient made a full recovery with normalization of metabolic parameters and no long-term complications. Lessons:This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for EuDKA in trauma patients, particularly those on DPP-4 inhibitors. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial to preventing complications and ensuring positive outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms linking DPP-4 inhibitors with EuDKA, especially in the context of metabolic stress like traumatic brain injury.

TI  - Global Collaboration in Acute Care Clinical Research: Opportunities, Challenges, and Needs
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The most impactful research in critical care comes from trials groups led by clinician-investigators who study questions arising through the day-to-day care of critically ill patients. The success of this model reflects both "necessity" the paucity of new therapies introduced through industry-led research and "clinical reality" nuanced modulation of standard practice can have substantial impact on clinically important outcomes. Success in a few countries has fueled efforts to build similar models around the world and to collaborate on an unprecedented scale in large international trials. International collaboration brings opportunity the more rapid completion of clinical trials, enhanced generalizability of the results of these trials, and a focus on questions that have evoked international curiosity. It has changed practice, improved outcomes, and enabled an international response to pandemic threats. It also brings challenges. Investigators may feel threatened by the loss of autonomy inherent in collaboration, and appropriate models of academic credit are yet to be developed. Differences in culture, practice, ethical frameworks, research experience, and resource availability create additional imbalances. Patient and family engagement in research is variable and typically inadequate. Funders are poorly equipped to evaluate and fund international collaborative efforts. Yet despite or perhaps because of these challenges, the discipline of critical care is leading the world in crafting new models of clinical research collaboration that hold the promise of not only improving the care of the most vulnerable patients in the healthcare system but also transforming the way that we conduct clinical research.

TI  - Neurocognitive performance after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pigs
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To test the feasibility of a neurocognitive test based on operant conditioning in a porcine model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Furthermore, to characterize the influence of different durations of cardiac arrest on cognitive performance and the accompanying neurohistopathological changes.
   Design: Randomized controlled laboratory animal study.
   Setting. Animal research facility of a university hospital.
   Subjects. Seventeen male domestic pigs.
   Interventions: Animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated before arterial and pulmonary artery catheters were inserted. Cardiac arrest was induced electrically after randomization of the animals into two groups (n = 7/group) left untreated for either 5 or 8 mins. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with 100% oxygen and cardiac compressions at 100/min for 5 mins before defibrillation was attempted. Three animals treated identically, with the exception that neither cardiac arrest was induced nor cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, served as controls.
   Measurements and Main Results: Hemodynamic variables as well as variables of gas exchange were measured at baseline and 10, 60, 120, 240, and 360 mins after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated using a test based on operant conditioning 5 days before and 4 days after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. On the fifth postoperative day, animals were killed and the brains removed for histopathological evaluation of vulnerable brain regions.
   No noteworthy differences in hemodynamics or gas exchange were observed at baseline or after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Animals exposed to 8 mins of untreated cardiac arrest showed severe neurocognitive dysfunction, which was statistically significant on postoperative days 2 and 3 in comparison to animals exposed to 5 mins of cardiac arrest or controls. Neurohistopathological evaluation revealed a significantly greater proportion of ischemically damaged neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen in pigs subjected to 8 mins of cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions. Neurocognitive testing is feasible in this setting. Performance worsens with increasing ischemia time and is structurally associated with alterations in the caudate nucleus and the putamen.

TI  - Erythropoietin in post-resuscitation neurological recovery: is there light at the end of the tunnel?
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - Studies show that erythropoietin, besides its critical role in hematopoiesis, provides neuroprotection in hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury. Antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, angiogenetic, and neurotrophic properties of erythropoietin could increase indications, currently restricted to anemia in chronic renal failure and cancer, to hypoxic-ischemic cerebral insult.
   In the adult and neonatal animal model of hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury, erythropoietin significantly reduces infarct size with attenuation of brain damage, and preservation of cortical integrity. The first human study on the impact of erythropoietin in stroke victims showed that erythropoietin is safe and well tolerated at high doses, and associated with improved neurological outcome. Even with intravenous application, concentrations of erythropoietin in cerebrospinal fluid of these patients were many-fold higher than in non-treated patients.
   In successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest victims overall neurological recovery remains poor despite improved cardiopulmonary resuscitation strategies. Post-resuscitation care needs further advances in order to improve final outcome. Through promotion of neuroangiogenesis, inhibition of hypoxia-induced apoptosis in neurons, and thus support of the survival of neurons in the ischemic brain, erythropoietin could be used to improve functional recovery of these patients. Nevertheless, optimal molecular forms of EPO, therapeutic doses, and treatment time window have to be determined in order to lower the incidence of adverse effects and still preserve neuroprotective properties.

TI  - Pyruvate as a Potential Beneficial Anion in Resuscitation Fluids
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - There have been ongoing debates about resuscitation fluids because each of the current fluids has its own disadvantages. The debates essentially reflect an embarrassing clinical status quo that all fluids are not quite ideal in most clinical settings. Therefore, a novel fluid that overcomes the limitations of most fluids is necessary for most patients, particularly diabetic and older patients. Pyruvate is a natural potent antioxidant/nitrosative and anti-inflammatory agent. Exogenous pyruvate as an alkalizer can increase cellular hypoxia and anoxia tolerance with the preservation of classic glycolytic pathways and the reactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity to promote oxidative metabolism and reverse the Warburg effect, robustly preventing and treating hypoxic lactic acidosis, which is one of the fatal complications in critically ill patients. In animal studies and clinical reports, pyruvate has been shown to play a protective role in multi-organ functions, especially the heart, brain, kidney, and intestine, demonstrating a great potential to improve patient survival. Pyruvate-enriched fluids including crystalloids and colloids and oral rehydration solution (ORS) may be ideal due to the unique beneficial properties of pyruvate relative to anions in contemporary existing fluids, such as acetate, bicarbonate, chloride, citrate, lactate, and even malate. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that pyruvate-enriched saline is superior to 0.9% sodium chloride. Moreover, pyruvate-enriched Ringer's solution is advantageous over lactated Ringer's solution. Furthermore, pyruvate as a carrier in colloids, such as hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4, is more beneficial than its commercial counterparts. Similarly, pyruvate-enriched ORS is more favorable than WHO-ORS in organ protection and shock resuscitation. It is critical that pay attention first to improving abnormal saline with pyruvate for ICU patients. Many clinical trials with a high dose of intravenous or oral pyruvate were conducted over the past half century, and results indicated its effectiveness and safety in humans. The long-term instability of pyruvate aqueous solutions and para-pyruvate cytotoxicity is not a barrier to the pharmaceutical manufacturing of pyruvate-enriched fluids for ICU patients. Clinical trials with sodium pyruvate-enriched solutions are urgently warranted.

TI  - Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Provide Neuroprotection and Improve Long-Term Neurologic Outcomes in a Swine Model of Traumatic Brain Injury and Hemorrhagic Shock
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB  - Combined traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS) remains a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have demonstrated promise in small animal models of neurologic injury. To investigate the effects of exosome treatment in a clinically realistic large animal model, Yorkshire swine underwent TBI and HS. Animals were maintained in shock for 2 h before resuscitation with normal saline (NS). Animals were then resuscitated either with NS (3 x volume of shed blood) or with the same volume of NS with delayed exosome administration (1 x 10(13) particles/4 mL) (n = 5/cohort). Exosomes were administered 9 h post-injury, and on post-injury days (PID) 1, 5, 9, and 13. Neurologic severity scores (NSS) were assessed for 30 days, and neurocognitive functions were objectively measured. Exosome-treated animals had significantly lower NSS (p < 0.05) during the first five days of recovery. Exosome-treated animals also had a significantly shorter time to complete neurologic recovery (NSS = 0) compared with animals given NS alone (days to recovery: NS = 16.8 +/- 10.6; NS + exosomes = 5.6 +/- 2.8; p = 0.03). Animals treated with exosomes initiated neurocognitive testing earlier (days to initiation: NS = 9.6 +/- 0.5 vs. NS + exosomes = 4.2 +/- 0.8; p = 0.008); however, no difference was seen in time to mastery of tasks. In conclusion, treatment with exosomes attenuates the severity of neurologic injury and allows for faster neurologic recovery in a clinically realistic large animal model of TBI and HS.

TI  - Intralipid postconditioning in patients of cardiac surgery undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (iCPB): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundIntralipid is a necessary fatty acid carrier that has been safely used as an energy supplier in the clinic. It has played an important role in rescuing the cardiac arrest caused by local anesthetic toxicity. In recent years, experimental studies have shown that intralipid postconditioning (ILPC) could reduce myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injuries. Our research group has innovatively conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the results showed that ILPC could reduce the release of cTnT and CK-MB, biomarkers of myocardial I/R injury, in valve replacement surgery. However, the potential effects of ILPC on the clinical outcome of adult cardiac surgery patients are unclear. Intralipid postconditioning in patients of cardiac surgery undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (iCPB) trial is aimed to further study whether ILPC could improve short-term and long-term clinical outcome, as well as cardiac function in adult cardiac surgery patients.
   MethodsThe iCPB trial is an ongoing, single-center, prospective, double-blinded, large sample RCT. In total, 1000 adults undergoing cardiac surgery will be randomly allocated to either the ILPC group or the control group. The intervention group received an intravenous infusion of 2mL/kg of 20% intralipid (medium-chain and long-chain fat emulsion injection C6 similar to C24, Pharmaceutical) within 10min before aortic cross-unclamping, and the control group received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary endpoints are complex morbidity of major complications during hospitalization and all-cause mortality within 30days after surgery. The secondary endpoints include (1) all-cause mortality 6months and 1year postoperatively; (2) the quality of life within 1year after surgery, using the QoR-15 questionnaire; (3) the postoperative cardiac function evaluated by LVEF, LVEDS, and LVEDD, and the myocardial injury evaluated by CK-MB, cTnT, and BNP; and (4) short-term clinical outcomes during hospitalization and total cost are also detailed evaluated.
   DiscussionThe iCPB trial is the first to explore ILPC on the clinical outcome of adult cardiac surgery patients. The results are expected to provide potential evidences about whether ILPC could reduce the morbidity and mortality and improve the cardiac function and quality of life. Therefore, the results will provide a rationale for the evaluation of the potentially clinically relevant benefit of intralipid therapy.

TI  - Sudden cardiac death in childhood hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is best predicted by a combination of electrocardiogram risk-score and HCMRisk-Kids score
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - Aim To compare risk algorithms (HCMRisk-Kids, ECG Risk-score) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) without syndrome association (ns-HCM) and with Noonan-like syndromes (RAS-HCM). Methods A national paediatric HCM cohort (n = 151), presenting <19 years of age, mean follow-up 13.3 years, from all Swedish centres of Paediatric Cardiology (presenting 1972-2015), with 41 RAS-HCM patients (61% males), and 110 ns-HCM patients (68% familial; 65% males). The end-point was a composite of sudden cardiac death and resuscitated cardiac arrest (SCD/CA). Risk-factors were studied with Cox-hazard regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (C-statistic). Results There were 33 SCD/CA, 27/110 in ns-HCM and 6/41 in RAS-HCM (p = 0.27). In ns-HCM HCMRisk-Kids >= 6% at diagnosis had C-statistic of 0.69 for predicting SCD/CA during first 5 years of follow-up and positive predictive value (PPV) of 22%. After 7 years of age (HCMRisk-Kids7plus), C-statistic was 0.76. ECG Risk-score >= 6 at diagnosis had C-statistic 0.87 and PPV of 31%. Independent risk factors for SCD/CA were HCMRisk-Kids7plus score (p = 0.005) and ECG risk-score (p < 0.001), whereas early beta-blocker dose (p = 0.001) and myectomy (p = 0.004) reduced risk. The sum of HCMRisk-Kids7yplus and ECG Risk-score7yplus >= 14 best predicted SCD/CA within 5 years in ns-HCM with C-statistic of 0.90 [0.83-0.96], sensitivity 100% and PPV 38%. Conclusion Combining the ECG Risk-score with HCMRisk-Kids improves risk stratification in ns-HCM and shows promise in RAS-HCM.

TI  - Early prognostication markers in cardiac arrest patients treated with hypothermia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and purposeEstablished prognostication markers, such as clinical findings, electroencephalography (EEG) and biochemical markers, used by clinicians to predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest (CA) are altered under therapeutic hypothermia (TH) conditions and their validity remains uncertain.
   MethodsMEDLINE and Embase were searched for evidence on the current standards for neurological outcome prediction for out-of-hospital CA patients treated with TH and the validity of a wide range of prognostication markers. Relevant studies that suggested one or several established biomarkers and multimodal approaches for prognostication are included and reviewed.
   ResultsWhilst the prognostic accuracy of various tests after TH has been questioned, pupillary light reflexes and somatosensory evoked potentials are still strongly associated with negative outcome for early prognostication. Increasingly, EEG background activity has also been identified as a valid predictor for outcome after 72h after CA and a preferred prognostic method in clinical settings. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, can identify functional and structural brain injury but are not readily available at the patient's bedside because of limited availability and high costs.
   ConclusionsA multimodal algorithm composed of neurological examination, EEG-based quantitative testing and somatosensory evoked potentials, in conjunction with newer magnetic resonance imaging sequences, if available, holds promise for accurate prognostication in CA patients treated with TH. In order to avoid premature withdrawal of care, prognostication should be performed more than 72h after CA.

TI  - Timing is survival: modeling how earlier calls improve cardiac arrest outcomes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest decreases by 5%-12% for every minute of delay in treatment. Ambulance response times vary widely across Norway, particularly between urban and rural municipalities. Advances in digital health technologies may encourage earlier patient contact with emergency services, potentially mitigating these delays.Methods We analyzed official response time data from four Norwegian municipalities representing diverse geographic contexts (Bergen, Tokke, Lur & oslash;y, S & oslash;rfold). Using a survival decay function (Equation), we simulated changes in survival probability under scenarios where emergency calls were placed 1, 5, or 10 min earlier than observed.Results Baseline survival probabilities varied substantially across municipalities, from 47.7% in Bergen (mean response 10.2 min) to 9.3% in Lur & oslash;y (32.8 min). Simulated earlier calls produced marked gains: in Bergen, survival increased from 47.7% to 68.6% with a five-minute advance; in S & oslash;rfold, from 19.4% to 27.9%; and in Tokke, from 29.9% to 43.1%. Even modest improvements (1-2 min) yielded meaningful survival benefits.Conclusions Geographic disparities in emergency response times strongly influence survival after cardiac arrest. Wearables and AI-based monitoring cannot predict cardiac arrest but may promote earlier recognition of abnormal physiological states and timelier emergency calls. If widely adopted, such technologies could provide substantial survival gains, particularly in rural and remote regions.

TI  - Activation of caspase-3 may not contribute to postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Radhakrishnan J, Ayoub IM, Gazmuri RJ. Activation of caspase-3 may not contribute to postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 296: H1164-H1174, 2009. First published February 20, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00338.2008.-We have previously reported that postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is accompanied by the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. We now investigated the role of caspase-3 activation by examining whether such process prompts apoptotic DNA fragmentation, whether caspase-3 inhibition attenuates myocardial dysfunction, and whether myocardial protective effects of sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) inhibition involve caspase-3 inhibition using a rat model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) of closed-chest resuscitation. Resuscitation after 4 or 8 min of untreated VF caused significant reductions in left ventricular stroke work index averaging 23% of sham control rats at 4 h postresuscitation. Left ventricular dysfunction was accompanied by increases in cytosolic cytochrome c, decreases in pro-and cleaved caspase-9 fragments, increases in 17-kDa caspase-3 fragments, and increases in caspase-3 activity indicating the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway but without evidence of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. In addition, levels of heat shock protein 70 were increased and levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and alpha beta-crystallin were preserved, all of which can exert antiapoptotic effects. In a separate series, the caspase-3 inhibitor z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp chloromethyl ketone given before the induction of VF failed to prevent postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction despite reductions in caspase-3 activity (2.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5 pmol fluorophore AFC released.mg protein(-1).min(-1); P < 0.03). Treatment with the NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide had no effect on caspase-3 activity. Accordingly, in this rat model of VF and severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, activation of caspase-3 did not lead to DNA fragmentation or contribute to myocardial dysfunction. Concomitant activation of intrinsic antiapoptotic mechanisms could play a protective role downstream to caspase-3 activation.

TI  - Burn wound conversion: clinical implications for the treatment of severe burns
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOUND CARE
AB  - The identification of novel treatments for severe burn wounds relies on accurate clinical assessments of the extent of injury. However, evaluation of burn wound depth can be challenging due to the tendency for burn wounds to progress over time in a little-understood process known as `burn wound conversion'. Local factors affecting the burn wound, such as inflammation, oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, vasostasis and bacterial infections, lead to increased cell death by apoptosis or oncosis, while systemic events may promote burn wound conversion. Acute shock, metabolic derangements, age or immunomodulation can modify cytokine secretion, lower immune responses, decrease blood flow or cause bacterial infection at the burn wound site. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting specific mechanisms that reduce cell death, improve wound reperfusion and promote tissue regrowth should favourably enhance burn wound healing, and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Our current understanding of these mechanisms mostly comes from animal studies, underscoring the need for extensive research in humans. A streamlined approach would be to investigate the parallels in other disease states that exhibit ischaemia and potential reperfusion, such as ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Moreover, in view of the limited knowledge available on the subject, the need exists for further clinical research into burn wound conversion and novel target pathways to ameliorate its effects. This review describes events that affect the viability of cells at the burn wound site resulting in burn wound conversion, and identifies potential targets for clinical interventions that may diminish burn wound conversion.

TI  - Sepsis and Cerebral Dysfunction: BBB Damage, Neuroinflammation, Oxidative Stress, Apoptosis and Autophagy as Key Mediators and the Potential Therapeutic Approaches
T2  - NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH
AB  - Sepsis-associated cerebral dysfunction is complex pathophysiology, generated from primary infections that are developed elsewhere in the body. The neonates, elderly population and chronically ill and long-term hospitalized patients are predominantly vulnerable to sepsis and related cerebral damage. Generally, electrophysiological recordings, severity and sedation scales, computerized imaging and spectroscopy techniques are used for its detection and diagnosis. About the underlying mechanisms, enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability and metalloprotease activity, tight junction protein loss and endothelial cell degeneration promote the influx of inflammatory and toxic mediators into the brain, triggering cerebrovascular damage. An altered neutrophil count and phenotype further dysregulate the normal neuroimmune responses and neuroendocrine stability via modulated activation of protein kinase C-delta, nuclear factor kappa-B and sphingolipid signaling. Glial activation, together with pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the Toll-like receptor, destabilize the immune system. Moreover, superoxides and hydroperoxides generate oxidative stress and perturb mitochondrial dynamics and ATP synthesis, propagating neuronal injury cycle. Activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, characterized by increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage and Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the hippocampal and cortical neurons, stimulate neurocognitive impairments. Additionally, altered LC3-II/I and P62/SQSTM1, p-mTOR, p-AMPK1 and p-ULK1 levels and dysregulated autophagosome-lysosome fusion decrease neuronal and glial energy homeostasis. The therapies and procedures for attenuating sepsis-induced brain damage include early resuscitation, cerebral blood flow autoregulation, implantable electric vagus nerve stimulation, antioxidants, statins, glucocorticoids, neuroimmune axis modulators and PKC delta inhibitors. The current review enumerates the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced brain damage, its diagnosis, the role of critical inducers and mediators and, ultimately, therapeutic measures attenuating cerebrovascular degeneration.

TI  - Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived small extracellular vesicles restore lung architecture and improve exercise capacity in a model of neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES
AB  - Early administration of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (MEx) has shown considerable promise in experimental models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the ability of MEx to reverse the long-term pulmonary complications associated with established BPD remains unknown. In this study, MEx were isolated from media conditioned by human Wharton's Jelly-derived MSC cultures. Newborn mice (FVB strain) were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX (75% O2)) before returning to room air at postnatal day 14 (PN14). Following prolonged HYRX-exposure, animals received a single MEx dose at PN18 or serial MEx treatments at PN18-39 ("late" intervention). This group was compared to animals that received an early single MEx dose at PN4 ("early" intervention). Animals were harvested at PN28 or 60 for assessment of pulmonary parameters. We found that early and late MEx interventions effectively ameliorated core features of HYRX-induced neonatal lung injury, improving alveolar simplification, pulmonary fibrosis, vascular remodelling and blood vessel loss. Exercise capacity testing and assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) showed functional improvements following both early and late MEx interventions. In conclusion, delivery of MEx following prolonged HYRX-exposure improves core features of experimental BPD, restoring lung architecture, decreasing pulmonary fibrosis and vascular muscularization, ameliorating PH and improving exercise capacity. Taken together, delivery of MEx may not only be effective in the immediate neonatal period to prevent the development of BPD but may provide beneficial effects for the management and potentially the reversal of cardiorespiratory complications in infants and children with established BPD.

TI  - Eligibility criteria for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation at Auckland City Hospital: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
AB  - Objective Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a promising adjunct to routine advanced cardiac life support. Growing worldwide interest in ECPR-use has seen more tertiary centres offering ECPR programmes. New Zealand's nationwide extracorporeal membranous oxygenation service is provided at Auckland City Hospital (ACH). Despite the potential benefits of ECPR, it is currently only offered on anad hocbasis. It remains unknown whether ACH would manage sufficient numbers of patients to warrant an ECPR programme. Methods A 12-month retrospective cohort study of the medical records of patients who were managed for cardiac arrest in the resuscitation room of the ED was conducted. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were analysed descriptively and audited against a unique set of criteria for a hypothetical ECPR programme. Results Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, 286 patients died or had a cardiac arrest for which they were managed at ACH. Sixty-five of these patients had an in-hospital cardiac arrest in the ED. Seven (10.8%) of these patients were deemed eligible for hypothetical ECPR. Only one of these seven patients survived to hospital discharge with full neurological recovery. Conclusions An ECPR programme at ACH using standardised and agreed criteria may benefit a small number of patients and improve rates of survival to hospital discharge with preservation of neurological function. An ECPR guideline would help clarify for referring services cases that are appropriate for extracorporeal membranous oxygenation consideration, rather than discussing on anad hocbasis.

TI  - Code Status Documentation Availability and Accuracy Among Emergency Patients with End-stage Disease
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Some patients with end-stage disease who may neither want nor benefit from aggressive resuscitation receive such treatment if they cannot communicate in an emergency. Timely access to patients' current resuscitation wishes, or "code status," should be a key metric of electronic health records (EHR). We sought to determine what percentage of a cohort of patients with end-stage disease who present to the emergency department (ED) have accessible, code status documents, and for those who do, how quickly can this documentation be retrieved.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study of ED patients with end-stage disease (eg, palliative care, metastatic malignancy, home oxygen, dialysis) conducted during purposefully sampled random accrual times we performed a standardized, timed review of available health records, including accompanying transfer documents. We also interviewed consenting patients and substitute decision makers to compare available code status documents to their current wishes.
   Results: Code status documentation was unavailable within 15 minutes of ED arrival in most cases (54/85, or 63%). Retrieval time was under five minutes in the rest, especially when "one click deep" in the EHR. When interviewed, 20/32 (63%) expressed "do not resuscitate" wishes, 10 of whom had no supporting documentation. Patients from assisted-living (odds ratio [OR] 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-26) and long-term care facilities (OR 13; 95% CI, 2.5-65) were more likely to have a documented code status available compared to those living in the community.
   Conclusion: The majority of patients with end-stage disease, including half of those who would not wish resuscitation from cardiorespiratory arrest, did not have code status documents readily available upon arrival to our tertiary care ED. Patients living in the community with advanced disease may be at higher risk for unwanted resuscitative efforts should they present to hospital in extremis. While easily retrievable code status documentation within the EHR shows promise, its accuracy and validity remain important considerations.

TI  - Antenatal Corticosteroids at 21-23 Weeks of Gestation
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Administration of antenatal corticosteroids before delivery at 22-23 weeks of gestation is associated with reduced severe neonatal morbidity and mortality. The decision to administer steroids for threatened periviable delivery should be concordant with neonatal treatment plans and the patient's desire for trial of intensive care or palliative care after birth.
   Neonates born at the cusp of viability are at particularly high risk of severe morbidity and mortality. With advances in medicine and technology, the ability to resuscitate smaller, more premature neonates has become possible, and survival as early as 21 weeks of gestation has been reported. Although administration of antenatal corticosteroids has been shown to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality at later gestational ages, neonates born before 24 weeks of gestation have not been included in randomized clinical trials. Changing clinical practices surrounding neonatal resuscitation with intervention offered after birth at earlier gestational ages has prompted re-evaluation of the use of antenatal corticosteroids at these very early gestational ages. Recent observational data demonstrate that antenatal corticosteroids administered before deliveries at or after 22 weeks of gestation are associated with lower risks of neonatal mortality, although survival with severe morbidity remains high. Future research is needed to determine the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroids for deliveries before 22 weeks of gestation and should evaluate the timing of corticosteroid administration. Furthermore, efforts should be made to include diverse populations and clinically meaningful long-term outcomes. At this time, the decision surrounding antenatal corticosteroids for threatened periviable deliveries should incorporate multidisciplinary counseling with the goal of achieving concordant prenatal and postnatal management aligned with the patient's desires.

TI  - Intraoperative Hyperkaliemia Complicating Hand-assisted Live-donor Nephrectomy
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Objectives: Live donation has become increasingly valuable as a potential source of kidneys for transplant with hand-assisted laparoscopic donation is an important method of organ procurement. An important consideration is adequate preoperative and intraoperative planning, and precautions to minimize potential risks in the donor while providing a graft with good primary function.
   Materials and Methods: We present a case of live donation in which a hand-assisted laparoscopic approach was used to facilitate kidney donation. The process was complicated by a period of profound intraoperative hyperkalaemia, subsequently ascribed to rhabdomyolysis owing to muscle necrosis.
   Results: A 46-year-old man underwent assessment for live kidney donation for his brother. Preoperative investigations revealed normal renal function with no contraindications to donation. However, at the time of donation, a period of unexplained hyperkalaemia occurred that resolved spontaneously with fluid resuscitation and aggressive diuresis. After surgery, he was demonstrated to have an elevated creatine kinase level associated with unilateral gluteal pain and bruising. There were no long-term complications, and the donor made a full recovery with normal renal function. Hyperkalaemia was ascribed to extensive rhabdomyolysis owing to positioning on the operating table at the time of surgery.
   Conclusions: Rhabdomyolysis associated with laparoscopic renal surgery requires prompt recognition and treatment while unexplained hyperkalaemia may herald its onset. It is important that an increased sense of vigilance is given to patients with increased muscularity or body mass, especially in donor nephrectomy patients, because of its effect on the remaining solitary kidney.

T2  - THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is considered to be an effective treatment for patients with cesarean scar pregnancy, especially for those presenting uncontrollable hemorrhage. However, it can also cause some potential complications. Pulmonary embolism is a rare but fatal complication in patients treated with UAE. Here, we report a case of a woman who was diagnosed with cesarean scar pregnancy presenting with pulmonary embolism during the operation of dilation and curettage after UAE treatment. Prompt resuscitation was carried out and the patient received anticoagulant treatment immediately. During the follow-up, she recovered well without any complications. We present the clinical details and imaging findings, followed by discussions of the etiology, treatments, and prevention strategies.

TI  - Advance care planning for patients with advanced illnesses attending hospital outpatient clinics study: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction It is unclear whether advance care planning (ACP) undertaken with patients living in the community can improve patient care and avoid unwanted interventions and hospital admissions. We have designed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine if ACP undertaken with patients with advanced illnesses attending hospital outpatient clinics can reduce unplanned hospital admissions and improve patient and caregiver well-being.
   Methods and analysis Pragmatic RCT involving patients from subspecialty outpatient clinics at five clinical sites in Sydney, Australia. Participants will be >= 18 years screened as potentially having palliative care needs and at risk of dying in 6-12 months. The patients will be randomised to intervention or control group. Intervention group will undertake ACP discussions facilitated by a trained health professional. The control group will receive written information on ACP, representing the current standard of care. The primary outcome is the number of unplanned hospital admissions at the 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include: (i) patient's health-related quality-oflife and quality of chronic disease care; (ii) caregiver's health-related quality-of-life and caregiver burden and (iii) other health outcomes including ambulance usage, emergency department presentations, hospital admissions, resuscitation attempts, intensive care unit admissions, deaths, documentation of patient wishes in patient records and audit of ACP discussions and documents. The staff's self-reported attitudes and knowledge of ACP will also be measured. The data will be collected using self-report questionnaires, hospital records audit, audit of ACP documentation and data linkage analysis. Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions with patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals will explore the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.
   Ethics and dissemination Approved by South-East Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee and NSW Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated via conference presentations, journal publications, seminars and invited talks.

T2  - HELVETICA PAEDIATRICA ACTA
AB  - The effectiveness and lack of undesirable side effects has made verapamil the drug of choice in the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in infants without underlying heart disease. A described case demonstrates the occasional severe negative inotropic effect of the drug, independent of its influence on heart rate and conduction. Severe heart failure and shock ensued after a therapeutic dose of i.v. verapamil in a newborn suffering from atrial flutter with no associated heart disease. Although the arrhythmia was promptly converted to sinus rhythm, the baby required 2 h of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and inotropic support. Follow-up during the 1st year of life revealed a normal healthy baby. Attention to the hemodynamic status in addition to continuous ECG monitoring is also mandatory during i.v. verapamil administration in patients without underlying heart disease.

TI  - Assessing brain injury after cardiac arrest, towards a quantitative approach
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy due to a presumed poor neurological prognosis precedes most deaths in patients who have been resuscitated after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and are being treated in an ICU. Guidelines to support these critical decisions recommend a multimodal strategy based on advanced diagnostic methods. This review will discuss clinical experience with the 2015 guidelines and recent developments towards more accurate quantification of posthypoxic brain injury.
   Recent findings
   Qualitative assessment of clinical findings, neurophysiological signals and radiological images are prone to error due to the individual assessors' experience and competence. Currently, the only quantitative method for assessment of postarrest brain injury in regular clinical use is the measurement of neuronspecific enolase in serum. Since 2015 several promising methods to standardize assessment have been introduced including pupillometry, standardized electroencephalography interpretation and the quantification of somatosensory evoked potentials, computed tomography and MRI-signals. In addition, novel and superior blood biomarkers are on the verge of clinical introduction.
   Summary
   The current guidelines for neuroprognostication include a step-by-step multimodal algorithm but many patients will still be left with an uncertain prognosis 4-5 days after cardiac arrest. Novel quantitative methods are a necessary step to a more nuanced prediction of outcome for this group of patients.

TI  - Prognostication in Anoxic Brain Injury
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiac arrest is a common cause of coma with frequent poor outcomes. Palliative medicine teams are often called upon to discuss the scope of treatment and future care in cases of anoxic brain injury. Understanding prognostic tools in this setting would help medical teams communicate more effectively with patients' families and caregivers and may promote improved quality of life overall. This article reviews multiple tools that are useful in determining outcomes in the setting of postarrest anoxic brain injury.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy and surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in advanced resectable none small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundThe emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has brought about a paradigm shift in the treatment landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the promising long-term survival outcomes and optimization of pathological complete response (cPR) demonstrated by various studies such as Impower010 and Checkmate-816, the effectiveness of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced resectable NSCLC remains a subject of debate. Although previous research has explored the connection between the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy and surgical-related safety, limited studies have specifically investigated the surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Therefore, our study aims to assess the efficacy and surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced resectable non-small cell lung cancer.MethodWe conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of 93 patients with stage IIIA-IIIC NSCLC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection. Among them, 53 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy, 18 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the remaining 22 underwent neoadjuvant targeted therapy. The patients were separated into further groups according to their pathological type. Data analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test.ResultsAll patients were categorized into six distinct groups. Notably, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy squamous carcinoma group exhibited a favorable edge over the neoadjuvant targeted squamous carcinoma group concerning the duration of drainage tube indwelling and the extent of lymph node dissection. Furthermore, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy adenocarcinoma group outperformed neoadjuvant targeted therapy adenocarcinoma counterpart in terms of achieving complete pathological response (cPR). Simultaneously, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy adenocarcinoma group surpassed the neoadjuvant chemotherapy adenocarcinoma group in the incidence of hydrothorax. Nevertheless, no statistically significant disparities were noted between the neoadjuvant immunotherapy squamous carcinoma group and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy carcinoma group.ConclusionRegarding surgical outcomes, neoadjuvant immunotherapy conferred notable advantages compared to conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant targeted therapy for patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. In the case of squamous carcinoma, neoadjuvant immunotherapy exhibited superiority over neoadjuvant targeted therapy, although additional evidence is required to conclusively establish its precedence over neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - EFFECT ON BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS OF BRAIN INJURY OF THERAPY WITH DEFEROXAMINE OR SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE FOLLOWING CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Iron-mediated lipid peroxidation by oxygen radical mechanisms is thought to be a contributing factor to neurological injury during reperfusion following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. This study was designed to examine and compare the effects of an iron chelator (deferoxamine) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) on brain lipid peroxidation and tissue ions after eight hours of reperfusion following a 15-minute cardiac arrest. This sampling time was chosen because other work with this model has shown severe ionic and ultrastructural derangement at this point. Twenty-three dogs were anesthetized with ketamine and halothane and divided into four groups. Six dogs were nonischemic controls (group I). In the remaining dogs, a 15-minute cardiac arrest was induced with KCI. Resuscitation was begun with internal cardiac massage and artificial ventilation. After five minutes of artificial perfusion, internal defibrillation was perfomred to restart the heart. All dogs were resuscitated and supported by a standard intensive care (SIC) protocol for eight hours. Six resuscitated dogs served as SIC control (group II). Six were treated with deferoxamine, 200 mg/kg loading dose and 100 mg/kg/h maintenance drip (group III), and five were treated with SOD, 1,000,000 units bolus and 500,000 units/h drip (group IV). All drugs were administered intravenously immediately postresuscitation. At eight hours postresuscitation, a 3-g portion of parietal cerebral cortex was obtained through a trephine hole. The sample was assayed for tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) by the thiobarbituric acid test, the double bond content of the tissue lipids (lipid unsaturation index, LUSI), and total tissue content of K and Na. Deferoxamine treatment inhibited peroxidation of brain lipids by both the MDA and LUSI assays, and protected tissue K/NA ratio. SOD treatment inhibited only MDA. Iron chelation therapy appears to be promising for the membrane component of reperfusion injury.

TI  - Predictors of successful discharge from intensive care units in older adults aged 80 years or older: A population-based study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES
AB  - Background: We determined the long-term outcomes of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients and investigated the predictors of successful discharge for >= 6 months among older adults aged >= 80 years in Taiwan.
   Objectives: To identify the predictors of ICU admission in patients aged >= 80 years and the predictors of and optimal cutoff predictive discharge score (PDS) for ICU successful discharge in patients aged >= 80 years.
   Design: A population-based retrospective cohort study. Settings and participants: Medical records of 282,269 individuals aged >= 80 years collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2001 to 2013.
   Methods: Demographic and clinical parameters, Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI), hospital type, and post-discharge outcomes of ICU patients aged >= 80 years were obtained from their medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze and identify the predictors of successful discharge and treatments received by critically ill patients aged >= 80 years admitted to the ICU. The optimal cutoff PDS for successful discharge in older adults were calculated by Youden Index.
   Results 65,756 ICU admissions were documented, of which 21% (n = 13,825) were for adults aged >= 80 years. The successful discharge rate among ICU patients aged >= 80 years (57.2%) was significantly lower than that among those aged 18-64 and 65-79 years (81.7% and 71.5%, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed the following predictors of successful discharge for >= 6 months after ICU admission in adults aged >= 80 years: younger age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94-0.96), shorter ICU length of stay (adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.88-0.92), lower CCI (adjusted OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.90-0.93), and no life-sustaining treatments received (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.68-0.84; mechanical ventilation: adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% Cl = 0.57-0.71; use of inotropic agents: adjusted OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.34-0.41). The optimal cutoff PDS in older adults was 6 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.72-0.74).
   Conclusion: This is the first population-based study investigating the post-discharge outcomes of ICU patients aged >= 80 years. Advanced age was a predictive factor of unsuccessful discharge from the ICU. Nevertheless, more than half of this vulnerable population survived for at least 6 months after discharge. Therefore, age should not be the sole criterion when considering ICU admission and deciding curative treatments for critically ill older adults. Comprehensive assessment and effective communication with patients and their families are also crucial in clinical decision-making for critically ill older adults. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Factors influencing major adverse cardiac events among people with acute coronary syndrome admitted to a tertiary hospital in Northeastern Thailand: A cross-sectional study
T2  - BELITUNG NURSING JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a severe cardiovascular condition that can lead to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), resulting in significant morbidity and elevated mortality rates. Objective: This study aimed to examine complications arising from ACS in patients admitted to a tertiary hospital and identify the influencing factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February and December 2021 among patients diagnosed with ACS at the tertiary hospital in Northeastern Thailand. The sample included 133 participants hospitalized for ACS. Simple random sampling was employed, with data collected from the patient registry by selecting 15 individuals at a time until the target of 1,998 patients was reached. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Chi-Square test, Fisher's exact test, and binary logistic regression to identify significant predictors of complications in this population. Results: Factors influencing the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) included cardiac function and the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV had a significantly higher risk of MACE compared to those with NYHA class I (p <0.001; 95% CI, 2.008-10.984). Additionally, patients who received CPR were 4.15 times more likely to experience MACE than those who did not receive CPR (p <0.05; 95% CI, 1.029-16.729). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that cardiac function and the necessity for CPR significantly influence the development of MACE in patients with ACS. These findings highlight the importance of thorough evaluation and monitoring by healthcare teams during hospitalization, particularly for patients with abnormal cardiac function or a history of CPR. Prompt identification and targeted interventions for high-risk individuals can improve outcomes and reduce complications. Nurses should prioritize follow-up evaluations for ACS patients with NYHA class II-IV or those who have undergone CPR, as these individuals are at elevated risk for developing MACE.

TI  - Medical and Paramedical Care of Patients With Cerebellar Ataxia During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Seven Practical Recommendations of the COVID 19 Cerebellum Task Force
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the cause of the current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily targets the respiratory system. Some patients also experience neurological signs and symptoms ranging from anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, and vomiting to confusion, encephalitis, and stroke. Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies. Most CA patients burdened by progressive neurologic deficits have substantially impaired mobility and other essential functions, for which they rely heavily on ambulatory services, including rehabilitation and psychosocial care. Cessation of these interventions because of isolation restrictions places the CA patient population at risk of further deterioration. This international panel of ataxia experts provides recommendations for neurologists caring for patients with CA, emphasizing a pro-active approach designed to maintain their autonomy and well-being: continue long-term medications, promote rehabilitation efforts, utilize the technology of virtual visits for regular contact with healthcare providers, and pay attention to emotional and psychosocial health. Neurologists should play an active role in decision-making in those CA cases requiring escalation to intensive care and resuscitation. Multi-disciplinary collaboration between care teams is always important, and never more so than in the context of the current pandemic.

TI  - Update on sublingual immunotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-College-of-Allergy-Asthma-and-Immunology
AB  - Objective: To obtain a current understanding of the mechanisms, clinical indications, efficacy, and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for the treatment of children and adults with allergic rhinitis, asthma, and allergic conjunctivitis.
   Methods: A MEDLINE and Index Medicus search for peer-reviewed articles on SLIT was performed.
   Results: Since the approval of SLIT by the World Health Organization in 1988, the efficacy and safety of SLIT have been confirmed in several new double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for monosensitized patients who are allergic to house dust mites, grass pollens, ragweed, and birch pollen. Documented immunologic responses to SLIT have included a decrease in serum eosinophilic cationic protein and interleukin 13 (IL-13) levels, an elevation in IL-12 levels, a reduction in late-phase responses, and increases in IgG4/IgE ratios. A Cochrane review of 22 studies confirmed the efficacy and safety of SLIT for patients with allergic rhinitis. A long-term asthma study showed sustained efficacy 5 years after discontinuing the vaccine. The safety of SLIT has been confirmed in postmarketing studies, and severe systemic adverse effects have never been reported. In view of its safety profile, SLIT is taken by the patient at home (away from specialized centers), and no specialized resuscitation facilities are required.
   Conclusion: SLIT is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Because of its efficacy, safety, and ease of administration, it has been accepted in Europe, Southern Africa, Australasia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East as a promising therapeutic option that can significantly alter the natural history of allergic disease without the risks of injection immunotherapy.

TI  - Staff awareness of a 'do not attempt resuscitation' policy in a district general hospital
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - UK hospitals have been instructed to ensure that all staff understand the institution's resuscitation policy. Using a questionnaire, we determined the level of knowledge about the hospital's 'do not attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) policy amongst a range of staff.
   Six hundred and seventy-seven questionnaires were returned. 91.4% of responders did not know the correct overall percentage survival to hospital discharge following an in-hospital cardiac arrest. 19.3%, of doctors, 10.6% of nurses, and 8.9% of health care support workers (HCSW) gave answers in the correct range (i.e., 15-25%).
   Most doctors (93.5%), nurses (93.5%), and HCSW (78.9%) correctly identified that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be the default position, when a DNAR decision does not exist. The majority of doctors (78.5%), nurses (73.2%) and HCSW (65.8%) appreciated that the hospital policy allowed a senior trainee doctor (specialist registrar, SpR) to make the initial decision without consultation with more senior medical staff. Knowledge of who was ultimately responsible for the DNAR decision was also good, with 100% of doctors, 100% of midwives, 98.3% of nurses and 78.9% of HCSW responding correctly.
   Ten percent of doctors, 15% of nurses and 10.5% of HCSW believed that the next of kin could demand resuscitation or a DNAR status. There was inconsistency about what information staff felt should be included in DNAR documentation and what, if any, continuing care should be given to patients who are not for resuscitation.
   Our study demonstrates that there is room for improvement in the awareness of staff about the DNAR process. The local DNAR policy is being reviewed to ensure that its messages are clear and a specific DNAR educational programme has been commenced. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Brain wave disturbance and cognitive impairment after CPR
T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB  - Cognitive impairment (CI) is a common morbidity after cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with long time persistence. Brain hypoxia is believed to be the main but not the single etiology of post CPR cognitive impairment. Theta and lower theta waves of the EEG have essential role in proper functioning of the memory performance. Both endotracheal incubation and atropine administration in CPR process can abolish these waves. We hypothesize that CI in CPR survivors can be caused by disturbance in aforementioned waves due to endotracheal intubation and atropine administration.

TI  - Outcome and prognostic factors in critically ill cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To assess survival in cancer patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with respect to the nature of malignancy, cause of ICU admittance, and course during ICU stay as well as to evaluate the prognostic value of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: ICU at a university cancer referral center.
   Patients: A total of 414 cancer patients admitted to the ICU during a period of 66 months.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements: Charts of the patients were analyzed with respect to underlying disease, cause of admission, APACHE III score, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, neutropenia and development of septic shock, as well as ICU survival and survival after discharge. Mortality data were compared with two control groups: 1362 patients admitted to our ICU suffering from diseases other than cancer and 2,776 cancer patients not admitted to the ICU.
   Main Results: ICU survival was 53%, and 1-yr survival was 23%. The 1-yr mortality rate was significantly lower in both control groups. Patients admitted after bone marrow transplantation had the highest mortality. In a multivariate analysis, prognosis was negatively influenced by respiratory insufficiency, the need of mechanical ventilation, and development of septic shock during the ICU stay. Admission after cardiopulmonary resuscitation yielded high ICU mortality but a relatively good long-term prognosis. Admission after surgery and as a result of acute hemorrhage was associated with a good prognosis. Age, neutropenia, and underlying disease did not influence outcome significantly. Admission APACHE III scores were significantly higher in nonsurvivors but failed to predict individual outcome satisfactorily. All patients with APACHE III scores of >80 died at the ICU.
   Conclusion: A combination of factors must be taken into account to estimate a critically ill cancer patient's prognosis in the ICU. The APACHE III scoring system alone should not be used to make decisions about therapy prolongation. Admission to the ICU worsens the prognosis of a cancer patient substantially; however, as ICU mortality is 47%, comparable with severely ill noncancer patients, general reluctance to admit cancer patients to an ICU does not seem to be justified.

TI  - The influence of body composition on therapeutic hypothermia: a prospective observational study of patients after cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction Patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) benefit from therapeutic hypothermia for 24 hours. The time needed to reach hypothermia (target temperature of 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C) varies widely. In this study, we explore the relation between measures of body composition and the time needed to reach target temperature with hypothermia.
   Method We conducted a prospective observational study in patients treated with hypothermia after OHCA. Data collected included weight and height, body composition by anthropometric measures and by single-frequency body impedance, and waist-to-hip ratio. Analysis of concordance between impedance and anthropometric measures and hazard ratios of achieving target temperature (event) corrected for different body composition measures.
   Results Twenty-seven patients were included. The median (interquartile range) time to reach target temperature after admission to the intensive care unit was 191 (105 to 382) minutes. Intraclass correlation for total body fat (TBF) measures was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 0.97). Only TBF percentage (anthropometrics by the Durnin's table) appeared to be associated with time to reach target temperature: 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.99; P = 0.03).
   Conclusion The body composition measures from single-frequency impedance and anthropometrics appear to be very concordant. Only TBF percentage (anthropometrics) showed a significant but clinically irrelevant influence on time needed to achieve target temperature with hypothermia. We conclude that there are no indications to adjust current cooling practice toward the body composition of patients.

TI  - Continuous evaluation of neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Post-resuscitation care has changed in the last decade, and outcome after cardiac arrest has improved, thanks to several combined measures. Induced hypothermia has shown a treatment benefit in two randomized trials, but some doubts remain. General care has improved, including the use of emergency coronary intervention. Assessment of neurological function and prognosis in comatose cardiac arrest patient is challenging, especially when treated with hypothermia. In this review, we evaluate the recent literature and discuss the available evidence for prognostication after cardiac arrest in the era of temperature management. Relevant literature was identified searching PubMed and reading published papers in the field, but no standardized search strategy was used. The complexity of predicting outcome after cardiac arrest and induced hypothermia is recognized in the literature, and no single test can predict a poor prognosis with absolute certainty. A clinical neurological examination is still the gold standard, but the results need careful interpretation because many patients are affected by sedatives and by hypothermia. Common adjuncts include neurophysiology, brain imaging and biomarkers, and a multimodal strategy is generally recommended. Current guidelines for prediction of outcome after cardiac arrest and induced hypothermia are not sufficient. Based on our expert opinion, we suggest a multimodal approach with a continuous evaluation of prognosis based on repeated neurological examinations and electroencephalography. Somatosensory-evoked potential is an established method to help determine a poor outcome and is recommended, whereas biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging are promising adjuncts. We recommend that a decisive evaluation of prognosis is performed at 72?h after normothermia or later in a patient free of sedative and analgetic drugs.

TI  - New aspects and perspective on cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
T2  - ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION
AB  - Objectives: To analyse the current knowledge based on the experimental and the clinical research studies focused on the main fields of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Data sources: International guidelines and recent review articles. Data collected from the Medline database with the key word: cardiac arrest.
   Study selection: Research studies published during the last ten years were reviewed. Relevant clinical information was extracted and discussed when it induced changes in guidelines.
   Data synthesis: Promising improvements on basic and advanced life supports are proposed. Chest compressions prevail over ventilation. Alternatives to classical chest compressions are tested. Ventilatory volume must be reduced from 1000 to approximatively 500 mL for each breath with oxygen. Biphasic waveform defibrillators and automated external defibrillators will be considered as the best devices in the near future. Some non-catecholaminergic vasopressors could reduce the use of epinephrine for advanced cardiac life support. Lidocaine could be replaced by amiodarone as anti-arrhythmic drug of choice. New postresuscitation therapeutic strategies are evaluated, especially coronary reperfusion when the cause of cardiac arrest is cardiac.
   Conclusion: Many fields of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are investigated. Some relevant informations are included in the last international guidelines published in 2000, but most of them need complementary studies before other changes could be recommended for routine practice.

TI  - Acute phase treatment of VTE: Anticoagulation, including non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
T2  - THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS
AB  - The acute phase of venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment focuses on the prompt and safe initiation of full-dose anticoagulation to decrease morbidity and mortality. Immediate management consists of resuscitation, supportive care, and thrombolysis for patients with haemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) or limb-threatening deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with contraindications to anticoagulants are considered for vena cava filters. Disposition for the acute treatment of VTE is then considered based on published risk scores and the patient's social status, as the first seven days carries the highest risk for VTE recurrence, extension and bleeding due to anticoagulation. Next, a review of: immediate and long-term bleeding risk, comorbidities (i.e. active cancer, renal failure, obesity, thrombophilia), medications, patient preference, VTE location and potential for pregnancy should be undertaken. This will help determine the most suitable anticoagulant for immediate treatment. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban as well as the direct-thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, are increasing the convenience of and options available for VTE treatment. Current options for immediate, treatment include low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), fondaparinux, apixaban, or rivaroxaban. LMWH or UFH may be continued as monotherapy or transitioned to treatment with a VKA, dabigatran or edoxaban. This review describes the upfront treatment of VTE and the evolving role of NOACs in the contemporary management of VTE.

TI  - Peptidoglycan Remodeling in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Comparison of Structures and Catalytic Activities of RipA and RipB
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB  - The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sustaining long-term survival within the host macrophages partly relies on its unique cell envelop that also confers low susceptibility to several antibiotics. Remodeling of the septal peptidoglycan (PG) has been linked to the putative PG hydrolases RipA and RipB. The crystal structures of RipB (Rv1478) and the homologous module of RipA (Rv1477) were determined to 1.60 angstrom and 1.38 angstrom resolution, respectively. Both proteins contain a C-terminal core domain resembling the NlpC-type PG hydrolases. However, the structure of RipB exhibits striking differences to the structures of this domain in RipA reported here and previously by others. Major structural differences were found in the N-terminal segments of 70 amino acids and in an adjacent loop, which form part of the substrate binding groove. Both RipA and RipB are able to bind PG. RipA, its C-terminal module and RipB cleave defined PG fragments between D-glutamate and mesodiaminopimelate with pH optima of 5 and 6, respectively. The peptidase module of RipA is also able to degrade Bacillus subtilis PG, which displays peptide stems and cross-links identical with those found in mycobacterial murein. RipB did not show comparable hydrolase activity with this substrate. Removal of the N-terminal segments previously suggested to have a role in auto-inhibition did not change the activity of either RipA or RipB. A comparison of the putative active-site clefts in the two enzymes provides structural insights into the basis of the differences in their substrate specificity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Influence of atrial fibrillation type on outcomes of ablation vs. drug therapy: results from CABANA
T2  - EUROPACE
AB  - Aims Influence of atrial fibrillation (AF) type on outcomes seen with catheter ablation vs. drug therapy is incompletely understood. This study assesses the impact of AF type on treatment outcomes in the Catheter Ablation vs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation Trial (CABANA). Methods and results CABANA randomized 2204 patients >= 65 years old or <65 with at least one risk factor for stroke to catheter ablation or drug therapy. Of these, 946 (42.9%) had paroxysmal AF (PAF), 1042 (47.3%) had persistent AF (PersAF), and 215 (9.8%) had long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF) at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Symptoms were measured with the Mayo AF-Specific Symptom Inventory (MAFSI), and quality of life was measured with the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT). Comparisons are reported by intention to treat. Compared with drug therapy alone, catheter ablation produced a 19% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint for PAF {adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 1.30]}, and a 17% relative reduction for PersAF (aHR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.22). For LSPAF, the ablation relative effect was a 7% reduction (aHR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.36, 2.44). Ablation was more effective than drug therapy at reducing first AF recurrence in all AF types: by 51% for PAF (aHR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.62), by 47% for PersAF (aHR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.43,0.65), and by 36% for LSPAF (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41,1.00). Ablation was associated with greater improvement in symptoms, with the mean difference between groups in the MAFSI frequency score favouring ablation over 5 years of follow-up in all subgroups: PAF had a clinically significant -1.9-point difference (95% CI: -1.2 to -2.6); PersAF a -0.9 difference (95% CI: -0.2 to -1.6); LSPAF a clinically significant difference of -1.6 points (95% CI: -0.1 to -3.1). Ablation was also associated with greater improvement in quality of life in all subgroups, with the AFEQT overall score in PAF patients showing a clinically significant 5.3-point improvement (95% CI: 3.3 to 7.3) over drug therapy alone over 5 years of follow-up, PersAF a 1.7-point difference (95% CI: 0.0 to 3.7), and LSPAF a 3.1-point difference (95% CI: -1.6 to 7.8). Conclusion Prognostic treatment effects of catheter ablation compared with drug therapy on the primary and major secondary clinical endpoints did not differ consequentially by AF subtype. With regard to decreases in AF recurrence and improving quality of life, ablation was more effective than drug therapy in all three AF type subgroups. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00911508

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Rivaroxaban in Adults With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Background: All evidence regarding benefits and harms of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention has not been appraised yet.
   Study Question: What are the comparative effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban in adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation?
   Data Sources: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and observational studies were identified in several databases in October 2018.
   Study Design: Rapid review with evidence appraisal using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group approach.
   Results: Two direct RCTs (23,021 patients) suggest that rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (pooled relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-1.24), reduces risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.38-0.92), fatal bleeding (RR 0.49, 95% CI, 0.31-0.76), and cardiac arrest (RR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.25-0.82, 2 RCTs), but increases risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.46, 95% CI, 1.19-1.78). In observational studies, rivaroxaban is associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.77-0.99, 222,750 patients), acute myocardial infarction (RR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.48-0.78, 73,739 patients), and intracranial hemorrhage (RR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.45-0.92, 197,506 patients) but higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.30, 95% CI, 1.19-1.42, 188,968 patients) and higher risk of mortality when compared with warfarin in European studies (RR 1.19, 103,270 patients in the UK; RR 2.02, 22,358 patients in Denmark) but lower risk of mortality in Taiwan (RR 0.58, 40,000 patients). Network meta-analyses and observational studies suggest that rivaroxaban is associated with higher risk of bleeding when compared with apixaban (RR 2.14, 72,586 patients), dabigatran (RR 1.24, 67,102 patients), and edoxaban (RR 1.32, 71,683 patients).
   Conclusions: Research on the long-term comparative effectiveness, safety, and effects on quality of life between rivaroxaban and other novel oral anticoagulants is urgently needed.

TI  - Intra-Cardiac Arrest Use of Stellate Ganglion Block for Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Refractory ventricular dysrhythmia, or electrical storm, is a cardiac condition consisting of three or more episodes of ventricular dysrhythmia resistant to treatment within a 24-hour period. These dysrhythmias carry high morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and abated promptly. When traditional resuscitative algorithms fail to return a patient to a perfusing rhythm, providers need to consider other, more novel techniques to terminate these dangerous dysrhythmias. One approach is the use of a stellate ganglion block, which has been documented in the literature only a handful of times for its resuscitative use in cardiac arrest. Case Series: This case series details two cases from an urban emergency department (ED) in a large metropolitan city, where the use of ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion blocks during cardiac arrest provided successful ablation of the tachydysrhythmia. The first case involves a patient who went into cardiac arrest while in the ED and was found to be in refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardiawhile. The second case describes a patient who went into a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while with emergency medical services. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: The stellate ganglion block is a procedure currently being used as a treatment modality for a variety of neurologic, psychological, and cardiac conditions. This intervention may provide a viable and lifesaving option for emergency physicians to adopt when traditional resuscitative algorithms fail to break resistant ventricular tachydysrhythmias.

TI  - Effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions on the secondary consequences of surviving a cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Aim The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions on the secondary physical, neurological and psychological consequences of cardiac arrest (CA) for adult survivors. Methods A literature search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Psychological Information Database, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials) was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies up to 18 April 2021. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and main secondary outcome was neurological function with additional secondary outcomes being survival, rehospitalisation, safety (serious and non-serious adverse events), psychological well-being, fatigue, exercise capacity and physical capacity. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results Three RCTs and 11 observational studies were included (total 721 participants). Study duration ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Pooled data from two RCTs showed low-quality evidence for no effect on physical HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19, (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.47)) and no effect on mental HRQoL (SMD 0.27 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.55)). Regarding secondary outcomes, very low-quality evidence was found for improvement in neurological function associated with inpatient rehabilitation for CA survivors with acquired brain injury (SMD 0.71, (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.96)) from five observational studies. Two small observational studies found exercise-based rehabilitation interventions to be safe for CA survivors, reporting no serious or non-serious events. Conclusions Given the overall low quality of evidence, this review cannot determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for CA survivors on HRQoL, neurological function or other included outcomes, and recommend further high-quality studies be conducted. In the interim, existing clinical guidelines on rehabilitation provision after CA should be followed to meet the high burden of secondary consequences suffered by CA survivors.

TI  - ILCOR's revised Covid-19 defibrillation recommendation requires a new approach to training
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - In-hospital resuscitation practices have changed by necessity in the Covid-19 era, principally due to precautions intended to protect caregivers from infection. This has resulted in serious delays in resuscitation response.
   ILCOR has recently modified its guidelines to separate defibrillation from other interventions, recognizing that shock success is extremely time-dependent and that defibrillation poses relatively little risk of Covid-19 transmission. The new recommendation calls for sending one caregiver into the isolation room in order to initiate bedside monitoring and defibrillate if indicated, while the code team is donning their personal protective equipment. Implementing this change requires focused training in that specific role. This can be accomplished by intensively training a subset of clinical staff to assume the responsibility and act without hesitation when a code occurs.
   Focused defibrillation training promises to avoid compromising the care of patients experiencing tachyarrhythmic arrests in the setting of Covid-19. Such a training program might even result in better survival than before the pandemic for this subset of patients.

TI  - New signs to encourage the use of Automated External Defibrillators by the lay public
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Public Access Defibrillation - the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) by lay bystanders before the arrival of Emergency Medical Services - is an important strategy in delivering prompt defibrillation to victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and can greatly improve survival rates. Such public-access AEDs are used rarely: one barrier might be poor understanding and content of current signage to indicate their presence. The aim of this project was to develop a sign, with public consultation, that better indicated the function of an AED, and an associated poster to encourage its use.
   Methods: Two public surveys were undertaken, in July and December 2015, to investigate perceptions of the current AED location sign recommended for use in the UK and to produce an improved location sign and associated information poster.
   Results: There were 1895 and 2115 respondents to the surveys. Fewer than half (47.9%, 895/1870) understood what the current location sign indicated. One of four design options for a location sign best explained the indication for (preferred by 56.0%, 1023/1828) and best encouraged the use of a public AED (51.8%, 946/1828). 83.5% (1766/2115) preferred an illustration of a stylised heart trace to the lightning bolt used at present. From five wording options, Defibrillator- Heart Restarter' was the most popular (29.4%, 622/2115). An associated poster was developed using design features from the new location sign, findings from the surveys and expert group input regarding its content.
   Conclusions: This is the first time that public consultation has been used to design a public AED location sign. Effective signage has the potential to help break down the barriers to more widespread use of AEDs in public places. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Successful ventricular defibrillation by the selective sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 inhibitor cariporide
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-l (NHE-1)activation worsens functional myocardial abnormalities associated with ischemia and reperfusion. We hypothesize that these abnormalities may limit cardiac resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) and investigated whether NHE-1 inhibition with the benzoylguanidine derivative cariporide could improve resuscitability, postresuscitation myocardial function, and short-term survival in isolated heart and intact rat models of VF.
   Methods and Results in the isolated rat heart, VF was induced for 25 minutes. Perfusion was interrupted for the initial 10 minutes and restarted at 10% of baseline flow for the remaining 15 minutes (simulating chest compression). Cariporide ameliorated ischemic contracture, prevented postresuscitation diastolic dysfunction, and favored earlier return of contractile function. In the intact rat, cariporide, injected into the right atrium before chest compression was started (after 6 minutes of untreated VF), prompted spontaneous defibrillation between minutes 7 and 9 of chest compression in 6 of 8 rats. In contrast, electrical defibrillation was required in each of 8 control rats after completion of a predetermined 16-minute interval of VF. After resuscitation, cariporide-treated rats had less ventricular ectopic activity and normalized their hemodynamic function faster. Electrical defibrillation was then timed in control rats to match the time when spontaneous defibrillation occurred in cariporide-treated rats. With comparable VF duration, postresuscitation hemodynamic dysfunction was ameliorated by cariporide, but only when more severe ischemia was modeled by prolongation of the interval of untreated VF from 6 to 10 minutes.
   Conclusion-NHE-1 inhibition may represent a novel and remarkably effective intervention for resuscitation from VF.

TI  - Prevalence and impact of frailty on mortality in elderly ICU patients: a prospective, multicenter, observational study
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Frailty is a recent concept used for evaluating elderly individuals. Our study determined the prevalence of frailty in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and its impact on the rate of mortality.
   A multicenter, prospective, observational study performed in four ICUs in France included 196 patients aged a parts per thousand yen65 years hospitalized for > 24 h during a 6-month study period. Frailty was determined using the frailty phenotype (FP) and the clinical frailty score (CFS). The patients were separated as follows: FP score < 3 or a parts per thousand yen3 and CFS < 5 or a parts per thousand yen5.
   Frailty was observed in 41 and 23 % of patients on the basis of an FP score a parts per thousand yen3 and a CFS a parts per thousand yen5, respectively. At admission to the ICU, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores did not differ between the frail and nonfrail patients. In the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for ICU mortality were FP score a parts per thousand yen3 [hazard ratio (HR), 3.3; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.6-6.6; p < 0.001], male gender (HR, 2.4; 95 % CI, 1.1-5.3; p = 0.026), cardiac arrest before admission (HR, 2.8; 95 % CI, 1.1-7.4; p = 0.036), SAPS II score a parts per thousand yen46 (HR, 2.6; 95 % CI, 1.2-5.3; p = 0.011), and brain injury before admission (HR, 3.5; 95 % CI, 1.6-7.7; p = 0.002). The risk factors for 6-month mortality were a CFS a parts per thousand yen5 (HR, 2.4; 95 % CI, 1.49-3.87; p < 0.001) and a SOFA score a parts per thousand yen7 (HR, 2.2; 95 % CI, 1.35-3.64; p = 0.002). An increased CFS was associated with significant incremental hospital and 6-month mortalities.
   Frailty is a frequent occurrence and is independently associated with increased ICU and 6-month mortalities. Notably, the CFS predicts outcomes more effectively than the commonly used ICU illness scores.

TI  - Characteristics, Interventions, and Outcomes of Lung Transplant Recipients Co-Managed with Palliative Care
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Lung transplantation (LT) recipients carry a high symptom burden. Palliative Care (PC) is a field of medicine focused on symptom control and psychosocial support, but transplant recipients are often referred to PC very late in the disease course, if at all. In our institution, the LT service has increasingly consulted PC to co-manage LT recipients with end-stage graft dysfunction or other terminal conditions. We present the characteristics, PC interventions used, and outcomes of these patients.
   Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, cohort study of LT recipients referred for PC consultation between January 2010 and May 2012. We collected patient demographics, timing and location of PC consultation, PC interventions, and patient outcomes.
   Results: Twenty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen (67%) had chronic allograft dysfunction. Reasons for referral were dyspnea (42%), end-of-life planning (42%), pain (29%), cough (4%), anxiety (4%), and depression (4%). Referral was made a median of 3.2 (range, 0.2 to 18) years from transplant and a median 14 days (range, 0 to 227 days) from death. Eighty-three percent of consultations occurred >48 hours from time of death. Ninety-two percent of patients were prescribed opioids over their course of treatment. Among the 12 (50%) who died in our center, 10 (83%) were receiving comfort medications. Eight patients (33%) initially requested full resuscitation at the time of PC consultation, but seven of these patients (or their surrogates) later agreed to a do not resuscitate (DNR) order; the eighth was still alive at last follow-up. No patient in this study received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at the time of death.
   Conclusion: LT recipients referred for PC co-management typically receive comfort medications and avoid the aggressive end-of-life care usually reported for this population. The effect of PC interventions on patient quality of life requires further study.

TI  - EFFORT study: Comparing impact of operation and assisted reproductive technologies on fertility for women with deep infiltrating endometriosis - study protocol for a multicentre randomised trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) affecting the rectum or sigmoid colon is associated with infertility, severe pain and decreased quality of life. As most women with DIE are young, many have a pregnancy intention. Treatment possibilities of endometriosis-associated infertility are surgery or assisted reproductive technologies (ART). However, no studies have compared the two interventions directly. Therefore, this study aims to determine the cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR) and the live birth rate (LBR) after first-line surgery compared with first-line ART for women with rectosigmoid DIE and a pregnancy intention.
   Methods and analysis Multicentre, parallel-group, randomised trial of women with rectosigmoid DIE and a pregnancy intention for at least 6 months in Aarhus, Denmark and Bordeaux, France. 352 women aged 18-38 years are randomised 1:1 to either surgical management (shaving, disc excision or segmental resection) or ART management (at least two in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedures if not pregnant after the first cycle). Women in the surgical intervention group will attempt to get pregnant by either spontaneous conception or ART, depending on the endometriosis fertility index score. Primary outcome measures are CPR and LBR at 18 months' follow-up.

TI  - Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Department Visits of Patients with an Emergent or Urgent Diagnosis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, visits to emergency department (ED) have significantly declined worldwide. The purpose of this study was to identify the trend of visits to ED for different diseases at the peak and slack stages of the epidemic.
   Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary referral medical center in northern Taiwan. We recorded weekly ED visits for myocardial infarction with or without ST-elevation (STEMI or NSTEMI), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), acute stroke, and congestive heart failure from 2016 to 2021. We compared the local epidemic peak periods (calendar weeks 4-18, 2020 and calendar weeks 21-31, 2021) and its corresponding slack periods (calendar weeks 4-18, 2021 and calendar weeks 21-31, 2020) with the baseline period (2016-2019) using Maim-Whitney test to identify the difference.
   Results: We observed a significant decline in ED visits (median [Q1, Q3]) during the epidemic for OHCA (6 [5, 7] and 5 [4, 6], p = 0.046, for baseline and peak period, respectively, in week 4-18), acute stroke (41.5 [38, 47] and 35 [28, 39], p < 0.001, in week 4-18, 40 [35, 45] and 35 [28, 40], p = 0.039, in week 21-31) and CHF (28 [24.25, 33] and 19 [12, 23], p < 0.001, in week 4-18, 18 [16, 23] and 13 [11, 16], p = 0.001, in week 21-31). Significant difference was not observed in patients with NSTEMI and STEMI in both week 4-18 and 21-31, and cardiac arrest in week 21-31. There was a rebound in ED visits in the slack period.
   Conclusion: This study revealed that ED visits significantly declined during the COVID-19 epidemic and rebounded in the slack period. The trend was significant for acute stroke and heart failure but was relatively less prominent effect for emergent events such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction.

TI  - Endothelial BMP4 Regulates Leukocyte Diapedesis and Promotes Inflammation
T2  - INFLAMMATION
AB  - Leukocyte recruitment is a fundamental event in the response of the innate immune system to injury. This process is promoted in part by the opening of endothelial cell adherens junctions that allows leukocyte extravasation through gaps between adjacent endothelial cells. VE-cadherin is a key component of endothelial cell adherens junctions and a negative regulator of leukocyte emigration. Accumulating evidence implicates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 as a critical regulator in vascular biology, but its role in leukocyte extravasation in vitro and in vivo has not been investigated so far. To assess the impact of BMP4 on leukocyte emigration in vivo, we used the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with recombinant BMP4 in addition to thioglycollate. Compared to solvent-treated controls, we observed higher accumulation of leukocytes in the peritoneal lavage of BMP4-treated mice indicating that BMP4 promotes leukocyte diapedesis into the inflamed peritoneal cavity. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of BMP4 in mice markedly diminished leukocyte diapedesis following thioglycollate administration suggesting that endothelial BMP4 is required for leukocyte recruitment. Consistent with these in vivo results, transwell migration assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro revealed that recombinant BMP4 enhanced leukocyte transmigration through the endothelial monolayer. Conversely, silencing of endothelial BMP4 by siRNA dampened leukocyte diapedesis in vitro. Mechanistic studies showed that loss of BMP4 improved endothelial junction stability by upregulation of VE-cadherin expression in vitro and in vivo. Vice versa, treatment of HUVECs with recombinant BMP4 decreased expression of VE-cadherin and impaired endothelial junction stability shown by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Finally, severe endothelial damage in HUVECs in response to serum of patients collected 24 h after survived cardiac arrest was accompanied by increase in leukocyte migration in transwell assays and activation of the BMP pathway most probably by upregulation of endothelial BMP4 RNA and protein expression. Collectively, the present study provides novel evidence that endothelial BMP4 controls leukocyte recruitment through a VE-cadherin-dependent mechanism and that BMP4-induced inflammation might be involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial cell damage following successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors: A nationwide Swedish registry study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Most cardiac arrest (CA) survivors report good health and quality of life. Life satisfaction on the other hand has not yet been studied in a large scale in the CA population. We aimed to explore life satisfaction as perceived by CA survivors with three research questions addressed: (1) how do CA survivors report their life satisfaction, (2) how are different domains of life satisfaction associated with overall life satisfaction, and (3) how are demographic and medical factors associated with overall life satisfaction?Methods: This registry study had a cross-sectional design. Life satisfaction was assessed using the 11-item Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11). The sample included 1435 survivors >= 18 years of age. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were used.Results: Survivors were most satisfied with partner relation (85.6%), family life (82.2%), and self-care (77.8%), while 60.5% were satisfied with overall life. Satisfaction with psychological health was strongest associated with overall life satisfaction. Among medical and demographic factors, female sex and poor cerebral performance were associated with less overall life satisfaction.Conclusions: Generally, CA survivors seem to perceive similar levels of overall life satisfaction as general populations, while survivors tend to be significantly less satisfied with their sexual life. Satisfaction with psychological health is of special interest to identify and treat. Additionally, female survivors and survivors with poor neurological outcome are at risk for poorer overall life satisfaction and need special attention by healthcare professionals.

TI  - Medical Emergency Team syndromes and an approach to their management
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction Most literature on the medical emergency team ( MET) relates to its effects on patient outcome. Less information exists on the most common causes of MET calls or on possible approaches to their management.
   Methods We reviewed the calling criteria and clinical causes of 400 MET calls in a teaching hospital. We propose a set of minimum standards for managing a MET review and developed an approach for managing common problems encountered during MET calls.
   Results The underlying reasons for initiating MET calls were hypoxia (41%), hypotension (28%), altered conscious state (23%), tachycardia (19%), increased respiratory rate (14%) and oliguria (8%). Infection, pulmonary oedema, and arrhythmias featured as prominent causes of all triggers for MET calls. The proposed minimum requirements for managing a MET review included determining the cause of the deterioration, documenting the events surrounding the MET, establishing a medical plan and ongoing medical follow-up, and discussing the case with the intensivist if certain criteria were fulfilled. A systematic approach to managing episodes of MET review was developed based on the acronym 'A to G': ask and assess; begin basic investigations and resuscitation, call for help if needed, discuss, decide, and document, explain aetiology and management, follow-up, and graciously thank staff. This approach was then adapted to provide a management plan for episodes of tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia and dyspnoea, reduced urinary output, and altered conscious state.
   Conclusion A suggested approach permits audit and standardization of the management of MET calls and provides an educational framework for the management of acutely unwell ward patients. Further evaluation and validation of the approach are required.

TI  - Update on critical care for acute spinal cord injury in the setting of polytrauma
T2  - NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) often occurs in patients with concurrent traumatic injuries in other body systems. These patients with polytrauma pose unique challenges to clinicians. The current review evaluates existing guidelines and updates the evidence for prehospital transport, immobilization, initial resuscitation, critical care, hemodynamic stability, diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, and timing appropriate for the patient with SCI who has multisystem trauma. Initial management should be systematic, with focus on spinal immobilization, timely transport, and optimizing perfusion to the spinal cord. There is general evidence for the maintenance of mean arterial pressure of > 85 mm Hg during immediate and acute care to optimize neurological outcome; however, the selection of vasopressor type and duration should be judicious, with considerations for level of injury and risks of increased cardiogenic complications in the elderly. Level II recommendations exist for early decompression, and additional time points of neurological assessment within the first 24 hours and during acute care are warranted to determine the temporality of benefits attributable to early surgery. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended by current guidelines for SCI. For these patients, titration of tidal volumes is important to balance the association of earlier weaning off the ventilator, with its risk of atelectasis, against the risk for lung damage from mechanical overinflation that can occur with prolonged ventilation. Careful evaluation of infection risk is a priority following multisystem trauma for patients with relative immunosuppression or compromise. Although patients with polytrauma may experience longer rehabilitation courses, long-term neurological recovery is generally comparable to that in patients with isolated SCI after controlling for demographics. Bowel and bladder disorders are common following SCI, significantly reduce quality of life, and constitute a focus of targeted therapies. Emerging biomarkers including glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100b, and microRNAs for traumatic SCIs are presented. Systematic management approaches to minimize sources of secondary injury are discussed, and areas requiring further research, implementation, and validation are identified.

TI  - The psychosocial outcomes of anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: This exploratory study aimed to investigate the psychosocial outcomes for cardiac arrest survivors and explore if there is a greater impact on psychosocial outcome for individuals experiencing anoxic brain injury as a result of the cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Self-report measures were used to compare the quality of life, social functioning and symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress of individuals with and without anoxic brain injury. Secondary measures of subjective memory and executive difficulties were also used. Fifty-six participants (27 with anoxia, 29 without anoxia) took part in the study between six months and four years after experiencing cardiac arrest.
   Results: A MANOVA identified a significant difference between the two groups, with the anoxia group reporting more psychosocial difficulties. They reported more social functioning difficulties and more anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. There was, however, no significant difference in self-reported quality of life between the two groups.
   Conclusion: As the first known study to compare psychosocial outcomes for cardiac arrest survivors experiencing anoxic brain injury with those without anoxia, the current results suggest that cardiac arrest survivors with subsequent acquired brain injury experience more psychosocial difficulties. This could be due to a combination of neuropsychological, social and psychological factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - In vivo assessment of the Combat Ready Clamp to control junctional hemorrhage in swine
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Junctional wounds and associated hemorrhage have become more common and more lethal in the current war. The Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC) has been developed and deployed for treating junctional hemorrhage on the battlefield. This study examined the efficacy of CRoC and its acute effects in an animal model.
   METHODS: Anesthetized pigs (n = 6) were subjected to laparotomy, splenectomy, and abdominal closure. Next, coagulopathy was induced in animals by hemodilution and hypothermia. The left femoral artery was isolated, punctured (6-mm hole), and allowed to bleed for 15 seconds. The groin wound was packed with gauze, and a CRoC applied and tightened until hemorrhage stopped. It was kept in place for 1 hour (treatment period) and then released for another hour or less (control-period) if animal exsanguinated. Fluid resuscitation was administered, and vascular blood flow was examined by Doppler and CT scans. After death, local tissues were collected for histology.
   RESULTS: CRoC generated 800 to 900 mm Hg pressure on the wounds, which stopped the hemorrhage and prevented rebleeding during the first hour in all animals. Blood loss was minimal (<= 137 mL), and mean arterial pressure remained at or higher than the target level (65 mm Hg) during this period. Removal of the clamp promptly led to rebleeding and exsanguination of five of six pigs during the second hour despite fluid resuscitation. Blood loss, survival, shock indices, and other measures were significantly (p < 0.01) different between the two periods. Doppler tests and CT scans showed no blood flow in the proximal, distal, and collateral arteries of the clamped leg. Minor inflammation was seen on blood vessels (endothelium) and nerves.
   CONCLUSION: CRoC functioned as an effective hemostatic adjunct for compression and control of groin hemorrhage. Although no acute histological damages were seen in compressed tissues, the short-and long-term effects of CRoC application (e.g., total ischemia) on limb function remain unknown and warrant investigation.

TI  - Management or suspected immediate perioperative allergic reactions: an international overview and consensus recommendations
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
AB  - Suspected perioperative allergic reactions are rare but can be life-threatening. The diagnosis is difficult to make in the perioperative setting, but prompt recognition and correct treatment is necessary to ensure a good outcome. A group of 26 international experts in perioperative allergy (anaesthesiologists, allergists, and immunologists) contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process, which covered areas such as differential diagnosis, management during and after anaphylaxis, allergy investigations, and plans for a subsequent anaesthetic. They were asked to rank the appropriateness of statements related to the immediate management of suspected perioperative allergic reactions. Statements were selected to represent areas where there is a lack of consensus in existing guidelines, such as dosing of epinephrine and fluids, the management of impending cardiac arrest, and reactions refractory to standard treatment. The results of the modified Delphi consensus process have been included in the recommendations on the management of suspected perioperative allergic reactions. This paper provides anaesthetists with an overview of relevant knowledge on the immediate and postoperative management of suspected perioperative allergic reactions based on current literature and expert opinion. In addition, it provides practical advice and recommendations in areas where consensus has been lacking in existing guidelines.

TI  - Study protocol for a randomized trial on timely delivery versus expectant management in late preterm small for gestational age pregnancies with an abnormal umbilicocerebral ratio (UCR): the DRIGITAT study
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: The clinical inability to correctly identify late fetal growth restriction (FGR) within a group of fetuses who are identified as small for gestational age (SGA) is an everyday problem for all obstetrician-gynecologists. This leads to substantial overtreatment of healthy small fetuses but also inadequate detection of the growth-restricted fetuses that may benefit from timely delivery. Redistribution of the fetal circulation, signaled by an abnormal ratio of the Doppler velocity flow profiles of the umbilical artery and the middle cerebral artery, more specifically an increased umbilicocerebral ratio (UCR) (or its inverse: a decreased cerebroplacental ratio (CPR)), is an adaptation to chronic hypoxemia and nutritional scarcity with long-term consequences in survivors. The relevance of an abnormal UCR has been signaled extensively, and there is a general consensus that it is a signal of FGR, independent of size, with a strong association with poor outcomes. Yet, in the current literature, no comparisons of a monitoring-delivery strategy based on unfavorable UCR have been published. The objective of the Doppler Ratio In fetal Growth restriction Intervention Trial At (near) Term (DRIGITAT) is to evaluate if the timing of the delivery based on an abnormal UCR in late preterm fetuses identified as SGA improves neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age.
   Methods: The DRIGITAT study is a national multicenter cohort study of women with singleton pregnancies between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation identified as SGA, with a nested randomized controlled trial (RCT) in case of an abnormal UCR (> 0.8). Recruiting centers are in The Netherlands. In the nested RCT, women are randomized to either immediate induction of labor or expectant management from 34 weeks in case of severely abnormal size (EFW or FAC < p3) and from 36 weeks in case of mildly abnormal size (EFW or FAC p3-p10). The primary outcome measure is the 7-point average difference in the composite cognitive score (CCS) and composite motor score (CMS) on the Bayley-3 at 2 years. Secondary outcome measures include a composite outcome of neonatal morbidity, perinatal mortality, mode of delivery, maternal quality of life, costs, and predictive value of serum biomarkers. Analyses will be by intention to treat. The required sample size is determined for the nested RCT as 185 patients.
   Discussion: This study will provide insight into the diagnostic efficacy of UCR measurement in the evaluation of SGA fetuses in order to differentiate the healthy SGA fetus from the growth-restricted fetus and to determine if a fetus with abnormal UCR benefits from early delivery.

TI  - The outcome of prolonged mechanical ventilation in elderly patients: Are the efforts worthwhile?
T2  - AGE AND AGEING
AB  - We studied the outcome of prolonged (> 3 days) mechanical ventilation in 181 patients aged 70 and over and determined the risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The overall in-hospital mortality for the entire study group was 57.5%. The previous medical history did not influence the final outcome. Shock during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay and an admission diagnosis of cardiac arrest were independently correlated with in-hospital mortality. We conclude that the prognosis for patients aged 70 and over who need prolonged mechanical ventilation is mainly dependent on the acute health status and the occurrence of complications during the ICU admission.

TI  - REGION-SPECIFIC ROLE FOR GLUN2B-CONTAINING NMDA RECEPTORS IN INJURY TO PURKINJE CELLS AND CA1 NEURONS FOLLOWING GLOBAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Motor deficits are present in cardiac arrest survivors and injury to cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) likely contribute to impairments in motor coordination and post-hypoxic myoclonus. N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor- mediated excitotoxicity is a well-established mechanism of cell death in several brain regions, but the role of NMDA receptors in PC injury remains understudied. Emerging data in cortical and hippocampal neurons indicate that the GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors signal to improve cell survival and GluN2B-containing receptors contribute to neuronal injury. This study compared neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 region to that in PCs and investigated the role of NMDA receptors in PC injury in our mouse model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Analysis of cell density demonstrated a 24% loss of PCs within 24 h after 8 min CA/CPR and injury stabilized to 33% by 7 days. The subunit promiscuous NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 protected both CA1 neurons and PCs from ischemic injury following CA/CPR, demonstrating a role for NMDA receptor activation in injury to both brain regions. In contrast, the GluN2B antagonist, Co 101244, had no effect on PC loss while protecting against injury in the CA1 region. These data indicate that ischemic injury to cerebellar PCs progresses via different cell death mechanisms compared to hippocampal CA1 neurons. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Can catheter ablation in cardiac arrest survivors prevent ventricular fibrillation recurrence?
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are the most common cause for sudden cardiac death. The success of catheter ablation for supraventricular tachycardias led to the supposition that ablation could also be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias. Despite the promising results in bundle branch reentry and some forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, the success rate in patients with coronary artery disease is still low. There is hope that new approaches to reliably localize the critical region of the tachycardia and new ablation techniques to create larger areas of injury may lead to a wider application of ablation therapy in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. Survivors of cardiac arrest typically have more rapid and unstable arrhythmias than patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, and these rapid arrhythmias frequently degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. The instability of the arrhythmia makes it impossible to localize the arrhythmia origin with current mapping techniques. Experimental and clinical data, however, suggest that these arrhythmias also frequently start from a localized area of electrical activation. With developments in mapping techniques and energy delivery, catheter ablation may soon become a feasible therapeutic approach in some patients with unstable arrhythmias. The article discusses the prerequisites for this approach and suggests the patients who may be appropriate candidates for this technique.

TI  - "If You Look Closely, You Have Everything …": Ideas of a Good Life Among Middle-Aged Individuals With Heart Disease: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - Heart disease at an early or middle age is critical, especially when accompanied by an acute cardiac event with or without sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Owing to this situation, patients describe changes in their health-related quality of life as well as in their future plans and goals. This study examined changes in ideas of a good life due to heart disease treated in an acute hospital. In our study, 16 patients aged 30-59 years were included. Among them, four had SCA, seven myocardial infarction, and five other serious cardiac conditions, such as cardiac arrhythmia. Advanced chronic heart failure was noted in five, and four had implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Phenomenological semi-structured interviews of 50-100 min each were conducted with a purposive sample and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The ideas of a good life and changes in future lifestyle following a serious heart disease were reported by patients. These experiences were summarized into five superordinate themes: "My bodily trust is gone," "Simply living a modest life," "Actively shaping my life again," "Being more in contact with relevant people," and "Grateful for the gift of my new life." Living a more modest life and actively shaping life again are two new aspects of the ideas of a good life. Further studies should be conducted in cardiac patients with lower disease burden and young patients with congenital heart disease, with a focus on sex-specific issues.

TI  - Intravenous infusion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells improves brain function after resuscitation from cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 9th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary
AB  - Objective: Allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were previously shown to improve myocardial function when administered intravenously after resuscitation from cardiac arrest in rats. Coincidental evidence of improved brain function prompted the present study.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.
   Setting: University-affiliated research institute.
   Subjects: Male Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Interventions: Using an established model in 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats in which 6 mins of untreated cardiac arrest was followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation, animals were randomized to receive 5 x 10(6) mesenchymal stem cells labeled with PKH26 in phosphate buffer solution or phosphate buffer solution alone as a placebo at 2 hrs after restoration of spontaneous circulation. The stem cells or buffer diluent were injected into a catheter advanced from the jugular vein into the right atrium.
   Measurements and Main Results: Outcome measurements in addition to 35-day survival included somatosensor testing of capability for removal of an adhesive patch applied to both front paws, testing of motor function using a rotating cylinder, and observational scoring of the severity of neurologic impairment. Labeled mesenchymal stem cells were subsequently identified and counted in 5 mu m sections obtained from defined sites in the harvested brain. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify neural cells differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Adhesive removal, motor function test, neurologic severity score, and 35-day survival were each significantly improved in comparison with control animals. Labeled mesenchymal stem cells were identified in the hippocampus, cortex, pons, medulla, and cerebellum and expressed protein markers phenotypic neural cells.
   Conclusions: Mesenchymal stem cells injected into the right atrium of rats after resuscitation from cardiac arrest were identified in brains harvested 35 days later. Brain function was significantly improved. Accordingly, venous injection of mesenchymal stem cells after cardiopulmonary resuscitation has promise of minimizing the severity of postresuscitation neurologic impairment.

TI  - Ethical challenges in resuscitation
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - A rapidly evolving resuscitation science provides more effective treatments to an aging population with multiple comorbidites. Concurrently, emergency care has become patient-centered. This review aims to describe challenges associated with the application of key principles of bioethics in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care; propose actions to address these challenges; and highlight the need for evidence-based ethics and consensus on ethical principles interpretation.
   Following agreement on the article's outline, subgroups of 2-3 authors provided narrative reviews of ethical issues concerning autonomy and honesty, beneficence/nonmaleficence and dignity, justice, specific practices/circumstances such as family presence during resuscitation, and emergency research. Proposals for addressing ethical challenges were also offered.
   Respect for patient autonomy can be realized through honest provision of information, shared decision-making, and advance directives/care planning. Essential prerequisites comprise public and specific healthcare professionals' education, appropriate regulatory provisions, and allocation of adequate resources. Regarding beneficence/nonmaleficence, resuscitation should benefit patients, while avoiding harm from futile interventions; pertinent practice should be based on neurological prognostication and patient/family-reported outcomes. Regarding dignity, aggressive life-sustaining treatments against patients preferences should be avoided. Contrary to the principle of justice, resuscitation quality may be affected by race/income status, age, ethnicity, comorbidity, and location (urban versus rural or country-specific/region-specific). Current evidence supports family presence during resuscitation. Regarding emergency research, autonomy should be respected without hindering scientific progress; furthermore, transparency of research conduct should be promoted and funding increased.
   Major ethical challenges in resuscitation science need to be addressed through complex/resource-demanding interventions. Such actions require support by ongoing/future research.

TI  - Mechanistic Wager on Outcome in Coma After Cardiac Arrest: The EEG Signature in Burst Suppression Provides Some Clues
T2  - EPILEPSY CURRENTS
AB  - Objective:
   Survivors of prolonged (>2 weeks) post-cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post-CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post-CA patients.
   Methods:
   We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17-37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post-CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.
   Results:
   All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (similar to 4-7 Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time.
   Interpretation:
   Burst suppression patterns with theta (similar to 4-7 Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post-CA coma.

TI  - Ethical and legal issues in late stage of dementia
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
AB  - As we enter the 21st century, growth of the elderly population, the costs of care, and the advances of medical science and technology will continue to have an impact on the patient- physician relationship. Transformation of the health care system will also raise ethical issues inherent to changing roles. The special nature of Alzheimer's patients and the natural course of their disease require special care on the part of physicians to meet the ethical challenges and establish medical goals, in conjunction with their patients and their families.
   In spite of these rapid advances in biomedical sciences, were not sufficiently developed in the most fitness answers, regarding special moral and ethical attitudes, which must be taken into account, in particular when we try to understand the experience of people with dementia.
   This article explores emerging issues in relation to awareness in dementia and its impact on legal and ethical matters. The different approaches and principles demonstrated in relation to ethical issues are discussed, with an exploration of the concepts of mental capacity, testamentary capacity, power of attorney, court of protection, advance directives, decision making, participation in research and treatment, informed consent and older people driving. The tensions that exist between the imperatives of doing no harm and of maintaining autonomy in addressing legal and ethical issues are highlighted. The review emphasizes the importance of considering competency and awareness as being multi- faceted, to be understood in the context of social interaction, trying to deal with the challenge of protecting, but not overprotecting, people with dementia. Late stage of dementia is a terminal disease where the goal of the care may not be prolongation of life at all costs, but rather achievement: quality of life, dignity and comfort.
   In the initial late dementia, quality of life is the target, treating medical problems and psychiatric symptoms. The dignity of people with severe dementia will be preserved, mostly when this influences patient's behaviour, maximizing individual independence in daily living activities. Finally, comfort is the last and the most important goal of care in late stages of dementia, using appropriate medical strategies and eliminating aggressive interventions ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute care setting, tube feeding and antibiotic treatment).
   The future work will focus on promoting more evidence- based decision- making on treatment and guidelines for prognostic information. Physician must be knowledgeable about broadly intersecting medical, legal, finance and ethics, underlying the long- term management of dementia.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for near fatal asthma with sudden cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASTHMA
AB  - Introduction:Near fatal asthma is a life-threatening disorder that requires mechanical ventilation. Near fatal asthma and COPD with sudden cardiac arrest can worsen the outcomes. Previous studies demonstrated that ECMO is a live-saving measure for near fatal asthma that does not respond to traditional treatment. Case study:A patient with near fatal asthma (NFA) and COPD presented with high airway resistance, life-threatening acidemia and severe hypoxemia that failed to respond to conventional therapy. His hospital course was complicated by sudden cardiac arrest when preparing to initiate V-V mode extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The mode immediately changed from V-V to V-A, then to V-AV and finally to V-V mode in order to improve cardiac function and promote recovery of lung function. Results:On the sixth day, ECMO was removed and on the ninth day, he was extubated and transferred to the ward. Finally, the patient was discharged home on the nineteenth day after admission to be followed up in the pulmonary clinic. Conclusions:The early application of ECMO and mode changing plausibly resulted in dramatic improvement in gas exchange and restoration of cardiac function. This case illustrates the critical role of ECMO mode changing as salvage therapy in NFA and COPD with sudden cardiac arrest.

TI  - Sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition during ventricular fibrillation - Beneficial effects on ischemic contracture, action potential duration, reperfusion arrhythmias, myocardial function, and resuscitability
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Inhibition of the sarcolemmal sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) is emerging as a promising novel strategy for ameliorating myocardial injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion. We investigated whether NHE-1 inhibition (with cariporide) could minimize mechanical and electrical myocardial abnormalities that develop during ventricular fibrillation (VF) and improve outcome using a porcine model of closed-chest resuscitation.
   Methods and Results-Two groups of 8 pigs each were subjected to 8 minutes of untreated VF and randomized to receive either a 3-mg/kg bolus of cariporide or 0.9% NaCl immediately before an 8-minute interval of conventional closed-chest resuscitation. Cariporide prevented progressive increases in left ventricular free-wall thickness (from 1.0+/-0.2 to 1.5+/-0.3 cm with NaCl, P<0.001 versus 0.9+/-0.1 to 1.1+/-0.3 cm with cariporide, P=NS), maintained the coronary perfusion pressure above resuscitability thresholds (10+/-8 versus 19+/-3 mm Hg before attempting defibrillation, P<0.05), and increased resuscitability (2 of 8 versus 8 of 8, P<0.005). In 2 additional groups of 4 pigs each subjected to a briefer interval of untreated VF, cariporide ameliorated postresuscitation shortening of the action potential duration (APD) at 30%, 60%, and 90% repolarization (ie, APD(60) at 2 minutes after resuscitation; 75+/-29 versus 226+/-16 ms, P<0.05), minimized postresuscitation ventricular ectopic activity preventing recurrent VF, and lessened postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.
   Conclusions-NHE-1 inhibition may represent a highly potent novel strategy for resuscitation from VF that can ameliorate myocardial manifestations of ischemic injury and improve the effectiveness and outcome of closed-chest resuscitation.

TI  - The Danish National Child Health Register
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Aim of the Database: The aim of the National Child Health Registry is to provide comprehensive insight into children's health and growth on a national scale by continuously monitoring the health status of Danish children. Through this effort, the registry assists the health authorities in prioritizing preventive efforts to promote better child health outcomes.Study Population: The registry includes all Danish children, however, incomplete coverage persists.Main Variables: The National Child Health Registry contains information on exposure to secondhand smoking, breastfeeding duration, and anthropometric measurements through childhood. The information in the registry is divided into three datasets: Smoking, Breastfeeding, and Measurements. Beside specific information on the three topics, all datasets include information on CPR-number, date of birth, sex, municipality, and region of residence. Database Status: The National Child Health Registry was established in 2009 and contains health information on children from all Danish municipalities, collected through routinely performed health examinations conducted by general practitioners and health nurses. Conclusion: The National Child Health Register is an asset to epidemiological and health research with nationwide information on children's health and growth in Denmark. Due to the unique Danish Civil Registration System, it is possible to link data from the National Child Health Register to information from several other national health and social registers which enables longitudinal unambiguous follow-up.

TI  - Symptom Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression in Older Cardiac Arrest Survivors: A Comparative Nationwide Register Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Knowledge about psychological distress in older cardiac arrest (CA) survivors is sparse, and the lack of comparisons with general populations make it difficult to draw any strong conclusions about prevalence and potential changes caused by CA. Our aim was to compare psychological distress between older CA survivors and a general population. This study included survivors 65-80 years old and an age- and sex-matched general population. Data on survivors was collected from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to measure psychological distress. Data were analyzed with non-parametric statistics. The final sample included 1027 CA survivors and 1018 persons from the general population. In both groups, the mean age was 72 years (SD = 4) and 28% were women. The prevalence of anxiety was 9.9% for survivors and 9.5% for the general population, while the corresponding prevalence for depression was 11.3% and 11.5% respectively. Using the cut-off scores, no significant differences between the groups were detected. However, CA survivors reported significantly lower symptom levels using the subscale scores (Delta Mdn = 1, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the CA survivors did not report higher symptom levels of anxiety and depression than the general population. However, since psychological distress is related to poor quality-of-life and recovery, screening for psychological distress remains important.

TI  - Outcomes Following Single and Recurrent In-Hospital Cardiac Arrests in Children With Heart Disease: A Report From American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines Registry-Resuscitation
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Little is known regarding patient characteristics and outcomes associated with cardiac arrest in hospitalized children with underlying heart disease. We described clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in cardiac patients with both single and recurrent cardiac arrests.
   Design: Retrospective analysis evaluating characteristics and outcomes in single versus recurrent arrest groups in unadjusted and adjusted analyses.
   Setting: American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines-Resuscitation registry (2000-2010).
   Patients: Children younger than 18 years, identified with medical or surgical cardiac disease and one or more in-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurement and Main Results: One thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine patients with 2,387 cardiac arrests from 157 centers met inclusion criteria: 1,546 (82%) with a single arrest and 343 (18%) with a recurrent arrest. More than two thirds of recurrent cardiac arrests occurred in ICUs, and those with recurrent arrest had a higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities (e. g., more likely to be mechanically ventilated and receiving vasoactive infusions). Overall survival to hospital discharge was 51%, and was lower in the recurrent versus single arrest group (41% vs 53%; p < 0.001). In analysis adjusted for baseline comorbidities, there was no longer a statistically significant association between recurrent arrest and survival (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.33-1.63; p = 0.45). In stratified analysis, the relationship between recurrent arrest and lower survival was more prominent in the surgical-cardiac (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.14-1.11; p = 0.09) versus medical-cardiac (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.28-3.30; p = 0.95) group.
   Conclusions: In this large multicenter study, half of pediatric cardiac patients who suffered a cardiac arrest survived to hospital discharge. Lower survival in the group with recurrent arrest may be explained in part by the higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities in these patients, and surgical cardiac patients appeared to be at greatest risk. Further study is necessary to develop strategies to reduce subsequent mortality in these high-risk patients.

TI  - Nanoparticulate CpG Immunotherapy in RAO- Affected Horses: Phase I and IIa Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Recurrent airway obstruction ( RAO), an asthma- like disease, is 1 of the most common allergic diseases in horses in the northern hemisphere. Hypersensitivity reactions to environmental antigens cause an allergic inflammatory response in the equine airways. Cytosine- phosphate- guanosine- oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG- ODN) are known to direct the immune system toward a Th1- pathway, and away from the pro- allergic Th2- line ( Th2/ Th1- shift). Gelatin nanoparticles ( GNPs) are biocompatible and biodegradable immunological inert drug delivery systems that protect CpG- ODN against nuclease degeneration. Preliminary studies on the inhalation of GNP- bound CpG- ODN in RAO- affected horses have shown promising results. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of GNP- bound CpG- ODN in a double- blinded, placebo- controlled, prospective, randomized clinical trial and to verify a sustained effect post- treatment. Animals and Methods: Twenty- four RAO- affected horses received 1 inhalation every 2 days for 5 consecutive administrations. Horses were examined for clinical, endoscopic, cytological, and blood biochemical variables before the inhalation regimen ( I), immediately afterwards ( II), and 4 weeks post- treatment ( III). Results: At time points I and II, administration of treatment rather than placebo corresponded to a statistically significant decrease in respiratory effort, nasal discharge, tracheal secretion, and viscosity, AaDO2 and neutrophil percentage, and an increase in arterial oxygen pressure. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Administration of a GNP- bound CpG- ODN formulation caused a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory- induced clinical variables in RAO- affected horses. This treatment, therefore, provides an innovative, promising, and well- tolerated strategy beyond conventional symptomatic long- term therapy and could serve as a model for asthma treatment in humans.

TI  - Higher versus lower fractions of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the intensive care unit
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   This is an updated review concerning 'Higher versus lower fractions of inspired oxygen or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the intensive care unit'.
   Supplementary oxygen is provided to most patients in intensive care units (ICUs) to prevent global and organ hypoxia (inadequate oxygen levels). Oxygen has been administered liberally, resulting in high proportions of patients with hyperoxemia (exposure of tissues to abnormally high concentrations of oxygen). This has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity in some settings, but not in others. Thus far, only limited data have been available to inform clinical practice guidelines, and the optimum oxygenation target for ICU patients is uncertain. Because of the publication of new trial evidence, we have updated this review.
   Objectives
   To update the assessment of benefits and harms of higher versus lower fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) or targets of arterial oxygenation for adults admitted to the ICU.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS Previews, and LILACS. We searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trial registers and scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials. Literature searches for this updated review were conducted in November 2022.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared higher versus lower FiO(2) or targets of arterial oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), peripheral or arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2) or SaO(2))) for adults admitted to the ICU. We included trials irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language.
   We excluded trials randomising participants to hypoxaemia (FiO(2) below 0.21, SaO(2)/SpO(2) below 80%, or PaO2 below 6 kPa) or to hyperbaric oxygen, and cross-over trials and quasi-randomised trials.
   Data collection and analysis
   Four review authors independently, and in pairs, screened the references identified in the literature searches and extracted the data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events (SAEs), and quality of life. We analysed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. Only three trials reported the proportion of participants with one or more SAEs as a composite outcome. However, most trials reported on events categorised as SAEs according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) criteria. We, therefore, conducted two analyses of the effect of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies using 1) the single SAE with the highest reported proportion in each trial, and 2) the cumulated proportion of participants with an SAE in each trial. Two trials reported on quality of life.
   Secondary outcomes were lung injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis. No trial reported on lung injury as a composite outcome, but four trials reported on the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and five on pneumonia. We, therefore, conducted two analyses of the effect of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies using 1) the single lung injury event with the highest reported proportion in each trial, and 2) the cumulated proportion of participants with ARDS or pneumonia in each trial.
   We assessed the risk of systematic errors by evaluating the risk of bias in the included trials using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. We used the GRADEpro tool to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. We also evaluated the risk of publication bias for outcomes reported by 10b or more trials.
   Main results
   We included 19 RCTs (10,385 participants), of which 17 reported relevant outcomes for this review (10,248 participants). For all-cause mortality, 10 trials were judged to be at overall low risk of bias, and six at overall high risk of bias. For the reported SAEs, 10 trials were judged to be at overall low risk of bias, and seven at overall high risk of bias. Two trials reported on quality of life, of which one was judged to be at overall low risk of bias and one at high risk of bias for this outcome.
   Meta-analysis of all trials, regardless of risk of bias, indicated no significant difference from higher or lower oxygenation strategies at maximum follow-up with regard to mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (C)I 0.96 to 1.06; I-2 = 14%; 16 trials; 9408 participants; very low-certainty evidence); occurrence of SAEs: the highest proportion of any specific SAE in each trial RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.06; I-2 = 36%; 9466 participants; 17 trials; very low-certainty evidence), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.5 points in participants assigned to higher oxygenation strategies (95% CI -2.75 to 1.75; I-2 = 34%, 1649 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence)). Meta-analysis of the cumulated number of SAEs suggested benefit of a lower oxygenation strategy (RR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.07; I-2 = 74%; 9489 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty evidence)). However, trial sequential analyses, with correction for sparse data and repetitive testing, could reject a relative risk increase or reduction of 10% for mortality and the highest proportion of SAEs, and 20% for both the cumulated number of SAEs and quality of life. Given the very low-certainty of evidence, it is necessary to interpret these findings with caution.
   Meta-analysis of all trials indicated no statistically significant evidence of a difference between higher or lower oxygenation strategies on the occurrence of lung injuries at maximum follow-up (the highest reported proportion of lung injury RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.38; I-2 = 0%; 2048 participants; 8 trials; very low-certainty evidence).
   Meta-analysis of all trials indicated harm from higher oxygenation strategies as compared with lower on the occurrence of sepsis at maximum follow-up (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.93; I-2 = 0%; 752 participants; 3 trials; very low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis indicated no differences regarding the occurrences of myocardial infarction or stroke.
   Authors' conclusions
   In adult ICU patients, it is still not possible to draw clear conclusions about the effects of higher versus lower oxygenation strategies on all-cause mortality, SAEs, quality of life, lung injuries, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis at maximum follow-up. This is due to low or very low-certainty evidence.

TI  - Complex Limb Injuries: Limb Salvage Versus Amputation-A Mini Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - ADVANCES IN ORTHOPEDICS
AB  - Introduction: The management of complex limb injuries can be very challenging, and it demands a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Amputation and limb reconstruction are the two options that clinicians must choose. This study aims to comprehensively synthesize existing tools and resources from the literature that can assist clinicians in the decision-making process.Evaluation: The initial resuscitation and the prehospital care are the first important steps in the management of these injuries, while the immediate transfer to trauma centers is recommended for complex cases. After the stabilization of the patient, a thorough clinical examination of the limb is necessary with emphasis on the degree of soft tissue damage. Blunt trauma in the lower limb is associated with a higher risk of early amputation. Polytrauma patients with complex limb injuries require a holistic approach, with Damage Control Orthopedics (DCO) principles. Traumatic bleeding significantly increases mortality rates, necessitating prompt control using pressure bandages or tourniquets. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is necessary in order to assess the viability of the limb.Management: Scoring systems can be used as a tool in the management of complex lower and upper limb injuries. Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) calculates ischemia, shock, bone and soft tissue damage, and patient characteristics. The Narakawa Index (NISSSA score) constitutes an alteration of MESS with the implementation of a nerve injury element. The Musculoskeletal Score for Severity of Injury (MESI score) estimates the risk of limb amputation by evaluating injury, neurovascular damage, type of fracture, patient characteristics, and the period from the occurrence of trauma to the definitive treatment. Further interventions and patient preferences should be incorporated into the decision-making process.Outcome: The outcomes of limb salvage versus amputation for complex limb injuries encompass various factors, including patient's preinjury health status, psychological well-being, functional outcomes, and economic impact. While some studies suggest better psychological outcomes with limb reconstruction and others find similar functional outcomes between the two approaches, economic considerations play a significant role in decision-making.Conclusion: Managing complex limb injuries effectively necessitates a comprehensive approach involving thorough assessment, multidisciplinary collaboration, and patient-centered care. Given the diverse factors influencing management and long-term outcomes, it is crucial to integrate medical expertise with patient preferences and expectations.

TI  - AVAILABILITY AND USE OF AN AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR AT EMERGENCY MEDICAL DISPATCH
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of automatic external defibrillator (AED) retrieval and placement by bystander callers when prompted by an Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD). Methods: This retrospective descriptive study utilized a convenience sample of emergency dispatch data collected from 23 Emergency Communication Centers (ECCs) spanning 14 states across the United States (U.S.) from July 11, 2014 to August 13, 2018, including all cases in which the EMD recorded any response to the AED availability prompt. Data were collected using ProQA, the software version of the Medical Priority Dispatch System. Primary outcome measures were (a) distribution of responses to the AED prompt; (b) percentage of cases in which an AED was retrieved; and (c) percentage of cases in which AED pads were placed by the bystander-caller. Results: A total of 2,200,285 cases were collected during the study period, in 18,904 (0.86%) of which the AED prompt was displayed (indicating suspected out of hospital cardiac arrest, or OHCA). Overall, an AED was reported as available 5.8% (n = 1,091) of the time the EMD recorded an answer to the AED prompt. In multiple-rescuer situations, a rescuer was sent to get the AED 2.8% (n = 523) of the time, as opposed to only 0.30% (n = 56) for single-rescuer calls. The AED was reported to be already on scene, by the patient, in 2.7% (n = 512) of the cases. A majority (72.0%; n = 417) of the time, rescuers who were sent to get an AED were unable to retrieve it, with single rescuers being successful more often (57.1% unable to retrieve, vs 73.6% for multiple rescuers). Conclusions: AEDs are reported as available by only a small percentage of callers to 911, and in the majority of cases in which a bystander rescuer is sent to retrieve an AED, one is never located or used. Sending someone to retrieve the AED may be more appropriate in multiple-rescuer situations than when a single bystander rescuer is alone on scene.

TI  - Local fishery, global commodity: the role of institutions in mediating intersectoral conflict, cooperation, and competition in a globalized fishery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Commons scholarship has improved our understanding of how to govern resources for sustainability. However, it has also been critiqued for its focus on traits (e.g. well-defined system boundaries) that are increasingly threatened by social and environmental trends. Fisheries are a key example of this challenge. While small-scale fisheries are critically important to the diets and livelihoods of millions, industrial fisheries from developed countries now dominate fishing around the world. While these two systems are governed separately, there is substantial overlap between them, conceptualized as the growing influence of globalization on local common pool resource (CPR) systems. One of the most impactful, but least understood consequences of this convergence are the emerging conflicts and competition between small-scale and industrial fisheries. In these systems, the interaction between small-scale CPRs and globalized commodity chains has meant the creation of a new, hybrid resource system, addressed by neither conventional industrial nor traditional small-scale governance approaches. We use empirical data from 396 cases of interactions at sea between globalized industrial and local small-scale fishers in Ghana from 1984 to 2013 to examine the conditions under which resource users conflict or cooperate, linking them to broader political and economic dynamics across scales. We consider the institutional factors that mediate these interactions, identifying policies to promote cooperative, and avert conflictual incidents. We further consider the long-term effects of these patterns of conflict and cooperation for the resilience or vulnerability of the resource base, the fishers, and the institutions governing the system. We suggest that specific governance arrangements that reduce disparities between groups, promote bridging social capital, and enhance hybrid and cross-scale institutions offer the best potential to govern resource systems where traditional CPRs and market-oriented industries converge.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of implantable defibrillator as first-choice therapy versus electrophysiologically guided, tiered strategy in postinfarct sudden death survivors - A randomized study
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background Rising costs of health care, partly as a result of costly therapeutic innovations, are of concern to both the medical profession and healthcare authorities. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or (ICD) is still not remunerated by Dutch healthcare insurers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of early implantation of the ICD in postinfarct sudden death survivors.
   Methods and Results Sixty consecutive postinfarct survivors of cardiac arrest caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation were randomly assigned either ICD as first choice (n=29) or a tiered therapy starting with antiarrhythmic drugs and guided by electrophysiological (EP) testing (n=31). Median follow-up was 729 days (range, 3 to 1675 days). Fifteen patients died, 4 in the early ICD group and 11 in the EP-guided strategy group (P=.07). For quantitative assessment, the cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for both groups and expressed as median total costs per patient per day alive. Because effectiveness aspects other than mortality are not incorporated in this ratio, other factors related to quality of life were used as qualitative measures of cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness ratios were $63 and $94 for the early ICD and EP-guided strategy groups, respectively, per patient per day alive. This amounts to a net cost-effectiveness of $11 315 per patient per year alive saved by early ICD implantation. Costs in the early ICD group were higher only during the first 3 months of followup, but as a result of the high proportion of therapy changes, including arrhythmia surgery and late ICD implantation, costs in the EP-guided strategy group became higher after that. Patients discharged with antiarrhythmic drugs as sole therapy had the lowest total costs. This subset, however, showed extremely high mortality, resulting in a poor cost-effectiveness ratio ($196 per day). Invasive therapies and hospitalization were the major contributors to costs. If quality-of-life measures are taken into account, the cost-effectiveness of early ICD implantation was even more favorable. Recurrent cardiac arrest and cardiac transplantation occurred in the EP-guided strategy group only, whereas exercise tolerance, total hospitalization duration, number of invasive procedures, and antiarrhythmic therapy changes were significantly in favor of early ICD implantation.
   Conclusions In terms of cost-effectiveness, early ICD implantation is superior to the EP-guided therapeutic strategy in postinfarct sudden death survivors.

TI  - NEO-SAFE: a clinical model for patients and healthcare personnel safety in primary level hospitals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB  - Patient safety is a major concern in medicine. Approximately, 4 million infants die each year worldwide and 23% of these deaths are caused by perinatal asphyxia. To prevent the long-term damage of asphyxia, the resuscitation flowchart must be perfectly and promptly performed. However, high effectiveness in performing resuscitation can only be achieved and maintained if the algorithm is frequently executed. Therefore, maintaining a high level of patient care is difficult in some remote centres. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new organizational model of care-network between Hub & Spoke hospitals to improve both the safety of the newborns in hospitals with a low number of births and the well-being of operators. Our project, NEO-SAFE (NEOnatal SAFety and training Elba), began in 2017 and involved the neonatal intensive care unit and the NINA Center of the Pisa University Hospital (hub) and the Hospital of Elba Island (spoke). It consisted of a continuous training program, both with 'classic' training course and 'on-job tutoring' (on side and remotely), of the health workers at spoke (i.e. nurses, midwives, and paediatricians). All four milestones of the study design were achieved. During the project, NINA Center instructors organized training courses for the staff in Portoferraio. These courses were based on learning technical and non-technical skills in a training course of increasing difficulty. Staff training needs were also monitored during the project by means of periodic questionnaires, sentinel events, and specific requests. The curve described by the rate of newborns transfer to the Pisa neonatal intensive care unit (hub) shows a monotonous decreasing trend line. On the other hand, this project allowed operators to develop greater self-confidence and greater safety in managing emergency situations, reducing stress for them and improving patient safety. The project allowed the creation of a safe, effective, low-cost, and reproducible organizational model for centres with a low number of births. Moreover, the tele-medicine approach is an important improvement in the assistance and is a window on the future.

TI  - Ambulatory Pulse Wave Velocity Is a Stronger Predictor of Cardiovascular Events and All-Cause Mortality Than Office and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Hemodialysis Patients
T2  - HYPERTENSION
AB  - Arterial stiffness and augmentation of aortic blood pressure (BP) measured in office are known cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. This study examines the prognostic significance of ambulatory brachial BP, central BP, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and heart rate-adjusted augmentation index [AIx(75)] in this population. A total of 170 hemodialysis patients underwent 48-hour ambulatory monitoring with Mobil-O-Graph-NG during a standard interdialytic interval and followed-up for 28.1 +/- 11.2 months. The primary end point was a combination of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) cardiovascular mortality; and (3) a combination of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. During follow-up, 37(21.8%) patients died and 46(27.1%) had cardiovascular events. Cumulative freedom from primary end point was similar for quartiles of predialysis-systolic BP (SBP), 48-hour peripheral-SBP, and central-SBP, but was progressively longer for increasing quartiles for 48-hour peripheral-diastolic BP and central-diastolic BP and shorter for increasing quartiles of 48-hour central pulse pressure (83.7%, 71.4%, 69.0%, 62.8% [log-rank P=0.024]), PWV (93.0%, 81.0%, 57.1%, 55.8% [log-rank P< 0.001]), and AIx(75) (88.4%, 66.7%, 69.0%, 62.8% [log-rank P=0.014]). The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and the combined outcome were similar for quartiles of predialysis-SBP, 48-hour peripheral-SBP, and central-SBP, but were increasing with higher ambulatory PWV and AIx(75). In multivariate analysis, 48-hour PWV was the only vascular parameter independently associated with the primary end point (hazard ratios, 1.579; 95% confidence intervals, 1.187-2.102). Ambulatory PWV, AIx(75), and central pulse pressure are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, whereas office and ambulatory SBP are not. These findings further support that arterial stiffness is the prominent cardiovascular risk factor in hemodialysis.

TI  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AFTER CARDIAC ARREST: INVOLVEMENT OF THE RISK PATHWAY IN MITOCHONDRIAL PTP-MEDIATED NEUROPROTECTION
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia is neuroprotective after cardiac arrest (CA) via poorly understood mechanisms. It may prevent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, an event which plays a pivotal role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. PTP is the main end-effector of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) signaling pathway. We hypothesized that therapeutic hypothermia activates the RISK pathway, thereby preventing PTP opening and its deleterious neurological consequences after CA. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 15 min of CA and 120 min of reperfusion: Control, HT (hypothermia at 32 degrees-34 degrees C), NIM (specific PTP inhibition with N-methyl-4-isoleucine-cyclosporine at the onset of reperfusion), and HT+NIM. A Sham group only underwent surgery. The following measurements were taken: pupillary reflexes and brain damage biomarkers (NSE and S100 beta), RISK pathway activation in brain cortex (total and phosphorylated forms of both protein kinase B [Akt] and extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]) and PTP opening in isolated brain mitochondria. Therapeutic hypothermia and pharmacological PTP inhibition preserved the pupillary reflexes and prevented the increase in both NSE and S100 beta (P < 0.05 vs. controls). These two interventions also enhanced (P < 0.05 vs. controls) the phospho-Akt/Akt ratio to a similar extent while preventing a CA-induced increase in phospho-ERK/ERK ratio. This Akt activation in the HT and NIM groups was associated with an attenuation of CA-induced PTP opening. In this model, therapeutic hypothermia promoted the activation of the RISK signaling pathway via Akt and limited CA-induced brain injury by preventing PTP opening.

TI  - Sudden Cardiac Arrest at the Finish Line: In Coronary Ectopia, the Cause of Ischemia Is from Intramural Course, Not Ostial Location
T2  - TEXAS HEART INSTITUTE JOURNAL
AB  - A 26-year-old woman, a well-trained runner, had a sudden cardiac arrest just before crossing the finish line of a marathon. She was rapidly resuscitated and was later found to have an ectopic origin of the left coronary artery. This anomaly was surgically repaired by translocating the ostium from the right to the left sinus of Valsalva. Her difficult postoperative course prompted further coronary evaluation, which revealed severe stenosis of the neo-ostium. The patient underwent a second operation: this time, the stenosis was bypassed via a left internal mammary artery-to-left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) graft. Hypoplasia of the LAD and spasm during manipulation caused the graft to fail, necessitating double-stent angioplasty of the left main ostium and the LAD 2 months later. At the patient's 6-month follow-up examination, she had no further evidence of functional ischemia, and she resumed jogging.
   Because the mode and mechanism of the patient's condition and events were documented in unusual detail, this case furthers our understanding of sudden cardiac arrest in athletes who have rare coronary anomalies. We conclude that ectopia of a coronary artery does not itself cause potentially fatal ischemia. Rather, these events are due to the ectopic artery's intramural proximal course within the aortic media, which might result in critical stenosis by means of hypoplasia or lateral compression of the artery.

TI  - Personalising Outcomes after Child Cardiac Arrest (POCCA): design and recruitment challenges of a multicentre, observational study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Blood and imaging biomarkers show promise in prognosticating outcomes after paediatric cardiac arrest in pilot studies. We describe the methods and early recruitment challenges and solutions for an ongoing multicentre (n=14) observational trial, Personalising Outcomes following Child Cardiac Arrest to validate clinical, blood and imaging biomarkers individually and together in a clinically relevant panel.
   Methods and analysis Children (n=164) between 48 hours and 17 years of age who receive chest compressions irrespective of provider, duration, or event location and are admitted to an intensive care unit are eligible. Blood samples will be taken on days 1-3 for the measurement of brain-focused biomarkers analysed to predict the outcome. Clinically indicated and timed brain MRI and spectroscopy biomarkers will be analysed to predict the outcome. The primary outcome for the trial is survival with favourable (Vineland Adaptive Behavioural Scale score >70) outcome at 1 year. Secondary outcomes include mortality and pre-event and postdischarge measures of emotional, cognitive, physical and family functioning and health-related quality of life. Early enrollment targets were not met due to prolonged regulatory and subcontract processes. Multiple, simultaneous interventions including modification to inclusion criteria, additional sites and site visits were implemented with successful improvement in recruitment. Study procedures including outcomes and biomarker analysis are ongoing.
   Ethics and dissemination Twelve of 14 sites will use the centralised Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pittsburgh (PRO14030712). Two sites will use individual IRBs: Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Institutional Review Board and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin IRB. Parents and/or guardians are consented and children assented (when possible) by the site Primary investigator (PI) or research coordinator for enrollment. Study findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, peer-reviewed journal publications, public study website materials and invited lectures.

TI  - CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE RESEARCH IN ACUTE TRAUMA RESUSCITATION: CONSENT AND ENDPOINTS
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Selection of study endpoints is one of the most important decisions in the design of effective clinical trials. Late mortality (e. g., 28 days) is an unambiguous endpoint, accepted by regulatory agencies, but it is viewed as problematic among researchers in the study of resuscitation for acute trauma injury with hemorrhagic shock. In February 2008, physicians, ethicists, statisticians, and research scientists from the military, academia, industry, the Federal Drug Administration, and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute gathered to discuss the obstacles confronting the trauma community in their efforts to improve patient outcomes. The primary meeting objective was to generate preliminary suggestions for a series of follow-up meetings that will develop consensus guidelines for the design of large multicenter clinical trials. Twenty short presentations and discussions, summarized here, outlined the group's concerns and suggestions. Successful and failed, completed or ongoing, clinical studies provided insight as to endpoints that may be of value for future trauma and shock studies. In addition to the importance of appropriate endpoints in study design, other related topics were discussed, including trauma epidemiology, patient enrollment and inclusion criteria, community consultation and the difficulty of obtaining informed consent in acute trauma research, and the inclusion of quality of life in composite endpoints. The consensus was that more discussion was needed and that consideration of new endpoints for clinical trials in emergency trauma research was a worthwhile and necessary goal.

TI  - Pseudo-aortic dissection after sudden cardiac death in coronary angiography a case report: Pearls and pitfalls in false aortic dissection artifacts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and importance: Various artifacts mimicked aortic dissection, such as streak artifacts generated by high-attenuation material, high-contrast interfaces, cardiac motion, periaortic structures, aortic wall motion, and normal aortic sinuses, have been described in the literature. Most artifacts that simulate ascending aortic dissection occur frequently on conventional CT. Their position is predictable and is related to systolic aortic motion. However, so far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first pseudo-aortic dissection reported during coronary angiography in cardiac arrest.
   Case presentation: We report a case of a middle-aged man transferred to our hospital after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The coronary angiography revealed non-obstructive coronary arteries and an image of probable aortic dissection was observed. Given the persistent asystole despite a prolonged advance cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the possibility of aortic dissection, a prompt in-room heart team discussion was performed. It was decided to stop and withdraw potentially life-sustaining treatment due to futility. The necropsy study revealed the aorta with some mild atherosclerotic plaques but without either aneurysm or thrombosis. The coronary arteries were reported as with patency, but in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), the intima layer presented a thickness that decreased 50 % of the luminal area without signs of complicated acute plaques.
   Clinical discussion: In this case, the systolic aortic motion theory cannot explain the false-aortic dissection image in the coronary angiography because the patient was under cardiac arrest. Studies with arterial and venous pressures devices recording in cardiac arrest, demonstrated an abnormal hemodynamic flow, suggesting that the hemodynamic flow might be backward during cardiopulmonary resuscitation Therefore, in the setting of this abnormal hemodynamic flow, the injection of contrast may have an abnormal distribution and flow in the aorta creating an image of pseudo-aortic dissection.
   Conclusion: Although the exact mechanism of this false-positive aortic dissection in cardiac arrest remains unoknown, operators should be aware of this entity during coronary angiography in the setting of cardiac arrest with mechanical chest compressions to avoid diagnostic errors in clinical practice.

TI  - Risks and benefits of rate control versus maintenance of sinus rhythm
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - There are 2 fundamental approaches to managing patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF): to restore and maintain sinus rhythm with cardioversion and/or antiarrhythmic drugs, or to control the ventricular rate only. Over the past few years, there have been several important prospective clinical trials comparing rate control with rhythm control in patients with recurrent AF. The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was the first prospective randomized study to test the hypothesis of equivalency between the 2 management strategies for AF. The trial demonstrated that rate control was not inferior to rhythm control with respect to symptoms, quality of life, or number of hospitalizations in patients with persistent AF. The Strategies of Treatment in Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) trial was a pilot study that enrolled approximately 200 patients with AF who were randomized to either ventricular rate control or cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. The results, showed that over a 1-year period there was little difference in outcome in terms of morbidity or symptoms. In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, patients with AF and risk factors for stroke were randomized to either rhythm control or, rate control, with both groups receiving anticoagulation with warfarin. There was no difference in the composite end point of death, disabling stroke or anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest between the 2 arms. In addition, no major differences were noted in functional status or quality of life. The Rate Control Versus Electrical Cardioversion (RACE) trial also reached a similar conclusion. Thus, rate control is an acceptable primary strategy for management of patients with recurrent AF. (C) 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

TI  - Basic life support, a necessary inclusion in the medical curriculum: a cross-sectional survey of knowledge and attitude in Uganda
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background Uganda continues to depend on a health system without a well-defined emergency response system. This is in the face of the rising cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest contributed largely to the high incidence of road traffic accidents. Non-communicable diseases are also on the rise further increasing the incidence of cardiac arrest. Medical students are key players in the bid to strengthen the health system which warrants an assessment of their knowledge and attitude towards BLS inclusion in their study curriculum. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 among undergraduate medical students across eight public and private universities in Uganda. An online-based questionnaire was developed using Google forms and distributed via identified WhatsApp groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were performed in STATA 15 to assess the association between knowledge of BLS and demographics. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Out of the total 354 entries obtained, 351 were analyzed after eligibility screening. Of these, (n = 250, 71.2%) were male less than 25 years (n = 273, 77.8%). Less than half (n = 150, 42.7%) participants had undergone formal BLS training. Less than a third of participants (n = 103, 29.3%) had good knowledge (>= 50%) with an overall score of 42.3 +/- 12.4%. Age (p = 0.045), level of academic progress (p = 0.001), and prior BLS training (p = 0.033) were associated with good knowledge. Participants with prior training were more likely to have more BLS knowledge (aOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.7, p = 0.009). The majority (n = 348, 99.1%) believed that BLS was necessary and would wish (n = 343, 97.7%) to have it included in their curriculum. Conclusions Undergraduate medical students have poor BLS knowledge but understand its importance. Institutions need to adopt practical teaching methods such as clinical exposures, field experience in collaboration with local implementers, and participating in community health promotion campaigns.

TI  - Kinetic eGFR and Novel AKI Biomarkers to Predict Renal Recovery
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
AB  - Background and objectives Prompt recognition of severe renal impairment could improve the early management of critically ill patients. We compared the value of kinetic eGFR, plasma neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), and urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and urine insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 ([TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]) in predicting short-term recovery from AKI and major adverse kidney events.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements During the 6-month study period, 245 patients were admitted to our intensive care unit. This study included 57 consecutive patients presenting with AKI within the first 24 hours after admission. AKI markers were evaluated at inclusion (day 0) and 24 hours later (day 1). Kinetic eGFR was calculated on day 1 according to serum creatinine evolution. Renal recovery was defined as normalization of serum creatinine with reversal of oliguria within 48 hours. Major adverse kidney events included death, need for RRT, or persistence of renal dysfunction at hospital discharge.
   Results Plasma NGAL and ([TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]) predicted renal recovery, with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) values between 0.70 and 0.79 at inclusion. Although plasma NGAL values frequently reached the maximal measurement range, their decrease on day 1 predicted recovery. The kinetic eGFR calculation after initial resuscitation provided the best AUC-ROC value for renal recovery, at 0.87. The best predictions for major adverse kidney events were provided by ([TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]) and kinetic eGFR (equal AUC-ROCs of 0.81). Combining AKI markers in addition to clinical prediction models improved the discrimination and reclassification of patients who will recover from AKI or suffer from major adverse kidney events.
   Conclusions Biomarkers of kidney damage predicted short-term renal recovery and major adverse kidney events for an unselected cohort of critically ill patients. Calculating the kinetic eGFR imposed a delay after initial resuscitation but provided a good diagnostic and prognostic approach. The utility of functional and damage AKI Marker combinations in addition to clinical information requires validation in larger prospective studies.

TI  - Comparison of patient and partner quality of life and health outcomes in the first year after an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Recovery following an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) impacts both the patient and partner, often in divergent ways. Patients may have had a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmias, whereas partners may have to perform CPR and manage the ongoing challenges of heart disease therapy. Currently, support for post-ICD care focuses primarily on restoring patient functioning with few interventions available to partners who serve as primary support. This descriptive study examined and compared patterns of change for both patients and partners during the first year post-ICD implantation. For this longitudinal study, the sample included 42 of 55 (76.4 %) patient-partner dyads who participated in the 'usual care' group of a larger intervention RCT with patients following ICD implant for secondary prevention of cardiac arrest. Measures taken at across five time points (at hospital discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up) tracked physical function (SF-12 PCS, symptoms); psychological adjustment (SF-12 MCS; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; CES-D); relationship impact (Family Functioning, DOII; Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity, MIS); and healthcare utilization (ED visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to characterize and compare outcome trends for patients and partners across the first 12 months of recovery. Patients were 66.5 +/- 11.3 (mean + SD) years old, predominately Caucasian male (91 %), with Charlson comorbidities of 4.4 +/- 2.4. Partners were 62.5 +/- 11.1 years old, predominantly female (91 %) with Charlson co-morbidities of 2.9 +/- 3.0. Patient versus partner differences were observed in the pattern of physical health (F = 10.8, p < 0.0001); patient physical health improved while partner health showed few changes. For partners compared to patients, anxiety, depression, and illness demands on family functioning tended to be higher. Patient mutuality was stable, while partner mutuality increased steadily (F = 2.5, p = 0.05). Patient sensitivity was highest at discharge and declined; partner sensitivity increased (F = 10.2, p < 0.0001) across the 12-month recovery. Outpatient visits for patients versus partners differed (F = 5.0, p = 0.008) due most likely to the number of required patient ICD visits. Total hospitalizations and ED visits were higher for patients versus partners, but not significantly. The findings highlight the potential reciprocal influences of patient and partner responses to the ICD experience on health outcomes. Warranted are new, sound and feasible strategies to counterbalance partner needs while simultaneously optimizing patient recovery outcomes.

TI  - Comparison of the Adaptive Potential of the Arthrobacter oxydans and Acinetobacter lwoffii Isolates from Permafrost Sedimentary Rock and the Analogous Collection Strains
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - A comparative study was conducted on the adaptive mechanisms of the strains Arthrobacter oxydans K14 and Acinetobacter lwoffii EK30A isolated from permafrost subsoil sediments and of those of the analogous collection strains (Ac-1114 Type and BSW-27, respectively). In each pair of the strains compared, the strains differed in terms of (i) growth-related, physiological, and biochemical properties; (ii) resistance to stress factors; (iii) capacity for generation of dormant forms (DFs) under growth arrest conditions, and (iv) intrapopulation production of phase variants. The strains isolated from permafrost displayed a lower growth rate but were more resistant to repeated freezing-thawing treatment than the collection strains. Under the same growth conditions, the permafrost strains formed larger numbers of cystlike anabiotic DFs, extraordinarily small cells, and forms that became nonculturable during long-term storage. Resuscitation of the nonculturable forms resulted in a 2- to-7-fold increase in the percentage of FISH-detectable metabolically active cells. The permafrost strains were also distinguished by increased genome lability. This facilitated their dissociation into intrapopulation variants with phenotypically distinct colonial and morphological properties and different antibiotic resistance. The phenotypic variability was more prominent in Arthrobacter (for which it was not reported previously) than in Acinetobacter. In the populations produced by plating the dormant bacterial forms, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the phase variant spectra varied depending on the formation conditions and the composition of the solid media used for the plating. Thus, the permafrost isolates of A. oxydans and Ac. lwoffii were distinguished from their collection analogs by a more manifest adaptive potential including stress resistance, the intensity of DF generation under growth arrest conditions, and increased intrapopulation variability.

TI  - Real-time machine learning model to predict in-hospital cardiac arrest using heart rate variability in ICU
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - Predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) allows prompt interventions to improve patient outcomes. We developed and validated a machine learning-based real-time model for in-hospital cardiac arrest predictions using electrocardiogram (ECG)-based heart rate variability (HRV) measures. The HRV measures, including time/frequency domains and nonlinear measures, were calculated from 5 min epochs of ECG signals from ICU patients. A light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm was used to develop the proposed model for predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest within 0.5-24 h. The LGBM model using 33 HRV measures achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.875-0.887) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.104 (95% CI: 0.093-0.116). The most important feature was the baseline width of the triangular interpolation of the RR interval histogram. As our model uses only ECG data, it can be easily applied in clinical practice.

TI  - Abdominal compartment syndrome in gynecologic surgery
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Background: Abdominal compartment syndrome is a rare condition in which increased infra-abdominal pressure adversely affects perfusion and viability of the viscera, and the cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems. The syndrome follows acute abdominal events such as abdominal trauma, intraperitoneal hemorrhage, or intra-abdominal infection.
   Cases: Two women who had abdominal hysterectomies postoperatively developed clinical features of multisystem failure with markedly elevated intra-abdominal pressures. The women, one with intra-abdominal infection and diffuse intestinal edema and one with intra-abdominal hemorrhage, were diagnosed by clinical exam. and intravesical pressure measurements. Both had follow-up exploration and temporary placement of the small bowel and colon into an intestinal bag until adequate resuscitation was achieved.
   Conclusion: Abdominal compartment syndrome is a rare complication in gynecology that can be diagnosed early and decompressed promptly. (Obstet Gynecol 1999;94:830-2. (C) 1999 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.).

TI  - NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF MAJOR BLUNT LIVER-INJURY WITH HEMOPERITONEUM
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
AB  - We evaluated the role of nonoperative therapy in 16 patients with blunt multisystem trauma, hemodynamic stability following resuscitation, and major lobar liver injury; the patients were treated with a protocol of intensive care unit observation and computed tomographic scanning to identify and follow up the hepatic lesion. Computed tomographic scans showed right-lobe or bilobar liver lacerations and/or subcapsular hematomas in all patients and associated hemoperitoneum in 8 patients. Exploration was required in 2 patients; both were found to have a hemoperitoneum and a nonbleeding liver laceration. There were no deaths. Patients with hemoperitoneum requiring transfusion had significantly greater injury severely and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays. The major advantage of a nonoperative approach is the oppertunity to stabilize major extra-abdomina (particularly head) injuries as the first priority. Unstable hemodynamics abdominal distension, and falling  hematocrit are indications for prompt exploration. Nonoperative care of these injuries requires a strict treatment protocol.

TI  - Prognostic value of mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin in patients with heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction
T2  - HEART
AB  - Objective To assess the cardiovascular prognostic value of mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) and compare this with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), on death or a composite end point in patients who developed heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods From a subset of 214 patients from the OPTIMAAL study, blood samples were obtained at a median of 3 days after AMI when patients had developed signs and/or symptoms of heart failure (HF) or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35%. End points were all-cause mortality and a composite end point, including death, myocardial reinfarction, stroke and/ or resuscitated cardiac arrest.
   Results Mean age of the patients was 68 +/- 10 years and mean follow-up was 918 +/- 311 days. During follow-up 31 patients died and 61 reached the composite end point. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for BNP, NT-proBNP and other covariates, a doubling of MR-proADM showed a 3.02 (95% CI 1.66 to 5.49) times increased risk of mortality (p < 0.001) and a 1.77 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.78) times increased risk of reaching the composite end point (p=0.013). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that MR-proADM (area under the curve (AUC)=0.81) was a stronger predictor of mortality than BNP (AUC=0.66; p=0.0034 vs MR-proADM) and NT-proBNP (AUC=0.67; p < 0.001 vs MR-proADM). Furthermore, MR-proADM enhanced significantly risk classification and integrated discrimination improvement in comparison with BNP and NT-proBNP. Finally, changes in MR-proADM over time significantly added prognostic information to the baseline value.
   Conclusion MR-proADM is a promising biomarker and has strong prognostic value for mortality and morbidity in patients with HF after an AMI. In this study, MR-proADM had stronger predictive value than BNP and NT-proBNP.

TI  - Determinants of decision-making for the initiation of resuscitation: a mixed-methods systematic review of barriers and facilitators
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - AimThis study aimed to comprehensively examine the factors influencing healthcare providers' decision-making for initiation of resuscitation (IOR).BackgroundIn-hospital resuscitation survival hinges on timely and effective interventions. Despite guidelines, decision-making during resuscitation remains challenging, impacted by both clinical and non-clinical factors.MethodsA mixed-methods systematic review (MMSR) was conducted, searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase in May 2024. Twenty peer-reviewed studies of adult in-hospital resuscitation decision-making (>= 18 years) were included. Data were extracted and synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) convergent integrated approach.ResultsA database search yielded 4398 studies, of which 1216 were duplicates. After screening 3182 unique studies, 20 articles (five qualitative, 12 quantitative, three mixed methods) were included. Data synthesis identified three overarching themes: patient, provider, and system factors. These themes encompassed barriers and facilitators to IOR.ConclusionThis review underscores the importance of understanding patient-related, provider-related, and system-related factors influencing IOR. By addressing these factors, healthcare organizations can improve resuscitation practices and outcomes. Future research should focus on enhancing collaboration, communication, and resource availability while considering non-medical factors in decision-making for IOR.Relevance to clinical practiceUnderstanding the multifaceted barriers and facilitators identified in this study can enhance the effectiveness of resuscitation protocols and ultimately improve patient outcomes during critical care situations.

T2  - 2017 IEEE 56TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)
CP  - 56th Annual IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)
AB  - Developing an ability to classify ventricular fibrillation (VF) into cases where restoration of an organized electrical activity (ROEA) is achieved after the application of a defibrillatory shock, and telling these cases apart from cases where such a restoration does not happen, is of paramount importance to guide first- aid therapy in patients in cardiac arrest. Indeed, VF is a medical emergency of enormous proportions and it is one of the first causes of sudden death in a large range of population's age. In this article, we address this problem in the light of recent achievements in the field of machine learning and present results with the use of a new machine called GEM (Guaranteed Error Machine) applied to a group of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. While our results indicate that this methodology is promising, it remains a fact that this study is still at the outset, and by this article we also want to make the current state of the art available with the use of GEM to others and indicate what we believe are the research priorities for the near future. This is done in the belief that this important medical endeavor is better addressed by the cooperation of various teams, possibly carrying complementary expertise.

TI  - Spinal injuries at the University Hospital of the West Indies
T2  - WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Acute spinal damage forms a small percentage of total trauma injury but it has tremendous significance because of the resultant disability, poor prognosis, economic and social cost and the burden on victims, family, taxpayers and health workers. Of fifty-five patients admitted to the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI), Mona, Jamaica, over a seven-year period, forty form the basis of this report. Young males accounted for most victims and 85% of the injuries were non-intentional. The cervical spine, most commonly C6, was the region most frequently injured, followed by the lumbar and the thoracic regions. On admission, the mean Glasgow Coma Score was 14.6 and the mean Modified Injury Severity Score 12.7. Five patients were admitted in Frankel Grade A, complete paraplegia. Of eighteen patients treated with steroids, only eleven had methylprednisolone and only six of these appropriately. nine patients had surgery after a mean time of 10.1 days. The average length of hospital stay was 18.2 days. Of 35 patients whose outcomes were know, eleven improved; two patients died in hospital. With the modernization of the management of this condition, we recommend that attention be focused on prevention, pre-hospital immobilization and transport, prompt resuscitation, the standardization of written protocols and early operative intervention. Also essential is the continuing medical education of all levels of personnel and the formalization of a well-coordinated and rehearsed Spine team.

TI  - In Situ Simulation to Promote Residents as Resuscitation Leaders
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Objectives
   Our study sought to assess whether perceptions of residents as resuscitation team leaders could be improved by using emergency department (ED) in situ simulations involving ED staff. Secondarily, we monitored changes indicated in overall resuscitation team dynamics.
   Methods
   We conducted a prospective experimental study over the 2018-2019 academic year. Data were collected at a community-based ED with an emergency medicine residency program. Prior to starting the education, all ED staff including residents, attending physicians nurses and techs completed a survey of their perceptions of learn performance and leadership during medical resuscitations. Throughout the year, residents and ED staff members were exposed to various in situ simulation scenarios. A follow-up survey was administered to reassess resident and ED staff perceptions of team dynamics and, specifically, residents as patient care team leaders. A relational coordination survey analysis was performed, dichotomized by professional domain.
   Results
   A total of 20 participants completed surveys before and after the in situ simulations, covering the professional domains with matched pre-simulation and post-simulation data showing significant improvement in communication and team dynamics for residents (p = 0.029) and other ED staff in medical resuscitations. Using residents as the team leaders for the simulation improved perceived leadership during resuscitation (p = 0.006).
   Conclusions
   Our study suggests that in situ simulation within the ED leads to improved team dynamics and defined roles while emphasizing the resident as a resuscitation leader.

TI  - Electrical Stimulation for Preventing Skin Injuries in Denervated Gluteal Muscles-Promising Perspectives from a Case Series and Narrative Review
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) where the lower motor neuron is compromised leads to atrophy and degenerative changes in the respective muscle. This type of lesion becomes especially critical when the gluteal muscles and/or the hamstrings are affected as they usually offer a cushioning effect to protect from skin injuries. Previous research conducted over the past 30 years has made advancements in the development of parameters for the optimal application of long pulse stimulation with the aim to restore muscle structure and trophic aspects in people with chronic SCI (<20 years post-injury). This work provides an overview of previous achievements in the field through a narrative literature review before presenting preliminary results in the form of a case series from an ongoing study investigating the acute effects of six months of long pulse stimulation on the tissue composition of the gluteal muscles in five people with chronic SCI (>20 years post-injury). Participants underwent a 33-min home-based long pulse stimulation program five times a week, and their muscle and adipose tissue thicknesses were assessed at baseline, after three and six months, respectively, using magnetic resonance imaging. The results show that the largest increase in muscle thickness occurred at the level of the height of the acetabulum (+44.37%; chi(2)(2) = 0.5; p = 0.779), whereas the most important decrease in adipose tissue occurred at the level of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) reference (-11.43%; chi(2)(2) = 1.6; p = 0.449) within only six months of regular stimulation despite the preceding long denervation period. The underlying mechanism and physiology of muscular resuscitation from myofibrillar debris as presented in chronic denervation to functional contractile entities remain to be investigated further.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Use of Preemptive Hemodynamic Intervention to Improve Postoperative Outcomes in Moderate and High-Risk Surgical Patients
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complications from major surgery are undesirable, common, and potentially avoidable. The long-term consequences of short-term surgical complications have recently been recognized to have a profound influence on longevity and quality of life in survivors. In the past 30 years, there have been a number of studies conducted attempting to reduce surgical mortality and morbidity by deliberately and preemptively manipulating perioperative hemodynamics. Early studies had a high control-group mortality rate and were criticized for this as being unrepresentative of current practice and raised opposition to its implementation as routine care. We performed this review to update this body of literature and to examine the effect of changes in current practice and quality of care to see whether the conclusions from previous quantitative analyses of this field remain valid.
   METHODS: Randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of preemptive hemodynamic intervention to improve surgical outcome were identified using multiple methods. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials register) were screened for potential trials, reference lists of identified trials were examined, and additional sources were sought from experts and industry representatives. Identified studies that fulfilled the entry criteria were examined in full and subjected to quantifiable analysis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis where possible.
   RESULTS: There were 29 studies identified, 23 of which reported surgical complications. In total, the 29 trials involved 4805 patients with an overall mortality of 7.6%. The use of preemptive hemodynamic intervention significantly reduced mortality (pooled odds ratio [95% confidence interval] of 0.48 [0.33-0.78]; P = 0.0002) and surgical complications (odds ratio 0.43 [0.34-0.53]; P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed significant reductions in mortality for studies using a pulmonary artery catheter, supranormal resuscitation targets, studies using cardiac index or oxygen delivery as goals, and the use of fluids and inotropes as opposed to fluids alone. By contrast, there was a significant reduction in morbidity for each of the 4 subgroups analyzed.
   CONCLUSION: The use of a preemptive strategy of hemodynamic monitoring and coupled therapy reduces surgical mortality and morbidity. (Anesth Analg 2011; 112: 1392-402)

TI  - Hypothermia in adult neurocritical patients: a very "hot" strategy not to be hibernated yet!
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - Therapeutic moderate hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) is currently recommended for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and for newborns exhibiting neonatal hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. Hypothermia as neuroprotective strategy has been extensively studied in other scenarios, mainly for traumatic brain injury. Despite a negative result reported by a multicenter trial conducted in 2001 by Clifton et al. regarding the use of hypothermia oil head injury patients, several Studies in both clinical and laboratory settings have continued to report positive Outcomes with hypothermia use in neurocritical care. 16 date, no adequate consensus has been reached. Though the topic is still under debate, emerging data Suggest that there may not be a clear-cut answer as to whether hypothermia is beneficial. However, new research may indicate what target populations can benefit most from this therapy. Furthermore, issues of timing (when and for how long hypothermia is applied) seem to be the primary drivers of the most unambiguous findings in this matter. For the time being, we conclude that further Studies are needed to assess how to better administer this possibly beneficial therapy, and who might benefit most from the technique.

TI  - Innovative strategies to identify M. tuberculosis antigens and epitopes using genome-wide analyses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - In view of the fact that only a small part of the Mtb expressome has been explored for identification of antigens capable of activating human T-cell responses, which is critically required for the design of better TB vaccination strategies, more emphasis should be placed on innovative ways to discover new Mtb antigens and explore their function at the several stages of infection. Better protective antigens for TB-vaccines are urgently needed, also in view of the disappointing results of the MVA85 vaccine, which failed to induce additional protection in BCG-vaccinated infants (1). Moreover, immune responses to relevant antigens may be useful to identify TB-specific biomarker signatures. Here, we describe the potency of novel tools and strategies to reveal such Mtb antigens. Using proteins specific for different Mtb infection phases, many new antigens of the latency-associated Mtb DosR-regulon as well as resuscitation promoting factor proteins, associated with resuscitating TB, were discovered that were recognized by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Furthermore, by employing MHC binding algorithms and bioinformatics combined with high-throughput human T-cell screens and tetramers, HLA-class la restricted polyfunctional CD8+ T-cells were identified in TB patients. Comparable methods, led to the identification of HLA-E-restricted Mtb epitopes recognized by CD8+ T-cells. A genome-wide unbiased antigen discovery approach was applied to analyze the in vivo Mtb gene expression profiles in the lungs of mice, resulting in the identification of IVE-TB antigens, which are expressed during infection in the lung, the main target organ of Mtb. IVE-TB antigens induce strong T-cell responses in long-term latently Mtb infected individuals, and represent an interesting new group of TB antigens for vaccination. In summary, new tools have helped expand our view on the Mtb antigenome involved in human cellular immunity and provided new candidates for TB vaccination.

TI  - Life expectancy gains and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter/defibrillators for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a devastating complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The optimal strategy for the primary prevention of SCID in HCM remains controversial.
   Methods Using a Markov model, we compared the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies for the primary prevention of SCD: implantable cardioverter/clefibrillator (ICD) insertion, amiodarone therapy, or no therapy. We modeled hypothetical cohorts of 45-year-old patients with HCM with no history of cardiac arrest but at significant risk of SCID (3%/y).
   Results Over a lifetime, compared with no therapy, ICD therapy increased quality-adjusted survival by 4.7 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an additional cost of $142800 ($30000 per QALY), whereas amiodarone increased quality-adjusted survival by 2.8 QALYs at an additional cost of $104900 ($37300 per QALY). Compared with no therapy, ICD therapy would cost <$50000 per QALY for patients (i) aged 25, with ! I risk factors for SCID, and (ii) aged 45 or 65, with >= 2 risk factors for SCD.
   Conclusions An ICD strategy is projected to yield the greatest increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of the 3 treatment strategies evaluated. Combined consideration of age and the number of risk factors for SCID may allow more precise tailoring of ICD therapy to its expected benefits.

TI  - Capecitabine-induced-coronary-vasospasm leading to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest
T2  - CARDIO-ONCOLOGY
AB  - Capecitabine, a pro-drug of 5-fluorouracil, is commonly used in the treatment of breast and colorectal cancer. Its side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and bone marrow suppression, are well recognized. However, coronary vasospasm represents a less commonly recognized but significant complication of fluoropyrimidine-based therapies such as capecitabine. Proposed mechanisms for this adverse effect complication include direct endothelium-independent vasoconstriction, activation of protein kinase C, and activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway. In this report, we present a case of capecitabine-induced coronary vasospasm leading to progressive, focal ST-elevations, myocardial ischemia, and subsequently polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These events were captured on telemetry, in a male in his early 40s, diagnosed with stage IIIB sigmoid colon cancer. Notably, the patient had no pre-existing coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors. Upon diagnosis, the patient was initiated on a calcium channel blocker, verapamil, to mitigate further coronary vasospasm events. After thorough discussions that prioritized the patient's input and values, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed subcutaneously. Following discharge, the patient restarted capecitabine therapy along with verapamil prophylaxis and did not experience any subsequent shocks from his ICD as assessed during his outpatient follow-up visits. This case emphasizes the need to involve patients in decision-making processes, especially when managing unexpected and serious complications, to ensure treatments align with their quality of life and personal preferences.

TI  - The feasibility of recognizing the heart rhythm with an automated external defibrillator from an area the size of a mobile phone
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective
   Recognition of cardiac arrest (CA) during an emergency call leans on questions concerning CA symptoms and is correct in 50-83% of cases. If the heart rhythm could be recorded and analysed over a mobile phone or transmitted during the emergency call to the dispatch centre and analysed there, using software identical to one in an automated external defibrillator (AED), CA recognition could be more prompt. We investigated whether an AED can correctly analyse normal heart rhythms recorded within an area the size of a mobile phone.
   Methods
   Bipolar ECG signal was recorded using an AED in 20 healthy volunteers in four different positions during rest and muscle tension with small pads in an area the size of a mobile phone. Recordings obtained with standard pads in standard positions served as the reference. The recorded ECGs were analysed with an AED and by two cardiologists and categorized as shockable or nonshockable.
   Results
   All analyses were correct when the recordings were performed vertically at the midsternum level. Horizontally at this level, the AED made correct analyses in 95 and 65% of cases and the cardiologists in 100 and 88% of cases at rest and during muscle tension, respectively. In the lateral positions only the analyses by cardiologists partly reached 100% sensitivity. The analysis time of the AED was 7 s in all positions.
   Conclusion
   ECGs can be analysed promptly with an AED within an area the size of a mobile phone. The most reliable recording position was vertical at the midsternum level.

T2  - 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - 11th International Congress of Neurological Surgery
AB  - Clinical, laboratory and neuroradiological features of eighteen patients with primitive spine infection are reported. Two patients had more than one site of infection. Staphilococcus Aureus was the commonest etiological agent, cultured by blood percutaneous biopsy or surgical material; when no growth was obtained, the diagnosis was believed to be compatible with spinal infection, based on histopathological evidence or by clinical observation. Four patients underwent surgical treatment for acute neural compression. Other two cases, surgically treated, presented previous clinical features of disk space infection, and had significative histological examination. Four infections involved the cervical spine, four the thoracic spine, nine the lumbar area and one the thoraco-lumbar area. Laboratory investigations ESR, CPR, culture) and neuroradiological features (plain radiography, radionuclide investigations, CT scan, RM examination) are discussed for the sensibility of detecting spinal infections and evaluating the follow-up. Medical or surgical treatment and possible instability are discussed: the aims were to eradicate infection, relieve pain, reverse neurodeficits and promote correct osseous fusion.

TI  - Prognostic effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease under statin treatment
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) under statin treatment, the influence of on-treatment level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on cardiovascular (CV) events is controversial. Statin-treated patients were selected from the Taiwanese Secondary Prevention for patients with AtheRosCLErotic disease (T-SPARCLE) Registry, a multicenter, observational study of adult patients with ASCVD in Taiwan. Low HDL-C was defined as<40 mg/dL for men and<50 mg/dL for women. The primary outcome was a composite CV events including CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. A total of 3731 patients (mean age 65.6 years, 75.6% men) were included. Patients with on-treatment low HDL-C (44%, mean HDL-C 34.9 +/- 6.8 mg/dL) were younger and with more diabetes and higher body weight. The mean follow-up time was 2.7 years. We used restricted cubic spline curves to examine the potential non-linear association between HDL-C and adverse outcomes. Decreased HDL-C levels were associated with a significantly increased risk of CV events in women (<49 mg/dL in women) but not in men (<42 mg/dL in men). However, the protective effect of elevated HDL-C levels was more prominent in men than in women. In ASCVD patients with statin therapy, low on-treatment HDL-C was common in Taiwan and associated with an increased risk of CV events in women. Higher HDL-C levels provided more protective effect in men than in women.

TI  - Acute triple coronary artery occlusion leading to cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest emphasizing the role of mechanical circulatory support (escalate before it's too late)
T2  - HEART VIEWS
AB  - We report a case of cardiac arrest in a 38-year-old male with no past medical history who presented as a case of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and coronary angiography showed triple coronary artery thrombosis complicated with cardiogenic shock (CS) that warrants starting on inotropic support and insertion of intra-aortic balloon pump. CS diagnosis with a high likelihood of deterioration was established based on hemodynamics assessment; hence, an early prompt decision for escalation of mechanical circulatory support to Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was made, which helped to prevent the patient's further deterioration and organ damage. The patient had uneventful VA-ECMO decannulation and was transferred to the ward and discharged after 28 days in stable condition on oral medical therapy and was following up regularly in the cardiology clinic. Therefore, early hemodynamics assessment in acute myocardial infarction CS cases will help predict rapid worsening, which may require prompt escalation of mechanical circulatory support and perhaps improve the outcome.

TI  - Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin: Ready for Routine Clinical Use? An International Perspective
T2  - BLOOD PURIFICATION
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a challenge in terms of diagnosis and classification, its morbidity and mortality remaining high in the face of improving clinical protocols. Current clinical criteria use serum creatinine (sCr) and urine output to classify patients. Ongoing research has identified novel biomarkers that may improve the speed and accuracy of patient evaluation and prognostication, yet the route from basic science to clinical practice remains poorly paved. International evidence supporting the use of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a valuable biomarker of AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for a number of clinical scenarios was presented at the 31st International Vicenza Course on Critical Care Nephrology, and these data are detailed in this review. NGAL was shown to be highly useful alongside sCr, urinary output, and other biomarkers in assessing kidney injury; in patient stratification and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) selection in paediatric AKI; in assessing kidney injury in conjunction with sCr in sepsis; in guiding resuscitation protocols in conjunction with brain natriuretic peptide in burn patients; as an early biomarker of delayed graft function and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity in kidney transplantation from extended criteria donors; as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and in guiding CRRT selection in the intensive care unit and emergency department. While some applications require further clarification by way of larger randomised controlled trials, NGAL nevertheless demonstrates promise as an independent biological marker with the potential to improve earlier diagnosis and better assessment of risk groups in AKI and CKD. This is a critical element in formulating quick and accurate decisions for individual patients, both in acute scenarios and in long-term care, in order to improve patient prognostics and outcomes.

TI  - Complete Heart Block Secondary to COVID-19
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - In our everyday practice with COVID-19 patients, we noticed that they are not tachycardic even when critically ill and shocked on pressors they are bradycardic. Most of them are in sinus rhythm. However, some of them go into advanced degree heart block and had cardiac arrest related to complete heart block. A 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diabetes admitted with COVID-19 bronchopneumonia. The hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and septic shock requiring norepinephrine. It was noted that she is bradycardic in the 50s in sinus rhythm, her heart rate dipped down to 30 for about six seconds, and her telemetry strip showed evidence of complete heart block, and then she was back in sinus rhythm. The decision was made to follow-up, given that it was for a short time and did not recur. The next day she had cardiac arrest related to a complete heart block, and a temporary trans-venous pacemaker was placed, Later when her condition improved, her heart rate started recovering gradually. At first, she was in junctional tachycardia, and one week later, she was back in sinus rhythm. The temporary pacemaker was removed, and she was discharged on a ZIO monitor for two weeks with no further evidence of bradycardia. Bradycardia in COVID-19 patients is frequently reported. It is not always benign and should be managed promptly when there is evidence of advanced heart block.

TI  - Establishing an Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Program
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a complex, life-saving procedure that uses mechanical support for patients with refractory cardiac arrest, representing the pinnacle of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) applications. Effective ECPR requires precise patient selection, rapid mobilization of a multidisciplinary team, and skilled cannulation techniques. Establishing a program necessitates a cohesive ECMO system that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, which is essential for managing acute cardiogenic shock and severe pulmonary failure. ECPR is suited for selected patients, emphasizing the need to optimize every step of cardiac arrest management-from public education to advanced post-resuscitation care. The flexibility of ECMO teams allows them to manage various emergencies such as cardiogenic shock, massive pulmonary embolism, and severe asthma, showcasing the program's adaptability. Launching an ECPR program involves addressing logistical, financial, and organizational challenges. This includes gaining administrative approval, assembling a diverse team, and crafting detailed protocols and training regimens. The development process entails organizing teams, refining protocols, and training extensively to ensure operational readiness. A systematic approach to building an ECPR program involves establishing a team, defining patient selection criteria, and evaluating caseloads. Critical elements like patient transport protocols and anticoagulation management are vital for the program's success. In conclusion, initiating an ECPR program demands thorough planning, collaborative effort across specialties, and ongoing evaluation to improve outcomes in critical cardiac emergencies. This guide offers practical insights to support institutions in navigating the complexities of ECPR program development and maintenance.

TI  - Efficiency of Hypertonic Saline in the Management of Decompensated Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Studies
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS
AB  - Introduction Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), with an incidence of 1-2%, is a clinical syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality despite therapeutic advancements and ongoing clinical trials. A recent therapeutic approach to patients with ADHF includes combination therapy with hypertonic saline solution (HSS) and furosemide, based on the hypothesis that resistance to loop diuretics occurs because of achievement of plateau in water and sodium excretion in patients receiving long-term loop diuretic therapy. Objective Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficiency of combination HSS plus furosemide therapy in patients with ADHF in terms of mortality, readmissions, length of hospital stay, kidney function, urine output, body weight, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Methods A total of 14 studies-four observational and ten randomized studies (total 3398 patients)-were included in the meta-analysis. Results Our results demonstrate the superiority of combination HSS plus furosemide therapy over furosemide alone in terms of kidney function preservation (mean creatinine difference - 0.33 mg/dL; P < 0.00001), improved diuresis (mean difference [MD] 581.94 mL/24 h; P < 0.00001) and natriuresis (MD 57.19; P < 0.00001), weight loss (MD 0.99 kg; P < 0.00001), duration of hospital stay (MD - 2.72 days; P < 0.00001), readmissions (relative risk 0.63; P = 0.01), and mortality (relative risk 0.55; P < 0.00001). However, no difference in BNP levels was detected (MD 19.88 pg/mL; P = 0.50). Conclusion Despite the heterogeneity and possible risk of bias among the studies, results appear promising on multiple aspects. A clear need exists for future randomized controlled trials investigating the role of combination HSS plus furosemide therapy to clarify these effects and their possible mechanisms.

AB  - Objective. Donation after cardiac death (DCD) has been proposed to overcome in part the organ donor shortage. In liver transplantation, the additional warm ischemia time associated with DCD procurement may promote higher rates of primary nonfunction and ischemic biliary lesions. We reviewed the results of liver transplantation from DCD.
   Patients and Methods. From 2003 to 2007, we consecutively performed 13 controlled DCD liver transplantations. The medical records of all donors and recipients were retrospectively reviewed, evaluating in particular the outcome and occurrence of biliary complications. Mean follow-up was 25 months.
   Results. Mean donor age was 51 years, and mean intensive care unit stay was 5.4 days. Mean time between ventilation arrest and cardiac arrest was 9.3 minutes. Mean time between cardiac arrest and arterial flushing was 7.7 minutes. No-touch period was 2 to 5 minutes. Mean graft cold ischemia time was 295 minutes, and mean suture warm ischemia time was 38 minutes. Postoperatively, there was no primary nonfunction. Mean peak transaminase level was 2546 UI/mL. Patient and graft survival was 100% at I year. Two of 13 patients (15%) developed main bile duct stenosis and underwent endoscopic management of the graft. No patient developed symptomatic intrahepatic bile duct strictures or needed a second transplantation.
   Conclusions. Our experience confirms that controlled DCD donors may be a valuable source of transplantable liver grafts in cases of short warm ischemia at procurement and minimal cold ischemia time.

TI  - Management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage: Controversies and areas of uncertainty
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage (UGIH) remains a common presentation requiring urgent evaluation and treatment. Accurate assessment, appropriate intervention and apt clinical skills are needed for proper management from time of presentation to discharge. The advent of pharmacologic acid suppression, endoscopic hemostatic techniques, and recognition of Helicobacter pylori as an etiologic agent in peptic ulcer disease (PUD) has revolutionized the treatment of UGIH. Despite this, acute UGIH still carries considerable rates of morbidity and mortality. This review aims to discuss current areas of uncertainty and controversy in the management of UGIH. Neoadjuvant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has become standard empiric treatment for UGIH given that PUD is the leading cause of non-variceal UGIH, and PPIs are extremely effective at promoting ulcer healing. However, neoadjuvant PPI administration has not been shown to affect hard clinical outcomes such as rebleeding or mortality. The optimal timing of upper endoscopy in UGIH is often debated. Upon completion of volume resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization, upper endoscopy should be performed within 24 h in all patients with evidence of UGIH for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. With rising healthcare cost paramount in today's medical landscape, the ability to appropriately triage UGIH patients is of increasing value. Upper endoscopy in conjunction with the clinical scenario allows for accurate decision making concerning early discharge home in low-risk lesions or admission for further monitoring and treatment in higher-risk lesions. Concomitant pharmacotherapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antiplatelet agents, such as clopidogrel, has a major impact on the etiology, severity, and potential treatment of UGIH. Long-term PPI use in patients taking chronic NSAIDs or clopidogrel is discussed thoroughly in this review. (C) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

TI  - 24-HOUR VARIATION IN THE OCCURRENCE AND SURVIVAL OF POTENTIALLY LETHAL VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIA
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The temporal pattern in the occurrence and primary outcome of resuscitation of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia was studied. The onset time of 117 cases of tachyarrhythmia exhibited a double-peaking 24-h variation with a first prominent peak in the midmorning and a second less prominent one during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Survival after resuscitation also was time dependent, showing a quite different temporal pattern. Survival was lowest during the daytime and greatest (four to five times greater) during the night. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia may be dependent on autonomic regulation.

TI  - EMPOWERING END-OF-LIFE CONVERSATIONS: The Role of Specialized Nursing Teams in Facilitating Code Status Changes at Discharge
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - Objectives: Hospitalized patients may require goals of care (GOC) or Advance Health Care Planning (ACP), which can be time-consuming and emotionally tolling for providers. A nursing team specializing in code status (CODE), GOC, and ACP was developed to provide meaningful support for patients and families and decrease provider burden. Interest in CODE, GOC, ACP, and effectiveness of a nursing team to lead these conversations prompted this study. Methods: A collaborative nursing team was trained to address CODE, GOC, and ACP with patients demonstrating illness or geriatric syndrome. This team conducted 3 visits per patient on average during hospitalization using structured CODE templates to establish longer term goals and document what matters in the healthcare journey. Comprehensive narratives for ACP and GOC were included in charting, syncing the medical team, nursing, patient, and family. Consults were tracked over nine months with data reviewed retrospectively from medical charts. Descriptive analyses of cohort demographics, CODE and outcomes were completed. Results: The study group comprised 3342 patients between October 2022 and June 2023. Patients ranged in age from 18-106 years, with majority (88%) age 65 years and older. Mean length of stay (LOS) was 6.8 days with CODE documented for 91% upon admission. Of the 3166 older adults with known CODE on admission, 946 (30%) changed CODE by discharge, of which 95% were de-escalated. 83% of older patients arriving with limited CODE maintained limitations at discharge, with a small portion converting to comfort (16%). Conclusion: Employing a focused nursing team to conduct CODE, GOC, and ACP conversations may be an effective use of time and resources and result in de-escalation of resuscitation orders for patients demonstrating illness or geriatric syndrome.

TI  - Lateral fluid percussion brain injury: A 15-year review and evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB  - This article comprehensively reviews the lateral fluid percussion (LFP) model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in small animal species with particular emphasis on its validity, clinical relevance and reliability. The UP model, initially described in 1989, has become the most extensively utilized animal model of TBI (to date, 232 PubMed citations), producing both focal and diffuse (mixed) brain injury. Despite subtle variations in injury parameters between laboratories, universal findings are evident across studies, including histological, physiological, metabolic, and behavioral changes that serve to increase the reliability of the model. Moreover, demonstrable histological damage and severity-dependent behavioral deficits, which partially recover over time, validate LFP as a clinically-relevant model of human TBI. The UP model, also has been used extensively to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions, including resuscitation, pharmacologic therapies, transplantation, and other neuroprotective and neuroregenerative strategies. Although a number of positive studies have identified promising therapies for moderate TBI, the predictive validity of the model may be compromised when findings are translated to severely injured patients. Recently, the clinical relevance of LFP has been enhanced by combining the injury with secondary insults, as well as broadening studies to incorporate issues of gender and age to better approximate the range of human TBI within study design. We conclude that the LFP brain injury model is an appropriate tool to study the cellular and mechanistic aspects of human TBI that cannot be addressed in the clinical setting, as well as for the development and characterization of novel therapeutic interventions. Continued translation of pre-clinical findings to human TBI will enhance the predictive validity of the LFP model, and allow novel neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment strategies developed in the laboratory to reach the appropriate TBI patients.

TI  - Therapeutic Gases and Inhaled Anesthetics as Adjunctive Therapies in Critically Ill Patients
T2  - SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The administration of exogenous oxygen to support adequate gas exchange is the cornerstone of respiratory care. In the past few years, other gaseous molecules have been introduced in clinical practice to treat the wide variety of physiological derangement seen in critical care patients. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is used for its unique selective pulmonary vasodilator effect. Recent studies showed that NO plays a pivotal role in regulating ischemia-reperfusion injury and it has antibacterial and antiviral activity. Helium, due to its low density, is used in patients with upper airway obstruction and lower airway obstruction to facilitate gas flow and to reduce work of breathing. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas that acts as a signaling molecule involved in many biologic pathways. CO's anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects are under investigation in the setting of acute respiratory distress and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Inhaled anesthetics are widely used in the operative room setting and, with the development of anesthetic reflectors, are now a valid option for sedation management in the intensive care unit. Many other gases such as xenon, argon, and hydrogen sulfide are under investigation for their neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in post-cardiac arrest syndrome. With all these therapeutic options available, the clinician must have a clear understanding of the physiologic basis, therapeutic potential, and possible adverse events of these therapeutic gases. In this review, we will present the therapeutic gases other than oxygen used in clinical practice and we will describe other promising therapeutic gases that are in the early phases of investigation.

TI  - Effect of dexamethasone in patients with ARDS and COVID-19-prospective, multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (REMED trial): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that administration of dexamethasone 20 mg is superior to a 6 mg dose in adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to confirmed COVID-19. The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone 20 mg versus dexamethasone 6 mg. The exploratory objective of this study is to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days.
   Trial design: REMED is a prospective, phase II, open-label, randomised controlled trial testing superiority of dexamethasone 20 mg vs 6 mg. The trial aims to be pragmatic, i.e. designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in conditions that are close to real-life routine clinical practice.
   Participants: The study is multi-centre and will be conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of ten university hospitals in the Czech Republic.
   Inclusion criteria: Subjects will be eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following criteria:
   1. Adult (>= 18 years of age) at time of enrolment;
   2. Present COVID-19 (infection confirmed by RT-PCR or antigen testing);
   3. Intubation/mechanical ventilation or ongoing high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy;
   4. Moderate or severe ARDS according to Berlin criteria:
   center dot Moderate - PaO2/FiO(2) 100-200 mmHg;
   center dot Severe - PaO2/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg;
   5. Admission to ICU in the last 24 hours.
   Exclusion criteriaSubjects will not be eligible for the trial if they meet any of the following criteria:
   1. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to dexamethasone or excipients of the investigational medicinal product (e.g. parabens, benzyl alcohol);
   2. Fulfilled criteria for ARDS for >= 14 days at enrolment;
   3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding;
   4. Unwillingness to comply with contraception measurements from enrolment until at least 1 week after the last dose of dexamethasone (sexual abstinence is considered an adequate contraception method);
   5. End-of-lif decision or patient is expected to die within next 24 hours;
   6. Decision not to intubate or ceilings of care in place;
   7. Immunosuppression and/or immunosuppressive drugs in medical history:a) Systemic immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy in the past 30 days;b) Systemic corticosteroid use before hospitalization;c) Any dose of dexamethasone during the present hospital stay for COVID-19 for >= 5 days before enrolment;d) Systemic corticosteroids during present hospital stay for conditions other than COVID-19 (e.g. septic shock);
   8. Current haematological or generalized solid malignancy;
   9. Any contraindication for corticosteroid administration, e.g.
   center dot intractable hyperglycaemia;
   center dot active gastrointestinal bleeding;
   center dot adrenal gland disorders;
   center dot presence of superinfection diagnosed with locally established clinical and laboratory criteria without adequate antimicrobial treatment;
   10. Cardiac arrest before ICU admission;
   11. Participation in another interventional trial in the last 30 days.
   Intervention and comparator: Dexamethasone solution for injection/infusion is the investigational medicinal product as well as the comparator. The trial will assess two doses, 20 mg (investigational) vs 6 mg (compaator). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily on day 1-5, followed by dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously once daily on day 6-10. Patients in the control group will receive dexamethasone 6 mg day 1-10. All authorized medicinal products containing dexamethasone in the form of solution for i.v. injection/infusion can be used.
   Main outcomes: Primary endpoint: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days after randomisation, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation.
   Secondary endpoints: a) Mortality from any cause at 60 days after randomisation;
   b) Dynamics of inflammatory marker (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) change from Day 1 to Day 14;
   c) WHO Clinical Progression Scale at Day 14;
   d) Adverse events related to corticosteroids (new infections, new thrombotic complications) until Day 28 or hospital discharge;
   e) Independence at 90 days after randomisation assessed by Barthel Index.The long-term outcomes of this study are to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days through telephone structured interviews using the Barthel Index.
   Randomisation: Randomisation will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the stratified permuted block randomisation method. Allocation sequences will be prepared by a statistician independent of the study team. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomisation process. The following stratification factors will be applied:
   center dot Age <65 and >= 65;
   center dot Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) <3 and >= 3;
   center dot CRP <150 mg/L and >= 150 mg/L
   center dot Trial centre.
   Patients will be randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms. Randomisation through the eCRF will be available 24 hours every day.
   Blinding (masking): This is an open-label trial in which the participants and the study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded pre-planned statistical analysis will be performed.
   Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The sample size is calculated to detect the difference of 3 VFDs at 28 days (primary efficacy endpoint) between the two treatment arms with a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Based on data from a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in COVID-19 ARDS patients in Brazil and a multi-centre observational study from French and Belgian ICUs regarding moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19, investigators assumed a standard deviation of VFD at 28 days as 9. Using these assumptions, a total of 142 patients per treatment arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate, 150 per treatment arm (300 patients per study) will be enrolled.
   Trial Status: This is protocol version 1.1, 15.01.2021. The trial is due to start on 2 February 2021 and recruitment is expected to be completed by December 2021.
   Trial registration: The study protocol was registered on EudraCT No.:2020-005887-70, and on December 11, 2020 on ClinicalTrials.gov (Title: Effect of Two Different Doses of Dexamethasone in Patients With ARDS and COVID-19 (REMED)) Identifier: NCT04663555 with a last update posted on February 1, 2021.
   Full protocol: The full protocol (version 1.1) is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest of expediting dissemination of this material, the standard formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.

TI  - Impact of a Formal Advance Care Planning Program on End-of-Life Care for Patients With Heart Failure: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC FAILURE
AB  - Background: There is no evidence on effectiveness of advance care planning (ACP) among patients with heart failure (HF). We examined the effect of an ACP program in facilitating end of life (EOL) care consistent with the preferences of patients with HF (primary aim), and on their decisional conflict, discussion with surrogates, illness understanding, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (secondary aims).
   Methods: We randomized 282 patients with HF to receive ACP (n=93) or usual care (control arm, n=189). Primary outcomes were assessed among deceased (n=89) and secondary outcomes from baseline and 6 follow-ups conducted every 4 months.
   Results: Deceased patients in the ACP arm were no more likely than those in control arm to have wishes followed for EOL treatments (ACP: 35%, Control: 44%; P=.47), or place of death (ACP: 52%, Control: 51%; P = .1.00). A higher proportion in the ACP arm had wishes followed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ACP: 83%, Control: 62%; P = .12). At first follow-up, patients with ACP had lower decisional conflict (beta = -10.8, P < .01) and were more likely to discuss preferences with surrogates (beta = 1.3, P = .04). ACP did not influence other outcomes.
   Conclusion: This trial did not confirm that our ACP program was effective in facilitating EOL care consistent with patient preferences. The program led to short-term improvements in the decision-making.

TI  - AUTOMATIC IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR - COST-EFFECTIVENESS
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
CP  - INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON NEW HORIZONS FOR ELECTRICAL THERAPY IN MANAGING VENTRICULAR AND SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIAS
AB  - Unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is in most cases due to ventricular fibrillation or rapid ventricular tachycardia. The usual therapeutic strategy in survivors starts with drug treatment, in case of failure followed by nonpharmacological therapy, which may include catheter ablation, ablative surgery, and finally defibrillator implantation. In most cases, this strategy is long lasting and very expensive. Implantation of a defibrillator as a first choice therapy may be cost effective, especially if the probability of successful drug treatment is low. However, cost-effective aspects have been studied only retrospectively and in models. In 1989 we started a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) as first choice therapy (''early'' AICD implantation) in successfully resuscitated postinfarct patients. Evaluation is being done in a randomized way with one group having early AICD implantation and the other group following the usual conventional therapeutic strategy. We compare medical, economic, and quality-of-life aspects. As of June 1992, 46 patients have entered the study. Totally 60 patients will be included. Results are expected in 1993 and will be expressed as cost effectiveness ratios in both study arms.

TI  - Impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on long-term clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with successful percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents: Comparison between STEMI and NSTEMI
T2  - ATHEROSCLEROSIS
AB  - Background and aims: We compared the clinical impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) on longterm clinical outcomes between ST-segment elevation (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug eluting stents (DES) because of the paucity of published data.
   Methods: A total of 24,960 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who underwent PCI with DES and were prescribed the RASI were enrolled and divided into two groups, the STEMI group (n= 14,061) and the NSTEMI group (n= 10,899). The clinical endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, cardiac death (CD), recurrent myocardial infarction (re-MI), total coronary revascularization (target lesion revascularization [TLR], target vessel revascularization [TVR], non-TVR) during 2 years.
   Results: After propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis, two PSM groups (6762 pairs, n= 13,524, C-statistic= 0.682) were generated. All-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.386; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.114-1.725; p= 0.003) and CD (HR, 1.358; 95% CI, 1.041-1.770; p= 0.024) rates were significantly higher in NSTEMI patients. However, the incidence of MACE, re-MI, total revascularization, TLR, TVR, non-TVR was not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, old age (>= 65years), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (< 50%), hypertension, creatine kinase isoenzyme level, cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation on admission, and PCI within 24 h were common significant independent risk factors of all-cause death and CD.
   Conclusions: The mortality reduction capability of RASI was more prominent in the STEMI patients compared with the NSTEMI patients.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of mild induced hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using an endovascular cooling system
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: To assess the efficacy, the tolerance and the ability of mild therapeutic hypothermia using an endovascular cooling system to reach and to maintain a target temperature of 33 degrees C after cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Case series in the medical-surgical intensive care unit ( ICU) of an urban university hospital. 40 patients admitted to the ICU after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest underwent mild induced hypothermia ( MIH). Core temperature was monitored continuously for 5 days using a Foley catheter equipped with a temperature sensor. Any equipment malfunction was noted and all adverse events attributable to MIH were collected. The neurological status was evaluated daily using Pittsburgh cerebral performance category ( CPC). The mechanism of cardiac arrest, the Simplified Acute Physiologic Score ( SAPS) II on admission, standard biological variables, and time lags characterizing the duration of cerebral hypoperfusion were recorded. Nosocomial infections were collected during and after MIH until day 28.
   Results: Six patients ( 15%) died during hypothermia. Among the 34 patients who completed the period of MIH, hypothermia was maintained steady in 31 patients ( 91%). Post re-warming "rebound hyperthermia" determined as temperature >= 38.5 degrees C was observed in 25 patients ( 74%) during the first 24 hours which followed the cessation of MIH. Infectious complications were observed in 18 patients ( 45%), but no patient developed severe sepsis or septic shock. Biological changes during MIH principally resulted in hypokaliemia < 3.5 mmol/L ( 75%).
   Conclusion: The intravascular cooling system is effective, safe and allows reaching a target temperature fairly rapidly and steadily over a period of 36h.

TI  - A Clinical Practice Guideline for the Emergency Management of Anaphylaxis (2020)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: For anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction, the incidence rate was presented to have increased from the beginning of the 21st century. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of anaphylaxis are public health concerns.Objective: This guideline aimed to provide high-quality and evidence-based recommendations for the emergency management of anaphylaxis.Method: The panel of health professionals from fifteen medical areas selected twenty-five clinical questions and formulated the recommendations with the supervision of four methodologists. We collected evidence by conducting systematic literature retrieval and using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.Results: This guideline made twenty-five recommendations that covered the diagnosis, preparation, emergency treatment, and post-emergency management of anaphylaxis. We recommended the use of a set of adapted diagnostic criteria from the American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN), and developed a severity grading system that classified anaphylaxis into four grades. We recommended epinephrine as the first-line treatment, with specific doses and routes of administration for different severity of anaphylaxis or different conditions. Proper dosage is critical in the administration of epinephrine, and the monitor is important in the IV administration. Though there was only very low or low-quality evidence supported the use of glucocorticoids and H1 antagonists, we still weakly recommended them as second-line medications. We could not make a well-directed recommendation regarding premedication for preventing anaphylaxis since it is difficult to weigh the concerns and potential effects.Conclusion: For the emergency management of anaphylaxis we conclude that:center dot NIAID/FAAN diagnostic criteria and the four-tier grading system should be used for the diagnosis center dot Prompt and proper administration of epinephrine is critical.

TI  - Mobile ECMO - A divine technology or bridge to nowhere?
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
AB  - Introduction: Extracorporeal life support emerged as a salvage option in patients with therapy-refractory severe hemodynamic or respiratory failure. However, this promising therapy option has been limited by the use of experienced teams in highly specialized tertiary-care centers. Thus, in order to provide this standard of care in local hospitals and due to increasing evidence on improved outcomes using ECMO devices and setting for patients with heart and lung failure, an increasing number of experienced ECMO centers have launched mobile ECMO retrieval services in recent years.Areas covered: This review provides a summary on the current scientific status concerning use, indications and complications of mobile ECMO devices and services. A scientific literature research was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases using keywords denoted.Expert commentary: Mobile ECMO devices and setting offer severely ill patients refractory to maximal conventional treatment an option of hemodynamic and/or respiratory stabilization and subsequent transportation to specialized care centers for further treatment. Compared to in-hospital ECMO support, out-of-hospital mobile ECMO implantation, transport and retrieval of patients require additional organizational, logistical and clinical efforts. This review provides a summary on the current scientific status concerning use, indications and complications of mobile ECMO services.

TI  - Standards for Studies of Neurological Prognostication in Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Significant improvements have been achieved in cardiac arrest resuscitation and postarrest resuscitation care, but mortality remains high. Most of the poor outcomes and deaths of cardiac arrest survivors have been attributed to widespread brain injury. This brain injury, commonly manifested as a comatose state, is a marker of poor outcome and a major basis for unfavorable neurological prognostication. Accurate prognostication is important to avoid pursuing futile treatments when poor outcome is inevitable but also to avoid an inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who may otherwise have a chance of achieving meaningful neurological recovery. Inaccurate neurological prognostication leading to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and deaths may significantly bias clinical studies, leading to failure in detecting the true study outcomes. The American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science Subcommittee organized a writing group composed of adult and pediatric experts from neurology, cardiology, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, and nursing to review existing neurological prognostication studies, the practice of neurological prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. The writing group determined that the overall quality of existing neurological prognostication studies is low. As a consequence, the degree of confidence in the predictors and the subsequent outcomes is also low. Therefore, the writing group suggests that neurological prognostication parameters need to be approached as index tests based on relevant neurological functions that are directly related to the functional outcome and contribute to the quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors. Suggestions to improve the quality of adult and pediatric neurological prognostication studies are provided.

TI  - Paediatric resuscitation in regional Queensland: A simulation informed biopsy of current system challenges
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
AB  - ObjectivesAn outreach education service, Simulation Training Optimising Resuscitation for Kids (STORK) identified opportunities to use their course (Optimus PRIME) to understand and help optimise regional paediatric resuscitation. Our objective was to document challenges faced by healthcare providers in rural, remote, and regional (RRR) health centres in Queensland during a paediatric resuscitation course and ensure information reached stakeholders.MethodsUsing in situ simulation, participants were prompted to identify real-life challenges during paediatric resuscitation. Participants co-generated solutions to these specific challenges and identified local advocates. Summaries for stakeholders included service strengths and improvement opportunities. Site follow-up identified actions taken and supported ongoing challenges.ResultsBetween March and December 2023, 40 Optimus PRIME courses were delivered. Thirty-nine course summaries were sent. Using the safety software in infusion pumps, 60% and 81% of sites were unable to correctly administer adrenaline or phenytoin, respectively. One or more pieces of paediatric oxygenation or ventilation equipment were lacking at 65% of sites. Participants working at 81% of sites were unfamiliar with the Queensland Health paediatric guidelines.ConclusionWe highlight challenges for healthcare providers across Queensland and demonstrate educational teams can contribute to their resolution. Many problems perceived as local were occurring statewide. Our findings inform further advocacy. Our report informs opportunities for system optimisation and highlights inconsistencies in three key areas: infusion pump safety software, access to paediatric resuscitation equipment, and access to information technology. Statewide consistency synergising with local expertise is needed to ensure every child in Queensland has access to optimal resuscitation.

TI  - Foot injuries in the polytraumatized patient
T2  - UNFALLCHIRURG
AB  - Foot injuries in polytraumatized patients are not critical for survival but for the later quality of life. Closed fractures or dislocations of the foot are frequently overlooked or misinterpreted in association with polytrauma, which leads to severe functional impairment in those patients who survive. Repeated clinical examinations and early radiographic examinations are essential in the unconscious patient after resuscitation.
   Emergent indications for surgery even in the presence of multiple injuries are open injuries, incarcerated soft tissues, manifest compartment syndrome of the foot, and neurovascular injury. The decision on limb salvage or amputation has to be individualized with respect to the patient's overall condition and the severity of local trauma to the foot. The"life before limb" principle has to be respected. Emergent reduction of fracture dislocations of the talus, calcaneus, Chopart's and Lisfranc's joints via direct approaches and temporary transfixation with K-wires should be attempted in a first step whenever possible. Additional external fixation facilitates wound care and prevents soft tissue contractions until definite internal fixation becomes feasible. Early soft tissue coverage is always sought in order to avoid infection.

TI  - Choices of seriously ill patients about cardiopulmonary resuscitation: Correlates and outcomes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - PURPOSE: For patients hospitalized with serious illnesses, we identified factors associated with a stated preference to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), examined physician-patient communication about these issues, and deter mined the relationship of patients' preferences to intensity of care and survival.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional evaluation of patient preferences. The setting was five geographically diverse academic acute-care medical centers participating in the SUPPORT (Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments) project. Study participants were hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with 1 of 9 serious illnesses who were interviewed between days 3 and 6 after qualifying for the study. Using standardized interviews, patients provided information on demographics, preferences for CPR and other treatments, quality of life, functional status, perceptions of prognosis, and whether the patient had discussed CPR preferences with his or her physician. Data abstracted from the medical record included physiologic measures, therapeutic intensity, whether CPR was provided, and whether there was a do-not-resuscitate order.
   RESULTS: Of 1,955 eligible patients, 84% were interviewed (mean age 62 years, 58% men, inhospital mortality 7%, 6-month mortality 33%). Of the respondents, 28% did not want CPR. Factors associated independently with not wanting CPR included: hospital site; diagnosis; being older; being more functionally impaired; and patient perception of a worse prognosis. Only 29% of patients had discussed their preferences with their physician; 48% of those who did not want CPR reported such discussions. After adjusting for illness severity and factors associated with CPR preferences, patients not wanting CPR had lower intensity of care; similar inhospital mortality; and higher mortality at 2 and 6 months following study entry.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis, patients' perception of the prognosis, and hospital site were significantly associated with patients' resuscitation preferences after adjusting for patient demographics, severity of illness, and functional status, The rate of discussing CPR was low even for patients who did not want CPR. Patient preferences not to receive CPR were associated with a small decrease in intensity of care but no difference in hospital survival.

TI  - Neuroprognostication of Cardiac Arrest Patients: Outcomes of Importance
T2  - SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - During the last two decades, survival rates after cardiac arrest have increased while the fraction of patients surviving with a severe neurological disability or vegetative state has decreased in many countries. While improved survival is due to improvements in the whole "chain of survival," improved methods for prognostication of neurological outcome may be of major importance for the lower disability rates. Patients who are resuscitated and treated in intensive care will die mainly from the withdrawal of life-sustaining (WLST) therapy due to presumed poor chances of meaningful neurological recovery. To ensure high-quality decision-making and to reduce the risk of premature withdrawal of care, implementation of local protocols is crucial and should be guided by international recommendations. Despite rigorous neurological prognostication, cognitive impairment and related psychological distress and reduced participation in society will still be relevant concerns for cardiac arrest survivors. The commonly used outcome measures are not designed to provide information on these domains. Followup of the cardiac arrest survivor needs to consider the cardiovascular burden as an important factor to prevent cognitive difficulties and future decline.

TI  - Orthopedic surgery in polyhandicapped adults with low mental level
T2  - REVUE DE CHIRURGIE ORTHOPEDIQUE ET REPARATRICE DE L APPAREIL MOTEUR
AB  - Purpose of the study
   The object of this study was to define the requirements for successful management of polyhandicapped adults with low mental level. The goal of surgery was to improve motion performances, suppress pain, improve sitting position, and facilitate handicapped adults life.
   Material
   Thirty-five adults operated during a period of 20 years with a follow-up between 6 months and 20 years were studied. Three of them died within 2 months postoperatively due to causes unrelated to surgery.
   Method
   Surgical procedures performed were adductor tenotomies, femoral or pelvic osteotomies, femoral resections, triple arthrodeses of the foot, spine arthrodesis, lengthening of Achilles tendon, and 2 cases of femoral fractures.
   Results
   The functional goal was achieved in all cases. In 3 cases, we observed postoperative psychic regression.
   Discussion
   The surgeon must make every effort to achieve successful outcome in such cases without creating or exacerbating a behavioral impairment. Team discussions, choice of operative procedures, quality of resuscitation, and rapid return to usual life were the main factors required for successful outcome.
   Conclusion
   Functionnal results obtained regularly in this series justifies using surgery in such cases. Cost is lower, patient's quality of life is improved, the handicapped adults relationships with others are better, and caretaker's tasks are facilitated.

TI  - Urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention as a part of postresuscitation management
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 9th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary
AB  - Because an acute coronary thrombotic event may be viewed as the main trigger of sudden cardiac arrest, urgent coronary angiography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention appeared as a promising tool in the early postresuscitation phase. Unfortunately, large randomized trials, which have unequivocally demonstrated benefits of urgent percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes, systematically excluded patients with preceding cardiac arrest followed by successful reestablishment of spontaneous circulation. There are several nonrandomized trials in patients with electrocardiographic signs of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction after reestablishment of spontaneous circulation which together accumulated 478 patients. After urgent coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 98%. Patency of infarct-related artery was reestablished in 89%. Success of primary percutaneous coronary intervention and hospital survival in patients regaining consciousness soon after reestablishment of spontaneous circulation appeared to be comparable with ST-elevation myocardial infarction population without preceding cardiac arrest. This is in contrast with comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in whom survival to hospital discharge was, despite somewhat smaller patency of infarct-related artery after percutaneous coronary intervention (94% vs. 82%; p = .12), disproportionably decreased to 57% with good neurologic outcome in only 38%. There is evidence that in these patients, urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention can be safely combined with mild induced hypothermia to facilitate neurologic recovery.

TI  - The experience of sudden cardiac arrest: Becoming reawakened to life
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is an event that has tremendous impact on the physical, cognitive and emotional well-being of individuals. Clinical experience and results of various studies indicate that survivors, in addition to having problems related to the underlying disease, have unique needs as a result of the cardiac arrest.
   Aim: The main purpose of this study was to describe survivors' experiences following SCA and resuscitation in order to gain knowledge of the effect of this experience on the needs and concerns of the survivors.
   Methods: This qualitative study draws on interpretive phenomenology. The sample was purposive and data were generated through two semi-structured interviews.
   Results: Seven men aged 50 to 54 years participated. Participants' experience is reflected in the following themes: feelings of insecurity and the need for support; striving to regain former life; emotional challenges; responding to symptoms; and a new view on life.
   Conclusion: The findings illustrate complex effects of the cardiac arrest on the survivor's life. Support after hospital discharge needs to be organized in a more structured fashion. The need for security and support was fundamental and should be addressed with continuity and vigilance in health care.

TI  - Reproductive performance and obstetric outcomes after hysteroscopic septum resection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the effects of hysteroscopic uterine septum resection on the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), live birth rate (LBR) and miscarriage rate.Materials and Method(s)Hospital records of consecutive patients who underwent hysteroscopic uterine septum resection between February 2021 and December 2022 were reviewed. They were telephoned and interviewed about their reproductive performance after surgery, and pregnancy outcomes, if achieved.Results and ConclusionsSixty-nine eligible patients were enrolled. Forty-one (59.4%) of these patients were referred to our clinic for otherwise unexplained infertility of at least 1 year and 28 (40.6%) for pregnancy loss. During the follow-up period, 32 patients conceived. The overall CPR was 46.4%, the LBR per woman was 36.2%, the LBR per pregnancy was 78.1% and the miscarriage rate was 12.5%. The LBRs per pregnancy were 83.3% and 71.4% in the infertility and miscarriage subgroups, respectively. The miscarriage rates per pregnancy were 0% and 28.6% in the infertility and miscarriage subgroups, respectively. Three of 6 patients whose uterine septum was incomplete but prominent became pregnant (CPR: 50.0%), and all pregnancies resulted in live birth (LBR per pregnancy:100%, LBR per woman:50%). Two patients with complete uterine septum didn't achieve pregnancy. Hysteroscopic uterine septum resection may improve the CPR, LBR and miscarriage rates in subfertile population with and without previous pregnancy loss.

TI  - Decompressive craniectomy in the treatment of post-traumatic intracranial hypertension in children: our philosophy and indications
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Decompressive craniotomy (DC) in children is a life-saving procedure for the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension related to traumatic, ischemic and infectious lesions. Different surgical procedures have been proposed including uni or bilateral hemicraniectomy, bi-frontal, bi-temporal, or bi-parietal craniotomies. DC can avoid the cascade of events related to tissue hypoxia, brain perfusion reduction, hypotension and the evolution of brain edema that can be responsible for brain herniation. The monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is very important to take a decision as well as the value of Trans cranial Doppler (TCD). Repeated TCD in the intensive care unit give important information about the decrease of the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and facilitates the decision making. The important question is about how long time we have to wait before to perform the DC. Three conditions can be distinguished: 1) ICP stable and TCD with good parameters: the decision can be postponed; 2) ICP>20 mmHg with good TCD and without clinical signs of deterioration: the decision can be postponed; 3) ICP>20 mmHg with altered CPP and degraded TCD value and clinical signs of brain herniation: the surgical procedure is indicated. The decision of a ventricular drainage can also be discussed but in cases of slit ventricles it is preferable to realize a DC to avoid the problems of multiple taps without finding the ventricular system. In some very specific situations, DC has to be contraindicated. The first one is a prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest with a no-flow longer than 15 minutes and irreversible lesions on the TCD or on the CT-scan. The second most common situation is a patient with GCS of 3 on admission associated with bilaterally fixed dilated pupils. In this case TCD is very useful to document the decrease or the absence of diastolic flux that indicates a very poor cerebral perfusion. In case of severe poly traumatism with multiorgan failure, especially in very severe hemorrhagic shock with incontrollable coagulopathy, the realization of DC is definitely hazardous with y a high risk of cardiac arrest during the surgical procedure. The decision to realize a hemicraniectomy or a bi-frontal craniotomy is related to the presence or not of associated traumatic lesions as hemorrhagic contusions or a sub-dural or extradural hematoma. In cases of diffuse cerebral edema the bi-frontal bone flap is indicated. In all cases a closure of the dura mater with a large dural patch has to be performed avoiding compression of the nervous system. Our results showed a mortality rate of 18%. Eighty percent of the survivors have a good quality of life but only 43% in a scholar age could attend a normal program. Patients treated with DC need a long follow-up and an important rehabilitation program to improve their quality of life. Our report shows that DC in children is effective to control the post-traumatic intracranial hypertension but a long follow-up is recommended to access the sequels and quality of life of these patients.

TI  - Aetiological Profile and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury among Neonates Admitted in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at a Tertiary Care Hospital, Northeast India: A Prospective Cohort Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) affects approximately 8%-24% of critically ill neonates, with a mortality rate ranging from 10%-61%. Groups of newborns at higher risk for AKI include those with perinatal hypoxia, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), premature and very low birth weight infants, and newborns with sepsis. AKI is associated with poor short-term and long-term outcomes and has a multifactorial aetiology.Aim: To evaluate the aetiological profile and short-term outcomes of AKI in neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort (descriptive) study was conducted in the NICU at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, Assam, India, over a period of one year, from September 1, 2021, to August 31, 2022. A total of 100 neonates exhibiting signs and symptoms of AKI according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Detailed neonatal history, including neonatal resuscitation, history of perinatal asphyxia, signs and symptoms of sepsis, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), or any other symptoms, were recorded. The course and outcome of the neonates during their NICU stay were noted. Data were presented in terms of frequency (n) and percentages (%). Results: Among the 100 AKI neonates, 58 were males and 42 were females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.38:1. Out of 100 neonates, birth asphyxia constituted 40 (40%) cases, of cases, followed by sepsis in 30 (30%), RDS 27 (27%), dehydration 2 (2%), and obstructive uropathy in 1 (1%) case. Among the 100 AKI neonates, 64 (64%) cases were discharged, 35 (35%) expired, and 1 (1%) were transferred to the paediatric surgery department.Conclusion: Neonatal AKI is an independent contributor to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early identification and prompt management are crucial for improving outcomes and prognosis.

TI  - Two years' clinical experience with a quadrileaflet stentless bioprosthesis in the mitral position
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEART VALVE DISEASE
CP  - World Symposium on Heart Valve Disease
AB  - Background and aims of the study: Currently available bioprosthetic mitral valves do not provide sufficient durability. A new stentless pericardial prosthesis was designed for better hemodynamic performance and reduction of stress load compared with current stented bioprostheses.
   Methods: Between September 1997 and August 1999, the Quadrileaflet mitral valve (QMV) was implanted in 17 patients at our institution. Four patients had minimally invasive mitral valve replacement. Mean patient age was 62.2 +/- 16.3 years; preoperative NYHA class was 3.06 +/- 0.2; ejection fraction was 64.1 +/- 14.7%. Echocardiography was performed pre-, intra- and postoperatively, and at 3-6, 12 and 24 months follow up.
   Results: Fifteen patients had an uneventful intra- and postoperative course. Two patients died, one from acute left heart failure at 6 h after surgery, and one on the first postoperative day after resuscitation for ventricular fibrillation. A small-sized prosthesis was implanted in four patients, medium-sized in eight and large-sized in five. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 138.3 +/- 37.0 min; mean cross-clamp time was 91.3 +/- 26.3 min. Postoperative control echocardiography showed a mean valve orifice area of 2.5 +/- 0.4 cm(2), transvalvular velocity (V-max) was 1.6 +/- 0.4 m/s, and mean pressure gradient 3.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg. Echocardiographic evaluation after 3, 6 and 12 months showed no significant difference compared with the intraoperative data. Three patients had a minor mitral regurgitation (grade I-II). At 12 months all patients were in NYHA class I or II.
   Conclusion: The implantation technique of the QMV is more demanding, but the prosthesis is a promising alternative to conventional biological mitral valve replacement. Further follow up is needed to confirm these favorable mid-term results.

TI  - Medical Conditions Associated with Out-of-Hospital Endotracheal Intubation
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background. While prior studies describe the clinical presentation of patients requiring paramedic out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation (ETI), limited data characterize the underlying medical conditions or comorbidities. Objective. To characterize the medical conditions and comorbidities of patients receiving successful paramedic out-of-hospital ETI. Methods. We used Pennsylvania statewide emergency medical services (EMS) clinical data, including all successful ETIs performed during 2003--2005. Using multiple imputation triple-match algorithms, we probabilistically linked EMS ETI to statewide death and hospital admission data. Each hospitalization record contained one primary and up to eight secondary diagnoses, classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). We determined the proportion of patients in each major ICD-9-CM diagnostic group and subgroup. We calculated the Charlson Comorbidity Index score for each patient. Using binomial proportions with confidence intervals (CIs), we analyzed the data and combined imputed results using Rubin's method. Results. Across the imputed sets, we linked 25,733 (77.7%% linkage) successful ETIs to death or hospital records; 56.3%% patients died before and 43.7%% survived to hospital admission. Of the 14,478 patients who died before hospital admission, most (92.7%%; 95%% CI: 92.5--93.3%%) had presented to EMS in cardiac arrest. Of the 11,255 hospitalized patents, the leading primary diagnoses were circulatory diseases (32.0%%; 95%% CI: 30.2--33.7%%), respiratory diseases (22.8%%; 95%% CI: 21.9--23.7%%), and injury or poisoning (25.2%%; 95%% CI: 22.7--27.8%%). Prominent primary diagnosis subgroups included asphyxia and respiratory failure (15.2%%), traumatic brain injury and skull fractures (11.3%%), acute myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease (10.9%%), poisonings and drug and alcohol disorders (6.7%%), dysrhythmias (6.7%%), hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke (5.9%%), acute heart failure and cardiomyopathies (5.6%%), pneumonia and aspiration (4.9%%), and sepsis, septicemia, and septic shock (3.2%%). Most of the admitted ETI patients had a secondary circulatory (70.8%%), respiratory (61.4%%), or endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic (51.4%%) secondary diagnosis. The mean Charlson Index score was 1.6 (95%% CI: 1.5--1.7). Conclusions. The majority of successful paramedic ETIs occur on patients with cardiac arrest and circulatory and respiratory conditions. Injuries, poisonings, and other conditions compromise smaller but important portions of the paramedic ETI pool. Patients undergoing ETI have multiple comorbidities. These findings may guide the systemic planning of paramedic airway management care and education.

TI  - Automated external defibrillators in the hospital: A case of medical reversal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) emerged in the 1980s as an important innovation in pre-hospital emergency cardiac care (ECC). In the years since, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the International Liaison Committee for Resuscitation (ILCOR) have promoted AED technology for use in hospitals as well, resulting in the widespread purchase and use of AED-capable defibrillators. In-hospital use of AEDs now appears to have decreased survival from cardiac arrests. This article will look at the use of AEDs in hospitals as a case of "medical reversal." Medical reversal occurs when an accepted, widely used treatment is found to be ineffective or even harmful. This article will discuss the issue of AEDs in the hospital using a conceptual framework provided by recent work on medical reversal. It will go on to consider the implications of the reversal for in-hospital resuscitation programs and emergency medicine more generally. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Difficult Case of Necrotizing Fasciitis Caused By Acinetobacter baumannii
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOWER EXTREMITY WOUNDS
AB  - This study reports the case of a 55-year-old woman with diabetes with a necrotizing fasciitis of the right lower limb and the perineum, first admitted at the emergency department for septic shock with cardiac arrest, and later transferred to the department of surgery. Microbiological and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis caused by Acinetobacter baumanii. A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was administered and later readjusted according to the results of microbiological culture. Intensive hemodynamic support was required. Wounds were dressed daily with a 3 percent boric acid solution and a silver sulfadiazine-impregnated dressing. An extensive surgical debridement was promptly performed and repeated until complete control of the infection. Wounds were finally covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The infection was overcome 35 days after admission. The graft take was 100%. Postoperative rehabilitation was required because of the functional limitation of lower limb movements. Follow-up at 6 months showed no functional deficit and an acceptable aesthetic result. Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening disorder, especially in patients with diabetes, whose clinical diagnosis may sometimes be challenging. Early recognition and treatment represent the most important factors influencing survival.

TI  - Prognosis, risk factors, and scoring model of patients resuscitated from traumatic cardiac arrest: A multicenter observational study in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUNDA subset of patients with traumatic cardiac arrest is salvageable when the reversible causes of cardiac arrest are promptly treated. However, prognosis and risk factors of survivors upon hospital admission after traumatic cardiac arrest remain unclear. We aimed to describe the outcomes, identify risk factors, and develop a simple risk-scoring model for patients resuscitated from traumatic cardiac arrest.METHODSThis observational multicenter study analyzed data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021. Patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the emergency department and survived to the day after hospital admission for traumatic cardiac arrest were included. Factors associated with survival to hospital discharge were determined using mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression analysis. A simple scoring model was developed to stratify the probability of survival to hospital discharge.RESULTSIn total, 452 patients from 119 hospitals (median age, 64 years; 334 [74.4%] men) were included in the analysis. Of these, 130 (28.8%) survived until discharge. Penetrating injury, signs of life upon hospital arrival, and Injury Severity Score were significantly associated with survival at hospital discharge. A scoring model that assigned 1 point each for penetrating injury and signs of life upon hospital arrival effectively stratified the probability of survival to hospital discharge, with scores of 0, 1, and 2 corresponding to survival probabilities of 12.2%, 35.2%, and 83.3%, respectively.CONCLUSIONThis study described the outcomes and risk factors of patients resuscitated from traumatic cardiac arrest. Our simple scoring model effectively stratified the likelihood of survival to hospital discharge.LEVEL OF EVIDENCETherapeutic/Care Management; Level III.

TI  - Protocolised reduction of non-resuscitation fluids versus usual care in patients with septic shock (REDUSE): a protocol for a multicentre feasibility trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Administration of large volumes of fluids is associated with poor outcome in septic shock. Recent data suggest that non-resuscitation fluids are the major source of fluids in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients suffering from septic shock. The present trial is designed to test the hypothesis that a protocol targeting this source of fluids can reduce fluid administration compared with usual care.Methods and analysis The design will be a multicentre, randomised, feasibility trial. Adult patients admitted to ICUs with septic shock will be randomised within 12 hours of admission to receive non-resuscitation fluids either according to a restrictive protocol or to receive usual care. The healthcare providers involved in the care of participants will not be blinded. The participants, outcome assessors at the 6-month follow-up and statisticians will be blinded. Primary outcome will be litres of fluids administered within 3 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes will be proportion of randomised participants with outcome data on all-cause mortality; days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 90 days of inclusion; any acute kidney injury and ischaemic events in the ICU (cerebral, cardiac, intestinal or limb ischaemia); proportion of surviving randomised patients who were assessed by European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 5-Level questionnaire and Montreal Cognitive Assessment; proportion of all eligible patients who were randomised and proportion of participants experiencing at least one protocol violation.Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained in Sweden. Results of the primary and secondary outcomes will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Rapid tumor lysis syndrome in a patient with metastatic colon cancer as a complication of treatment with 5-fluorouracil/leucoverin and irinotecan
T2  - TUMORI
AB  - Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially fatal complication of anticancer therapy that is usually seen in patients with bulky, rapidly proliferating, treatment-sensitive tumors such as hematological malignancies, but it rarely occurs in a variety of solid tumors such as colorectal carcinoma. Combination chemotherapy with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucoverin and irinotecan has been recently accepted as the first treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer. We present a case of tumor lysis syndrome in a patient with metastatic colon carcinoma that occurred 72 hrs after the initial course of a combination chemotherapy with irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil/leucoverin. Despite the immediate treatment with aggressive hydration by a sodium bicarbonate infusion, followed by forced diuresis and uricolytic therapy, he died of a sudden cardiac arrest complicated by acute renal failure. Our case indicates that administration of 5-fluorouracil/leucoverin and irinotecan for bulky tumors of colorectal origin with a rapid doubling time may induce an acute tumor lysis syndrome, which necessitates frequent laboratory monitoring and a close follow-up of the patient as well as prompt initiation of appropriate therapeutic measures.

TI  - Measurement properties of the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) among cardiac arrest survivors - A Rasch evaluation study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors often face significant health challenges, including insomnia, which can adversely affect their healthrelated quality of life. The Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) is a brief, self-reported instrument designed to screen for insomnia. This study aimed to identify the measurement properties of the MISS in CA survivors and to explore a relevant cut-off score. Methods: Data were collected from two studies: a health survey of CA survivors and a sub-study of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on targeted temperature management (TTM2). A total of 269 CA survivors participated, with 212 from the survey and 57 from the RCT, the data was collected 6- 7 months after CA. The MISS was evaluated using the polytomous Rasch model, focusing on model fit, local independence, response category functioning, targeting, reliability, and differential item functioning (DIF). Results: In total, 212 participants were males and 57 females, with a mean age of 66 years. Overall, 51% had survived in-hospital CA and 49% outof-hospital CA. The MISS exhibited acceptable model fit and targeting, with no disordered thresholds or DIF for age, sex, or place of arrest. The reliability was acceptable. The suggested optimal cut-off score for identifying insomnia was >6 points. Conclusions: The findings indicate that MISS is a valid and reliable screening instrument for insomnia in CA survivors. These results support the use of MISS for screening insomnia in CA survivors.

TI  - Epidemiology of sudden cardiac death in Cameroon: the first population-based cohort survey in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Incidence estimates of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are unknown.
   Method: Over 12 months, the household administrative office and health community committee within neighbourhoods in two health areas of Douala, Cameroon, registered all deaths among 86 188 inhabitants aged >18 years. As part of an extended multi-source surveillance system, the Emergency Medical Service (EMS), local medical examiners and district hospital mortuaries were also surveyed. Whereas two physicians investigated every natural death, two cardiologists reviewed all unexpected natural deaths.
   Results: There were 288 all-cause deaths and 27 (9.4%) were SCD. The crude incidence rate was 31.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.3-40.6]/100 000 person-years. The agestandardized rate by the African standard population was 33.6 (95% CI: 22.4-44.9)/100 000 person-years. Death occurred at night in 37% of cases, including 11% of patients who died while asleep. Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest occurred in 63% of cases, 55.5% of which occurred at home. Of the 88.9% cases of witnessed cardiac arrest, 63% occurred in the presence of a family member and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted only in 3.7%.
   Conclusion: The burden of SCD in this African population is heavy with distinct characteristics, whereas awareness of SCD and prompt resuscitation efforts appear suboptimal.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Rituximab for New-Onset Generalized Myasthenia Gravis The RINOMAX Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NEUROLOGY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Rituximab is a third-line option for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) based on empirical evidence, but its effect in new-onset disease is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with placebo as an add-on to standard of care for MG.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study took place throughout 48 weeks at 7 regional clinics in Sweden. Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, onset of generalized symptoms within 12 months or less, and a Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score of 6 or more. Patients were screened from October 20, 2016, to March 2, 2020. Key exclusion criteria included pure ocular MG, suspected thymoma, previous thymectomy, and prior noncorticosteroid immunosuppressants or high doses of corticosteroids.
   INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized 1:1 without stratification to a single intravenous infusion of 500 mg of rituximab or matching placebo.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Minimal disease manifestations at 16 weeks defined as a QMG score of 4 or less with prednisolone, 10 mg or less daily, and no rescue treatment.
   RESULTS Of 87 potentially eligible patients, 25 were randomized to rituximab (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [13.4] years; 7 [28%] female) and 22 to placebo (mean [SD] age, 58 [18.6] years; 7 [32%] female). Compared with placebo, a greater proportion with rituximab met the primary end point; 71% (17 of 24) in the rituximab group vs 29% (6 of 21) in the placebo group (Fisher exact test P = .007; probability ratio, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.20-5.11]). Secondary end points, comparing changes in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living and Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life at 16 weeks with QMG at 24 weeks did not differ between groups with censoring for rescue treatment (per-protocol analysis) but were in favor of active treatment when rescue treatment was taken into account by worst rank imputation (post hoc analysis). Rescue treatments were also more frequent in the placebo arm (rituximab: 1 [4%]; placebo, 8 [36%]). One patient in the placebo arm had a myocardial infarction with cardiac arrest and 1 patient in the active arm experienced a fatal cardiac event.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A single dose of 500 mg of rituximab was associated with greater probability of minimal MG manifestations and reduced need of rescue medications compared with placebo. Further studies are needed to address long-term benefit-risk balance with this treatment.

TI  - SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA CARDIOVERTED BY AN AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEBRILLATOR IN A 9-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH A HISTORY OF WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Early defibrillation for cardiac arrest patients is a formidable link in the chain of survival promulgated by the American Heart Association. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) provide public access defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and improve survivability. AEDs are only approved for use in patients in cardiac arrest; defibrillation may be inadvertently advised if utilized on a patient not experiencing cardiac arrest. We describe a case report of an AED cardioversion of a stable, pediatric patient with acute supraventricular tachycardia secondary to underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. We discuss general AED principles, the cardioversion function on the particular AED used in this encounter, and the importance of community and organizational policies to encourage the correct application of AEDs.

TI  - Quality of life and performance status after cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A study in Cova da Beira University Hospital Center's intensive care unit
T2  - REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - Introduction and Objectives: Cardiac arrest (CA) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many studies focus on survival, but few explore the outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyze the survival curve, independence, quality of life, and performance status after CA. Methods: This retrospective study included adults admitted to the intensive care unit of Cova da Beira University Hospital Center after CA between 2015 and 2019. We analyzed patient records and applied a questionnaire including EuroQoL's EQ-5D-3L and ECOG performance status. Results: Ninety-seven patients were included (mean age 75.74 years). Thirty-one patients (32.0%) survived to hospital discharge. There was a significant loss of independence for activities of daily living, with 50.0% of those previously independent becoming dependent and 47.5% of those previously at home being institutionalized. Diabetes, female gender, and length of hospital stay were especially impactful on these findings. One year after CA, only 20.6% were alive and only 13.4% (65% of the one-year survivors) were independent. Nine patients answered our questionnaire. Mean EQ-5D quality of life index (0.528 +/- 0.297) and the most affected domains ('Pain/discomfort' and 'Anxiety/depression') were similar to the Portuguese population aged >30 years. However, 66.6% reported a decline in their quality of life. Lastly, seven respondents had a good performance status (ECOG 0-1). Conclusions: There was a significant loss of independence after CA. Moreover, despite the acceptable performance status and the quality of life results being similar to the general population, there was a perceived deterioration post-CA. Ultimately, we emphasize the need to improve care for these patients. (c) 2024 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espan(SIC), S.L.U.

TI  - Palliative care in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review for clinicians
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF MEDICINE
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive condition characterized by airflow obstruction which ultimately kills many patients. It is common in both men and women and there is a 24-30% 5-year survival rate in the UK for those with severe disease. The annual death rate in the UK from COPD approaches that from lung cancer. Patients' symptoms can be improved by drug therapy, but stopping smoking is also an effective way of improving the outcome in patients at all stages of COPD.
   Predicting prognosis has been difficult in COPE) due to the variable illness trajectory. However, assessment of severity of lung function impairment, frequency of exacerbations and requirement for long term oxygen therapy can help identify patients entering the final 12 months of life. Symptom burden and impact off activities of daily living for patients with COPE) are comparable with that of Cancer patients, and palliative care approaches are equally necessary, yet few publications exist to guide clinicians in this area. An evidence base exists for the management of dyspnoea with oxygen therapy and opioid drugs. There is less evidence for the effective treatment of depression and anxiety, fatigue and pain, and treatment is based on experience and considered best practice. This review discusses the problems that patients experience and offers practical guidance.
   The management of patients should be shared between primary and secondary care, with multidisciplinary teams being involved at an early stage. Patients and their families require honest and clear communication about the condition and what to expect in the future. The strict application of advance care planning and directives may not be feasible of appropriate, but there is evidence that attitudes towards resuscitation and artificial ventilation can be explored without distress. The requirement by patients and carers for surveillance and timely support is acknowledged, but how to provide such input is as yet unclear, with little evidence to Support the widespread implementation of nurse-led management interventions. The hospice movement has become increasingly involved in the management of life-threatening, non-malignant disease and should be involved in the multidisciplinary care of patients dying from COPD.

TI  - Magnitude of temperature elevation is associated with neurologic and survival outcomes in resuscitated cardiac arrest patients with postrewarming pyrexia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose: Avoidance of pyrexia is recommended in resuscitation guidelines, including after treatment with targeted temperature management (TTM). Which aspects of postresuscitation pyrexia are harmful and modifiable have not been conclusively determined.
   Materials and methods: This retrospective multicenter registry study collected serial temperatures during 72 hours postrewarming to assess the relationship between 3 aspects of pyrexia (maximum temperature, pyrexia duration, timing of first pyrexia) and neurologic outcome (primary) and survival (secondary) at hospital discharge. Adult TIM-treated patients from 13 US hospitals between 2005 and 2015 were included.
   Results: One hundred seventy-nine of 465 patients had at least 1 temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C. Pyrexic temperatures were associated with better survival than nonpyrexic temperatures (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.00-2.35). Higher maximum temperature was associated with worse outcome (neurologic aOR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.10-0.84]; survival aOR, 0.25 [95% Cl, 0.10-0.59]) in pyrexic patients. There was no significant relationship between pyrexia duration and outcomes unless duration was calculated as hours greater than or equal to 38.8 degrees C, when longer duration was associated with worse outcomes (neurologic aOR, 0.86 [95% Cl, 0.75-1.00]; survival aOR, 0.82 [95% Cl, 0.72-0.93]).
   Conclusions: In postarrest TrM-treated patients, pyrexia was associated with increased survival. Patients experiencing postrewarming pyrexia had worse outcomes at higher temperatures. Longer pyrexia duration was associated with worse outcomes at higher temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - European standard internal telephone number 2222 for in-hospital emergency calls: A national survey in all French military training hospitals
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: In 2016, three European scientific societies called for standardization to the "2222" as a European unique phone number in case of in-hospital emergencies. This study describes the management of in-hospital emergency calls in all French military training hospitals and aims to detail their original transition, for the first time in France, to the "2222".
   Methods: An electronic standardized questionnaire was emailed to heads of rapid response teams in the eight French military training hospitals.
   Results: All participants answered the questionnaire (100%). The eight French military training hospitals had a specific procedure for management of in-hospital emergencies. Six hospitals already used a unique phone number for in-hospital emergencies, but none of them were using the 2222 in March 2019. Two hospitals still used several phone numbers for in-hospital emergencies, mainly due to historical and local arrangements. Rapid response teams included at least a physician and a nurse. There was a discussion to switch to "2222" as the unique phone number for inhospital emergencies in two hospitals. In both, the discussions involved hospital executive officers, medical teams, rapid response teams and technical teams leading to a step-by-step transition. Finally, in October 2019, these two hospitals launched the "2222" procedure for in-hospital emergencies.
   Conclusion: This study found a large disparity in the eight French military training hospitals, concerning in-hospital emergency protocols. Two French military training hospitals launched the "2222" procedure for the first time in France. Further efforts are still needed to continue to promote the use of the 2222 as a European unique phone number for in-hospital emergencies.

TI  - UNEXPECTED CARDIAC-ARREST DURING SPINAL-ANESTHESIA - A CLOSED CLAIMS ANALYSIS OF PREDISPOSING FACTORS
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Fourteen cases of sudden cardiac arrest in healthy patients who received spinal anesthesia were discovered in a preliminary review of 900 closed insurance claims for major anesthetic mishaps. All patients were resuscitated from the intraoperative cardiac arrest, but six suffered such severe neurologic injury that they died in hospital. Of the eight survivors, only one exhibited sufficient neurologic recovery to allow independence in daily self-care. In view of the unexpected nature of the  cardiac arrests, as well as the ultimate severity of injury, these cases were analyzed in detail to determine whether there were recurring patterns of management that may have contributed to the occurrence or outcome of these anesthetic mishaps. Two patterns were identified. The first was the intraoperative use of sufficient sedation to produce a comfortable-appearing, sleep-like state in which there was no spontaneous verbalization. Cyanosis frequently heralded the onset of cardiac arrest in  patients exhibiting this degree of sedation, suggesting that unappreciated respiratory insufficiency may have played an important role. The second pattern appeared to be an inadequate appreciation of the interaction between sympathetic blockade during high spinal anesthesia and the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Prompt augmentation of central venous filling through the use of a potent .alpha.-agonist and positional change might have improved organ perfusion, shortened the duration of  cardiac arrest, and lessened the degree of neurologic damage.

TI  - A mind-body resilience intervention for emotional distress in cardiac arrest survivors and their informal caregivers - Recovering together after cardiac arrest: Protocol for an open pilot trial
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Background: Chronic emotional distress among cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and their caregivers is prevalent and worsens quality of life and recovery. Interventions to prevent chronic distress post-CA are needed. We developed Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest (RT-CA), an intervention to increase resiliency in CA survivor-caregiver dyads (pairs). Method: We will conduct an open pilot clinical trial of RT-CA to examine preliminary feasibility and refine the intervention based on participant feedback. We will enroll at least 7 CA survivor-caregiver dyads during their hospitalization at a single academic medical center. We will identify eligible survivors by screening admission reports and through referrals from medical staff. Inclusion criteria: Survivors - sufficient cognitive status to meaningfully participate (Short Form of the Mini Mental State Exam >= 5). Dyads - English-speakers; one member must have clinically significant distress (>= 8 on either Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale). Procedure: dyads will participate in 6, 30-45 min sessions with a study clinician. Sessions will include mind-body coping skills training and provision of anticipatory guidance and resources to navigate CA-survivorship. Dyads will complete pre- and post-test measures of emotional distress and treatment targets. We will calculate frequencies and proportions of our primary outcomes (feasibility - recruitment, assessments, adherence, therapist fidelity and acceptability/credibility). After completing post-test assessments, dyads will provide feedback via exit interviews. We will integrate qualitative and quantitative data using explanatory-sequential mixed-methods. Discussion: We will use our findings to refine RT-CA content and study procedures. If successful, RT-CA has potential to significantly improve quality of survivorship for CA survivors and their caregivers.

TI  - PROspective Meta-analysis Of Trials of Initial Oxygen in preterm Newborns (PROMOTION): Protocol for a systematic review and prospective meta-analysis with individual participant data on initial oxygen concentration for resuscitation of preterm infants
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - BackgroundClinicians favour low oxygen concentrations when resuscitating preterm infants immediately after birth despite inconclusive evidence to support this practice. Prospective meta-analysis (PMA) is a novel approach where studies are identified as eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis before their results are known. AimsTo explore whether high (60%) or low (30%) oxygen is associated with greater efficacy and safety for the initial resuscitation (immediately after birth) of preterm infants born at We will conduct a prospective meta-analysis (PMA) with individual participant data (IPD). We will perform a systematic search to identify ongoing RCTs including infants <29 weeks' gestation randomised to high (60%) or low (30%) oxygen for initial resuscitation after birth. IPD will be sought for all infants randomised for the purpose of meta-analysis. We will employ a one-stage random-effects approach to IPD meta-analysis. Potential heterogeneity and the differential effect of high or low oxygen will be explored through subgroup and interaction analyses. The primary outcome of this study is all-cause mortality prior to hospital discharge. There will be a follow-up analysis of neurodevelopmental outcomes once available. Results/ConclusionThe results of neonatal outcomes at hospital discharge are expected by 2025, and neurodevelopmental outcomes by 2027.

TI  - A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study of altered functional brain activity in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurological outcome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - PurposeTo investigate the spontaneous brain activity alterations in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) with good neurological outcome using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) methods. Materials and methodsThirteen CA survivors with favorable neurological outcomes and 13 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent rs-fMRI scans. The ALFF and ReHo methods were applied to assess the regional intensity and synchronization of spontaneous brain activity. Correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationships between the mean ALFF and ReHo values in significant clusters and clinical parameters. ResultsThe survivors of CA showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left postcentral gyrus and precentral gyrus and increased ALFF values in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus than HCs. Significantly decreased ReHo values were observed in the left inferior occipital gyrus and middle occipital gyrus in the patients. Mean ALFF values in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were positively correlated with the time to return of spontaneous circulation (r = 0.794, p = 0.006) in the patient group. ConclusionFunctional activity alterations in the brain areas corresponding to known cognitive and physical impairments were observed in CA survivors with preserved neurological function. Our results could advance the understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying the residual deficits in those patients.

TI  - Acute left main coronary occlusion after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: life-saving intervention using the snare technique-a case report
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has rapidly evolved and changed the field of structural cardiovascular intervention. Its advances lead to a marked reduction in the risk of complications and improved outcomes. However, TAVI is still associated with potential serious complications. Case summary A 73-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVI using a 34-mm self-expanding aortic bioprosthesis. After valve deployment, the patient rapidly progressed to cardiac arrest. Acute left main occlusion, due to high valve implantation, was promptly recognized and advanced life support immediately initiated. Concomitantly, the valve was successfully retrieved toward the ascending aorta using the snare technique, resulting in immediate restoration of flow and successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Subsequently, a 29-mm balloon-expandable aortic bioprosthesis was uneventfully implanted. After TAVI, the patient had a remarkable clinical evolution and was discharged home at hospitalization day five without relevant electrocardiographic nor echocardiographic disturbances. At six-month follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a normofunctional aortic bioprosthesis with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Discussion Acute coronary occlusion is a rare and life-threating complication of TAVI that may be prevented with accurate procedure planning. Pre-procedural computed tomography angiography is essential for a comprehensive patient evaluation, allowing appropriate valve selection, a key factor for successful management. Self-expandable valve retrieval with snare technique can be an appropriate strategy for the management of this complication. This case highlights the importance of performing these procedures in highly experienced centres and with fully equipped catheterization laboratories to allow timely interventions when facing unexpected events.

TI  - Endovascular treatment for acute traumatic thoracic aortic transection
T2  - ULUSAL TRAVMA VE ACIL CERRAHI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF TRAUMA & EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to present our experience in patients with acute traumatic thoracic aortic transection treated by endovascular stent-graft.
   METHODS: From October 2011 to October 2014, eleven patients were brought to our hospitals after suffering motor vehicle accident or fall from height. Computed tomography revealed acute traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta at the aortic isthmus just distal to the left subclavian artery in nine patients, at the middle or distal thoracic aorta in two, and both aortic isthmus and middle thoracic aorta in one. Endovascular technique was preferred as the treatment modality. All patients, except one, were treated within twelve hours of diagnosis.
   RESULTS: Deployment of stent-grafts was successful in all cases. The stent-grafts were oversized between 10% and 20%. The origin of left subclavian artery was covered with stent-graft in six patients to achieve adequate proximal landing zone. In two of them, carotico-subclavian bypass and periscope graft placement were applied to maintain subclavian artery blood flow. There were no procedure related deaths, paraplegia or ischemic complications. A patient with cardiac arrest, on whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation and transient aortic balloon occlusion within the aorta were applied in the angiography suit died at the postoperative twelve hours. Mean hospital stay after procedures was 14.8 days (range, 4-60 days). Mean follow-up time of ten patients was 16.6 months (range, 1-36 months).
   CONCLUSION: Our study supports that thoracic endovascular aortic stenting for acute transection is promising in terms of short- and mid-term results similar to other studies in the literature.

TI  - Differential Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Neurons and Astrocytes Following Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Hypothermia
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
AB  - The close interaction between neurons and astrocytes has been extensively studied. However, the specific behavior of these cells after ischemia-reperfusion injury and hypothermia remains poorly characterized. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondria function and putative transference between neurons and astrocytes may play a fundamental role in adaptive and homeostatic responses after systemic insults such as cardiac arrest, which highlights the importance of a better understanding of how neurons and astrocytes behave individually in these settings. Brain injury is one of the most important challenges in post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and therapeutic hypothermia remains the single, gold standard treatment for neuroprotection after cardiac arrest. In our study, we modeled ischemia-reperfusion injury by using in vitro enhanced oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (eOGD-R) and subsequent hypothermia (HPT) (31.5 degrees C) to cell lines of neurons (HT-22) and astrocytes (C8-D1A) with/without hypothermia. Using cell lysis (LDH; lactate dehydrogenase) as a measure of membrane integrity and cell viability, we found that neurons were more susceptible to eOGD-R when compared with astrocytes. However, they benefited significantly from HPT, while the HPT effect after eOGD-R on astrocytes was negligible. Similarly, eOGD-R caused a more significant reduction in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in neurons than astrocytes, and the ATP-enhancing effects from HPT were more prominent in neurons than astrocytes. In both neurons and astrocytes, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed higher ROS output following eOGD-R, with a non-significant trend of differential reduction observed in neurons. HPT after eOGD-R effectively downregulated ROS in both cells; however, the effect was significantly more effective in neurons. Lipid peroxidation was higher after eOGD-R in neurons, while in astrocytes, the increase was not statistically significant. Interestingly, HPT had similar effects on the reduction in lipoperoxidation after eOGD-R with both types of cells. While glutathione (GSH) levels were downregulated after eOGD-R in both cells, HPT enhanced GSH in astrocytes, but worsened GSH in neurons. In conclusion, neuron and astrocyte cultures respond differently to eOGD-R and eOGD-R + HTP treatments. Neurons showed higher sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion insults than astrocytes; however, they benefited more from HPT therapy. These data suggest that given the differential effects from HPT in neurons and astrocytes, future therapeutic developments could potentially enhance HPT outcomes by means of neuronal and astrocytic targeted therapies.

TI  - Effects of intracerebroventricular application of insulin-like growth factor 1 and its N-terminal tripeptide on cerebral recovery following cardiac arrest in rats
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Following global cerebral ischaemia due to cardiac arrest (CA), selective neuronal vulnerability and delayed neuronal death with distinct signs of apoptosis could be observed in certain areas of the brain. Growth hormones like the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and the bioactive N-terminal tripeptide of IGF-1, glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE), exhibit strong protective properties in focal ischaemia in vivo and in vitro. To examine these promising effects on neuronal survival and cerebral recovery after experimental cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the most vulnerable hippocampal CA-1 sector was investigated.
   Methods: After 6 min of CA, 54 male Wistar rats were resuscitated and were randomly assigned to 3 groups (IGF-1, GPE vs. placebo; n = 6 per group) and 3 different reperfusion periods. Intracerebroventricular application of IGF-1 (1.25 mu g h(-1)), GPE (50 ng h(-1)) and placebo was performed using osmotic minipumps up to day 7 following reperfusion. After 3, 7 and 14 days, coronal brain sections were analysed by counting Nissl-positive (i.e. viable) neurons and TUNEL-positive (i.e. apoptotic) cells. All experiments were performed in a randomised and blinded setting.
   Results: In all groups in the hippocampal CA-1 sector typical delayed neurodegeneration from day 3 to day 14 after CA could be found. No significant increase of the number of Nissl-positive neurons after IGF-1-treatment (p = 0.18) as well as after GPE-treatment (p = 0.14) could be observed. The number of TUNEL-positive cells could not be reduced significantly in the IGF-1 group (p = 0.13), whereas GPE treatment revealed significant less TUNEL-positive cells (p = 0.02). This was primarily an effect in the early phase (day 3: p = 0.02) of reperfusion and was no more detectable 7 days (p = 0.69) and 14 days after ROSC (p = 0.30).
   Conclusion: Despite the well known neuroprotective properties of IGF-1 and GPE in ischaemic induced neuronal degeneration, this model could only reveal a short-term beneficial effect of GPE after experimental cardiac arrest in rats.

TI  - A rare presentation of measles and post-measles complications in a neonate: case report
T2  - EGYPTIAN PEDIATRIC ASSOCIATION GAZETTE
AB  - BackgroundMeasles is a common infection in children. Measles infection in children less than 6 months of age is very rare since maternal antibodies play a major role in the prevention of the disease.Case presentationHere we present a rare case of a 34-day-old infant, who had a history of fever with a rash on the 18th day of life and significant history of measles contact with mother and elder brother. The patient presented to us with septic shock and multiorgan involvement in the form of pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis with severe dehydration, mucopurulent conjunctivitis, and post-measles encephalitis. The patient had a strong measles contact and epidemiological linkage to the measles epicenter, Govandi (a locality in the Mumbai region of western India), so measles IgM antibody was obtained which were significantly raised.The patient was successfully revived from this critical presentation with early and appropriate resuscitation, timely ionotropic support, and the use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient required intensive unit care for four days and was started on feeds and discharged after 12 days of hospital stay. On follow-up, the patient is doing well and gaining weight.Case presentationHere we present a rare case of a 34-day-old infant, who had a history of fever with a rash on the 18th day of life and significant history of measles contact with mother and elder brother.

AB  - BACKGROUND International guidelines advise universal beta- blocker therapy as either a class I (symptomatic or QTc > 470 ms) or class II (asymptomatic and QTc < 470 ms) recommendation for treatment of long QT syndrome (LQTS). OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of a highly selected cohort of patients with LQTS managed with an observation -only (intentional nontreatment) strategy. METHODS The cohort was derived from a comprehensive retrospec- tive registry of patients with LQTS. Clinical phenotype and genotype data were collected via review of electronic health records. RESULTS Among 661 patients with LQTS, 55 (8.3%) asymptomatic patients (53% female; 16 age < 18 years) were managed with inten- tional nontherapy. Only preventative measures were advised. Mean age at diagnosis was 37.8 +/- 21.2 years. Mean QTc was 448 +/- 30 ms. None of the patients experienced an LQTS-triggered cardiac event over mean follow-up of 7.5 +/- 4.3 years. Compared to the largertreated cohort, this intentionally untreated cohort was less symp- tomatic, was older at diagnosis, and had lower resting QTc values ( P < .0001). CONCLUSION After careful clinical evaluation, risk assessment, and institution of precautionary measures, an observation -only strategy may be considered in a highly selected group of LQTS patients with a clinical pro fi le that includes asymptomatic status, older age at diagnosis, and QTc < 470 ms, with excellent outcomes and better quality of life than LQTS patients treated with beta- blocker. LQTS patients with this low -risk pro fi le should not receive a prophylactic implantable cardioverter -de fi brillator.

TI  - REEMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF THE AUTOMATIC CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - One hundred one patients who received an implantable automatic cardioverter defibrillator (ACD) were evaluated to determine the reemployment rate and factors associated with return to work. Forty-seven were employed before ACD implantation. Their mean (.+-. standard deviation) age was 53 .+-. 11 years, 83% were men, 75% had coronary artery disease, 76% presented with cardiac arrest and 28% had concomitant cardiac surgery. The mean ejection fraction of these patients was 0.41 .+-. 0.15. At follow-up, 29 patients (62%) had resumed work at 11 .+-. 9 weeks after implantation. Those who returned to work were better educated (15 vs 11 years, p < 0.001) and less likely to have a history of prior myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between patients who returned to work and those who did not in terms of age, sex, race, functional class, ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease, reason for ACD, or concomitant surgery. Multivariate analysis revealed that level of education was the single best predictor of reemployment status. The only other factors found to add significant predictive power in a stepwise analysis were extent of coronary artery disease and marital status. The model using these 3 variables had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 72%. It was concluded that (1) most patients employed before ACD implantation are able to return to work after the procedure, and (2) nonmedical factors play an important role in the resumption of work-related activities. These findings have important quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness implications for ACD implantees.

TI  - Improving Diagnosis and Prognosis in Acute Severe Brain Injury: A Multimodal Imaging Protocol
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Multi-modal neuroimaging techniques have the potential to dramatically improve the diagnosis of the level consciousness and prognostication of neurological outcome for patients with severe brain injury in the intensive care unit (ICU). This protocol describes a study that will utilize functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure and map the brain activity of acute critically ill patients. Our goal is to investigate whether these modalities can provide objective and quantifiable indicators of good neurological outcome and reliably detect conscious awareness. To this end, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal cohort study to validate the prognostic and diagnostic utility of neuroimaging techniques in the ICU. We will recruit 350 individuals from two ICUs over the course of 7 years. Participants will undergo fMRI, EEG, and fNIRS testing several times over the first 10 days of care to assess for residual cognitive function and evidence of covert awareness. Patients who regain behavioral awareness will be asked to complete web-based neurocognitive tests for 1 year, as well as return for follow up neuroimaging to determine which acute imaging features are most predictive of cognitive and functional recovery. Ultimately, multi-modal neuroimaging techniques may improve the clinical assessments of patients' level of consciousness, aid in the prediction of outcome, and facilitate efforts to find interventional methods that improve recovery and quality of life.

TI  - Therapeutic and prognostic implications of subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients who suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation during an emergency room stay
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB  - Objective: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a well-known cause of sudden cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Even after successful cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the prognosis of patients following an aneurysmal SAH presenting with CPA remains dismal. However, there have been anecdotal reports of good outcomes with appropriate interventions. Pseudo-SAH resulting from marked elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) after CPR, can mimic SAH in head computed tomographic (CT) scan. Such manifestations hamper resuscitation or delay appropriate neurosurgical management. This study assessed incidence and clinical characteristics of SAH-CPR or pseudo-SAH-CPR patients among non-traumatic CPA-CPR patients, and investigated their therapeutic and prognostic implication.
   Methods: During the 5-year observation period, 63 non-traumatic coma patients with CT evidence of high attenuation areas in the basal cistern who suffered arrest and underwent CPR during initial resuscitation in the emergency room, were reviewed retrospectively. They were divided into two groups according to the imaging pattern: true-SAH vs. pseudo-SAH, and then true-SAH group were further divided into two groups according to the CT acquisition time: brain CT before arrest vs. brain CT after arrest. Demographic, clinical, and CT data were assessed, and the primary outcome was measured using the 30-day Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, and the final outcome was evaluated at the end of 3 months post-ictus.
   Results: When compared with pseudo-SAH (n = 28) patients, true-SAH (n = 35) patients showed a higher Hounsfield unit values in the affected area, earlier CT acquisition time before CPR, more survivors beyond 3 months (all p < 0.05); however, the 30-day survival rate was not significantly different. Of the true-SAH patients, ruptured intracranial aneurysms were found in eight patients, and definite intervention was administered in four patients. When SAH patients were categorized according to the temporal relationship with CPR, the group of 24 patients undergoing CT scan before CPR showed a lower frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage, but showed a higher chance of surgical treatment and survival at 30 days and 3 months compared to the group undergoing CT scan after CPR.
   Conclusion: The overall survival between true-SAH and pseudo-SAH group was different significantly. Administering definite treatment for a ruptured aneurysm in instances of true SAH could save patients, albeit infrequently. A Prompt CT scan could guarantee recognition of high-density area, blood in the ventricle, and subsequent identification of the ruptured aneurysm, altogether preventing re-bleeding and warranting further systemic resuscitation.

TI  - SIMULATED CARDIAC ARRESTS FOR MONITORING QUALITY OF IN-HOSPITAL RESUSCITATION
T2  - LANCET
AB  - To improve monitoring of the quality of resuscitation after cardiac arrest staff performance in 47 simulated cardiac arrests was assessed. The exercise revealed many unsuspected deficiencies. Nurses did not apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, use the hand-held defibrillator, or give supplementary oxygen while awaiting the arrival of the arrest team; the availability of different models of defibrillators led to confusion and delay in defibrillation; suction equipment did not suck hard enough;  lack of special protocols for areas such as paediatrics led to medication errors. Remedial measures included in-service education for nurses, purchase of new defibrillators and portable suction machines, and preparation of detailed protocols for paediatric, haemodialysis, and obstetric units. The use of mock arrests helps in the immediate and definitive identification of deficiencies in the quality of cardiac resuscitation. Furthermore information obtained by the use of mock arrests spurs physicians and hospital administrators to correct the deficiencies promptly.

TI  - Digital Simulation Improves, Maintains, and Helps Transfer Health-Care Providers' Neonatal Resuscitation Knowledge
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose: To safely care for their newborn patients, health-care professionals (HCP) must undergo frequent training to improve and maintain neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills. However, the current approach to neonatal resuscitation simulation training is time and resource-intensive, and often inaccessible. Digital neonatal resuscitation simulation may present a convenient alternative for more frequent training.
   Method: Fifty neonatal HCPs participated in the study (44 female; 27 nurses, 3 nurse practitioners, 14 respiratory therapists, 6 doctors). This study was conducted at a tertiary perinatal center in Edmonton, Canada from April-August 2019, with 2-month (June-October 2019) and 5-month (September 2019-January 2020) follow-up. Neonatal HCPs were recruited by volunteer sampling to complete a demographic survey, pre-test (baseline knowledge), two digital simulation scenarios (intervention), and post-test (knowledge acquisition). Two months later, participants repeated the post-test (knowledge retention). Five months after the initial intervention, participants completed a post-test using a table-top simulation (knowledge transfer). Longitudinal analyses were used to compare participants' performance over time.
   Results: Overall the proportion of correct performance increased: 21/50 (42%) passed the pre-test, 39/50 (78%) the post-test, 30/43 (70%) the 2-month post-test, and 32/40 (80%) the 5-month post-test. GLMM and GEE analyses revealed that performance on all post-tests was significantly better than the performance on the pre-test. Therefore, training with the RETAIN digital simulation effectively improves, maintains, and transfers HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge.
   Conclusions: Digital simulation improved, maintained, and helped transfer HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge over time. Digital simulation presents a promising approach for frequent neonatal resuscitation training, particularly for distance-learning applications.

TI  - Risk Factors for Acquiring Functional and Cognitive Disabilities During Admission to a PICU
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To describe the risk factors for acquiring functional or cognitive disabilities during admission to a PICU.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of a multicenter PICU database.
   Setting: Twenty-four PICUs in the Virtual PICU Performance System network from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010.
   Patients: Consecutive patients, who are 1 month to 18 years old, who survived to discharge.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcomes were acquired global functional disability and cognitive disability during admission to a PICU, measured by change in Pediatric Overall Performance Category or in Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores, respectively. The primary analysis cohort consisted of 29,352 admissions to the 24 Virtual PICU Performance System sites which collected the main outcome variables. Respectively, 10.3% and 3.4% of the cohort acquired global functional or cognitive disability. Trauma diagnosis (odds ratio, 4.50; 95% CI, 3.83-5.29; odds ratio, 3.91; 95% CI, 3.07-4.98), unscheduled admission to the PICU (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.27-3.12; odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), highest risk of mortality category (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.15-3.40), oncologic primary diagnoses (odds ratio, 5.61; 95% CI, 4.56-6.91; odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 2.97-6.24), and neurologic primary diagnoses (odds ratio, 2.04, 95% CI, 1.70-2.44; odds ratio, 4.29, 95% CI, 3.18-5.78) were independently associated with acquiring both functional and cognitive disability. Intervention risk factors for acquiring both functional and cognitive disability included invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.60-2.00; odds ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.36-3.39), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.73-3.42; odds ratio, 1.76, 95% CI, 1.08-2.85), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.24-2.95; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.02-3.23), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 7.40, 95% CI, 4.10-13.36; odds ratio, 14.04, 95% CI, 7.51-26.26).
   Conclusions: We identified a subset of patients whose potential for acquiring global functional and cognitive disability during admission to the PICU is high. This population may benefit from interventions that could mitigate this risk and from focused follow-up after discharge from the PICU.

TI  - Postnatal Calyceal-to-Parenchymal Ratio: A Promising Predictor for Surgical Correction of Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction in Newborns
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Objective: This study aims to explore a new parameter, the calyceal-to-parenchymal ratio (CPR) of postnatal renal ultrasonography (RUS) as a predictor of surgery in newborns with possible ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Although UPJO remains the main surgical category of antenatally detected hydronephrosis, there is a lack of a gold-standard test that predicts the need for pyeloplasty. Subjects and methods: We retrospectively reviewed infants with a positive antenatal history of hydronephrosis who were confirmed to have grade 3 or 4 hydronephrosis on postnatal RUS between 2010 and 2020. We compared postnatal CPR between surgical and control groups and tested the correlation between postnatal CPR and diuretic renogram.Results: A total of 79 and 136 kidneys were included in the surgical and control groups, respectively. Kidneys that were managed with pyeloplasty between January 2010 and July 2020 were included in the surgical group, while kidneys from patients with comparable traits who were managed conservatively comprised the control group. At a mean age of 18.9 weeks at presentation and a mean follow-up period of 48.99 months, the median postnatal CPR was significantly greater in the surgical group (3.62 vs. 0.98, p<0.001). A postnatal CPR of 1.68 had a sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 84.8%, respectively, in predicting the need for future pyeloplasty (area under the curve (AUC)=0.966). There was a positive and significant correlation between postnatal CPR and the half-life of the renogram (p=0.018) but not significant with the differential function (p=0.090).Conclusion: Diuretic renography has little capability for predicting future pyeloplasty. Current RUS grading systems do not offer an objective measure of renal parenchyma. Numerous other RUS parameters are less frequently utilized in clinical practice, and many are challenging to assess and require sophisticated software or equipment.

TI  - Influence of Stress on Gas Sorption Behavior and Induced Swelling in Coal: Implications for Sustainable CO2 Geological Storage
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The influence of stress on gas sorption behavior and sorption-induced swelling in coal is critical for the success of CO2-enhanced coalbed methane recovery (CO2-ECBM) and geological carbon sequestration-a key strategy for mitigating climate change and promoting clean energy transitions. However, this influence remains insufficiently understood, largely due to experimental limitations (e.g., overreliance on powdered coal samples) and conflicting theoretical frameworks in existing studies. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates the effects of two distinct stress constraints-constant confining pressure and constant volume-on CO2 adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics, and associated swelling deformation of intact anthracite coal cores. An integrated experimental apparatus was custom-designed for this study, combining volumetric sorption measurement with high-resolution strain monitoring via the confining fluid displacement (CFD) method and the confining pressure response (CPR) method. This setup enables the quantification of CO2-coal interactions under precisely controlled stress environments. Key findings reveal that stress conditions exert a regulatory role in shaping CO2-coal behavior: constant confining pressure conditions enhance CO2 adsorption capacity and sustain adsorption kinetics by accommodating matrix swelling, thereby preserving pore accessibility for continuous gas uptake. In contrast, constant volume constraints lead to rapid internal stress buildup, which inhibits further gas adsorption and accelerates the attainment of kinetic saturation. Sorption-induced swelling exhibits clear dependence on both pressure and constraint conditions. Elevated CO2 pressure leads to increased strain, while constant confining pressure facilitates more gradual, sustained expansion. This is particularly evident at higher pressures, where adsorption-induced swelling prevails over mechanical constraints. These results help resolve key discrepancies in the existing literature by clarifying the dual role of stress in modulating both pore accessibility (for gas transport) and mechanical response (for matrix deformation). These insights provide essential guidance for optimizing CO2 injection strategies and improving the long-term performance and sustainability of CO2-ECBM and geological carbon storage projects, ultimately supporting global efforts in carbon emission reduction and sustainable energy resource utilization.

TI  - Hypovolemic shock due to intragastric migration of an adjustable gastric band
T2  - OBESITY SURGERY
AB  - Migration of the adjustable gastric band (AGB) is a serious complication which usually does not require emergency treatment, except when there is a risk to life. We report a 30-year-old patient who presented with syncope, melena and hypovolemic shock due to the intragastric erosion of an AGB, 13 months after laparoscopic band placement. The diagnosis of migration had been made 7 months after placement, and bleeding only occurred 6 months later. Greater intraluminal penetration had been awaited to facilitate gastroscopic extraction, but, faced with hemodynamic instability, resuscitation was carried out followed by emergency endoscopy to cut the device, using endoscopic scissors. Then, the band was removed orally. There has been no recurrence of hemorrhage 12 months later. Delayed treatment may be indicated in cases of initial band migration; however, rigorous follow-up is necessary with frequent re-evaluation, to diagnose potentially life-threatening complications promptly.

TI  - Cytomegalovirus haemorrhagic cystitis in a pregnant patient with AIDS
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN UROLOGY
AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV), an AIDS defining disease, has a high seroprevalence in the general population, while symptomatic infections occur mostly in immunocompromised individuals. Symptomatic CMV infections commonly include pneumonia, encephalitis, retinitis and colitis, while urinary tract involvement is a rare entity. We present a rare case of massive macroscopic haematuria due to CMV haemorrhagic cystitis in a 29-year-old woman in her second trimester of pregnancy. She was treated with intravenous Ganciclovir after initial resuscitation, and her symptoms promptly resolved. Timely diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic CMV infection is necessary to prevent associated morbidity, and this is especially significant during pregnancy in order to prevent foetal transmission. Both our patient and her baby remained symptom free at the 6-month follow-up post-delivery. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion to biopsy the bladder urothelium of at-risk patients who present with haemorrhagic cystitis and have non-specific cystoscopy findings as histopathological analysis is the mainstay of diagnosing CMV-cystitis.

TI  - Pheochromocytoma-induced cardiogenic shock requiring ECMO: cardiovascular recovery prior to surgical resection
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
AB  - An otherwise healthy woman in her 30s presented with cardiogenic shock and acute pulmonary oedema (APO), subsequently requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A CT scan revealed an adrenal mass that prompted the differential diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma crisis that was later further suggested by raised plasma metanephrines. In the absence of clear guidelines due to the clinical rarity, a decision was made to delay adrenalectomy and stabilise the patient from a cardiac perspective with the view to operate after improvement of cardiac function with adequate alpha and beta blockade. Despite multiple complications, the patient was discharged from the hospital on day 32. After stabilisation and improvement of cardiac function, the patient underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. She was haemodynamically stable throughout the operation and was discharged on postoperative day 1 from the ICU to home. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. She has been stable on follow-up.

TI  - Cardiac sarcoidosis in patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias refractory to endocardial ablation
T2  - CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionThe clinical presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis is diverse. Detection of granuloma in histopathological evaluation proves the diagnosis, but endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is associated with a high sampling error. However, prompt immunosuppressive therapy may significantly affect patient's prognosis. By analyzing our single center cohort of patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy after failure of endocardial ablation, we looked for additional markers supporting the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.MethodIn the last 4 years, 135 patients (mean age 49 y, 63% male) were hospitalized for epicardial ventricular arrhythmia (VA) ablation after failure of endocardial ablation. Nineteen patients had either previously received a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis or were newly diagnosed. The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years. The ECG criteria, primary manifestation, histological findings in EMB, history of VT ablation, distribution of scars on MRI, electroanatomical mapping (EAM), PET CT findings, presence of atrial tachycardias, valve disease and comorbidities were analyzed.ResultsSix of 19 (32%) patients showed right bundle block; 6 of 19 (32%) had AV nodal disease, including 4 patients with AV-block III; and 14 patients (73%) primarily presented with ventricular arrhythmias (including 3 with cardiac arrest). In all 19 patients cardiac EMB revealed elevated CD68 macrophages and CD3 T lymphocytes, and 7 of 19 were positive for granuloma (36,8%). Six of 6 patients (100%) undergoing PET CT showed acute inflammation. By analyzing the scar distribution, the most common locations were basal anteroseptal, basal inferoseptal, mid inferoseptal, mid inferior and the septal RV/RVOT. (septal substrate in 100%). There was a high correlation between the findings on the MRIs and low voltage in the electroanatomical mapping EAM). All patients received an immunosuppressive therapy. No patient died during follow-up, 1 patient had a high urgent heart transplant after withdrawal of steroid therapy.ConclusionChronic untreated inflammation may be the underlying pathophysiology for patients with unspecific cardiomyopathy and recurrent VA refractory to endocardial and epicardial ablation. Septal substrate in the EAM/MRI, elevated CD3 lymphocytes in the EBM and inflammation in the PET CT may indicate the possible diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. Initializing immunosuppressive therapy in patients with this dedicated constellation with should be taken into consideration.

TI  - 'Stand still ..., and move on', a new early intervention service for cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers: rationale and description of the intervention
T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
AB  - Objective: To describe a new early intervention service for survivors of cardiac arrest and their caregivers, and to explain the evidence and rationale behind it.
   Rationale: A cardiac arrest may cause hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, which often results in cognitive impairments. Survivors of cardiac arrest can also encounter emotional problems, limitations in daily life, reduced participation in society and a decreased quality of life. A new early intervention service was designed based on literature study, expert opinion and patient experiences.
   Description of the intervention: The early intervention service is an individualized programme, consisting of one to six consultations by a specialized nurse for the patient and their caregiver. The intervention starts soon after discharge from the hospital and can last up to three months. The intervention consists of screening for cognitive and emotional problems, provision of information and support, promotion of self-management strategies and can include referral to further specialized care if indicated.
   Discussion: This intervention is assumed to reduce future problems related to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury in the patient and caregiver, and its effectiveness is currently being investigated in a randomized controlled multicentre trial.

TI  - Defining the Limits of Resuscitative Emergency Department Thoracotomy: A Contemporary Western Trauma Association Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 40th Annual Meeting of the Western-Trauma-Association
AB  - Background: Since the promulgation of emergency department (ED) thoracotomy > 40 years ago, there has been an ongoing search to define when this heroic resuscitative effort is futile. In this era of health care reform, generation of accurate data is imperative for developing patient care guidelines. The purpose of this prospective multicenter study was to identify injury patterns and physiologic profiles at ED arrival that are compatible with survival.
   Methods: Eighteen institutions representing the Western Trauma Association commenced enrollment in January 2003; data were collected prospectively.
   Results: During the ensuing 6 years, 56 patients survived to hospital discharge. Mean age was 31.3 years (15-64 years), and 93% were male. As expected, survival was predominant in those with thoracic injuries (77%), followed by abdomen (9%), extremity (7%), neck (4%), and head (4%). The most common injury was a ventricular stab wound (30%), followed by a gunshot wound to the lung (16%); 9% of survivors sustained blunt trauma, 34% underwent prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the presenting base deficit was > 25 mequiv/L in 18%. Relevant to futile care, there were survivors of blunt torso injuries with CPR up to 9 minutes and penetrating torso wounds up to 15 minutes. Asystole was documented at ED arrival in seven patients (12%); all these patients had pericardial tamponade and three (43%) had good functional neurologic recovery at hospital discharge.
   Conclusion: Resuscitative thoracotomy in the ED can be considered futile care when (a) prehospital CPR exceeds 10 minutes after blunt trauma without a response, (b) prehospital CPR exceeds 15 minutes after penetrating trauma without a response, and (c) asystole is the presenting rhythm and there is no pericardial tamponade.

TI  - Mental health CPR: Peer contracting as a response to potential suicide in adolescents
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH
AB  - Contracting has been used as a response to individuals at risk of suicide for over thirty years. In the present study almost 400 high school students were given a survey about their experiences with suicide. It found that they were unlikely to initiate contact with traditional counselors during a suicidal crisis, but over half of them admitted they would probably tell a friend. Training in "No harm agreements", a form of peer contracting, was given to half the students. After training, these experimental subjects were significantly more likely than control subjects to recognize symptoms of suicide, to intervene appropriately, and to arrange for professional follow-up. They were also less likely to consider suicide an acceptable option. Greater recognition of two suicidal symptoms and increased likelihood of getting a promise not to commit suicide without talking with a counselor or minister were still present in the experimental group at seven weeks after the training. Responses about questions of safety with this method were promising but still need further attention.

TI  - A Case of Pleomorphic-Type Anaplastic Carcinoma of the Pancreas with Rapidly Progressive and Fatal Cardiac Metastasis
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac metastasis from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is extreme ly rare. Pleomorphic-type anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas (PACP) is an uncommon, highly aggressive PDAC variant with lymphatic and hematogenous spread and poor prognosis. We report, to our knowledge, the first PACP case with antemortem diagnosis of cardiac metastasis and a rapidly fatal course. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old man presented with left hypochondrial pain. CT showed a 4-cm, gradually and heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass without distant metastasis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrated peripheral progressive enhancement with internal non-enhancing areas, suggesting a non-conventional PDAC. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), nevertheless, yielded mainly scattered atypical epithelial cells with a small cohesive columnar component, and adenocarcinoma was diagnosed; further subclassification was not feasible on the limited cytologic material. Because the tumor was radiologically resectable, neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus S-1 was administered. Follow-up CT showed enlargement to 5.5 cm, new invasion of the spleen and gastric wall, and peripheral progressive enhancement-previously demonstrated on MRI-now appreciable on CT, while distant disease remained absent. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, regional lymphadenectomy, and partial gastrectomy was performed. The resected specimen revealed a whitish solid tail tumor with focal hemorrhage/necrosis; histology confirmed PACP. Adjuvant S-1 was initiated 1 month postoperatively. Three months after surgery, CA19-9 increased despite no recurrence on CT. One month later he presented with exertional dyspnea and complete atrioventricular block. Echocardiography and CT showed an approximately 8-cm interatrial mass and a left-ventricular wall lesion. Retrospective review of CT performed 1 month earlier identified a 2-cm atrial nodule at the same site, indicating very rapid intracardiac growth. He was transferred to a cardiovascular center for planned pacemaker implantation, and heart-failure therapy was initiated first. During preparation he developed sudden cardiac arrest and died. Postmortem myocardial biopsy confirmed PACP metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to recognize that PACP can metastasize to the heart and incorporate this risk into routine follow-up, maintaining vigilance for imaging features suggestive of cardiac involvement and for new-onset cardiac symptoms or conduction disturbances; when cardiac metastasis is suspected, prompt evaluation and intervention are warranted.

TI  - CVP and echo Measurements are Associated with Improved Outcomes in Patients with Gastrointestinal (GI) Hemorrhage: A Retrospective Analysis of the MIMIC- IV Database
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose: Mortality associated with acute Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage in intensive care units (ICU) has remained high in patients suffering from hemodynamic instability. Prompt recognition and rapid assessment of bleeding severity are crucial to improve survival. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring is commonly used for early recognition of intravascular imbalances, but its effectiveness in predicting fluid responsiveness is often questioned. Echocardiography (echo) is a rapid, noninvasive method to repeatedly assess cardiac function and fluid responsiveness. This study investigated the impact of CVP and echo measurements on the outcomes of critically ill patients with GI hemorrhage. Methods: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC- IV) database. Patients were divided into four groups according to the usage of CVP and/or echo. The primary outcomes were 7-day, 14-day, 28-day, and overall mortalities after ICU admission. Cox Proportional-Hazards Models were used to elucidate the relationship between CVP/ Echo monitoring and mortality. The severity of illness of patients were adjusted by qSOFA score, SOFA score and base deficit level at admission. Results: Among 1705 eligible patients, 82 patients had both CVP and echo, 85 had CVP only, and 116 had Echo only. The results of survival analysis indicated that, comparing with those without either CVP or echo, the echo utilization was associated with improved mortalities at all time points during ICU stay for patients with moderate GI hemorrhage, and the combined use of CVP and echo was associated with lower 7-day,14-day and overall mortalities for patients with severe GI hemorrhage. Conclusion: Early usage of CVP and echo monitoring or echo alone are associated with lower mortality in the short and long-term when compared to patients without either measurement. Clinicians should consider goal-directed resuscitation guided by echo with/without CVP in patients with GI hemorrhage early after admission to ICU.

TI  - Total neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with high risk factors in Slovenia
T2  - RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background. In the light of a high rate of distant recurrence and poor compliance of adjuvant chemotherapy in high risk rectal cancer patients the total neoadjuvant treatment was logical approach to gaining acceptance. We aimed to evaluate toxicity and efficiency of this treatment in patients with rectal cancer and high risk factors for local or distant recurrence.
   Patients and methods. Patients with rectal cancer stage II and III and with at least one high risk factor: T4, presence of extramural vein invasion (EMVI), positive extramesorectal lymph nodes or mesorectal fascia (MRF) involvement were treated with four cycles of induction CAPDX/FOLFOX, followed by capecitabine-based radiochemotherapy (CRT) and two consolidation cycles of CAPDX/FOLFOX before the operation. Surgery was scheduled 8-10 weeks after completition of CRT.
   Results. From November 2016 to July 2018 66 patients were evaluable. All patients had stage III disease, 24 (36.4%) had T4 tumors, in 46 (69.7%) EMVI was present and in 47 (71.2%) MRF was involved. After induction chemotherapy, which was completed by 61 (92.4%) of patients, radiologic downstaging of T, N, stage, absence of EMVI or MRF involvement was observed in 42.4%, 62.1%, 36.4%, 69.7% and 68.2%, respectively. All patients completed radiation and 54 (81.8%) patients received both cycles of consolidation chemotherapy. Grade 3 adverse events of neoadjuvant treatment was observed in 4 (6%) patients. Five patients rejected surgery, 3 of them with radiologic complete clinical remissions. One patient did not have definitive surgery of primary tumor due to unexpected cardiac arrest few days after sigmoid colostomy formation. Among 60 operated patients pathological complete response rate was 23.3%, the rate of near complete response was 20% and in 96.7% radical resection was achieved. Pathological T, N and stage downstaging was 65%, 96.7% and 83.4%, respectively. Grade >= 3 perioperative complications were anastomotic leakage in 3, pelvic abscess in 1 and paralytic ileus in 2 patients. The rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients irradiated with 3D conformal technique was 12.1% while with IMRT and VMAT it was 37% (p < 0.05). Hypofractionation with larger dose per fraction and simultaneous integrated boost used in the latest two was the only factor associated with pCR.
   Conclusions. Total neoadjuvant treatment of high risk rectal cancer is well tolerated and highly effective with excellent tumor and node regression rate and with low toxicity rate. Longer follow up will show if this strategy will improve distant disease control and survival.

TI  - Changes in health status and quality of life and the impact of uncertainty in patients who survive life-threatening arrhythmias
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the changes in perception of health status and quality of life from before treatment to 6 months after and the impact of uncertainty on these variables I : in survivors of life-threatening arrhythmia.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: A descriptive correlational design at a large urban teaching hospital.
   MEASURES: We measured health status, quality of life; and uncertainty before treatment and 6 months after a life-threatening arrhythmia.
   RESULTS: Survivors included 66 men and 15 women, 41 of whom received pharmacologic therapy and 36 of whom received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), completed the Medical Outcomes F Survey (SF-36), Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index: (QLI), and the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale (MUIS-C) before treatment and 6 months after. There were significant improvements in the men tal and physical health composite summaries as measured by the SF36 (P < .01). Conversely, there were significant reductions in the overall score and specifically in socioeconomic and psychological/spiritual quality of life domains as measured by the QLI (P < .05).:An increased perception of uncertainty was related to decreased perception of health status and quality of life at both measurement times, with higher correlations 6 months later.
   CONCLUSIONS: Survivors demonstrated improvements in perceived health status, although this did not appear to translate into improvements in the subjective domains of quality of life. The overall quality of life and the domains of psychological/spiritual state and socioeconomic status were lower 6 months after a life-threatening arrhythmia. Uncertainty had a significant impact on these perceptions, identifying an area for nursing interventions.

TI  - The educational experiences and needs of patients with an internal cardiac defibrillator: An interpretive phenomenological study
T2  - COLLEGIAN
AB  - Background: Internal cardiac defibrillators (ICD) are the treatment option for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest and potential death. The majority of research to date has focused on the psychological and physical outcomes affecting patients, such as fear, anxiety, depression, and changes in quality of life post ICD insertion. There is, however, limited research exploring the adequacy of their educational preparation by nurses and other health care professionals.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to understand the educational experiences and needs of adult patients with ICDs within a metropolitan tertiary hospital in Queensland.
   Methods: An interpretive phenomenological approach was chosen to explore the everyday educational experiences and needs of patients with an ICD or Subcutaneous Internal Cardiac Defibrillator (S-ICD). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of ten participants until data saturation was reached. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: Five themes emerged and these were 'understanding the information needs of patients'; 'psychological aspects'; 'fearful of the ICD shock'; 'physical concerns'; and 'importance of family inclusion'.
   Discussion: The study's findings revealed that patients with ICD/S-ICDs had unmet educational needs that are important for nurses to understand and address. These specifically related to education and the relevance to each individual's particular needs. These included addressing their anxiety levels explaining changes to everyday activities and including family in the education sessions. Discharge care via telemonitoring may be useful for follow-up care for this unique and vulnerable patient group.
   Conclusion: Interpretive phenomenology was used to understand the experiences and needs of people living with an ICD/S-ICD. This study has provided knowledge about the patient's desire for clarity of information relevant to their individual needs. The research found that patients with ICD/S-ICDs did not perceive the education that they received regarding the device to be adequate, nor did it address their specific needs. The research highlighted that nurses caring for patients undergoing ICD/S-ICD insertion need to provide education that is both patient and family specific, and that it continues for at least two months post-hospital discharge.

TI  - Are There Options to Prevent Early Occurring Deaths in Acute Myocardial Infarction: Prospective Evaluation of All &lt;24 h In-Hospital Deaths, 2004-2006-The MONICA/KORA Augsburg Infarction Registry
T2  - CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: To provide valid clinical data of early in-hospital deaths with presumed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are often not included in clinical trials or registries. Methods: From August 2004 to August 2006 all patients (age 25-84 years) dying within 24 h after hospitalization in a large tertiary care academic teaching hospital were screened regarding an underlying cardiovascular cause of death. Results: After validation, 79 out of 1,352 patients remained with a final diagnosis of AMI. Sixty-six percent of these experienced prehospital cardiac arrest or shock. In 37% no resuscitation attempts were performed in-hospital, the most common reason being multimorbidity. Only 23% could be transferred to coronary angiography for revascularisation attempts. An independent panel of clinicians judged that only in one patient would another management strategy have been promising. Of interest, 33% of the deceased patients had typical or atypical chest pain the days before the lethal event. Conclusion: A large percentage of AMI patients who died soon after hospitalization were in critical circulatory state directly before hospitalization. In 37%, in-hospital resuscitation attempts were omitted for understandable reasons. Options for improvement in acute care in the investigated setting were not found. However, in one third of the cases earlier preventive measures might have been reasonable. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation: FLUid or vasopressors In emergency Department Sepsis (ARISE FLUIDS) trial: study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction International consensus guidelines support the initial administration of 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids for haemodynamic resuscitation of newly diagnosed septic shock. Practice variation exists between the volume of fluids administered and timing of vasopressor commencement. The optimal approach in patients with septic shock is uncertain.Methods and analysis Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation: FLUid or vasopressors In emergency Department Sepsis is a 1000-participant multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel group clinical trial conducted in patients with septic shock presenting to the emergency department in participating sites in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. Participants are randomised (1:1) to either restricted fluids and early vasopressors or a larger initial intravenous fluid volume and later vasopressors. The primary outcome is days alive and out of hospital at day 90 postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at day 90, time from randomisation until death (to day 90), days alive and at home at day 90 and ventilator-free, vasopressor-free and renal replacement-free days to day 28 postrandomisation and death or disability at 6-month and 12-month postrandomisation. Health-related quality of life will be assessed at day 180 and 12 months following randomisation.Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by Northern Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC2020/ETH02874) on 21 January 2021. Patients will be enrolled under a waiver of prior consent. The patient or next-of-kin (or equivalent according to local jurisdiction) is approached at the first available opportunity and given a trial information sheet. According to local approvals, the patient or next-of-kin chooses to either continue in the trial or opt-out/decline continued participation. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences.Trial registration number NCT04569942

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia and controlled normothermia in the intensive care unit: Practical considerations, side effects, and cooling methods
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Hypothermia is being used with increasing frequency to prevent or mitigate various types of neurologic injury. In addition, symptomatic fever control is becoming an increasingly accepted goal of therapy in patients with neurocritical illness. However, effectively controlling fever and inducing hypothermia poses special challenges to the intensive care unit team and others involved in the care of critically ill patients.
   Objective: To discuss practical aspects and pitfalls of therapeutic temperature management in critically ill patients, and to review the currently available cooling methods.
   Design: Review article.
   Interventions: None.
   Main Results: Cooling can be divided into three distinct phases: induction, maintenance, and rewarming. Each has its own risks and management problems. A number of cooling devices that have reached the market in recent years enable reliable maintenance and slow and controlled rewarming. In the induction phase, rapid cooling rates can be achieved by combining cold fluid infusion (1500-3000 mL 4 degrees C saline or Ringer's lactate) with an invasive or surface cooling device. Rapid induction decreases the risks and consequences of short-term side effects, such as shivering and metabolic disorders. Cardiovascular effects include bradycardia and a rise in blood pressure. Hypothermia's effect on myocardial contractility is variable (depending on heart rate and filling pressure); in most patients myocardial contractility will increase, although mild diastolic dysfunction can develop in some patients. A risk of clinically significant arrhythmias occurs only if core temperature decreases below 30 degrees C. The most important long-term side effects of hypothermia are infections (usually of the respiratory tract or wounds) and bedsores.
   Conclusions: Temperature management and hypothermia induction are gaining importance in critical care medicine. Intensive care unit physicians, critical care nurses, and others (emergency physicians, neurologists, and cardiologists) should be familiar with the physiologic effects, current indications, techniques, complications and practical issues of temperature management, and induced hypothermia. In experienced hands the technique is safe and highly effective. (Crit Care Med 2009; 37:1101-1120)

TI  - Fatal Hypernatremic Dehydration in a Term Exclusively Breastfed Newborn
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - Hypernatremic dehydration in term newborns has steadily increased in incidence with increasing efforts to promote exclusive breastfeeding before hospital discharge, a key metric of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. The following report details a case of a term newborn infant who had evidence of poor intake while exclusively breastfeeding during his hospital stay that may not have been recognized by health care providers. The infant was discharged home and was subsequently found by the parents in cardiac arrest 12 h after discharge and was found to have hypernatremic dehydration. Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after fluid resuscitation, the infant sustained extensive hypoxic-ischemic brain injury due to cardiovascular collapse. Due to the infant's extremely poor prognosis, life support was withdrawn at 19 days of age and the infant expired. This sentinel case demonstrates multiple pitfalls of current perceptions of normal vs. abnormal newborn feeding behavior, weight loss percentages, elimination patterns, and acceptable clinical thresholds believed to be safe for neonates. Newer data have shown that hypernatremia occurs commonly in healthy, term breastfed newborns at weight loss percentages previously deemed normal by most health professionals and hospital protocols. In-hospital strategies to prevent excessive weight loss and screening for hypernatremia in response to signs of inadequate feeding have the potential to prevent tens of thousands of readmissions for feeding complications a year, as well as hundreds of millions in health care costs.

TI  - Cardioprotected spaces in Mexico: actions to prevent sudden cardiac death. A position of health professionals
T2  - SALUD PUBLICA DE MEXICO
AB  - Sudden cardiac death is a worldwide public health problem. Although its incidence is not known, it is estimated to cause up to 50% of cardiac-related mortality and up to 20% of total mortality in adults. In Mexico, previous estimates suggest that it causes an average of 33 000 deaths per year; however, the data are not precise. Half of all sudden cardiac death events are due to out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest which, if not treated promptly, leads to sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the ability to respond promptly and adequately to these events with the necessary maneuvers and equipment improves the survival of the victims.To address this problem, in some states of the country, cardioprotected spaces have been created to allow timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiac defibrillation maneuvers to be performed in public access. As an objective, health professionals establish the importance of implementing cardioprotected spaces and creating public policies in this regard throughout the country.

TI  - Clinical Nurses' Intention to Use Defibrillators in South Korea: A Path Analysis
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - This study aimed to investigate factors affecting behavioral intentions to use defibrillators among clinical nurses in South Korea, using a modified predictive technology acceptance model 2 (TAM 2) that facilitates understanding of what prompts apparent spontaneous actions. This descriptive, cross-sectional study included 467 clinical nurses with more than 6 months of clinical experience. The path analysis results showed that the variables directly affecting the intention to use a defibrillator among clinical nurses were the image, organizational support, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Moreover, job autonomy and total career indirectly affected the intention to use a defibrillator. Clinical nurses need to know how to use defibrillators and be able to act promptly on patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Organizational managers need to improve the work environments of clinical nurses accordingly. Additionally, it is necessary to establish a policy foundation to ensure the development of competence and job autonomy that can lead to the use of defibrillators by improving various factors, including anxiety or reluctance of nurses to use defibrillators in acute cardiac arrest.

We performed a two-year prospective study at three Chicago airports to assess whether random bystanders witnessing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests would retrieve and successfully use automated external defibrillators.
   Methods: Defibrillators were installed a brisk 60-to-90-second walk apart throughout passenger terminals at O'Hare, Midway, and Meigs Field airports, which together serve more than 100 million passengers per year. The use of defibrillators was promoted by public-service videos in waiting areas, pamphlets, and reports in the media. We assessed the time from notification of the dispatchers to defibrillation, survival rate at 72 hours and at one year among persons with cardiac arrest, their neurologic status, and the characteristics of rescuers.
   Results: Over a two-year period, 21 persons had nontraumatic cardiac arrest, 18 of whom had ventricular fibrillation. With two exceptions, defibrillator operators were good Samaritans, acting voluntarily. In the case of four patients with ventricular fibrillation, defibrillators were neither nearby nor used within five minutes, and none of these patients survived. Three others remained in fibrillation and eventually died, despite the rapid use of a defibrillator (within five minutes). Eleven patients with ventricular fibrillation were successfully resuscitated, including eight who regained consciousness before hospital admission. No shock was delivered in four cases of suspected cardiac arrest, and the device correctly indicated that the problem was not due to ventricular fibrillation. The rescuers of 6 of the 11 successfully resuscitated patients had no training or experience in the use of automated defibrillators, although 3 had medical degrees. Ten of the 18 patients with ventricular fibrillation were alive and neurologically intact at one year.
   Conclusions: Automated external defibrillators deployed in readily accessible, well-marked public areas in Chicago airports were used effectively to assist patients with cardiac arrest. In the cases of survivors, most of the users had no duty to act and no prior training in the use of these devices.

TI  - Residents feel unprepared and unsupervised as leaders of cardiac arrest teams in teaching hospitals: A survey of internal medicine residents
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: We aimed to determine internal medicine residents' perceptions of the adequacy of their training to serve as in-hospital cardiac arrest team leaders, given the responsibility of managing acutely critically ill patients and with recent evidence suggesting that the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation provided in teaching hospitals is suboptimal.
   Design: Cross-sectional postal survey.
   Setting: Canadian internal medicine training programs.
   Participants: Internal medicine residents attending Canadian English-speaking medical schools.
   Interventions: A survey was mailed to internal medicine residents asking questions relating to four domains: adequacy of training, perception of preparedness, adequacy of supervision and feedback, and effectiveness of additional training tools.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of the 654 residents who were sent the survey, 289 residents (44.2%) responded. Almost half of the respondents (49.3%) felt inadequately trained to lead cardiac arrest teams. Many (50.9%) felt that the advanced cardiac life support course did not provide the necessary training for team leadership. A substantial number of respondents (40%) reported receiving no additional cardiac arrest training beyond the advanced cardiac life support course. Only 52.1 % of respondents felt prepared to lead a cardiac arrest team, with 55.3% worrying that they made errors. Few respondents reported receiving supervision during weekdays (14.2%) or evenings and weekends (1.4%). Very few respondents reported receiving postevent debriefing (5.9%) or any performance feedback (1.3%). Level of training and receiving performance feedback were associated with perception of adequacy of training (12 = .085, p < .001). Respondents felt that additional training involving full-scale simulation, leadership skills training, and postevent debriefing would be most effective in increasing their skills and confidence.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that residents perceive deficits in their training and supervision to care for critically ill patients as cardiac arrest team leaders. This raises sufficient concern to prompt teaching hospitals and medical schools to consider including more appropriate supervision, feedback, and further education for residents in their role as cardiac arrest team leaders.

TI  - Association between intensive care unit nursing grade and mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock and its cost-effectiveness
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundDespite the high workload of cardiac intensive care unit (ICU), there is a paucity of evidence on the association between nurse workforce and mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of the ICU nursing grade on mortality and cost-effectiveness in CS. MethodsA nationwide analysis was performed using the K-NHIS database. Patients diagnosed with CS and admitted to the ICU at tertiary hospitals were enrolled. ICU nursing grade was defined according to the bed-to-nurse ratio: grade1 (bed-to-nurse ratio < 0.5), grade2 (0.5 <= bed-to-nurse ratio < 0.63), and grade3 (0.63 <= bed-to-nurse ratio < 0.77) or above. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Cost-effective analysis was also performed. ResultsOf the 72,950 patients with CS, 27,216 (37.3%) were in ICU nursing grade 1, 29,710 (40.7%) in grade 2, and 16,024 (22.0%) in grade >= 3. The adjusted-OR for in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 (grade 1 vs. grade 2, 30.6% vs. 37.5%, adjusted-OR 1.14, 95% CI1.09-1.19) and grade >= 3 (40.6%) with an adjusted-OR of 1.29 (95% CI 1.23-1.36) than those with grade 1. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of grade1 compared with grade 2 and >= 3 was $25,047/year and $42,888/year for hospitalization and $5151/year and $5269/year for 1-year follow-up, suggesting that grade 1 was cost-effective. In subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of the high-intensity nursing grade on mortality were more prominent in patients who received CPR or multiple vasopressors usage. ConclusionsFor patients with CS, ICU grade 1 with a high-intensity nursing staff was associated with reduced mortality and more cost-effectiveness during hospitalization compared to grade 2 and grade >= 3, and its beneficial effects were more pronounced in subjects at high risk of CS.

TI  - In Hospitals With More Nurses Who Have Baccalaureate Degrees, Better Outcomes For Patients After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS
AB  - In 2010, prompted by compelling evidence that demonstrated better patient outcomes in hospitals with higher percentages of nurses with a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), the Institute of Medicine recommended that 80 percent of the nurse workforce be qualified at that level or higher by 2020. Using data from the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines Resuscitation registry (for 2013-18), RN4CAST-US hospital nurse surveys (2015-16), and the American Hospital Association (2015), we found that each 10-percentage-point increase in the hospital share of nurses with a BSN was associated with 24 percent greater odds of surviving to discharge with good cerebral performance among patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest. Lower patient-to-nurse ratios on general medical and surgical units were also associated with significantly greater odds of surviving with good cerebral performance. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports policies to increase access to baccalaureate-level education and improve hospital nurse staffing.

TI  - Mild hypothermia for neuroprotection after cardiac arrest
T2  - MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK
AB  - The favorable effect of hypothermia oil brain damage resulting from cardiac arrest was first demonstrated in animal studies. Subsequent small-scale human studies have also shown positive effects. In 2002, two large randomized studies investigating the use of controlled mild hypothermia after resuscitation were published in the New, England Journal of Medicine. The results convincingly showed a positive effect on survival and neurologic outcome. Based oil the currently available data, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) strongly recommends that unconscious adult patients who are resuscitated after ventricular Fibrillation be cooled to temperatures between 32 and 34 degrees C for 12-24 h.

TI  - Sotatercept for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundPulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, cellular proliferation, and poor long-term outcomes. Dysfunctional bone morphogenetic protein pathway signaling is associated with both hereditary and idiopathic subtypes. Sotatercept, a novel fusion protein, binds activins and growth differentiation factors in the attempt to restore balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signaling pathways.
   MethodsIn this 24-week multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 106 adults who were receiving background therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension to receive subcutaneous sotatercept at a dose of 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks or 0.7 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 24 in pulmonary vascular resistance.
   ResultsBaseline characteristics were similar among the three groups. The least-squares mean difference between the sotatercept 0.3-mg group and the placebo group in the change from baseline to week 24 in pulmonary vascular resistance was -145.8 dyn.sec.cm(-5) (95% confidence interval [CI], -241.0 to -50.6; P=0.003). The least-squares mean difference between the sotatercept 0.7-mg group and the placebo group was -239.5 dyn.sec.cm(-5) (95% CI, -329.3 to -149.7; P<0.001). At 24 weeks, the least-squares mean difference between the sotatercept 0.3-mg group and the placebo group in the change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance was 29.4 m (95% CI, 3.8 to 55.0). The least-squares mean difference between the sotatercept 0.7-mg group and the placebo group was 21.4 m (95% CI, -2.8 to 45.7). Sotatercept was also associated with a decrease in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Thrombocytopenia and an increased hemoglobin level were the most common hematologic adverse events. One patient in the sotatercept 0.7-mg group died from cardiac arrest.
   ConclusionsTreatment with sotatercept resulted in a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance in patients receiving background therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. (Funded by Acceleron Pharma; PULSAR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03496207.)
   Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension were randomly assigned to receive sotatercept at a dose of 0.3 mg per kilogram or 0.7 mg per kilogram or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. At 24 weeks, both sotatercept groups had a greater reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance than the placebo group.

TI  - Pushing the Envelope-Rehabilitation of Non-Circular Sewers Up to 2.7 m (9′) High with Reinforced Cured in Place Pipe
T2  - PIPELINES 2019: CONDITION ASSESSMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND REHABILITATION
CP  - Conference on Pipeline Engineering - Concepts in Harmony (PIPELINES)
AB  - The city of Winnipeg, MB, Canada, has a large and old combined sewer network that was constructed using a wide range of materials, cross sections, and construction methods. As with many jurisdictions in North America, their rehabilitation needs have become considerably more challenging over time. This paper focusses on the design considerations to rehabilitate two sites with egg shaped monolithic concrete combined sewers with numerous major defects in the form of sewer fabric decay (i.e. general surficial material degradation), localized invert loss, infiltration, and longitudinal four point fractures. The sections included pipes that were 1,800 mm highx1,350 mm wide (72"x54") and 2,700 mm highx1800 mm wide (108"x72") and conveyed dry weather flows ranging from 1.9 to 162.8 L/s (30 to 2,580 USGPM), respectively. The combination of defects present with active infiltration meant that active deterioration processes were present in form ground loss around the sewers. The sites themselves posed considerable access challenges, as one was located on a former road right of way now leased to a private recycling company and located adjacent to active Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) tracks. Proximity to active rail tracks necessitated seeking approval from CPR on a detailed sequential phasing plan for the shaft construction. Since the requirements for the shafts were dictated by both the rehabilitation method and the contractor's means of shoring construction, final approval for shaft construction at the site could not take place until after contractor procurement. Design and procurement included five unique rehabilitation alternative systems: reinforced cured in place pipe (CIPP), grouted in place glass reinforced polymer (GRP) liners, bonded in place fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) liners, centrifugally cast concrete pipe (CCCP), and grouted-in-place spiral wound PVC strip liners. Each technology was assessed and specified based on their unique installation and long term performance characteristics. While all of the deteriorated pipes appeared stable and were not at risk of short term failure; some of the pipes displayed evidence of accelerating deterioration which required a rehabilitation system designed for full pipe-soil loading models as well as hydrostatic groundwater loads. Design methodologies and minimum quality assurance (QA) requirements were dictated by the tender documents for each rehabilitation technology to promote an "equal" assessment of alternative technologies in a competitive environment. The rehabilitation contract was awarded based on the use of reinforced CIPP technology in late 2017 and installation of the liners was completed in November 2018.

TI  - Gynostemma pentaphyllum is neuroprotective in a rat model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
AB  - Asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA)-induced ischemia results in acute and delayed neuronal cell death. The early reperfusion phase is critical for the outcome. Intervention strategies directed to this period are promising to reduce ACA/resuscitation-dependent impairments. This study focused on the evaluation of the protective potential of an extract from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP), a plant used in traditional medicine with antioxidative, glucose lowering and neuroprotective activities, in an ACA rat model. We tested the following parameters: i) Basic systemic parameters such as pCO(2) and blood glucose value within the first 30 min post-ACA; ii) mitochondrial response by determining activities of citrate synthase, respiratory chain complexes I + III and II + III, and the composition of cardiolipin 6 and 24 h post-ACA; iii) neuronal vitality of the CA1 hippocampal region by immunohistochemistry 24 h and 7 days post-ACA; and iv) cognitive function by a novel object recognition test 7 days post-ACA. GP, administered after reaching spontaneous circulation, counteracted the following: i) ACA-mediated increases in arterial CO2 tension and blood glucose values; ii) transient increase in the activity of the respiratory chain complexes II + III; iii) elevation in cardiolipin content; iv) hippocampal CA1 neurodegeneration, and v) loss of normal novelty-object seeking. The protective effects of GP were accompanied by side effects of the vehicle DMSO, such as the stimulation of citrate synthase activity in control animals, inhibition of cardiolipin synthesis in ACA animals and complex II + III activity in both control and ACA animals. The results emphasize the importance of the early post-resuscitation phase for the neurological outcome after ACA/resuscitation, and demonstrated the power of GP substitution as neuroprotective intervention. Moreover, the results underline the need of a careful handling of the popular vehicle DMSO.

TI  - Post-partum myocardial ischemia due to intramuscular methylergonovine-induced coronary vasospasm: case report
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - BackgroundMethylergonovine is a vasoconstrictive agent historically used as a provocative agent in the lab for coronary vasospasm; it is also a first line uterotonic agent for management of postpartum hemorrhage.Case PresentationA 29-year-old female with history of smoking and idiopathic thrombocytopenia received intramuscular methylergonovine after delivery of twins for intrauterine hemorrhage management. Subsequently, she had episodes of chest pain with high sensitivity Troponin I elevation to 1509 ng/L with accompanying septal T wave inversions, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction to 49% and basal septal wall hypokinesis. Computed tomography (CT) coronary angiogram showed patent coronary arteries and no coronary arterial dissection. The patient was conservatively managed with aspirin and metoprolol, and on follow up had fully recovered left ventricular function with resolution of wall motion abnormalities. Given this, coronary vasospasm due to intramuscular methylergonovine is the most likely cause of patient's chest pain and associated myocardial ischemia.ConclusionsIntramuscular, intrauterine, intravenous, and even oral methylergonovine can rarely cause coronary vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia. Cardiologists caring for postpartum patients should be aware of these potential lethal complications; prompt identification and administration of sublingual nitroglycerin can prevent severe complications of arrythmias, heart block, or cardiac arrest.

TI  - Automated external defibrillation by untrained deaf lay rescuers
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: The use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by lay rescuers can reduce the time to defibrillation, improving survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, some people have hearing defects that can prevent them from understanding the AED verbal prompts. Moreover, even rescuers with normal hearing function may not easily understand the AED verbal prompts when operating in a noisy environment. This study was designed to assess the capability of rescuers to defibrillate effectively using an AED which included visual prompts. Methods and results: Nine deaf employees with no previous experience in basic life support (BLS) or defibrillation were asked to defibrillate a manikin following the text prompts of a Heartstart FR2+ AED. Subjects were tested before and after a 6 h BLS-AED course carried out with the help of a sign language interpreter. Before training, seven out of nine deaf subjects (78%) were able to defibrillate, eight out of nine subjects (89%) placed the pads correctly, and the mean time to defibrillation was 101.6 +/- 28.4 s. After the course, all subjects were able to complete the defibrillation sequence and place the pads correctly. The mean post-course time to defibrillation was 47.8 +/- 5.4 s (P < 0.001). None of the nine subjects touched the manikin during charging of the defibrillator and shock delivery before or after the course. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that untrained deaf rescuers can use AEDs appropriately providing that the defibrillator has visual instructions. Training improves defibrillator use and reduces time to defibrillation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diagnostic challenges in blunt pelvic fracture-related lower urinary tract injuries: a 13-year retrospective study
T2  - BMC UROLOGY
AB  - Introduction Pelvic fractures from high-energy trauma are associated with lower urinary tract injuries (LUTI) in 10-15% of cases, leading to significant morbidity if not promptly diagnosed. Bladder and urethral injuries can result in infection, urinary obstruction, and long-term complications. However, diagnosing LUTI in hemodynamically unstable patients remains particularly challenging, as advanced imaging studies such as retrograde cystography, computed tomography (CT) cystography, and retrograde urethrography (RUG) are typically deferred until after initial resuscitation and stabilization. This study reviews 13 years of clinical experience with blunt pelvic fracture-related LUTI, focusing on the diagnostic role of CT imaging. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed pelvic fracture cases with hematuria at a tertiary center from 2009 to 2021. All patients received abdominal and pelvic CT scans on admission. We recorded demographic data, injury characteristics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), diagnostic methods, and infection rates. Comparisons were made between patients with bladder and urethral injuries. The characteristics of patients with LUTI diagnosed on initial CT and those with delayed diagnosis were summarized descriptively. Results Of 2,865 patients with pelvic fractures, 127 (4.4%) were diagnosed with LUTI. The median age was 36 years, and 76% were male, with a median ISS of 26. Bladder injuries were present in 54% of LUTI cases, urethral injuries in 40%, and combined injuries in 6%. Diagnosis via CT was significantly higher for bladder injuries (58%) than urethral injuries (20%). Among those diagnosed with CT in the emergency department, 40% patients did not undergo further urological imaging. Thirteen patients (10%) had delayed diagnoses, primarily due to initial focus on life-saving interventions. No significant difference in outcomes was noted between early and delayed diagnoses. Conclusion CT imaging is valuable for the initial evaluation of pelvic fractures with LUTI- particularly bladder injuries, by aiding early diagnosis and reducing the need for invasive diagnostic studies. Early recognition, especially within the first two weeks, remains essential to optimize patient outcomes.

TI  - The Feasibility of Venovenous Extracorporeal Life Support to Treat Acute Respiratory Failure in Adult Cancer Patients
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Venovenous extracorporeal life support (VV-ECLS) is a lifesaving but invasive treatment for acute respiratory failure (ARF) that is not improved with conventional therapy. However, using VV-ECLS to treat ARF in adult cancer patients is controversial.
   This retrospective study included 14 cancer patients (median age: 58 years [interquartile range: 51-66]; solid malignancies in 13 patients and hematological malignancy in 1 patient) who received VV-ECLS for ARF that developed within 3 months after anticancer therapies. VV-ECLS would be considered in selected patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <= 70 mmHg under advanced mechanical ventilation.
   Before ECLS, the medians of intubation day, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were 8 (2-12), 62mmHg (53-76), and 10 (9-14), respectively. The case numbers of bacteremia, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50000 cells/mL), and neutropenia (actual neutrophil count < 1000 cells/mL) detected before ECLS were 3 (21%), 2 (14%), and 1 (7%), respectively. After 24 hours of ECLS, a significant improvement was seen in PaO2/FiO2 ratio but not in SOFA score. Six patients experienced major hemorrhages during ECLS. The median ECLS day, ECLS weaning rate, and hospital survival were 11 (7-16), 50% (n = 7), and 29% (n = 4). The development of dialysis-dependent nephropathy predicted death on ECLS (odds ratio: 36; 95% confidence interval: 1.8-718.7; P = 0.01). With a median follow-up of 11 (6-43) months, half of the survivors died of cancer recurrence and the others were in partial remission.
   The most prominent benefit of VV-ECLS is to improve the arterial oxygenation and rest the lungs. This may increase the chance of recovery from ARF in selected cancer patients.

TI  - Reaching the public via a multi media campaign as a first step to nationwide public access defibrillation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Public access defibrillation (PAD) is a promising strategy to fight sudden cardiac death. The Austrian Red Cross provided automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and basic life support (BILS) training as an "all inclusive package" combined with on site consultation and maintenance with annual retraining as a part of a nationwide PAD programme. A multi media campaign was started to promote the package and to increase awareness about sudden cardiac death. Data about the campaign, its recognition by the public in Austria and the number of packages were recorded. Sixty-eight percent of the Austrian public above the age of 15 years were able to recall the multi media campaign. Comparing the periods before and after the campaign, the number of website hits climbed significantly from 2931 hits/month (11866-6168) to 4812 hits/month (3432-13,434) (p = 0.0276). The number of AED services implemented before the campaign increased significantly (p=0.0026) in the time after the campaign. Therefore, we conclude that a multi media campaign is useful to stimulate public discussion and it encourages companies to buy "all inclusive packages" containing AEDs, BILS training, on site consultation and maintenance. These measures represent a possible first step in introducing PAD but it seems that they have to be continued on a constant basis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sudden Cardiac and Noncardiac Death in Sports: Epidemiology, Causes, Pathogenesis, and Prevention
T2  - SEMINARS IN THROMBOSIS AND HEMOSTASIS
AB  - Although few doubts remain that physical exercise should be widely promoted for maintenance of health and fitness, the risk of adverse events such as sudden death (especially due to cardiac causes, i.e., sudden cardiac death [SCD]) during exercise remains tangible. The overall risk of sudden death in athletes is relatively low (i.e., usually comprised between 0.1 and 38/100,000 person-years), and globally comparable to that of the general population. However, up to 20% of all sudden death cases are still recorded while exercising. The most frequent underlying disorders encountered in SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease (CAD), representing three quarters of all conditions. The risk related to CAD increases with aging (>35 years old), while that attributable to cardiomyopathies or fatal arrhythmias is especially frequent among young people (<35 years old). Taken together, these findings would lead to the conclusion that physical exercise may be seen as an acute trigger of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias in some predisposed individuals. Nonetheless, the prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis seems to be higher in athletes than in sedentary subjects with comparable risk profile. On the contrary, coronary plaques in physically active subjects appear more stable, thereby attenuating the risk of rupture and subsequent myocardial ischemia. These findings, along with evidence of a considerable increase of peak coronary blood flow during exercise, make it very likely that an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply may be the most frequent cause of myocardial ischemia in athletes suffering SCD and/or cardiac arrest. Therefore, all subjects who wish to practice moderate-to high-intensity exercise are recommended to undergo preparticipation screening and annual follow-up.

TI  - High technology near the end of life: Setting limits
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - High technology interventions near the end of life exact a high cost both in human and economic terms, Breathtaking advances in cardiology have helped to prolong life and improve its quality for many, For some, it has transformed the process of dying into a medical nightmare, The ''do everything possible'' attitude that prevailed during the past few decades is both inhumane and wasteful, In contrast, in the new era of managed care with its focus on profit, a well meaning physician may become suspect whenever he recommends against a medical intervention that he deems to be futile, More than ever before, there is a pressing need to develop rational guidelines for end of life medical interventions to ensure primacy of patients' best interests, protect the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship and affirm the duty of the medical establishment toward society at large, This weighty issue must not be relinquished to medical ethicists, health care alliances or the courts, It is the domain of physicians and the public at large, Medical futility should be defined as a treatment unlikely to affect the course of illness or that which has failed to achieve its desired effects, Rational guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and do not resuscitate orders should be formulated for both in-hospital and out of hospital victims of cardiac arrest, These guidelines meed to be developed through a process similar to those for the treatment of unstable angina, with involvement from all relevant medical specialities, Proposed guidelines must be negotiated, reviewed and ratified by the lay public, Appropriate legislation is necessary to establish the framework and policies to carry out agreed on recommendations. The focus of the ''living will'' should change so that it covers the last chapter of life rather than its terminal phase, The document should serve to express the person's wishes regarding specific medical interventions when the quality of life is seriously diminished beyond what is uniquely desirable for the particular patient, Living wills must be comprehensive, clear and specific, They must be honored, The Uniform Health Decisions Act, now pending legislation, should enhance the utility of the living will.

TI  - Early endovascular treatment of ruptured cerebral aneurysms in patients in very poor neurological condition
T2  - NEUROSURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients in very poor neurological condition (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grade V) with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, early surgery to prevent rebleeding and to allow appropriate treatment of complications is often difficult. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether early endovascular treatment followed by aggressive proactive treatment of complications (prophylactic hypervolemic hemodilution, hypertensive treatment in the event of systemic hypotension, and appropriate treatment of intracranial hypertension) is an acceptable management strategy for these patients.
   METHODS: We prospectively studied I I consecutive patients who presented with acutely ruptured aneurysms and were in very poor neurological condition after resuscitation (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grade V) but did not have a significant intracerebral hemorrhage. These patients received endovascular treatment with Guglielmi detachable coils (Boston Scientific/Target, Fremont, CA). Follow-up consisted of a clinical evaluation based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. A control angiogram was obtained after 6 months in patients with favorable outcomes to evaluate the occlusion of the aneurysm.
   RESULTS: There were no deaths or complications directly related to the procedure. Two patients died as a consequence of increased intracranial pressure. The mean follow-up of the surviving patients was 12 months. Two patients had early rebleeding after the coiling and required further treatment. Four patients had good outcomes, two patients were moderately disabled, and three patients were severely disabled.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early endovascular treatment of acutely ruptured cerebral aneurysms in patients evaluated as World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grade V allows for aggressive treatment of intracranial hypertension and vasospasm. More than half of the patients had favorable outcomes. Therefore, early endovascular treatment seems to be a valuable alternative to early surgery in patients who present with a very poor clinical grade after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The results of this study are promising but must be interpreted with caution, because a small number of patients were studied.

TI  - Disorders of consciousness diagnosis, interventions, and prognostication for the intensivist: Report of the 2025 ISICEM roundtable
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Disorders of consciousness (DoC) represent a spectrum of clinical conditions, including coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, and the minimally conscious state, which may result from structural and non-structural brain injuries due to trauma, stroke, anoxia, infections of the brain, and other causes. Clinical management of patients with DoC is especially challenging in the critical care environment, where the level of consciousness, a key factor in determining the trajectory of recovery, may be obscured by sedation, analgesia, and other confounders. The 2025 International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine hosted a Roundtable of 18 expert clinicians and researchers to synthesise and discuss the latest evidence on acute DoC epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Here, we summarise the output of the Roundtable in the format of a roadmap with six steps related to identifying patients with DoC, assessing for and treating confounders, establishing a diagnosis and prognosis, selecting interventions, and effectively communicating with family. This roadmap provides practical, evidence-informed guidance to help intensivists navigate diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication in patients with acute DoC. Advances in structural and functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and blood-based biomarkers offer promise for refined diagnostics and prognostication, though their clinical translation remains limited.

TI  - Predictors and outcomes of perioperative cardiac arrest in children undergoing noncardiac surgery
T2  - BJA OPEN
AB  - Background: Perioperative cardiac arrest continues to occur. This study aims to identify risk factors for perioperative cardiac arrest in children presenting for noncardiac surgery and characterise its outcomes. Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Pediatric Database 2019 and 2020, 261 276 patients were included. Patients >= 18 yr and cardiac surgical procedures were excluded. Exploratory multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of perioperative cardiac arrest and associated outcomes. Results: The overall rate of cardiac arrest was 0.1%, with an intraoperative rate of 0.05% and 48-h postoperative rate of 0.06%. Significant risk factors for perioperative cardiac arrest included age <12 months (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 3.07, P<0.001), American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status classification (ASA-PS 3 aOR=2.57, P<0.001; ASA-PS 4 aOR=5.27, P<0.001; ASA-PS 5 aOR=13.1, P<0.001), admission through the emergency room (aOR 1.7, P=0.003), inpatient (aOR 2.19, P=0.008), major and severe cardiac disease (aOR 1.58, P=0.008), impaired cognitive status (aOR 1.54, P=0.009), and longer anaesthesia duration (aOR 1.1 per 30 min, P<0.001). Perioperative cardiac arrest was significantly associated with longer hospital length of stay, reoperation, differences in discharge destination, and 30-day mortality. In addition, patients experiencing postoperative cardiac arrest had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital and 30-day mortality than those experiencing intraoperative cardiac arrest. Conclusions: The incidence of cardiac arrest in this study is higher than previously reported. This may be related to selection bias and the rigorous data collection required by NSQIP. Lower 30-day mortality after intraoperative cardiac arrest could be related to prompt recognition and rapid initiation of intraoperative resuscitation. Identification of perioperative risk factors for cardiac arrest is crucial to improve the safety and quality of patient care.

TI  - Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients With Hematologic Malignancies: Prospective Multicenter Data From France and Belgium-A Groupe de Recherche Respiratoire en Reanimation Onco-Hematologique Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - Purpose
   Patients with hematologic malignancies are increasingly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) when life-threatening events occur. We sought to report outcomes and prognostic factors in these patients.
   Patients and Methods
   Ours was a prospective, multicenter cohort study of critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and disease status were collected after 3 to 6 months.
   Results
   Of the 1,011 patients, 38.2% had newly diagnosed malignancies, 23.1% were in remission, and 24.9% had received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations (HSCT, including 145 allogeneic). ICU admission was mostly required for acute respiratory failure (62.5%) and/or shock (42.3%). On day1, 733 patients (72.5%) received life-supporting interventions. Hospital, day-90, and 1-year survival rates were 60.7%, 52.5%, and 43.3%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, cancer remission and time to ICU admission less than 24 hours were associated with better hospital survival. Poor performance status, Charlson comorbidity index, allogeneic HSCT, organ dysfunction score, cardiac arrest, acute respiratory failure, malignant organ infiltration, and invasive aspergillosis were associated with higher hospital mortality. Mechanical ventilation (47.9% of patients), vasoactive drugs (51.2%), and dialysis (25.9%) were associated with mortality rates of 60.5%, 57.5%, and 59.2%, respectively. On day 90, 80% of survivors had no HRQOL alterations (physical and mental health similar to that of the overall cancer population). After 6 months, 80% of survivors had no change in treatment intensity compared with similar patients not admitted to the ICU, and 80% were in remission.
   Conclusion
   Critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies have good survival, disease control, and post-ICU HRQOL. Earlier ICU admission is associated with better survival. (C) 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Fournier's gangrene: its management remains a challenge
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rapidly progressive necrotizing bacterial dermo-hypodermitis of the perineum and external genitalia. It represents a real medical and surgical emergency requiring multidisciplinary care. Our study was based on the retrospective analysis of 18 cases of FG, collected in the Department of General and Visceral Surgery of Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital in Monastir over an 18-year period extending from January 2000 to December 2018. Our series included 18 cases of FG collected over an 18-year period, an annual incidence of one case per year. The average age of our patients was 58 years (36 to 77). The male prevalence was clear. Diabetes and old age were found to be the major risk factors. The treatment was based on an aggressive surgical debridement remains to be the cornerstone of therapy and is commonly preceded by patient preparation for the surgical act by perioperative resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, possibly accompanied by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The vaccum assisted closure (VAC) therapy is also used, which is a non-invasive system that promotes open wound healing. Healing techniques can be once the septic risk is controlled. Dressings topical treatments, such as fatty substances or calcium alginate, in addition to skin grafts, musculo-neurotic or musculo-cutaneous cover flaps can be used. During the follow-up period, no reccurrence occurred in 14 out of the 18 cases (2 patients were lost to follow-up and 2 patients died). A colostomy was closed in 10 out of 11 cases with simple follow-ups. Restorative surgery (partial thickness skin graft) at the perineal level was performed in only one case. Despite the better understanding of its etiopathogenesis, the advent of targeted antibiotic therapy, the establishment of a better codification of surgical procedures, the contribution of hyperbaric oxygenation and reconstruction techniques, mortality rates are still high and FG remains a real health threat, thus constituting a real medical and surgical emergency.

TI  - Posttraumatic Stress 18 Months Following Cardioverter Defibrillator Implantation: Shocks, Anxiety, and Personality
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been observed in cardiac patients, but little is known about PTSD in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients. We examined the prevalence and predictors (clinical variables, personality, and anxiety) of PTSD in ICD patients. Method: Three hundred ninety-five ICD patients (20.1% female; mean age = 62.8 +/- 10.3 years) from two Dutch referral hospitals completed the 14-item Type D scale (DS14) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess Type D (distressed) personality (high negative affect with social inhibition) and anxiety (on the State Anxiety Inventory) at the time of implantation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of PTSD at 18 months postimplantation. Results: At 18 months postimplantation, 30 patients (7.6%) qualified for a PTSD diagnosis. Of these patients, 55% (n = 16) had a Type D personality. 83% (n = 25) experienced anxiety at baseline, and 24% (a = 7) had experienced shocks during follow-up. Both Type D personality (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5) and baseline anxiety (OR = 4.3) were significant predictors of posttraumatic stress at 18 months postimplantation, independent of shocks and other clinical and demographic covariates. Shocks were not significantly associated with PTSD. Conclusion: A significant group of ICD patients is at risk of posttraumatic stress 18 months postimplantation, especially Type D patients and patients with increased levels of baseline anxiety. Identification of patients with Type D personality and anxiety at the time of implantation may be warranted to prevent PTSD in ICD patients.

TI  - Intentional nontherapy in long QT syndrome
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND International guidelines advise universal beta-blocker therapy as either a class I (symptomatic or QTc >= 470 ms) or class II (asymptomatic and QTc <470 ms) recommendation for treatment of long QT syndrome (LQTS).
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of a highly selected cohort of patients with LQTS managed with an observation-only (intentional nontreatment) strategy.
   METHODS The cohort was derived from a comprehensive retrospective registry of patients with LQTS. Clinical phenotype and genotype data were collected via review of electronic health records.
   RESULTS Among 661 patients with LQTS, 55 (8.3%) asymptomatic patients (53% female; 16 age <18 years) were managed with intentional nontherapy. Only preventative measures were advised. Mean age at diagnosis was 37.8 +/- 21.2 years. Mean QTc was 448 +/- 30 ms. None of the patients experienced an LQTS-triggered cardiac event over mean follow-up of 7.5 +/- 4.3 years. Compared to the larger treated cohort, this intentionally untreated cohort was less symptomatic, was older at diagnosis, and had lower resting QTc values (P<.0001).
   CONCLUSION After careful clinical evaluation, risk assessment, and institution of precautionary measures, an observation-only strategy may be considered in a highly selected group of LQTS patients with a clinical profile that includes asymptomatic status, older age at diagnosis, and QTc <470 ms, with excellent outcomes and better quality of life than LQTS patients treated with beta-blocker. LQTS patients with this low-risk profile should not receive a prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Heart Rhythm Society.

TI  - Out-of-hospital assessment of elderly patients' preference for ICU care
T2  - ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION
AB  - Objective. - To estimate the adequacy between elderly patients' preference for ICU care when treated for a life-threatening pathology, and the strategy proposed by the medical team on scene.
   Study design. - Prospective, observational study.
   Patients and methods. - All patients older than 80 treated out-of-hospital for a life threatening pathology were included, except in case of language barrier, or when patients were unable to answer and absence of next-of-kin. The results of the questionnaire on quality of life and patients' preference concerning ICU care were compared to the responses provided blindly by the medical team.
   Results. - Fifty-five patients were included. Quality of life as expressed by the patients was 7 (5-10) and by the physician 7 (6-8)(P = 0.69). Thirty-six patients (65%) expressed the wish to be resuscitated, while ICU admission would have been proposed for 44 patients (80%) by the doctors (P = 0.01). Among the 14 patients reluctant to ICU admission, 11 would have been proposed for ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.55 [1.04-2.32], P = 0.03) and history of neurological pathology (OR: 11,91 [5.68 -> 100], P = 0.04) were associated with such an inadequacy.
   Conclusion. - The inadequacy between elderly patients' preferences and doctors' opinion concerning ICU cares is frequent. The present results support a more systematic collection of patients' preferences when treated on scene for a life-threatening pathology.

TI  - Cryptococcal meningitis after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: Microbial infection should be regarded in the differential diagnosis of neurosurgical complications after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery, albeit cryptococcal meningitis is rare. This article will discuss the risk factors of cryptococcal meningitis in patients underwent transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery, and summary the potential origins of infection.
   Patient concerns and diagnosis: Here, we report a case of 37-year-old male who had cryptococcal meningitis after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery of a relapsing ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.
   Intervention: Standard therapy for Cryptococcus neoformans (fluconazole [400mg per day] and flucytosine) was administered and followed by maintenance dose.
   Outcomes: The patient had been on treatment for one and a half years during follow-up and reported neurologically well with repeated negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture until sudden death of heart arrest.
   Main lessons to learn: C neoformans can be a possible cause of meningitis in immunocompetent patients after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery. Risk factors, such as pre-existed pulmonary infection and Cushing-associated hypercortisolemia, should be stressed. Promising preventive measures may include preoperative routine sputum smear and India-ink stain for screening, preoperative treatment of cryptococcal pneumonia, postoperative antibiotic management, and a more secure skull base reconstruction. Radiation and pharmaceutical treatment may be alternative for recurrent Cushing disease.

TI  - Continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury: a case report
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury is a severe complication of pediatric trauma with complex and diverse mechanisms and is associated with multiple organ dysfunction. For severely injured children, renal function should be closely monitored, and continuous renal replacement therapy should be promptly initiated if there is a risk of developing severe acute kidney injury. This case report describes the treatment process of a child with acute kidney injury due to trauma, highlighting the need to improve the rapid identification of traumatic acute kidney injury risk and actively implement resuscitation strategies to protect renal function in trauma patients. Case Description: A 3-year-old boy presented with acute kidney injury following a car accident. Multi-organ dysfunction developed, and laparotomy and liver laceration repair were performed. Continuous renal replacement therapy for 7 days, plasma exchange, antimicrobial therapy, and multi-organ support were provided. A 1-year follow-up showed no organ dysfunction. Conclusions: This case report describes the treatment process of a child with acute kidney injury due to trauma, highlighting the need to improve the rapid identification of traumatic acute kidney injury risk and actively implement resuscitation strategies to protect renal function in patients with trauma. Prompt continuous renal replacement therapy should be considered when necessary to prevent adverse outcomes.

TI  - Exploring the patients' experiences of living with a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator provides effective treatment for the prevention of sudden cardiac arrest but significant risks associated with transvenous implantation persist. The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator has proven to be an alternative and innovative treatment option for select patients to mitigate these risks. Obtaining the patients' perspectives can provide clinicians with essential information to guide implant selection, procedural decision-making, and support patient management. Conventional implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients have reported shock-related anxiety, fear, insufficient education, and challenges adapting to physical and psychological changes. Little evidence exists to determine whether differences between the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator and conventional implantable cardioverter defibrillator allow for the transferability of our current knowledge to the care and management of this population.
   Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore patients' experiences of living with a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator including the decision-making process, implant, and follow-up care processes.
   Methods: Using an exploratory qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone with 15 participants who underwent subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator implant.
   Results: Analysis revealed five main themes: (a) influences on decision-making; (b) unmet education needs; (c) physical impact; (d) psychological impact; and (e) recommendations.
   Conclusion: As a new technology, little knowledge of the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator exists outside of the tertiary implanting sites, therefore developing new strategies to increase learning and dissemination is essential. Although similarities exist in our findings to those of conventional implantable cardioverter defibrillators, there are significant differences in the decision-making process and physical impact which require individualized care planning and development of strategies to provide a patient-centered approach to care.

TI  - Implantable defibrillators in primary prevention of genetic arrhythmias. A shocking choice?
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Many previously unexplained life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) in young individuals are now recognized to be genetic in nature and are ascribed to a growing number of distinct inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and short QT syndrome. Because of their lower frequency compared to coronary disease, risk factors for SCD are not very precise in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. As randomized studies are generally non-feasible and may even be ethically unjustifiable, especially in the presence of effective therapies, the risk assessment of malignant arrhythmic events such as SCD, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interventions, or ICD therapy on fast VT/VF to guide ICD implantation is based on observational data and expert consensus. In this document, we review risk factors for SCD and indications for ICD implantation and additional therapies. What emerges is that, allowing for some important differences between cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, there is a growing and disquieting trend to create, and then use, semi-automated systems (risk scores, risk calculators, and, to some extent, even guidelines) which then dictate therapeutic choices. Their common denominator is a tendency to favour ICD implantation, sometime with reason, sometime without it. This contrasts with the time-honoured approach of selecting, among the available therapies, the best option (ICDs included) based on the clinical judgement for the specific patient and after having assessed the protection provided by optimal medical treatment.

TI  - Histone deactylase gene expression profiles are associated with outcomes in blunt trauma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as valproic acid, increases survival in animal models of trauma and sepsis. Valproic acid is a pan-inhibitor that blocks most of the known HDAC isoforms. Targeting individual HDAC isoforms may increase survival and reduce complications, but little is known of the natural history of HDAC gene expression following trauma. We hypothesized that distinct HDAC isoform gene expression patterns would be associated with differences in outcomes following trauma.
   METHODS Twenty-eight-day longitudinal HDAC leukocyte gene expression profiles in 172 blunt trauma patients were extracted from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury (Glue Grant) data set. Outcome was classified as complicated (death or no recovery by Day 28, n = 51) or uncomplicated (n = 121). Mixed modeling was used to compare the HDAC expression trajectories between the groups, corrected for Injury Severity Score (ISS), base deficit, and volume of blood products transfused during the initial 12 hours following admission. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified modules of genes with significant coexpression, and HDAC genes were mapped to these modules. Biologic function of these modules was investigated using the Gene Ontology database.
   RESULTS Elevated longitudinal HDAC expression trajectories for HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC11 were associated with complicated outcomes. In contrast, suppressed expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) was associated with adverse outcome (p < 0.01). Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified significant coexpression of HDAC and SIRT genes with genes involved in ribosomal function and down-regulation of protein translation in response to stress (HDAC1), T-cell signaling, and T-cell selection (HDAC3) as well as coagulation and hemostasis (SIRT3). No coexpression of HDAC11 was identified.
   CONCLUSION Expression trajectories of HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC11, and SIRT3 correlate with outcomes following trauma and may potentially serve as biomarkers. They may also be promising targets for pharmacologic intervention. The effects of HDAC and SIRT gene expression in trauma may be mediated through pathways involved in ribosomal and T-cell function as well as coagulation and hemostasis.

TI  - Exploring the Expanded Role of Pharmacists in Advance Care Planning
T2  - JCO ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
AB  - PURPOSE Advance care planning (ACP) is a clinical skill that can be taught. An opportunity exists to teach how to conduct ACP to clinicians not typically engaged in these conversations to increase the likelihood that patients and caregivers engage in ACP. We conducted a prospective study exploring the feasibility of a pharmacist-led ACP intervention.
   METHODS We completed a prospective, single-center study from July 2015 to July 2017. We included patients of age >= 18 years with incurable cancer referred to the palliative care clinic. A trained pharmacist led an ACP discussion with the patient and selected proxy. We defined feasibility as completion of >= 30 pharmacist-led ACP discussions over the study period. Additionally, we defined an informed healthcare proxy as someone who understood three key end-of-life (EOL) treatment preferences: the patient's personal definition of quality of life, desired resuscitation status, and preferred location of death (in or out of the hospital). Patients were followed until the end of the study or death. For those patients who died, the pharmacist contacted the proxy for follow-up and explored satisfaction with the ACP intervention.
   RESULTS Thirty-four patients completed the study. All selected proxies completed the intervention and were able to understand the three EOL preferences. At the time of the patient's death (n=20), proxies reported that 66.6% received their preferred resuscitation status and 72.2% died in their preferred location. Proxy satisfaction with the ACP process was 7.6 +/- 2.5 (mean +/- SD) on a 11-point Likert scale.
   CONCLUSION These findings indicate the potential for pharmacists to lead and engage in ACP in the outpatient setting. (C) 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - New trends in treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - ARCHIVES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
AB  - The management of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has evolved markedly over the past 20 years, particularly with the rising number of indications for implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and alcohol septal ablation (ASA). However, medical therapies targeted to improve quality of life are underused; when resting and/or exercise obstruction is present, an incremental and additive approach should be used based on a high dosage of beta-blockers, verapamil and/or disopyramide. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of atria[ fibrillation or A-V node has been proposed in some instances. Treatment of syncope or presyncope due to an abnormal blood pressure response during exercise remains challenging. Only patients with obstruction who remain severely symptomatic despite maximal. medical therapy should be considered for invasive procedures, including dual-chamber (DDD) pacing, ASA or surgery. The reported complication rates of ASA (essentially complete A-V block, incidence above 5-10%, with mortality rates ranging from 0-4%) and the benefits at medium-term follow-up appear comparable to those observed after myectomy, which, according to guidelines, should remain the primary treatment for most severely symptomatic drug-refractory young patients with obstruction. White the overall, survival of patients with HCM is similar to that of the general population, detection of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death remains challenging, particularly in the young, and indications for ICDs in high risk patients without prior cardiac arrest should be patient- and family-orientated.

TI  - Effects of obesity on function, pain, and complications after rotator cuff repair: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - OBESITY RESEARCH & CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - This meta-analysis aimed to determine the impact of obesity on function, pain, complication and patientreported outcome measure following rotator cuff repair. This meta-analysis compares patients with obesity and without obesity undergoing rotator cuff repair surgery in terms of effectiveness, safety, and patient-reported measures. Four major databases were searched. Odds ratios, mean differences, and standard mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.4. Sixteen studies (n = 139,638 patients) were included. At the final follow-up, patients with obesity had significantly higher visual analogue scale (VAS) pain (SMD 0.16, 95 % CI 0.03-0.29). Patients with obesity had lower American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) scores (MD -4.70, 95 % CI -7.57 to -1.82). No differences were observed in range of motion (ROM). Patients with obesity had a higher overall complication risk (OR 1.64, 95 % CI 1.38-1.95; I2 = 19 %) driven by obesity (OR 1.66, 95 % CI 1.29-2.13) and severely subgroups with obesity (OR 1.84, 95 %CI 1.43-2.37). Patients with obesity had significantly higher risks of thrombosis, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and renal complications. They also showed significantly higher reoperation (OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.21-1.43) and readmission rates (OR 1.37, 95 % CI 1.31-1.44). Obesity is associated with worse pain and function and higher complication rates after rotator cuff repair. These findings have implications for perioperative counseling and management in this population.

TI  - Perinatal asphyxia: current status and approaches towards neuroprotective strategies, with focus on sentinel proteins
T2  - NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH
AB  - Delivery is a stressful and risky event menacing the newborn. The mother-dependent respiration has to be replaced by autonomous pulmonary breathing immediately after delivery. If delayed, it may lead to deficient oxygen supply compromising survival and development of the central nervous system. Lack of oxygen availability gives rise to depletion of NAD(+) tissue stores, decrease of ATP formation, weakening of the electron transport pump and anaerobic metabolism and acidosis, leading necessarily to death if oxygenation is not promptly re-established. Re-oxygenation triggers a cascade of compensatory biochemical events to restore function, which may be accompanied by improper homeostasis and oxidative stress. Consequences may be incomplete recovery, or excess reactions that worsen the biological outcome by disturbed metabolism and/or imbalance produced by over-expression of alternative metabolic pathways. Perinatal asphyxia has been associated with severe neurological and psychiatric sequelae with delayed clinical onset. No specific treatments have yet been established. In the clinical setting, after resuscitation of an infant with birth asphyxia, the emphasis is on supportive therapy. Several interventions have been proposed to attenuate secondary neuronal injuries elicited by asphyxia, including hypothermia. Although promising, the clinical efficacy of hypothermia has not been fully demonstrated. It is evident that new approaches are warranted. The purpose of this review is to discuss the concept of sentinel proteins as targets for neuroprotection. Several sentinel proteins have been described to protect the integrity of the genome (e.g. PARP-1; XRCC1; DNA ligase III alpha; DNA polymerase beta, ERCC2, DNA-dependent protein kinases). They act by eliciting metabolic cascades leading to (i) activation of cell survival and neurotrophic pathways; (ii) early and delayed programmed cell death, and (iii) promotion of cell proliferation, differentiation, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. It is proposed that sentinel proteins can be used as markers for characterising long-term effects of perinatal asphyxia, and as targets for novel therapeutic development and innovative strategies for neonatal care.

TI  - Prospective Study to Assess Knowledge about Basic Life Support in College Students and Evaluate the Effectiveness of Basic Life Support Training
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PRACTICE OF CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Background and Aims:Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests represent critical situations wherein prompt basic life support (BLS) intervention can significantly impact survivability. This study aimed to assess the baseline knowledge of BLS among college students and evaluate the efficacy of a training intervention, gauging changes in confidence and performance scores.Methods:Following ethical approval, a pretraining BLS questionnaire was administered to participating students. Subsequently, American Heart Association-certified BLS training providers conducted hands-on training. Posttraining, participants completed confidence and their performance was evaluated by the training providers. Data analysis utilized a percentage-based methodology.Results:The findings from the questionnaire revealed that 87% of students had witnessed emergencies, with only 7.7% initiating help and 2.3% observing resuscitation efforts. Notably, a deficit in knowledge about automated external defibrillators was observed across all the participants. Approximately 49.5% expressed interest in training, while 41.7% declined periodic training. Concerningly, 53.7% cited fear of legal repercussions as a deterrent to aiding victims, and 30.09% attributed their nonintervention to a lack of BLS knowledge. Posttraining, 81.5% of students displayed average confidence, with 18.4% exhibiting poor confidence in providing roadside BLS assistance. Performance assessments revealed that 28.15% performed well, 52.90% performed at an average level, and 18.95% performed poorly during hands-on training with a mannequin.Conclusions:The study highlights a notable lack of awareness and understanding of BLS among college students, as evidenced by the pretraining questionnaire. The single training session employed in this study did not substantially enhance confidence or performance scores in providing BLS. The findings underscore the necessity for increased awareness and recurrent BLS training initiatives among the young population to bolster both confidence and practical proficiency in responding to emergency situations.

TI  - What do Galician schoolchildren know about basic life support? A descriptive study
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - Background: Education of schoolchildren is an important issue in promoting the involvement of the lay public in improving survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For this quality training it is necessary to know what schoolchildren know to establish what they need to learn about it. For this reason, the objective of this research was to evaluate the knowledge in SVB of schoolchildren in the 5th and 6th grades of Primary Education and students in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades of Secondary Education. Methods: During the first quarter of the 2021/2022 academic year, a survey was conducted of 947 Primary (n=308) and Secondary (n=639) schoolchildren between the ages of 10 and 17 from four schools supported with public funds from the Xunta de Galicia. Results: 62.81% of the students surveyed received prior training. 92.30% responded incorrectly to the correct sequence of action before a person with possible cardiac arrest and 93.14% did so to the correct order of execution of the AED for an effective shock. 82.40% of schoolchildren know the emergency telephone number. Secondary Education students and those who received prior training have better knowledge than Primary Education students (p < 0.001) and those who do not (p < 0.001), although in both cases they do not reach 5 points out of 10. Conclusions: Galician schoolchildren in Primary and Secondary Education have little knowledge of Basic Life Support, so they do not contribute to the "Children Save Lives" initiative.

TI  - Teaching high quality paediatric basic life support to laypeople: The development and evaluation of a virtual simulation game
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Self-directed training has been recognized as a reasonable alternative to traditional instructor-led formats to teach laypeople Basic Life Support (BLS). Virtual tools can facilitate high-quality self-directed resuscitation education; however, their role in teaching paediatric BLS remains unclear due to limited empiric evaluation and suboptimal design of existing tools. Aim: We describe the development and evaluation of a virtual simulation game (VSG) designed to teach highquality paediatric BLS using a self-directed, online format with integrated deliberate practice and feedback. Methods: We conducted a pilot prospective single-arm cohort study examining the VSG's impact on laypeople's paediatric BLS self-efficacy, attitudes, and knowledge as well as learner reactions. Data was collected using online surveys immediately after VSG completion and was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-five participants (median age 32 years, 76% female, 11% active certification in paediatric BLS) evaluated the VSG. Participants reported high self-efficacy, willingness to perform paediatric BLS, and high perceived knowledge after VSG completion. Fifty (91%) achieved a passing score (>= 13/15) on the paediatric BLS knowledge assessment. Learner reactions were favourable with 98% of participants agreeing that VSG educational content was clear and helpful. Mean System Usability Scale score was 81.1 (standard deviation 12.6) with a Net Promoter Score of 32 indicating high levels of usability and likelihood to recommend to others. Conclusions: The VSG was well-received by laypeople with positive effects observed on paediatric BLS selfefficacy, attitudes, and knowledge. Future studies should examine the impact of VSGs on skill performance through standalone or blended learning approaches.

TI  - The Incidence and Risk Factors for Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Observed in the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a rare but important event in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit, when surgical patients are most intensively monitored. Several recent publications have reported the rate of cardiac arrest in surgical patients during the subsequent hospital stay but have not uniquely identified the immediate perioperative period. We hypothesized that cardiac arrest during this time (intraprocedure and postanesthesia care) would occur at a lower frequency than that described for inpatient hospital care in the available literature.
   METHODS: We extracted data from all cardiac arrests and immediate perioperative deaths reported to the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry for the period from 2010 to 2013 and analyzed for anesthesia-related risk factors. We compared these data to published rates of in-hospital cardiac arrest after surgery.
   RESULTS: Overall, the risk of cardiac arrest was 5.6 per 10,000 cases, which is less than in previous reports of in-hospital arrests in surgical patients overall, with an associated mortality from the arrest of 58.4%. The rate of cardiac arrest increased with age and ASA physical status. The rate of cardiac arrest was significantly higher for males, as was the mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: The National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry is an emerging resource for examination of perioperative and anesthesia-related outcomes. Cardiac arrest is less frequent in the periprocedural setting than later in the hospital course, with most arrests predictably occurring in patients with ASA physical status III-V. The finding of increased risk of mortality in male patients cannot be readily explained and should prompt future research attention.

TI  - Effective Pain Control With Very Low Dose Palliative Radiation Therapy for Patients With Multiple Myeloma With Uncomplicated Osseous Lesions
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background: Osteolytic lesions are present in 75% of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and frequently require palliation with radiation therapy (RT). Prior case series of patients with MM with bone pain undergoing palliative RT suggests doses >= 12 Gy (equivalent dose in 2Gy fractions, EQD2) provide excellent bone pain relief. However, recent advances in care and novel biologic agents have significantly improved overall survival and quality of life for patients with MM. We hypothesized that lower-dose RT (LDRT, EQD2 <12 Gy) offers an effective alternative to higher-dose RT (HDRT, EQD2 >= 12 Gy) for palliation of painful, uncomplicated MM bone lesions. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients with MM treated with RT for uncomplicated, painful bone lesions and stratified by EQD2 >=/< 12 Gy. Clinical pain response (CPR) rates, acute and late toxicity, pain response duration, and retreatment rates between LDRT and HDRT groups were analyzed. Results: Thirty-five patients with 70 treated lesions were included: 24 patients (48 lesions) treated with HDRT and 11 patients (22 lesions) with LDRT. Median follow-up was 14 and 16.89 months for HDRT and LDRT, respectively. The median dose of HDRT treatment was 20 Gy versus 4 Gy in the LDRT group. The CPR rate was 98% for HDRT and 95% for LDRT. There was no significant difference in any-grade acute toxicity between the HDRT and LDRT cohorts (24.5% vs 9.1%, X-2 P = .20). Pain recurred in 10% of lesions (12% HDRT vs 9.5% LDRT). Median duration of pain response did not significantly differ between cohorts (P = .91). Five lesions were retreated, 2 (9.5%) in the LDRT cohort, and 3 (6.3%) in the HDRT cohort. Conclusion: In this study, LDRT effectively palliated painful, uncomplicated MM bony lesions with acceptable CPR and duration of palliation. These data support prospective comparisons of LDRT versus HDRT for palliation of painful, uncomplicated MM bony lesions. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Experience of heart transplantation from hemodynamically unstable brain-dead donors with extracorporeal support
T2  - CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Yang H-Y, Lin C-Y, Tsai Y-T, Lee C-Y, Tsai C-S. Experience of heart transplantation from hemodynamically unstable brain-dead donors with extracorporeal support. Abstract: The shortage of organ donors remains a major problem for transplantation worldwide. Potential donors after brain death may become hemodynamically unstable, despite maximal medical management, which ultimately leads to failure of organ procurement. We reviewed the medical records of five brain-dead potential donors who presented with hemodynamic instability despite maximal medical management that were supported by extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The outcomes of heart recipients were reviewed. The five donors under extracorporeal support finished a declaration of brain death without cardiac arrest. Donor organs, including three hearts, nine kidneys, and four livers, were harvested from the five donors under ECMO support. All three heart recipients recovered uneventfully after one yr of follow-up. Our experience indicates that potential donors may experience central-failure-related hemodynamic instability after brain death, despite maximal medical support, which leads to a fatal result. Beyond medical management, prompt and early extracorporeal support for salvaging brain-dead potential donors from cardiac death seems to be a practical strategy to increase the donor pool and preserve donor organs.

TI  - Emergency stent-graft repair of a ruptured hepatic artery secondary to local postoperative peritonitis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOVASCULAR THERAPY
AB  - Purpose: To describe the use of a stent-graft for emergent repair of life-threatening hepatic artery hemorrhage.
   Methods and Results: A 57-year-old man with a 17-year history of myxoid liposarcoma underwent surgery for a recurrent abdominal mass. Multivisceral resection including a Kausch-Whipple procedure with an extended right hemicolectomy was performed. Three weeks later an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding prompted surgical repair of the hepatic artery, which had been eroded by infection due to a leaking bilioenteric anastomosis. After 3 weeks of programmed abdominal lavage, bleeding recurred. Angiography documented another rupture of the proximal hepatic artery. After an unsuccessful attempt at coil embolization, a Hemobahn stent-graft was implanted percutaneously during simultaneous cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Hemostasis was secured, and the patient recovered. Over the 10-month follow-up, no bleeding or infection has been observed at the site of the repair, and flow through the hepatic artery endograft remains satisfactory.
   Conclusions: Percutaneous stent-graft placement can be employed for emergent treatment of visceral artery rupture in patients at high risk for conventional surgical repair.

TI  - Successful treatment of an acute type A aortic dissection presented with ST segment elevation on ECG and pericardial tamponade. Case report
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Successful treatment of type A acute aortic dissection depends on the promptness of diagnostic evaluation and therapy. Fast diagnosis can be challenged by numerous complications such as myocardial ischemia, acute aortic insufficiency, and disturbances in organ perfusion and pericardial tamponade. The authors report the case history of a 72-year-old woman, who was admitted after resuscitation with ST segment elevation. Echocardiography revealed acute type A aortic dissection with signs of pericardial tamponade. An emergency operation consisting of the resection of the ascending aorta and the reconstruction of the aortic root was performed, which took six hours from admission until the end of the operation. Follow-up examinations demonstrated good left ventricular function and competent aortic valve. The authors propose that with the development of diagnostic and therapeutic options, faster and less invasive interventions will be introduced in near future for the treatment of acute aortic dissection, which may reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of this lethal illness.

TI  - Saving lives with public access defibrillation: A deadly game of hide and seek
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Early defibrillation is a critical link in the chain of survival. Public access defibrillation (PAD) programmes utilising automated external defibrillators (AEDs) aim to decrease the time-to-first-shock, and improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective use of PADs requires rapid location of the device, facilitated by adequate signage. We aimed to therefore assess the quality of signage for PADs in the community.
   Method: From April 2017 to January 2018 we surveyed community PADs available for public use on the 'Save a Life' AED locator mobile application in and around Southampton, UK. Location and signage characteristics were collected, and the distance from the furthest sign to the AED was measured.
   Results: Researchers evaluated 201 separate PADs. All devices visited were included in the final analysis. No signage at all was present for 135 (67.2%) devices. Only 15/201 (7.5%) AEDs had signage at a distance from AED itself. In only 5 of these cases (2.5%) was signage mounted more than 5.0 m from the AED. When signage was present, 46 used 2008 ILCOR signage and 15 used 2006 Resuscitation Council (UK) signage. Signage visibility was partially or severely obstructed at 27/66 (40.9%) sites. None of the 45 GP surgeries surveyed used exterior signage or an exterior 24/7 access box.
   Conclusions: Current signage of PADs is poor and limits the device effectiveness by impeding public awareness and location of AEDs. Recommendations should promote visible signage within the operational radius of each AED.

TI  - Early Thalamic Injury After Resuscitation From Severe Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest in Developing Rats
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Children who survive cardiac arrest often develop debilitating sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. In animal models of cardiac arrest, delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region has served as a fruitful paradigm for investigating mechanisms of injury and neuroprotection. Cardiac arrest in humans, however, is more prolonged than in most experimental models. Consequently, neurologic deficits in cardiac arrest survivors arise from injury not solely to CA1 but to multiple vulnerable brain structures. Here, we develop a rat model of prolonged pediatric asphyxial cardiac arrest and resuscitation, which better approximates arrest characteristics and injury severity in children. Using this model, we characterize features of microglial activation and neuronal degeneration in the thalamus 24 h after resuscitation from 11 and 12 min long cardiac arrest. In addition, we test the effect of mild hypothermia to 34 degrees C for 8 h after 12.5 min of arrest. Microglial activation and neuronal degeneration are most prominent in the thalamic Reticular Nucleus (nRT). The severity of injury increases with increasing arrest duration, leading to frank loss of nRT neurons at longer arrest times. Hypothermia does not prevent nRT injury. Interestingly, injury occurs selectively in intermediate and posterior nRT segments while sparing the anterior segment. Since all nRT segments consist exclusively of GABA-ergic neurons, we asked if GABA-ergic neurons in general are more susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic injury. Surprisingly, cortical GABA-ergic neurons, like their counterparts in the anterior nRT segment, do not degenerate in this model. Hence, we propose that GABA-ergic identity alone is not sufficient to explain selective vulnerability of intermediate and posterior nRT neurons to hypoxic-ischemic injury after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our current findings align the animal model of pediatric cardiac arrest with human data and suggest novel mechanisms of selective vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic injury among thalamic GABA-ergic neurons.

TI  - Uncritical use of tranexamic acid in trauma patients. Do no further harm!
T2  - UNFALLCHIRURG
AB  - Based upon the results of CRASH-2, early administration of antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (TXA) is recommended in bleeding trauma patients or trauma patients presumed to bleed. Many trauma centers and emergency medical services have adopted this practice into their routine algorithms. The pitfalls of CRASH-2 have been discussed in the literature, but the positive effects could sometimes not be reproduced in follow-up studies. The mechanism of action of TXA in trauma is still not clear and major knowledge gaps with TXA in the context of trauma have been identified. Component analyses have indicated different phenotypes of fibrinolytic disturbances after trauma upon emergency department admission with fibrinolytic "shutdown" potentially representing the most prominent and frequent phenotype (64 %). Viscoelastic tests, e.g. ROTEM (R), are currently the best method to assess fibrinolytic phenotype in the acute phase and may support more selective TXA administration and therapies in trauma.

TI  - Interaction effect between prehospital hydration and initial cardiac rhythm in traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide observational study
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is different in etiology compared to medical cardiac arrest. In case of TCA, it is important to initiate early fluid resuscitation. Initial cardiac rhythm serves as an indicator of outcomes in case of cardiac arrest. We aimed to find the association between prehospital hydration and outcomes of TCA according to initial cardiac rhythm. This is a retrospective, observational, crosssectional study. An examination was undertaken involving patients afflicted with TCA within the timeframe of 2014 to 2019. Exposure was defined to encompass prehospital hydration; interactive exposure was categorized by initial cardiac rhythm (non -shockable vs. shockable); the primary outcome was defined as good neurological status at discharge, whereas the secondary outcome was defined as survival to discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A comprehensive analysis was conducted on a cumulative of 20,247 patients. Rates of good neurological status and survival to discharge were 0.2% and 8.3% (non -shockable rhythm group) and 3.0% and 16.7% (shockable rhythm group), respectively. However, rates of good neurological status and survival to discharge were 0.2% and 7.9% (non-prehospital hydration group) and 0.3% and 10.0% (hydration group), respectively. Compared to the non -hydration group, the AORs for good neurological status at discharge was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.77-2.69) for the hydration group. Moreover, compared to the non -shockable rhythm group, the AORs for good neurological status at discharge was 19.74 (95% CI: 10.46-27.26) in the shockable rhythm group. The interaction analysis conducted between prehospital hydration and initial rhythm unveiled the efficacy of prehospital hydration in promoting favorable survival to discharge outcomes in the non -shockable rhythm group. Therefore, prehospital hydration is recommended for those with TCA characterized by a nonshockable rhythm before transport from the incident location.

TI  - Recommendations of the Committee of Andrology and Sexual Medicine of the AFU concerning the management of Vasectomy
T2  - PROGRES EN UROLOGIE
AB  - Objectives. - To answer the main clinical questions asked by practitioners and men consulting for a vasectomy request. Method. - The CPR method was used. The clinical questions were formulated according to the PICO methodology. A Pubmed literature search for the period 1984-2021 identified 508 refe-rences, of which 79 were selected and analyzed with the GRADE grid. Recommendations. - Vasectomy is a permanent, potentially reversible contraception. It is a safe procedure. A second vasectomy is necessary in only 1 % of cases. Surgical complications (hematoma, infection, pain, etc.) are rare. The frequency of prolonged scrotal pain after vasec-tomy is about 5 %, and less than 2 % describe a negative impact of this pain on their quality of life. Vasectomy does not have negative consequences on sexuality. The only contraindication to vasectomy is the minor patient. Patients at increased risk of remorse are single, divorced or separated men under the age of 30. Sperm storage may be particularly appropriate for them. Whatever the reason, the law allows the surgeon to refuse to perform the vasectomy. He must inform the patient of this at the first consultation. The choice of the type of anesthesia is left to the discretion of the surgeon and the patient. It must be decided during the preoperative consultation. Local anesthesia should be considered first. General anesthesia should be parti-cularly considered in cases of anxiety or intense sensitivity of the patient to palpation of the vas deferens, difficulty palpating the vas deferens, or a history of scrotal surgery that would make the procedure more complex. Concerning the vasectomy technique, 2 points seem to improve the efficiency of the vasectomy: coagulation of the deferential mucosa and interpo-sition of fascia. Leaving the proximal end of the vas deferens free seems to reduce the risk of post-vasectomy syndrome without increasing the risk of failure or complications. No-scalpel vasectomy is associated with a lower risk of postoperative complications than conventional vasectomy. Regarding follow-up, it is recommended to perform a spermogram at 3 months post-vasectomy and after 30 ejaculations. If there are still a few non-motile spermatozoa at 3 months, it is recommended that a check-up be performed at 6 months post-vasectomy. In case of motile spermatozoa or more than 100,000 immobile spermatozoa/mL at 6 months (defining failure), a new vasectomy should be considered. Contraception must be maintained until the effectiveness of the vasectomy is confirmed. (c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Legal aspects of the application of the lay rescuer automatic external defibrillator (AED) program in South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - The American Heart Association has stated that the automatic external defibrillator (AED) is a promising method for achieving rapid defibrillation, and emphasized that AED training and use should be available in every community. The demonstrated safety and effectiveness of the AED make it ideally suited for the delivery of early defibrillation by trained laypersons, and the placement of AEDs in selected locations for immediate use by trained laypersons may enable critical intervention that can significantly increase survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The American Heart Association recommends the installation of AEDs in public locations such as airports, thus allowing laypersons to conduct defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the occasion of adverse cardiopulmonary events. In Korea, the Ministry of Health and Welfare officially prohibits the installation of AEDs in public locations on the grounds that cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation are understood as medical practices that can be conducted only by licensed medical practitioners. The purpose of this article is to discuss the necessity for AEDs and the appropriate process for their implementation in Korea, by examining the current pre-AED status of Korea and the relevant legal aspects.

TI  - Bereavement Support Programs in the Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Objectives. The death of a loved one in the intensive care unit (ICU) may have a psychological impact on relatives of deceased ICU patients. The first aim of this review is to give an overview of different bereavement support strategies and possible different effects on anxiety, depression, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and complicated grief. Secondly to assess if there is a difference in organization among bereavement support strategies mentioned in literature.
   Methods. A multi-database search (Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Medline, and Embase) was conducted until February 6, 2021. Articles were screened and selected by two independent researchers. Methodological quality of the included articles was assessed using the Delphi List for Quality Assessment of Randomized Clinical Trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for nonrandomized trials.
   Results. The primary literature search revealed 1668 articles, including 769 duplicates. Seven articles were included in this review, of which six were randomized controlled trials and one was a prospective cross-sectional study. We found that a bereavement strategy consisting of a communication strategy and a brochure lowered the appearance of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. A brochure, condolence card, and phone call as bereavement support can lower the risk of prolonged grief. Receiving information about CPR and getting the choice to attend CPR led to fewer frequencies of PTSD, depression, and traumatic/complicated grief.
   Significance of results. A bereavement strategy consisting of multiple parts, including family participation and a brochure may reduce the levels of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and/or complicated bereavement in family members of deceased ICU patients.

TI  - EEG Reactivity Evaluation Practices for Adult and Pediatric Hypoxic-Ischemic Coma Prognostication in North America
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the variability in EEG reactivity evaluation practices during cardiac arrest prognostication.
   Methods: A survey of institutional representatives from North American academic hospitals participating in the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium was conducted to assess practice patterns involving EEG reactivity evaluation. This 10-question multiple-choice survey evaluated metrics related to technical, interpretation, personnel, and procedural aspects of bedside EEG reactivity testing and interpretation specific to cardiac arrest prognostication. One response per hospital was obtained.
   Results: Responses were received from 25 hospitals, including 7 pediatric hospitals. A standardized EEG reactivity protocol was available in 44% of centers. Sixty percent of respondents believed that reactivity interpretation was subjective. Reactivity bedside testing always (100%) started during hypothermia and was performed daily during monitoring in the majority (71%) of hospitals. Stimulation was performed primarily by neurodiagnostic technologists (76%). The mean number of activation procedures modalities tested was 4.5 (SD 2.1). The most commonly used activation procedures were auditory (83.3%), nail bed pressure (63%), and light tactile stimuli (63%). Changes in EEG amplitude alone were not considered consistent with EEG reactivity in 21% of centers.
   Conclusions: There is substantial variability in EEG reactivity evaluation practices during cardiac arrest prognostication among North American academic hospitals. Efforts are needed to standardize protocols and nomenclature according with national guidelines and promote best practices in EEG reactivity evaluation.

TI  - Safety of instrumentation in patients with spinal infection Clinical article
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE
AB  - Object. Treatment of spine infection remains a challenge for spine surgeons, with the most effective method still being a matter of debate. Most surgeons agree that in early stages of infection, antibiotic treatment should be pursued; under certain circumstances, however, surgery is recommended. The goals of surgery include radical debridement of the infective focus. In some cases, when surgery causes mechanical spinal instability, the question arises whether the risk of recurrent infection outweighs the benefits of spinal instrumentation and stabilization. The authors report their series of cases in which instrumentation was placed in actively infected sites and review the relevant literature.
   Methods. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of all cases of spinal infection that were surgically treated with debridement and placement of instrumentation at their institution between 2000 and 2006. Patient presentation, risk factor, infective organism, surgical indication, level of involvement, type of procedure, and ultimate outcome were reviewed. Improved outcome was based on improvement of initial American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Score.
   Results. Forty-seven patients (32 men, 15 women) were treated with instrumented surgery for spinal infection. Their average age at presentation was 54 years (range 37-78 years). Indications for placement of instrumentation included instability, pain after failure of conservative therapy, or both. Patients underwent surgery within an average of 12 days (range 1 day to 5 months) after their presentation to the authors' institution. The average length of hospital stay was 25 days (range 9-78 days). Follow-up averaged 22 months (range 1-80 months). Eight patients died; causes of death included sepsis (4 patients), cardiac arrest (2), and malignancy (2). Only 3 patients were lost to follow-up. Using American Spinal Injury Association scoring as the criterion, the patients' conditions improved in 34 cases and remained the same in 5. Complications included hematoma (2 cases), the need for hardware revision (I), and recurrent infection (2). Hardware replacement was required in 1 of the 2 patients with recurrent infection.
   Conclusions. Instrumentation of the spine is safe and has an important role in stabilization of the infected spine. Despite the presence of active infection, we believe that instrumentation after radical debridement will not increase the risk of recurrent infection. In fact, greater benefit can be achieved through spinal stabilization, which can even promote accelerated healing. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.12.SPINE09428)

TI  - Enhancing Equity in Schoolchildren's Basic Life Support Education in Brazil Through Serious Games: Cohort Study
T2  - JMIR SERIOUS GAMES
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) predominantly occur in residential settings, often witnessed by children who could act as first responders. The World Health Organization (WHO) supports the Kids Save Lives (KSL) initiative, recommending basic life support (BLS) training for children aged >= 11 years. However, disparities in BLS education persist globally, particularly in low-resource regions where socioeconomic barriers, such as school type, malnutrition, and limited infrastructure, hinder implementation. Younger children (aged <11 years) face additional challenges due to physical limitations (eg, height, weight, and grip strength), which may compromise their ability to achieve adequate chest compression depth. While gamified learning has shown promise in improving BLS engagement and skill acquisition, its efficacy across diverse socioeconomic groups remains understudied.<br /> Objective: This study aimed to compare cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance (compression depth, rate, and recoil) between public and private school students following a game-based BLS intervention and evaluate the feasibility of a serious game (Kids Save Hearts) in improving BLS knowledge and irrespective of socioeconomic background.<br /> Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study with 336 students aged 7-17 years from 10 public and 10 private schools in Brazil (April to November 2022). Participants received 40 minutes of video-based CPR training (American Heart Association CPR in Schools) followed by 10 minutes of gamified training using the Children Save Hearts serious game (SG). CPR quality was assessed via quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (QCPR) scores (Laerdal QCPR manikin), measuring compression depth (mm), compression rate (per minute), and chest recoil. Anthropometric data (height, weight, and grip strength) and socioeconomic indicators (school type) were collected. Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests) and multivariate regression (SPSS v27.0; IBM Corp) were used to analyze associations between demographics, physical characteristics, and CPR performance.<br /> Results: Older students (11-17 years) outperformed younger peers (7-10 years) in median compression depth (48 mm vs 37 mm; P<.001) and overall QCPR scores (84 vs 42, P<.001). Private school students had higher grip strength (24.92 vs 21.48 g/cm2; P=.001), but school type did not significantly affect CPR quality. Postintervention SG scores improved universally (P<.001), with no age or socioeconomic disparities. Multivariate analysis identified age (P<.001), height (P<.001), and grip strength (P<.001) as independent predictors of high QCPR scores (>= 70).<br /> Conclusions: Age and physical development were stronger determinants of CPR quality than socioeconomic factors. The game-based intervention effectively improved BLS knowledge and skills across all participants, demonstrating its potential as an equitable training tool. These findings support the scalability of gamified BLS programs in resource-limited settings.

TI  - In-service training for health professionals to improve care of the seriously ill newborn or child in low and middle-income countries (Review)
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   A variety of emergency care training courses based on developed country models are being promoted as a strategy to improve the quality of care of the seriously ill newborn or child in developing countries. Clear evidence of their effectiveness is lacking.
   Objectives
   To investigate the effectiveness of in-service training of health professionals on their management and care of the seriously ill newborn or child in low and middle-income settings.
   Search strategy
   We searched The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane EPOC group (both up to May 2009), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2009), EMBASE (1980 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to March 2008), ERIC / LILACS / WHOLIS (all up to October 2008), and ISI Science Citation Index Expanded and ISI Social Sciences Citation Index (both from 1975 to March 2009). We checked references of retrieved articles and reviews and contacted authors to identify additional studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials (CRTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs) that reported objectively measured professional practice, patient outcomes, health resource / services utilization, or training costs in healthcare settings (not restricted to studies in low-income settings).
   Data collection and analysis
   We independently selected studies for inclusion, abstracted data using a standardised form, and assessed study quality. Meta-analysis was not appropriate. Study results were summarised and appraised.
   Main results
   Two studies of varied designs were included. In one RCT of moderate quality, Newborn Resuscitation Training (NRT) was associated with a significant improvement in performance of adequate initial resuscitation steps (risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42, P < 0.001, adjusted for clustering) and a reduction in the frequency of inappropriate and potentially harmful practices (mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66, P = 0.004). In the second RCT, available limited data suggested that there was improvement in assessment of breathing and newborn care practices in the delivery room following implementation of Essential Newborn Care (ENC) training.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is limited evidence that in-service neonatal emergency care courses improve health-workers' practices when caring for a seriously ill newborn although there is some evidence of benefit. Rigorous trials evaluating the impact of refresher emergency care training on long-term professional practices are needed. To optimise appropriate policy decisions, studies should aim to collect data on resource use and costs of training implementation.

TI  - Temporary mechanical circulatory support devices: updates from recent studies
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review Over the past several years, the role of short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices has become the dominant focus in efforts to improve outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). Alongside these efforts, temporary MCS devices have been increasingly used to support patients prior to cardiac surgery, during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, awaiting cardiac transplantation, and in the setting of refractory cardiac arrest. The present review aims to provide an update on the recent literature evaluating the evolving role of temporary MCS devices, and to provide insights into the current challenges and future directions of MCS research. Recent findings Recent observational data have demonstrated potential roles for intra-aortic balloon pump preoperatively in high-risk patients awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting, and advanced heart failure patients awaiting transplantation. Impella continues to demonstrate promising results as part of an early MCS strategy in CS, as a temporary bridge to transplantation, and as a mechanism for left ventricular unloading in patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Finally, the first randomized trial of ECMO facilitated resuscitation in the United States demonstrated improved survival in patients with refractory out of hospital cardiac arrest. Though randomized data remains limited, observational data continue to support the role of temporary MCS devices in a variety of clinical settings.

TI  - Almanac 2013: cardiac arrhythmias and pacing
T2  - HEART
AB  - Important advances have been made in the past few years in the fields of clinical cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. Researchers and clinicians have a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF), which has transpired into improved methods of detection, risk stratification, and treatments. The introduction of novel oral anticoagulants has provided clinicians with alternative options in managing patients with AF at moderate to high thromboembolic risk and further data has been emerging on the use of catheter ablation for the treatment of symptomatic AF. Another area of intense research in the field of cardiac arrhythmias and pacing is in the use of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of patients with heart failure. Following the publication of major landmark randomised controlled trials reporting that CRT confers a survival advantage in patients with severe heart failure and improves symptoms, many subsequent studies have been performed to further refine the selection of patients for CRT and determine the clinical characteristics associated with a favourable response. The field of sudden cardiac death and implantable cardioverter defibrillators also continues to be actively researched, with important new epidemiological and clinical data emerging on improved methods for patient selection, risk stratification, and management. This review covers the major recent advances in these areas related to cardiac arrhythmias and pacing.

TI  - Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Outcomes and Complications at a Quaternary Referral Center
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
AB  - Objective: At a quaternary care center that regularly performs and cares for patients undergoing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR), a database of all adult patients who underwent eCPR with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) over a 10-year period was reviewed. Seventy-one eCPR patients were analyzed to compare outcomes and complication rates. The authors hypothesized that evidence of end-organ injury, such as the need for continuous renal replacement therapy, in their institution's eCPR population would be associated with increased in-hospital mortality.
   Design: Retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data at a quaternary care center.
   Setting: Single quaternary academic referral center for ECMO.
   Participants: The study comprised adult patients who underwent venoarterial ECMO for eCPR from 2009-2019 and for whom demographic data, survival data, and complication rates were available.
   Interventions: None-this was a retrospective chart review.
   Measurements and Main Results: eCPR survival was 53.5% (38 of 71), and hospital survival was 33.8% (24 of 71). The most common complications were hemorrhage (26 of 67), renal failure (19 of 67), and neurologic injury (14 of 67). Of 19 patients requiring renal replacement therapy, only 1 survived to hospital discharge (5.3%) versus 23 of 48 patients without renal failure (47.9%) surviving to discharge (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: In this cohort of 71 patients who underwent eCPR, outcomes were promising; however, complication rates were high, and renal failure in particular demonstrated an extremely high mortality. These are single-institution results that should be followed up with larger multicenter cohorts of eCPR patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Crowdsourcing in health and medical research: a systematic review
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - Background Crowdsourcing is used increasingly in health and medical research. Crowdsourcing is the process of aggregating crowd wisdom to solve a problem. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize quantitative evidence on crowdsourcing to improve health. Methods We followed Cochrane systematic review guidance and systematically searched seven databases up to September 4th 2019. Studies were included if they reported on crowdsourcing and related to health or medicine. Studies were excluded if recruitment was the only use of crowdsourcing. We determined the level of evidence associated with review findings using the GRADE approach. Results We screened 3508 citations, accessed 362 articles, and included 188 studies. Ninety-six studies examined effectiveness, 127 examined feasibility, and 37 examined cost. The most common purposes were to evaluate surgical skills (17 studies), to create sexual health messages (seven studies), and to provide layperson cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) out-of-hospital (six studies). Seventeen observational studies used crowdsourcing to evaluate surgical skills, finding that crowdsourcing evaluation was as effective as expert evaluation (low quality). Four studies used a challenge contest to solicit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing promotion materials and increase HIV testing rates (moderate quality), and two of the four studies found this approach saved money. Three studies suggested that an interactive technology system increased rates of layperson initiated CPR out-of-hospital (moderate quality). However, studies analyzing crowdsourcing to evaluate surgical skills and layperson-initiated CPR were only from high-income countries. Five studies examined crowdsourcing to inform artificial intelligence projects, most often related to annotation of medical data. Crowdsourcing was evaluated using different outcomes, limiting the extent to which studies could be pooled. Conclusions Crowdsourcing has been used to improve health in many settings. Although crowdsourcing is effective at improving behavioral outcomes, more research is needed to understand effects on clinical outcomes and costs. More research is needed on crowdsourcing as a tool to develop artificial intelligence systems in medicine.

TI  - A rare case of retroperitoneal extension in Fournier's gangrene: A case report and review of literature
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB  - Introduction and importance: Retroperitoneal extension is a rare and fatal complication of Fournier's gangrene (FG) which mandates immediate surgical intervention for better outcome.Case presentation: A 70-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a history of bilateral painful scrotal swelling for 7 days with fever and abdominal pain for 3 days. On his general examination, he was septic with necrotic patches in the perineum and bilateral scrotum. Imaging revealed soft tissue gas and collections in scrotum extending to the right retroperitoneum with massive collection suggestive of retroperitoneal abscess. Following resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics, immediate exploratory laparotomy was done to drain the retroperitoneal abscess followed by debridement of Fournier's gangrene. The patient remained well on follow up.Clinical discussion: Fournier gangrene is a fulminant polymicrobial infection of the perineum, scrotum and penis which when complicated by retroperitoneal extension, has a very high mortality. Majority of patients have an immunocompromised condition. Early diagnosis with prompt surgical drainage and debridement (within 6 hours) significantly reduces the mortality.Conclusion: High index of suspicion, careful clinical examination and timely use of imaging is crucial for early diagnosis of this rare but fatal complication of FG. Furthermore, adequate resuscitation with prompt surgical intervention is the key for a favorable outcome.

TI  - Sudden cardiac death
T2  - SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias is a leading cause of death in the United States. Various etiologies, including ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular or congenital heart diseases and other less common disorders, may result in SCD. Beta blockers are the only class of medications that have been shown to be beneficial in the primary prevention of SCD. However, recently, aldosterone antagonism early after myocardial infarction has also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of SCD. Multiple trials have elaborated on the potential benefits of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) in appropriately selected patients. However, there is still some controversy regarding the optimum period for ICD implantation, and its cost-effectiveness. An evidence-based approach to primary and secondary prevention of SCD is presented. Management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is briefly discussed.

TI  - Ambulatory electrocardiogram-based tracking of T wave alternans in postmyocardial infarction patients to assess risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmic death
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - TWA and Post-MI Arrhythmia. Introduction: This is the first study to assess T wave alternans (TWA) analyzed from routine ambulatory electrocardiograms (AECGs) to identify postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) patients at increased risk for arrhythmic events.
   Methods and Results: The new method of modified moving average (MMA) analysis was used to measure TWA magnitude in 24-hour AECGs from ATRAMI, a prospective study of 1,284 post-MI patients. Using a nested case-control approach, we defined cases as patients who experienced cardiac arrest due to documented ventricular fibrillation or arrhythmic death during the follow-up period of 21 8 months. We analyzed 15 cases and 29 controls matched for sex, age, site of MI, left ventricular ejection fraction, thrombolysis, and beta-blockade therapy. TWA was reported as the maximum 15-second value at three predetermined times associated with cardiovascular stress: maximum heart rate, 8:00 A.M., and maximum ST segment deviation. TWA increased significantly from baseline in both leads at each time point (P << 0.01) in cases and controls. TWA in V-5 increased more in cases than controls during peak heart rate (P = 0.005) and at 8:00 A.M. (P = 0.02). A 4- to 7-fold higher odds of life-threatening arrhythmias was predicted by TWA level above the 75th percentile during maximum heart rate in leads V-1 (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-16.3, P = 0.04) and V-5 (OR 7.9, 95 % CI: 1.9-33.1, P = 0.005). TWA at 8:00 A.M. also predicted risk in leads V-1 (OR = 5.0, 95 % CI: 1.2-20.5, P = 0.02) and V-5 (OR = 4.2, 95 % Cl: 1.1-16.3, P = 0.04).
   Conclusion: TWA measurement from routine 24-hour AECGs is a promising approach for risk stratification for cardiac arrest and arrhythmic death in relatively low-risk post-MI patients.

TI  - Brugada Syndrome: An Electrical Storm without Warning
T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
AB  - Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is an inherited channelopathy causing sodium channel dysfunction in cardiac myocyte. These patients are prone to develop Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). Next to coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathies, BrS is an important cause of sudden cardiac death. We report here a case of 22year unmarried female with "unexplained" cardiac arrest without prior history of syncope and family history of sudden cardiac death. She was resuscitated out of hospital in some local dispensary in rural settings and after prolonged hypoxia with its neurological sequelae, she eventually died. BrS should be considered in differentials of unexplained cardiac arrest even in patients without family history of sudden cardiac death. First episode of VT/VF in BrS patients can be life threatening. Only prompt cardioversion / defibrillation can save life. We have suggested some measures to identify patients of BrS.

TI  - Huge Left Atrium Thrombus Presenting with Syncope and Sudden Death, Diagnosed by Point-of-care Ultrasound
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ULTRASOUND
AB  - The left atrium (LA) thrombus is a life-threatening disease that can result in systemic embolization and sudden death if misdiagnosed. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an efficient tool able to assist emergency physicians in accurately and promptly identifying patients with LA thrombus. We present a 72-year-old man who presented at the emergency department with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and achieved spontaneous circulation upon arrival. The patient had a past history of mitral valve regurgitation and valve replacement, followed by warfarin treatment for 5 years. Clinical examination, including POCUS, resulted in a diagnosis of LA thrombus with systemic thromboembolism events affecting the brain, kidney, and lower limbs. Although an emergency thrombectomy was performed immediately, the patient eventually died. POCUS should be performed in patients with any prior history of structural heart disease, especially those who received valve replacement surgery, to identify life-threatening thromboembolism events and facilitate prompt treatment.

TI  - Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Campylobacter fetus: a case report and literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Campylobacter fetus is a Gram-negative bacillus typically associated with bacteremia in immunocompromised patients. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a serious complication of prosthetic valve surgery, with a high mortality rate if not treated promptly. We present a rare case of PVE caused by C. fetus. A man in his mid-60s presented to the Emergency Department with a fever and showed elevated C-reactive protein concentrations. He had prosthetic mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery 15 years previously. Gram-negative rods were detected in a blood culture. These rods were identified as C. fetus using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The patient was treated with gentamicin and imipenem, and underwent valve replacement surgery. C. fetus was isolated in a left atrial appendage swab obtained during the surgery. Follow-up blood cultures were negative after treatment. However, after a cardiac arrest event, the patient's general condition deteriorated, and he died. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of PVE caused by C. fetus in Korea and the second fatality to date. This case highlights the importance of considering C. fetus as a potential cause of PVE, even in patients without known risk factors.

TI  - PREHOSPITAL THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY IN MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION
T2  - HERZ
AB  - The extent of myocardial damage occurring during acute myocardial infarction is time dependent, and there is abundant evidence from most clinical trials that mortality reduction is greatest in patients treated early with thrombolytic agents, although beneficial effects have been shown with treatment initiated up to 12 hours after onset of symptoms. This temporal dependence of benefit was most clearly seen with the 47% mortality reduction obtained with streptokinase given within the first hour in the GSSI-1 trial (Table 1). The process of infarction may be completely aborted if reperfusion is initiated within 30 minutes after symptom onset. Current approaches designed to reduce the time delay between onset of symptoms and the inhibition of thrombolytic treatment include increasing public awareness of the need to seek prompt medical attention in the event of chest pain, reducing in-hospital delays in initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and administration of thrombolytic agents in the prehospital setting. Since the first paper on prehospital thrombolysis by Koren et al. in 1985 there have been numerous studies published, including several randomized trials comparing prehospital and in-hospital initiation of thrombolytic therapy (Table 2). In randomized studies patients received in the prehospital phase either a bolus or infusion with the thrombolytic agent followed by placebo after hospital admission, or placebo when first seen outside the hospital, followed by the thrombolytic agent after arrival at the hospital. This was performed in a double-blind fashion in some of the trials. Some of the feasibility and safety, others on time again, differences in ejection fraction and mortality benefit. Almost all have conclusively shown the practicability and safety of patient selection and administration of the thrombolytic agent. This positive result was observed in different organizational types of the emergency system: In the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention trial (MITI) patients with chest pain were screened by paramedics using a checklist of clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria. The paramedics then obtained a computer-interpreted ECG which was transmitted to the emergency department in the hospital where a physician made the decision on the form of treatment. The thrombolytic agent was then administered by the paramedic. In the European Myocardial Infarction Project (EMIP) an emergency physician was personally present and responsible in the prehospital setting, whereas in the Grampian Region Early Anistreplase Trial (GREAT) general practitioners made the decision for enrolling the patient.
   The accuracy of diagnosis in the prehospital setting was comparable to trials of in-hospital thrombolysis. E.g. in MITI 98% of the patients enrolled had subsequent evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Table 3 shows the final diagnosis in EMIP, the largest trial of prehospital thrombolysis up to date, with about 90% correct diagnoses. In the swedish Thrombolysis Early in Acute Heart Attack Trial (TEAHAT) no ECG criteria were used and only 42% of prehospitally treated patients later developed definite signs of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore the use of ECG criteria for correct identification of patients suitable for prehospital thrombolysis seems to be warranted.
   Another question of trials of prehospital thrombolysis was whether the rate of complications would be comparable to in-hospital initiation of treatment. In the EMIP-study there was a significant excess of ventricular fibrillation in the prehospital group as compared with the hospital group during the period before admission which was offset by a higher incidence of this complication in the hospital group during the hospital period. The incidence of cardiac arrest and shock showed a similar trend. The incidence of bleeding complications and stroke were not statistically different between the two groups. With comparable results of other trials the prehospital initiation of thrombolytic therapy appears to be as safe as in-hospital treatment.
   With regard to time savings all randomized studies showed positive results (Table 4). The smallest time gain was observed in the MITI-trial: prehospitally treated patients received thrombolytic therapy a median of 33 minutes earlier than those treated in-hospital. In EMIP the difference in time between prehospital and hospital treatment was a median of 55 minutes. However, none of these trials were able to show a significant short-term mortality difference between the two groups (Table 4). The ability e.g. of the MITI-study to detect a significant difference in mortality was considerably reduced by the astonishing fact that the time gain of prehospital thrombolysis was with 33 minutes less than to be expected in real life. This was in part due to the fact that hospital treatment was accelerated by ECG transmission to the receiving hospital by the paramedics.
   A meta-analysis of five randomized studies with a combined median time gain of about 60 minutes showed a significant 17% reduction in short-term mortality for patients who received thrombolytic therapy in the prehospital. phase (Table 4). In GREAT, a study performed in a more rural area than other studies, the time gain by prehospital initiation of thrombolysis was a median of 130 minutes. GREAT was the only study up to date publishing long-term mortality results: There was a significant mortality benefit for prehospitally treated patients after 3 months and 1 year (Table 5).
   In conclusion, prehospital thrombolysis is feasible and safe. Patients with acute myocardial infarction can be correctly identified and treated with thrombolytic agents in the prehospital setting with the same rate of complications as expected for in-hospital thrombolysis provided basic resuscitation equipment including a defibrillator is available. The results of randomized studies comparing the results of prehospital and in-hospital thrombolysis seem to justify the prehospital institution of thrombolytic therapy especially in rural areas where transport times to the hospital are long and the expected time gain is largest.

TI  - Management of a recurrent suicide attempt with needle insertion into the heart; a case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction: Penetrating cardiac injury (PCI) is rare and life-threatening, with complications that include hemorrhage, tamponade, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest. Needle insertion into the heart is infrequently reported; to our knowledge, only one case of recurrent self-insertion has been described. Case presentation: A 29-year-old man with bipolar I disorder and a prior sternotomy for foreign-body removal presented after a second suicide attempt within two years, having self-inserted multiple needles through the chest and abdomen. Chest radiography showed three metallic densities in the left hemithorax and one in the abdominal wall. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a linear metallic echo within the left ventricle (LV) near the apex. Computed tomography confirmed three metallic densities in the left thorax, one penetrating the LV to a depth of 30 mm. Median sternotomy was performed, and one needle was removed from the LV. After recovery, the patient was transferred to a psychiatric hospital for further inpatient treatment. Discussion: Intentional cardiac injury by needle insertion is extremely rare and poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early imaging and prompt surgery are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary plan, including psychiatric evaluation and follow-up, is required to prevent fatal outcomes and recurrence. Conclusion: This study describes the successful management of a penetrating cardiac injury in a patient with a prior sternotomy.

TI  - A patient with acute pulmonary embolism caused by hyaluronic acid injection underwent nursing care of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support therapy: a case report
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - This article summarizes the nursing management of a patient who developed acute pulmonary embolism with concomitant cardiopulmonary arrest following intravaginal hyaluronic acid injection, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. The main measures are rapid activation of the treatment plan to improve the efficiency of treatment; teamwork and safe transfer; early implementation of target temperature management to promote neurological prognosis; implementation of individualized anticoagulation strategies and infection control strategies; and autologous blood transfusion techniques to reduce blood loss during ECMO withdrawal. After 9 days of active treatment and refined care, the patient's condition was stable, and she was transferred to the general ward to continue treatment for 2 days and was discharged after recovery. At 1-month follow-up after discharge, the patient's consciousness was clear, her speech was clear, and the muscle strength of the limbs was back to normal. The cooperation of a mature ECMO team was important in the rescue and treatment of this patient, which could shorten the response time in all aspects of the rescue and improve the success rate of rescue and treatment. The application of individualized therapeutic measures and high-quality nursing care is the key to promote the recovery of this patient.

TI  - A Case of Anomalous Right Coronary Artery With Catastrophic Presentation
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Anomalous coronary artery is a rare but potentially life-threatening alteration in the coronary vascular system that is related to an increased risk of myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Here, we present the case of a young male who presented to the hospital after a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started immediately, and normal sinus rhythm was achieved after electrical cardioversion three times. He was admitted to the ICU for further care upon admission. A CT of the chest showed a potential vascular structure in between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which identified minimal coronary artery disease with the anomalous takeoff of the right coronary artery from the left coronary cusp. A cardiac CT scan obtained also showed an anomalous right coronary artery (ARCA) with an inter-arterial course. After explaining available treatment options and obtaining informed consent, a surgical correction by cardiothoracic surgery was performed using the coronary artery bypass graft technique. The patient recovered well after the surgery and was discharged home. After two years of follow-up, he continued to live life normally without any symptoms. Early and accurate diagnosis of an anomalous coronary artery is imperative for timely intervention, as malignant coronary artery diseases can often have a catastrophic presentation with acute coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, or SCD. We present here a case of successful diagnosis of ARCA and its prompt surgical correction using coronary artery bypass grafting technique in a young adult. Despite the availability of various other treatment options, our case underscores coronary artery bypass grafting as a viable choice for individuals with anomalous coronary arteries, particularly in urgent situations.

TI  - Fundamentals in the clinical management of intoxication due to smoke inhalation
T2  - EMERGENCIAS
AB  - Intoxication due to smoke inhalation is the main cause of morbidity and mortality from fires. Smoke is a mixture of carbon particles suspended in hot air containing toxic gases. Carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanuric acid are the gases that are mainly responsible for tissue anoxia. The clinical signs of intoxication due to smoke inhalation vary. They may include eye irritation, sore throat, laryngeal stridor, dysphagia, soot in sputum, cough, breathlessness, laryngeal spasm, bronchospasm, coronary syndrome, coma, hypoxemia, lactic acidosis, cyanosis, and death. A finding of soot in the nostrils, mouth or sputum suggests severe intoxication. Lactate dehydrogenase levels over 10 mmol/L are indicative of cyanuric acid levels over 40 mmol/L. Pulse oximetry has represented an important advance for diagnosis, examination, and follow-up in this setting. The possible need for early intubation must be assessed and oxygen administration (at 100%) is essential. The treatment of choice for cyanuric acid poisoning is hydroxocobalamin. This antidote must be administered promptly whenever a patient has inhaled smoke (soot in mouth, throat or sputum), shows neurologic signs (confusion, coma, agitation, convulsions), or has any of the following signs: bradypnea, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, shock, hypotension, lactate dehydrogenase over 8 mmol/L, or lactic acidosis. Thereafter, management will be dictated by symptoms or complications. [Emergencias 2010;22:384-394]

TI  - Electronic Prompt to Improve Outpatient Code Status Documentation for Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - Purpose
   Rates of documentation of end-of-life care preferences in the medical record remain low, even among patients with incurable malignancies. We therefore conducted a two-phase study to develop and assess the effect of electronic prompts to encourage oncology clinicians to document code status in the outpatient electronic health record (EHR) of patients with advanced lung cancers.
   Patients and Methods
   To determine the optimal delivery, content, and timing of the electronic prompt, we first facilitated focus groups with oncology clinicians at an affiliated medical center. Given this feedback, we developed e-mail reminders timed to the start of each new chemotherapy regimen. Between July 2009 and January 2011, 102 eligible patients with incurable lung cancer were approached, and 100 agreed to participate. We compared e-mail prompt participants (EPPs) with a cohort of 100 consecutive historical controls who began therapy for incurable lung cancer at least 1 year before the start of this study. The primary outcome measure was clinician documentation of code status in the EHR.
   Results
   EPPs were similar to historical controls, with no significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics. At 1-year follow-up, 33.7% (n = 33/98) of EPPs had a code status documented in the outpatient EHR compared with 14.5% (n = 12/83) of historical controls (P = .003). Mean time to code status documentation was significantly shorter in EPPs (8.6 months [95% CI, 7.6 to 9.5]) compared with controls (10.5 months [95% CI, 9.8 to 11.3]; P = .004).
   Conclusion
   e-mail prompts may improve the rate and timing of code status documentation in the EHR and warrant further investigation. J Clin Oncol 31:710-715. (c) 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Superficial femoral vein in aorto-iliac position a suitable autogenous vascular substitute in the treatment of aortic graft infection?
T2  - CHIRURG
AB  - The current standard therapy of aortic graft infection is connected with a high incidence of operative and late complications. The usefulness of autogenous tissue revascularization techniques as promising therapeutic alternatives is limited by the complexity of these procedures and by the lack of suitable donor vessels. Since several authors have shown that serious venous stasis of the donor leg does not occur after superficial femoral vein (SFV) resection, we have started to use this deep leg vein for arterial in situ reconstructions in the treatment of aortic graft infection. During the past 3 years seven patients have received autogenous SFV grafts in this way. There were no intraoperative deaths. Two critically ill patients with severe Pseudomonas sepsis and extensive retroperitoneal abscess each died on the 4th postoperative day, due to acute massive bleeding in the operating area. In all of the five survivors infection could be eradicated; only one limb had to be amputated. Mild to moderate transient swelling of the lower extremity without stasis was regularly seen after SFV resection. During follow-up one patient died of cardiac arrest 5 months postoperatively. The remaining four patients are still alive with patent SFV grafts at 6, 22, 30 and 36 months after the operation.

TI  - Epinephrine-induced Effects on Cerebral Microcirculation and Oxygenation Dynamics Using Multimodal Monitoring and Functional Photoacoustic Microscopy
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background:The administration of epinephrine after severe refractory hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest restores systemic blood flow and major vessel perfusion but may worsen cerebral microvascular perfusion and oxygen delivery through vasoconstriction. The authors hypothesized that epinephrine induces significant microvascular constriction in the brain, with increased severity after repetitive dosing and in the aged brain, eventually leading to tissue hypoxia. Methods:The authors investigated the effects of intravenous epinephrine administration in healthy young and aged C57Bl/6 mice on cerebral microvascular blood flow and oxygen delivery using multimodal in vivo imaging, including functional photoacoustic microscopy, brain tissue oxygen sensing, and follow-up histologic assessment. Results:The authors report three main findings. First, after epinephrine administration, microvessels exhibited severe immediate vasoconstriction (57 & PLUSMN; 6% of baseline at 6 min, P < 0.0001, n = 6) that outlasted the concurrent increase in arterial blood pressure, while larger vessels demonstrated an initial increase in flow (108 & PLUSMN; 6% of baseline at 6 min, P = 0.02, n = 6). Second, oxyhemoglobin decreased significantly within cerebral vessels with a more pronounced effect in smaller vessels (microvessels to 69 & PLUSMN; 8% of baseline at 6 min, P < 0.0001, n = 6). Third, oxyhemoglobin desaturation did not indicate brain hypoxia; on the contrary, brain tissue oxygen increased after epinephrine application (from 31 & PLUSMN; 11 mmHg at baseline to 56 & PLUSMN; 12 mmHg, 80% increase, P = 0.01, n = 12). In the aged brains, microvascular constriction was less prominent yet slower to recover compared to young brains, but tissue oxygenation was increased, confirming relative hyperoxia. Conclusions:Intravenous application of epinephrine induced marked cerebral microvascular constriction, intravascular hemoglobin desaturation, and paradoxically, an increase in brain tissue oxygen levels, likely due to reduced transit time heterogeneity.

TI  - Effect of Baduanjin exercise on health and functional status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a community-based, cluster-randomized controlled trial
T2  - NPJ PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
AB  - Baduanjin has been shown to be an effective method of exercise for promoting body function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, this method is rarely used by rural doctors in rural communities. The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of Baduanjin exercise with those of conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) implemented by rural doctors in patients with COPD. A total of 472 COPD patients from 18 village clinics were randomly allocated to the Baduanjin group (n = 158), CPR group (n = 154), or control group (n = 160). The Baduanjin group received six months of Baduanjin training, the CPR group received six months of rehabilitation training, and the control group received usual care. The primary outcomes were changes in health status, as measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and dyspnoea, as assessed via the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale. The secondary outcomes included six-minute walking distance (6MWD) performance and anxiety and depression scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D, respectively). Baseline data were collected before randomization, and outcomes were ascertained at the six-month follow-up by blinded assessors. After six months of training, compared with the control group, the Baduanjin group presented significant improvements in CAT scores (t = 5.121, P < 0.001), mMRC scale scores (t = 5.719, P < 0.001), 6MWD performance (t = 12.608, P < 0.001), HADS-A scores (t = 6.210, P < 0.001), and HADS-D scores (t = 2.945, P = 0.010). The CPR group also presented significant improvements in CAT scores (t = 4.725, P < 0.001), mMRC scale scores (t = 5.499, P < 0.001), 6MWD performance (t = 11.662, P < 0.001), HADS-A scores (t = 5.697, P < 0.001), and HADS-D scores (t = 2.671, P = 0.023). In contrast, the control group participants showed no significant changes in CAT scores (t = -0.252, P = 0.801), mMRC scale scores (t = -0.085, P = 0.932), 6MWD performance (t = -0.463, P = 0.644), HADS-A scores (t = -2.75, P = 0.783), or HADS-D scores (t = -0.281, P = 0.779). No adverse events were reported during the study. The positive effects of Baduanjin exercise on the subjective symptoms of COPD patients are similar to those of CPR. The trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (reference: ChiCTR-TRC-12001958) (22/02/2012).

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Natural Compounds for Brain Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Brain ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, commonly occurring in ischemic stroke and post-cardiac arrest scenarios, results in complex secondary damage involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Despite decades of research, no pharmacological agent has yet been clinically approved for post-I/R neuroprotection. Natural compounds have recently gained attention for their multimodal therapeutic potential, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroregenerative effects. This review highlights nine promising candidates-resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, berberine, ginkgolide B, baicalin, naringin, fucoidan, and astaxanthin-that exhibit efficacy in experimental models of I/R injury when administered after the insult. Their chemical structures, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action are described in detail, focusing on key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Importantly, we outline the selection criteria for these compounds, including demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy, mechanistic clarity, and translational feasibility. While several challenges remain-such as limited bioavailability, BBB penetration, and species-specific metabolism-emerging strategies like nanoparticle delivery, synthetic analogs, and drug combinations offer potential solutions. By emphasizing the therapeutic versatility and mechanistic diversity of these natural agents, this review supports their clinical potential and encourages further preclinical optimization and biomarker-guided human trials.

TI  - Outcomes of electrical injuries in the emergency department: epidemiology, severity predictors, and chronic sequelae
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - IntroductionElectrical injuries (EIs) represent a significant clinical challenge due to their complex pathophysiology and variable presentation, ranging from minor burns to severe internal organ damage. Despite their prevalence in both; domestic and occupational settings, there remains a rareness of systematic guidelines and comprehensive literature to aid clinicians in effectively managing these injuries. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing protocols that can mitigate the risk of delayed complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, in patients who initially appear stable.ObjectivesThis study aims to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical outcomes, and predictors of severe presentation in EIs, providing insights to improve patient assessment and management strategies.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted over 4 years. Data were collected from standardized medical records. The group of patients with severe complications included those who presented a life-threatening cardiac, respiratory, neurological, or biological impairment or died within the first 48 h of the EI.ResultsWe enrolled 118 cases of electrical injury (EI). Ages ranged from 4 to 82 years, with 31.3% under 15. EI incidence peaked in summer, with 63.5% being home accidents. High-voltage injuries occurred in 13.6%. The most common ED complaints were burns in children (59.5%) and trauma in adults (48.1%). ECG abnormalities correlated with tetany (p = 0.016), and palpitations (p = 0.014). Complications included cardiac arrest (n = 8), rhabdomyolysis (n = 23), and acute renal injury (n = 9). Severe EI was linked to respiratory distress and creatine kinase levels higher than >= 253 UI/l. A normal ECG within 1 h post-injury was correlated to a low risk of severe EI. At 2-year follow-up, 43.9% of survivors reported aesthetic sequelae, 25.3% had psychological disorders, and 7% of adults could not return to their previous occupations.ConclusionEIs are frequent, with diverse clinical presentations requiring multidisciplinary care. Awareness of potential delayed complications is essential, and prevention is crucial.

TI  - The New South Wales Sudden Cardiac Arrest Registry: A Data Linkage Cohort Study
T2  - HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION
AB  - Background Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in young people aged 1 to 50 years often occurs with no presenting symptoms or risk factors prompting screening for cardiovascular disease prior to their cardiac arrest. Approximately 3,000 young Australians suffer from sudden cardiac death (SCD) each year, making this a major public health issue. However, there is significant variation in the way incidence is estimated resulting in discrepancy across reporting which impacts our ability to understand and prevent these devastating events. We describe the New South Wales (NSW) Sudden Cardiac Arrest Registry: a retrospective, data linkage study which will identify all SCAs in the young in NSW from 2009 through to June 2022. Objective To determine the incidence, demographic characteristics and causes of SCA in young people. We will develop an NSW-based registry that will contribute to a greater understanding of SCA including risk factors and outcomes.Methods The cohort will include all people who experience a SCA in the NSW community aged between 1 to 50 years. Cases will be identified using the following three datasets: the Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Register housed at NSW Ambulance, the NSW Emergency Department Data Collection, and the National Coronial Information System. Data from eight datasets will be collected, anonymised and linked for the entire cohort. Analysis will be undertaken and reported using descriptive statistics. Conclusions The NSW SCA registry will be an important resource for the improved understanding of SCA and inform the widespread impacts it has on individuals, their families and society.

TI  - CURRENT RESULTS OF CORONARY-BYPASS SURGERY AFTER FAILED ANGIOPLASTY
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) is a technique in continuous development. Since its introduction indications, number, quality of stenosis amenable to treatment and device employed have evolved leading to a change in the population undergoing treatment. Therefore surgical results obtained in the early 80's may not apply to the beginning of the 90's. This reason prompted us to review our recent experience. In the last 4 years (1989-1992) among 2563 PTCA procedures performed in our Institution, 114 patients (4.3%, CL 3.5%-5%) underwent urgent surgical revascularization because of failed angioplasty. Thirty-four patients (30%, CL 21%-38%) were older than 65 years; 68 patients (60%, CL 50%-68%) had multiple vessel disease; 63 patients (55%, CL 46%-64%) had previous Myocardial Infarction (M.I.); 20 patients (17%, CL 10%-24%)had already undergone a PTCA and 3 patients (2%, CL 0%-6%) had had coronary surgery. In 21 patients (18%, CL 11%-25%) the left ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF%) was below <50%, Complete revascularization was always performed with an average of 2.2 +/- 1 graft/patient. A Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) was implanted in 20 patients (17%, CL 10%-25%) of the patients and in 52% of cases requiring LAD grafts in the last two years. There were 2 deaths (1.7%, CL 0%-4%), both patients were in cardiac arrest before surgery (p < 0.001), 2 patients required a LVAD to be weaned from ECC and 7 patients (6%, CL 1%-10%)had an IABP inserted at the moment of surgery. Twenty-five patients (21%, CL 14%-29%) showed evidence of a new myocardial infarction. Only ongoing ischemia (51 patients: 27%, CL 19%-35%) at the moment of surgery was predictive of postoperative MI (48%, CL 30%-65%; p < 0.001). A perfusion catheter was inserted before surgery in 23 patients. In this group of patients the incidence of postoperative MI (17%, CL 2%-32 %) was lower than the group with ongoing ischemia (p = 0.01). We conclude that the current population undergoing surgery for failed PTCA has a high incidence of previous major cardiac events and multiple vessel disease. The incidence of postoperative MI remains higher than elective surgical cases and is one of the major pitfalls of the PTCA procedures, although the use of perfusion catheters contributes to reduce this complication. The inhospital mortality is low, while the increasing use of LIMA. may improve long term results.

TI  - The differentiation of the competitive athlete with physiologic cardiac remodeling from the athlete with cardiomyopathy
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - There are currently 5 million active high school, collegiate, professional, and master athletes in the United States. Regular intense exercise by these athletes can promote structural, electrical and functional remodeling of the heart, which is termed the "athlete's heart." In addition, regular intense exercise can lead to pathological adaptions that promote or worsen cardiac disease. Many of the athletes in the United States seek medical care. Consequently, physicians must be aware of the normal cardiac anatomy and physiology of the athlete, the differentiation of the normal athlete heart from the athlete with cardiomyopathy, and the contemporary care of the athlete with a cardiomyopathy. In athletes with persistent cardiovascular symptoms, investigations should include a detailed history and physical examination, an ECG, a transthoracic echocardiogram, and in athletes in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, a maximal exercise stress test or a continuous ECG recording, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac computed tomography angiography when definition of the coronary anatomy or characterization of the aorta and the aortic great vessels is indicated. This article discusses the differentiation of the normal athlete with physiologic cardiac remodeling from the athlete with hypertrophic, dilated or arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy (ACM). The ECG changes in trained athletes that are considered normal, borderline, or abnormal are listed. In addition, the normal echocardiographic measurements for athletes who consistently participate in endurance, power, combined or heterogeneous sports are enumerated and discussed. Algorithms are listed that are useful in the diagnosis of trained athletes with borderline or abnormal echocardiographic measurements suggestive of cardiomyopathies along with the major and minor criteria for the diagnosis of ACM in athletes. Thereafter, the treatment of athletes with hypertrophic, dilated, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathies are reviewed. The distinction between physiologic changes and pathologic changes in the hearts of athletes has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Failure by the physician to correctly diagnose an athlete with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, or ACM, can lead to the sudden cardiac arrest and death of the athlete during training or sports competition. Conversely, an incorrect diagnosis by a physician of cardiac pathology in a normal athlete can lead to an unnecessary restriction of athlete training and competition with resultant significant emotional, psychological, financial, and long-term health consequences in the athlete.

TI  - Distinctive aspects of peptic ulcer disease, Dieulafoy's lesion, and Mallory-Weiss syndrome in patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - AIM: To systematically review the data on distinctive aspects of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Dieulafoy's lesion (DL), and Mallory-Weiss syndrome (MWS) in patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease (aALD), including alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis.
   METHODS: Computerized literature search performed via PubMed using the following medical subject heading terms and keywords: "alcoholic liver disease", "alcoholic hepatitis"," alcoholic cirrhosis", "cirrhosis", " liver disease", "upper gastrointestinal bleeding", "nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding", "PUD", "DL'', "Mallory-Weiss tear", and "MWS''.
   RESULTS: While the majority of acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with aALD is related to portal hypertension, about 30%-40% of acute GI bleeding in patients with aALD is unrelated to portal hypertension. Such bleeding constitutes an important complication of aALD because of its frequency, severity, and associated mortality. Patients with cirrhosis have a markedly increased risk of PUD, which further increases with the progression of cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis or aALD and peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) have worse clinical outcomes than other patients with PUB, including uncontrolled bleeding, rebleeding, and mortality. Alcohol consumption, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and portal hypertension may have a pathogenic role in the development of PUD in patients with aALD. Limited data suggest that Helicobacter pylori does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of PUD in most cirrhotic patients. The frequency of bleeding from DL appears to be increased in patients with aALD. DL may be associated with an especially high mortality in these patients. MWS is strongly associated with heavy alcohol consumption from binge drinking or chronic alcoholism, and is associated with aALD. Patients with aALD have more severe MWS bleeding and are more likely to rebleed when compared to non-cirrhotics. Preendoscopic management of acute GI bleeding in patients with aALD unrelated to portal hypertension is similar to the management of aALD patients with GI bleeding from portal hypertension, because clinical distinction before endoscopy is difficult. Most patients require intensive care unit admission and attention to avoid over-transfusion, to correct electrolyte abnormalities and coagulopathies, and to administer antibiotic prophylaxis. Alcoholics should receive thiamine and be closely monitored for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Prompt endoscopy, after initial resuscitation, is essential to diagnose and appropriately treat these patients. Generally, the same endoscopic hemostatic techniques are used in patients bleeding from PUD, DL, or MWS in patients with aALD as in the general population.
   CONCLUSION: Nonvariceal upper GI bleeding in patients with aALD has clinically important differences from that in the general population without aALD, including: more frequent and more severe bleeding from PUD, DL, or MWS.

TI  - Spironolactone for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundMineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
   MethodsIn this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more to receive either spironolactone (15 to 45 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.
   ResultsWith a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 320 of 1722 patients in the spironolactone group (18.6%) and 351 of 1723 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.04; P=0.14). Of the components of the primary outcome, only hospitalization for heart failure had a significantly lower incidence in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (206 patients [12.0%] vs. 245 patients [14.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99, P=0.04). Neither total deaths nor hospitalizations for any reason were significantly reduced by spironolactone. Treatment with spironolactone was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and a doubling of the rate of hyperkalemia (18.7%, vs. 9.1% in the placebo group) but reduced hypokalemia. With frequent monitoring, there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events, a serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 mol per liter) or higher, or dialysis.
   ConclusionsIn patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; TOPCAT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094302.)
   In this trial, 3445 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were assigned to spironolactone or placebo. At a mean of 3.3 years, there was no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for heart failure. Many patients with heart failure have a normal or near-normal left ventricular ejection fraction.(1)-(4) Such patients share common signs and symptoms, as well as an impaired quality of life and a poor prognosis, with patients who have heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction.(5)-(8) However, the benefit of most medical therapies for heart failure is limited to those with a reduced ejection fraction, generally 40% or less.(1),(2),(9) The lack of favorable evidence from clinical-outcome trials involving patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction is reflected in current guidelines, which offer no specific ...

TI  - Cardiac Arrest and Neurologic Recovery: Insights from the Case of Mr. Damar Hamlin
T2  - ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - The association between brain injury after cardiac arrest and poor survival outcomes has led to longstanding pessimism. However, the publicly witnessed cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and acute management of Mr. Damar Hamlin and his favorable neurologic recovery provides some optimism. Mr. Hamlin's case highlights the neurologic advances of the last 2 decades and presents the opportunity to improve outcomes for all cardiac arrest patients in key areas: (1) effectively implementing the American Heart Association "Chain of Survival" to prevent initial brain injury and promote neuroprotection; (2) revisiting the process of neurologic prognostication and re-defining the brain recovery during the early periods, and (3) incorporating neurorehabilitation into existing cardiac rehabilitation models to support holistic recovery.

TI  - Functional Status Versus Quality of Life Where Does the Evidence Lead Us?
T2  - ADVANCES IN NURSING SCIENCE
AB  - The interchangeable use of functional status with quality of life has lead to various interpretations when discussing outcomes related to functional status. The literature revealed gaps in the measurement and blurred conceptualization of functional status. Given the prognostic importance of functional status measures, the results highlight the importance of developing a reliable and efficient means of obtaining a measure of functional status resulting in the advancement of nursing science. Having a clear and concise measure of functional status will enable clinicians to implement effect treatment plans that would lead to a faster recovery, higher level of functional status, and a greater well-being.

TI  - Outcome of Patients With Profound Cardiogenic Shock After Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Prompt Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support - A Single-Center Observational Study
T2  - CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: The in-hospital outcome of patients with profound cardiogenic shock (CS) undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and prognostic predictors were analyzed.
   Methods and Results: Between 2003 and 2010, 134 patients with profound CS undergoing 10-15 min of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) and ECM were prospectively recruited, including 27.6% (37) with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 11.9% (16) with non-STEMI, 22.4% (30) with post-surgery pump failure, 10.5% (14) with refractory congestive heart failure, 19.4% (26) with fulminant acute myocarditis, 2.2% (3) with pediatric congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and 6.0% (8) with percutaneous coronary intervention-related complications. The mean systolic pressure was 49.8 mmHg and 91.8% of patients required ventilatory support prior to ECMO. The Post-ECMO Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation "(APACHE) II score and peak creatine kinase level were 26.2 and 5,311 IU/L, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 57.5%. Sixty-eight patients (50.7%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and 57 (42.5%) were discharged alive. Univariate analysis identified the APACHE II score as the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality (P<0.0001) with respiratory failure, smoking, and male gender also related (all P<0.03). Multivariate analysis identified an APACHE II score >= 22 and successful ECM weaning as the only independent predictor for in-hospital mortality and a determinant of survival, respectively (P=0.0003).
   Conclusions: Profound CS was associated with high mortality. Both successful weaning from ECM() and an APACHE II score might serve as outcome predictors for risk stratification. (Circ J 2012; 76: 1385-1392)

TI  - Gaps in the Provision of Cognitive and Psychological Resources in Cardiac Arrest Survivors with Good Neurologic Recovery
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - We aimed to elucidate gaps in the provision of cognitive and psychological resources in cardiac arrest survivors. We conducted an online survey study between October 29, 2019, and November 15, 2019 with cardiac arrest survivors and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. We queried survivors as to whether they experienced cognitive or psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. Next, we queried both survivors and caregivers on the provision of resources through three metrics: (1) discussions with providers about potential cognitive or psychological symptoms, (2) neurologist or psychologist appointments scheduled by providers, and (3) mental health referrals by providers. We then ran Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to compare the proportion of survivors and caregivers who reported resource provision (observed values) to the proportion of survivors who reported experiencing cognitive and psychological symptoms, respectively (expected values). We included responses from 167 survivors and 52 caregivers. A total of 73.1% (n = 122) survivors reported experiencing cognitive symptoms and 67.1% (n = 112) psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. When compared to these two proportions, provision of resources was significantly lower in all three metrics: (1) fewer discussions with providers about potential for developing cognitive symptoms (31%) and psychological symptoms (26.3%), (2) fewer neurologist appointments scheduled (8.4%) and psychologist appointments scheduled (4.8%), and (3) fewer referrals to mental health (6%). Informal caregivers also reported significantly lower provision of resources in all three metrics, with the exception of discussions about developing cognitive symptoms. Our results suggest that there are discrepancies in the provision of cognitive and psychological resources in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery. Systematic referral processes may be needed to standardize resource provision to consistently meet the pervasive cognitive and psychological needs of cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - The prognostic value of gray-white-matter ratio in cardiac arrest patients treated with hypothermia
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Mild therapeutic hypothermia alters the validity of a number of parameters currently used to predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Thus, additional parameters are needed to increase certainty of early prognosis in these patients. A promising new approach is the determination of the gray-white-matter ratio (GWR) in cranial computed tomography (CCT) obtained early after resuscitation. It is not known how GWR relates to established outcome parameters such as neuron specific enolase (NSE) or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP).
   Methods: Cardiac arrest patients (n = 98) treated with hypothermia were retrospectively analyzed with respect to the prognostic value of GWR, NSE and SSEP.
   Results: A GWR < 1.16 predicted poor outcome with 100% specificity and 38% sensitivity. In 62 patients NSE, SSEP and CCT were available. The sensitivity of poor outcome prediction by both NSE > 97 mu g/L and bilateral absent SSEP was 43%. The sensitivity increased to 53% in a multi-parameter approach predicting poor outcome using at least two of the three parameters (GWR, NSE and SSEP).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest a strong association of a low GWR with poor outcome following cardiac arrest. Determination of the GWR increases the sensitivity in a multi-parameter approach for prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Early Urinary Metabolomics in Patent Ductus Arteriosus Anticipates the Fate: Preliminary Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Introduction: In premature neonates, the persistence of hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) can be associated with short- and long-term consequences, impairing their outcome. The correct strategy of management for such condition is under debate, especially regarding contraindications and/or side effects. In recent years, metabolomics was applied to several perinatal, pediatric, and adult conditions to investigate potential biomarkers of disease, which have become useful for early diagnosis and/or therapeutic management.
   Aim of the Study: The main purpose of our exploratory study was to asses, through H-1-NMR metabolomics analysis of urinary samples at birth, possible metabolic pathways differentiating, with a significant predictive power, those preterm neonates who will subsequently develop hsPDA and neonates of comparable gestational age (GA) who will undergo spontaneous ductal closure or the persistence of an irrelevant PDA (no-hsPDA). Moreover, we investigated potential prenatal or perinatal clinical factors potentially influencing the development of hsPDA.
   Materials and Methods: We enrolled n = 35 preterm neonates with GA between 24 and 32 weeks; urinary samples were collected within the first 12 h of life. Patients were closely monitored regarding intensive care, respiratory support, fluid balance and administered drugs; an echocardiogram was performed at 48-72 h.
   Results: Our results reported a significant correlation between lower GA at birth and the development of hsPDA. Moreover, neonates with GA <= 30w developing hsPDA were characterized by lower Apgar scores at 1 ' and 5 ', higher rates of perinatal asphyxia, higher need of delivery room resuscitation and subsequent surfactant administration. Interestingly, metabolomics analysis at birth detected a clear separation between the H-1-NMR urinary spectra of subjects GA <= 30w not developing hsPDA (n = 19) and those of subjects born at GA <= 30w in which hsPDA was confirmed at 48-72 h of life (n = 5).
   Conclusions: This is the first study applying metabolomics to investigate the PDA condition. Although preliminary and conducted on a limited sample, our results reveal that metabolomics could be a promising tool in the early identification of hsPDA, potentially superior to the clinical or laboratory predictive tools explored to date and even to the clinical observations and correlations in our sample, through the detection of specific urinary metabolites.

TI  - Categorization of survival and death after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Most cardiac arrest (CA) patients remain comatose post-resuscitation, prompting goals-of care (GOC) conversations. The impact of these conversations on patient outcomes has not been well described.
   Methods: Patients (n = 385) treated for CA in Columbia University ICUs between 2008-2015 were retrospectively categorized into various modes of survival and death based on documented GOC discussions. Patients were deemed "medically unstable" if there was evidence of hemodynamic instability at the time of discussion. Cerebral performance category (CPC) greater than 2 was defined as poor outcome at discharge and one-year post-arrest.
   Results: The survival rate was 31% (n = 118); most commonly after early recovery without any discussions (57%, n = 67), followed by survival due to family wishes despite physicians predicting poor neurological prognosis (20%, n = 24), and then survival after physician/family agreement of favorable prognosis (17%, n = 20). The survivors due to family wishes had significantly worse outcomes compared to the early recovery group (discharge: p = 0.01; one-year: p = 0.06) and agreement group (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), though 2 patients did achieve favorable recovery. Among nonsurvivors (n = 267), withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) while medically unstable was most common (31%; n= 83), followed by death after care was capped (24%, n = 65), then WLST while medically stable (17%, n = 45). Death despite full support, brain death and WLST due to advanced directives were less common causes.
   Conclusions: Most survivors due to family wishes despite poor neurological prognosis die or have poor outcomes at one-year. However, a small number achieve favorable recovery, demonstrating limitations with current prognostication methods. Among nonsurvivors, most WLST occurs while medically unstable, suggesting an overestimation of WLST due to unfavorable neurological prognosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Near-Peer Emergency Medicine for Medical Students in Port-au-Prince, Haiti: An Example of Rethinking Global Health Interventions in Developing Countries
T2  - ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - BACKGROUND During a 3-year time frame, a partnership between medical trainees in Haiti and the United States was forged with the objective of implementing an emergency response skills curriculum at a medical school in Port-au-Prince. The effort sought to assess the validity of a near-peer, bidirectional, cross-cultural teaching format as both a global health experience for medical students and as an effective component of improving medical education and emergency response infrastructure in developing countries such as Haiti.
   METHOD Medical students and emergency medicine (EM) residents from a North American medical school designed and taught a module on emergency response skills in PAP and certified medical students in basic cardiac life support (BLS) over 2 consecutive years. Five-point Likert scale self-efficacy (SE) surveys and multiple-choice fund of knowledge (FOK) assessments were distributed pre- and post-module each year and analyzed with paired t tests and longitudinal follow-up of the first cohort. Narrative evaluations from participants were collected to gather feedback for improving the module.
   FINDINGS Challenges included bridging language barriers, maintaining continuity between cohorts, and adapting to unexpected schedule changes. Overall, 115 students were certified in BLS with significant postcurriculum improvements in SE scores (2.75 +/- 0.93 in 2013 and 2.82 +/- 1.06 in 2014; P < 0.001) and FOK scores (22% +/- 15% in 2013 and 41% +/- 16% in 2014; P < 0.001). Of 24 Haitian students surveyed at 1-year follow-up from the 2013 cohort, 7 (29.3%) reported using taught skills in real-life situations since completing the module. The US group was invited to repeat the project for a third year.
   CONCLUSIONS Near-peer, cross-cultural academic exchange is an effective method of medical studentecentered emergency training in Haiti. Limitations such as successfully implementing sustainability measures, addressing cultural differences, and coordinating between groups persist. This scalable, reproducible, and mutually beneficial collaboration between North American and Haitian medical trainees is a valid conduit for building Haiti's emergency response infrastructure and promoting global health.

TI  - Are survivors of cardiac arrest provided with standard cardiac rehabilitation? - Results from a national survey of hospitals and municipalities in Denmark
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Aim: To quantify the provision of standard cardiac rehabilitation to Danish survivors of cardiac arrest at a programme level, and to analyse whether organizational factors influenced the provision. Method: We mapped the provision of cardiac rehabilitation core components to survivors of cardiac arrest and compared this with a reference group of patients after acute myocardial infarction using data from a cross-sectional programme-level survey among all hospitals (n=34) and municipalities (n= 98) in Denmark. Organizational factors of potential importance to service provision were considered: health care region, size of catchment area/population, type of department/municipality and socioeconomic index. Results: Response rates for the provision of each core component of cardiac rehabilitation ranged from 64% to 98%. All hospitals and municipalities provided some aspect of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest. Across hospitals, provision of four core components of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was lower compared with post acute myocardial infarction patients: patient education (relative risk (RR) =0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.75)), exercise training (RR=0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.98)), screening for anxiety and depression (RR=0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) and nutritional counselling RR=0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.93)). No difference was found in the provision of core components across municipalities. Overall, the provision of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was not affected by organizational factors Conclusion: This study indicates a need for future research to inform the development, adoption and implementation of equal access to all components of cardiac rehabilitation for survivors of cardiac arrest in Denmark

TI  - Secretoneurin as a marker for hypoxic brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The neuropeptide secretoneurin (SN) shows widespread distribution in the brain. We evaluated whether SN is elevated after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and could serve as a potential new biomarker for hypoxic brain injury after CPR.
   This was a prospective observational clinical study. All patients admitted to a tertiary medical intensive care unit after successful CPR with expected survival of at least 24 h were consecutively enrolled from September 2008 to April 2013. Serum SN and neuron-specific enolase were determined in 24 h intervals starting with the day of CPR for 7 days. Neurological outcome was assessed with the Cerebral Performance Categories Scale (CPC) at hospital discharge.
   A total of 134 patients were included with 49 % surviving to good neurological outcome (CPC 1-2). SN serum levels peaked within the first 24 h showing on average a sixfold increase above normal. SN levels were significantly higher in patients with poor (CPC 3-5) than in patients with good neurological outcome [0-24 h: 75 (43-111) vs. 38 (23-68) fmol/ml, p < 0.001; 24-48 h: 45 (24-77) vs. 23 (16-39) fmol/ml, p < 0.001]. SN determined within the first 48 h showed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.753 (0.665-0.841). NSE in the first 72 h had a ROC-AUC of 0.881 (0.815-0.946). When combining the two biomarkers an AUC of 0.925 (0.878-0.972) for outcome prediction could be reached.
   SN is a promising early biomarker for hypoxic brain injury. Further studies will be required for confirmation of these results.

TI  - Outcomes of acute exacerbation of severe congestive heart failure - Quality of life, resource use, and survival
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
CP  - 19th Annual Meeting of the Society-of-General-Internal-Medicine
AB  - Background: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common disease with high health care costs and high mortality rates. Knowledge of the health-related quality of life outcomes of CHF may guide decision making and be useful in assessing new therapies for this population.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted involving 1390 adult patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of severe CHF (New York Heart Association class III-IV). Demographic data and health-related quality of life were determined by interview; physiologic status and cost and intensity of care were determined from hospital charts.
   Results: The median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of patients was 68.0 (58.2, 76.9) years; 61.7% were male. Survival was 93.40%, at discharge from the index hospitalization, 72.9% at 180 days, and 61.5% at 1 year. Of patients interviewed at 180 days, the median health rating on a scale of 0 to 100 (0 indicates death; 100, excellent health) was 60 (interquartile range, 50-80), and 59.7% were independent in their activities of daily living. Overall quality of life was reported to be good, very good, or excellent in 58.2% at 180 days. Patients with worse functional capacity were more likely to die. Health perceptions among the patients with available interview data improved at 60 and 180 days after acute exacerbation of severe CHF.
   Conclusions: Patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of severe CHF have a generally poor 6-month survival, but survivors retain relatively good functional status and have good health perceptions. Furthermore, health perceptions improve after the acute exacerbation.

TI  - Crash Landing of Thyroid Storm: A Case Report and Review of the Role of Extra-Corporeal Systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening endocrinological emergency with significant mortality ranging from 10-30% with multi-organ involvement and failure. In view of the rarity of this condition and efficacy of established first line medical treatment, use of extra-corporeal treatments are uncommon, not well-studied, and its available evidence exists only from case reports and case series. We describe a 28-year-old man who presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to thyroid storm. Despite conventional first-line pharmacotherapy, he developed cardiogenic shock and circulatory collapse with intravenous esmolol infusion, as well as multi-organ failure. He required therapeutic plasma exchange, concurrent renal replacement therapy, and veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, one of the few reported cases in the literature. While there was clinical stabilization and improvement in tri-iodothyronine levels on three extra-corporeal systems, he suffered irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We reviewed the use of early therapeutic plasma exchange and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, as well as the development of other novel extra-corporeal modalities when conventional pharmacotherapy is unsuccessful or contraindicated. This case also highlights the complexities in the management of thyroid storm, calling for caution with beta-blockade use in thyrocardiac disease, with close monitoring and prompt organ support.

TI  - Does improvement in the treatment of those who attempt suicide contribute to a reduction in elderly suicide rates in England?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS
AB  - Background: The reported decline in elderly suicide rates in England may have been, in part, due to prompt and successful resuscitation of those who attempt suicide. This study examines the impact of prompt and successful resuscitation of those who attempt suicide on elderly suicide rates in England.
   Methods: Possible changes in rates of attempted suicides in elderly age-bands over a nine-year period and the correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in elderly age-bands in England were examined using nationally collected data.
   Results: There was a significant increase in the rates of attempted suicide over the study period in the age-band 60-74 years, but not in the age-band 75+ years. There was a positive correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in the age-band 75+ years, but not in the age-band 60-74 years.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study were unable to confirm conclusively that prompt and successful medical resuscitation of those who attempt suicide makes a contribution to the decline in elderly suicide rates and requires further study. Public health initiatives should be designed to reduce not only suicide rates but also rates of attempted suicide; otherwise they are failing in the prevention of mental illness and suicidal behavior, early identification and treatment of those with mental illness and those at risk of suicide, and systematic follow-up of those recovering and recovered from mental illness.

TI  - RECENT DECLINES IN INFANT AND NEONATAL MORTALITY IN TURKEY FROM 2007 TO 2012: IMPACT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH POLICIES
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Infant mortality rate (IMR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) are accepted as good indicators to measure the health status of a nation. This report describes recent declines in IMR and NMR in Turkey.
   Methods: Data on infants who died before 12 months of life were obtained from the Infant Mortality Monitoring System of Ministry of Health of Turkey between 2007 and 2012. A total of 94,038 infant deaths were evaluated.
   Results: Turkey IMR and NMR exhibited a marked decline from 2007 (16.4 and 12.2) to 2010 (10.1 and 6.6) and then plateaued in 2012 (9.7 and 6.3), despite regional differences. Prematurity, congenital anomalies and congenital heart diseases (CHD) were the three most common causes of infant deaths between 2007 and 2012. While the rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and metabolic diseases increased, the rates of congenital anomalies and birth injuries decreased. IMR and NMR significantly increased with the number of infants per paediatrician, per doctor, and per midwife, while was decreasing with the increased rate of hospital birth, caesarean delivery, antenatal care, infant follow-up, and staff trained within the Neonatal Resuscitation Programme (NRP).
   Conclusion: From 2007-2012, Turkey showed remarkable encouraging advances in reducing IMR and NMR. Any interventions aimed at further reductions in IMR and NMR should target the common causes of death and defined risk factors especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions.

TI  - Determination of CRP, neopterin and anti-endotoxin antibodies in horses with fever of unknown origin
T2  - TIERAERZTLICHE PRAXIS AUSGABE GROSSTIERE NUTZTIERE
AB  - Subject: Field study on fever of unknown origin in horses. Objective: Routine laboratory parameters were analysed concerning their usefulness for an etiologic diagnosis. The parameters CPR, neopterin and antiendotoxin antibodies were included in the diagnostic profile. These investigations were based on the hypothesis that endotoxins may be of etiologic relevance due to their fever-evoking potential. Material and methods: Within three years 383 horses with fever were investigated and categorised into four different types of fever. Group I (fever of unknown origin) included all horses for which no reason for the fever could be identified during the initial and follow-up examinations. A blood sample was taken during the initial examination. An ELISA was used to determine CRP, neopterin and anti-endotoxin antibodies. Results were investigated for correlations with other clinico-chemical parameters. Results: Fever of unknown origin was diagnosed in 195 horses (50.9%) and thus was the most frequently diagnosed fever type. The mean of CRIP was within the reference range (8.08 mu g/l), whereas the mean of neopterin was increased (7.29 mmol/1). A pathological increase was observed for IgM-antibodies (Anti-Lipid-A-IgM 1.18 OD, Anti-Endotoxin-IgM 1.5 OD), Clinical relevance: The pyrogenic potential of endotoxins should be considered in the differential diagnosis in horses with fever of unknown origin. An extended clinico-chemical profile may be useful following the exclusion of other etiological reasons. CRP and neopterin are unspecific parameters, which in conjunction with other findings may be of benefit for the evaluation of the health status in horses.

TI  - Integrated trauma care successfully treats a severe case of combined steel bar penetration injury to the head, neck, chest, and abdomen: A case report and literature review
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:Penetrating injuries spanning multiple anatomical regions carry significant risks of morbidity and mortality. Successful management depends on coordinated prehospital care, expedited imaging, and a multidisciplinary surgical approach. This case report details the successful management of an exceptionally severe combined penetrating injury involving the head, neck, chest, and abdomen, emphasizing the critical role of an integrated trauma care system. It serves to highlight the importance of standardized trauma protocols for optimizing outcomes in such complex and life-threatening injuries.Patients concern and diagnosis:The patient exhibited acute distress, hemodynamic instability, and 2 penetrating steel rebars traversing the head, neck, chest, and abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed trajectories through critical structures, including the right orbit, cervical vascular sheath, and intra-abdominal organs, prompting immediate surgical intervention.Interventions:Emergency response: the trauma resuscitation team was activated, followed by fluid resuscitation and urgent CT imaging. Surgical procedures: (1) Open wound debridement and foreign body removal; (2) diaphragmatic repair and liver laceration management; (3) closed thoracic drainage and clavicle fracture fixation; (4) postoperative care: intensive monitoring, infection prevention, and rehabilitation.Outcomes:(1) Successful stabilization and foreign body extraction; (2) full recovery with near-complete functional restoration by postoperative day 20; (3) no significant complications observed during follow-up.Lessons:(1) Multidisciplinary collaboration and standardized trauma protocols are vital for complex cases; (2) CT imaging remains indispensable despite metallic artifacts; (3) institutional preparedness and continuous team training improve trauma care efficacy.

TI  - Factors associated with delayed admission to the burn unit: A major burn center's experience
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Background: Timely admission to the burn unit is crucial. Ideal burn care requires prompt interventions such as wound and body temperature management, infection control, and fluid resuscitation to prevent complications like burn progression and infection. In this study, we identify specific factors and outcomes associated with delayed admission to a regional burn center. Methods: Patients admitted to a large urban burn center from January 2015 to December 2023 were retrospectively queried, with subsequent collection of demographic and outcome variables from chart review. Descriptive statistics, Welch's t-tests of unequal variances, and Chi-square analysis were performed. Multiple logistic regression was performed to explore the association between delayed admission and ICU stay, ventilator requirements, and mortality. Results: A total of 3137 patients were included in the study. Approximately 63.4 % of patients were admitted within 24 h, while 36.6 % had a significant delay in care of over 24 h after injury. Male patients were likely to experience delayed admission (39.0 vs. 31.8 %, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in age between the two cohorts (38.6 vs. 39.7 years, p = 0.199). There was no significant difference in time to admission by racial background (p = 0.061). Total body surface area burned (TBSA) varied between the delayed and control cohorts (15.5+18.7 % vs. 8.2+12.9 %, p < 0.001). Patients who were single (p < 0.001) and lived alone (p = 0.011) were more likely to experience a delay in burn unit admission. Homelessness (p < 0.001), substance abuse disorder (p < 0.001), and uninsured status (p < 0.001) were also associated with delayed admission. In regression analysis when controlling for TBSA, delay in care was significantly associated with a greater requirement for ICU stay (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.021) but was not associated with increased mortality (p = 0.232). Conclusion: Sociodemographic variables such as homelessness, lack of social support, and substance abuse are associated with delayed burn unit admission. Knowledge of these factors can inform future interventions to improve outcomes for vulnerable patients, promoting better recovery and long-term outcomes after burn injury.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest (CA) as the Initial Presentation of Cocaine-Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM): A Case Report and Review of Literature
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Cocaine is used as an illicit substance responsible for the most common cause of drug-related death. It is a stimulant that acts on the sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular system leading to exaggerated, prolonged sympathetic activity due to the accumulation of neurotransmitters. Cardiovascular side effects of cocaine are coronary artery spasms, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is characterized by transient hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis of the left ventricle (LV) wall with or without apical involvement in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Cocaine -induced TCM is an extremely rare condition emphasizing the need of its prompt diagnosis by the physicians. We present a case report of a 54-year-old male, brought to the emergency department (ED) after an out-of -hospital cardiac arrest (CA), found to have TCM in the setting of cocaine use. Clinicians need to understand the association between cocaine use and the development of TCM as cardiomyopathy of this type can result in complete remission after discontinuing the offending agent.

TI  - Ambulance response times and 30-day mortality: a Copenhagen (Denmark) registry study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background and importance Ensuring prompt ambulance responses is complicated and costly. It is a general conception that short response times save lives, but the actual knowledge is limited.Objective To examine the association between the response times of ambulances with lights and sirens and 30-day mortality.Design A registry-based cohort study using data collected from 2014-2018.Settings and participants This study included 182 895 individuals who, during 2014-2018, were dispatched 266 265 ambulances in the Capital Region of Denmark.Outcome measures and analysis The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Subgroup analyses were performed on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, ambulance response priority subtypes, and caller-reported symptoms of chest pain, dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and traffic accidents. The relation between variables and 30-day mortality was examined with logistic regression.Results Unadjusted, short response times were associated with higher 30-day mortality rates across unadjusted response time quartiles (0-6.39 min: 9%; 6.40-8.60 min: 7.5%, 8.61-11.80 min: 6.6%, >11.80 min: 5.5%). This inverse relationship was consistent across subgroups, including chest pain, dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and response priority subtypes. For traffic accidents, no significant results were found. In the case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, longer response times of up to 10 min correlated with increased 30-day mortality rates (0-6.39 min: 84.1%; 6.40-8.60 min: 86.7%, 8.61-11.8 min: 87.7%, >11.80 min: 85.5%). Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, and call-related symptoms were associated with 30-day mortality, but response time was not (OR: 1.00 (95% CI [0.99-1.00])).Conclusion Longer ambulance response times were not associated with increased mortality, except for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

TI  - Neuroprotection and Hypothermia in Infants and Children
T2  - CURRENT DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Brain injury is the leading cause of death in pediatric ICU. Current evidence supports the use of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) in unconscious patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when the initial heart rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. TH has been proved to be also beneficial in term neonates after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent reports have also investigated TH for the treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus. The clinical application of TH is based on the possibility to inhibit or lessen a myriad of destructive processes (including excitotoxicty, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, free radical production, seizure activity, blood- brain barrier disruption, blood vessel leakage) that take place in the injured tissue following ischemia-reperfusion. TH may also represent a useful tool when conventional therapy fails to achieve an effective control of elevated intracranial pressure. This review is aimed to provide an update of the available literature concerning this intriguing topic.

TI  - Integrating Pediatric Palliative Care into the School and Community
T2  - PEDIATRIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Children and adolescents with complex chronic conditions often receive pediatric palliative care (PPC) from health care professionals. However, children's needs exist both in a health care context and in the community where children interact with peers, including school, places of worship, sports, activities, and organizations. Partnerships between PPC professionals in health care settings and teachers, coaches, spiritual leaders, activity directors, and others, may lead to greater health and well-being. Children near the end of life or those with out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate orders may also find palliation in their community. Cooperation between all caregivers benefit the child and family.

TI  - Impact of Using Drones in Emergency Medicine: What Does the Future Hold?
T2  - OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - The use of unmanned aerial vehicles or "drones" has expanded in the last decade, as their technology has become more sophisticated, and costs have decreased. They are now used routinely in farming, environmental surveillance, public safety, commercial product delivery, recreation, and other applications. Health-related applications are only recently becoming more widely explored and accepted. The use of drone technology in emergency medicine is especially promising given the need for a rapid response to enhance patient outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the main current and expanding applications of drone technology in emergency medicine and to describe challenges and future opportunities. Current applications being studied include delivery of defibrillators in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, blood and blood products in response to trauma, and rescue medications. Drones are also being studied and actively used in emergency response to search and rescue operations as well as disaster and mass casualty events. Current challenges to expanding their use in emergency medicine and emergency medical system (EMS) include regulation, safety, flying conditions, concerns about privacy, consent, and confidentiality, and details surrounding the development, operation, and maintenance of a medical drone network. Future research is needed to better understand end user perceptions and acceptance. Continued technical advances are needed to increase payload capacities, increase flying distances, and integrate drone networks into existing 9-1-1 and EMS systems. Drones are a promising technology for improving patient survival, outcomes, and quality of life, particularly for those in areas that are remote or that lack funds or infrastructure. Their cost savings compared with ground transportation alone, speed, and convenience make them particularly applicable in the field of emergency medicine. Research to date suggests that use of drones in emergency medicine is feasible, will be accepted by the public, is cost-effective, and has broad application.

AB  - In the current manuscript, we report an unusual case of a young 18-year-old woman who survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to Bland-White-Garland syndrome. Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed an abnormal color Doppler flow-pattern within the myocardium indicative of coronary fistulous flow that prompted further evaluation with coronary CT angiography, which confirmed the diagnosis. Our case serves not only as a reminder to consider coronary artery anomalies as a cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals but also as a prompt to investigate unusual echocardiographic findings with alternative imaging when the diagnosis may not be initially clear.

Although historically most reported cases have been fatal, the advent of modern prehospital care has led to an increase in survival following this injury. As a consequence, some patients may achieve or maintain satisfactory neurologic function following early intervention, stabilization, and definitive management. We analyzed the data on children and adolescents in whom traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation had been treated with modern resuscitation techniques at our institution.
   Methods: Atlanto-occipital dislocation is defined as disruption of the ligaments and other supporting soft tissues as indicated by displacement in either a transverse or vertical direction. With use of the Trauma Registry database at our institution, we identified sixteen such injuries that had occurred between 1986 and 2003. The hospital charts, clinic notes, and radiographs were reviewed. A careful neurological evaluation was performed for all of the survivors at the time of the latest follow-up.
   Results: The mean age of the sixteen patients at the time of the injury was 7.6 years. The mechanisms of injury were diverse. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7.4 points. Eleven of the sixteen patients underwent intubation in the field, two were intubated in the emergency department, and three were not intubated. Eight of the sixteen patients were declared dead on arrival in the emergency department. The eight surviving patients initially were immobilized with either a halo vest or another orthosis. All patients except one received intravenous steroids in the emergency department. Three of the patients who survived the initial injury subsequently died while undergoing neurosurgical procedures for the treatment of extensive intracranial injuries. Four of the remaining five survivors underwent occiput-C2 fusion, and one was managed with a Minerva cast. At the time of the final follow-up, at a mean of 4.2 years after the injury, one patient was neurologically normal, three had mild spastic hemiparesis and were very functional, and one had spastic quadriplegia and was ventilator-dependent.
   Conclusions: Prompt recognition and treatment of traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation in children and adolescents can result in improved survival. Early diagnosis, prompt intubation, early and adequate immobilization of the head and neck, and the use of intravenous steroids appear to facilitate survival. We recommend arthrodesis from the occiput to C2 (or the nearest adjacent intact and stable vertebra caudad to C2) for all children who survive a traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation, particularly those with an incomplete spinal cord injury.

TI  - Transplacental Sirolimus for Reversal of Fetal Heart Failure due to Fetal Cardiac Rhabdomyoma: Fetal and Maternal Considerations
T2  - FETAL DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY
AB  - Background:Rhabdomyoma is the most common cardiactumor in fetal life. It has frequent association with tuberoussclerosis complex and may lead to heart failure, a potentiallyfatal condition. The use of transplacental sirolimus, amammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, has emerged as anovel treatment in symptomatic fetal rhabdomyomas;however, there are only few cases described.CasePresentation:A 37-year-old woman at 29 weeks and4 days of gestation had been diagnosed with fetal cardiactumor, adhered adjacent to the left ventricle, associated withheart dysfunction and polyhydramnios. Therapy with oralsirolimus was started, and, once serum levels were achieved,cardiac tumor reduction was observed, with progressiveresolution of cardiac dysfunction. However, maternal hy-pertriglyceridemia was developed as a side effect, a rarelydiscussed theme on previous articles, and was successfullycontrolled with dose reduction. The patient delivered a maleinfant at 38 weeks and 2 days of pregnancy with no need ofany resuscitation maneuver.Conclusion:Transplacentaltreatment with sirolimus is a promising therapeutic optionto treat symptomatic fetal rhabdomyomas, but more dataare demanded to determine its efficacy and safety duringpregnancy. A close maternal follow-up concerning triglyc-eride levels is mandatory.(c) 2025 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Unexplained syncope during pacemaker interrogation: Wand, AutoCapture, or lead-Which one is the elusive culprit?
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - A 65-year-old gentleman underwent dual chamber pacemaker implantation (DDDR, St Jude Medical) 7 years back for infra-hisian complete heart block. He was completely asymptomatic and came for his annual routine check-up. After undergoing ECG with and without magnet, he was prepared for device evaluation. After placing the programmer wand over the chest as soon as the ";interrogate" button on the programmer screen was pressed, the patient immediately experienced pre-syncope but recovered instantly as the wand was promptly withdrawn. After taking him to the casualty room with all resuscitation measures in hand, a repeat attempt of interrogation was made after connecting ECG, which revealed reproducible loss of capture (LOC), exclusively during wand placement. A differential diagnosis of lead failure, battery depletion, or wand related issues were considered. However, serial ECGs recorded without wand raised the possibility of AutoCapture malfunction. With all precautions, the device was programmed to fixed ventricular output mode after which interrogation could be performed safely. There was a remaining battery longevity of 2 years with acceptable lead parameters and stable threshold. He continues to be asymptomatic at 10 months of follow up.

TI  - A New Program of Kidney Transplantation From Donors After Cardiac Death in Spain
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 2nd Congress of the Spanish-Transplantation-Society (SET)
AB  - Despite the high rate of kidney transplantation in Spain, a disparity still exists between the numbers of donors and waiting-list patients. Donors after circulatory death (DCD) have been propagated as a promising approach to reduce the donor kidney shortage. In Europe most of the countries use controlled DCD, but in Spain, mainly uncontrolled DCD are harvested and until 2010 at only four institutions.
   In January 2010, we began a program of donation after uncontrolled DCD (Maastricht type II; unsuccessful resuscitation). The aim of this observational study was to describe our preliminary results. The numbers of recovered and transplanted organs per DCD were 27. There were no cases of primary nonfunction, but delayed graft function was present in 85% of recipients. Despite this impairment, about 75% of patients reached a serum creatinine below 2 mg/dL in the second month, with 1-year graft and patient survivals of 85% and 100%. Although, our preliminary results with a not very long follow-up and small number of patients suggested that utilization of DCD should be expanded because this type of donor increases the number of cases and opportunities of end-stage renal disease patients to reduce the waiting times for transplantation.

TI  - Intravesical migration of intrauterine device complicated by multifocal sepsis from ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess and acute appendicitis: a comprehensive clinical case study
T2  - BMC UROLOGY
AB  - BackgroundIntrauterine device (IUD) migration is a rare but serious complication of IUD use, most often resulting from unnoticed uterine perforation. However, intravesical migration complicated by multifocal sepsis from ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and acute appendicitis is an exceedingly rare and complex clinical scenario.Case presentationA 39-year-old multiparous Asian female with history of IUD placement presented with features of sepsis. Laboratory and radiological investigations, and quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score were promptly done. The assessment was intravesical IUD migration complicated by multifocal sepsis and septic shock due to ruptured TOA and acute appendicitis. She had resuscitation and an urgent combined minimal access surgical intervention. Her postoperative recovery was rapid, and she was discharged four days after surgery.ConclusionThis rare case demonstrates the importance of early recognition of sepsis, the relevant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of managing a critically ill gynecology patient with a migrated IUD complicated by multifocal sepsis and the significance of patient education and appropriate follow-up after IUD insertion.

TI  - The Eye Examination in the Evaluation of Child Abuse
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Child abuse can cause injury to any part of the eye. The most common manifestations are retinal hemorrhages (RHs) in infants and young children with abusive head trauma (AHT). Although RHs are an important indicator of possible AHT, they are also found in other conditions. Distinguishing the number, type, location, and pattern of RHs is important in evaluating a differential diagnosis. Eye trauma can be seen in cases of physical abuse or AHT and may prompt referral for ophthalmologic assessment. Physicians have a responsibility to consider abuse in the differential diagnosis of pediatric eye trauma. Identification and documentation of inflicted ocular trauma requires a thorough examination by an ophthalmologist, including indirect ophthalmoscopy, most optimally through a dilated pupil, especially for the evaluation of possible RHs. An eye examination is helpful in detecting abnormalities that can help identify a medical or traumatic etiology for previously well young children who experience unexpected and unexplained mental status changes with no obvious cause, children with head trauma that results in significant intracranial hemorrhage and brain injury, and children with unexplained death.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Electrocardiogram Model (EIANet) to Predict Emergency Department Cardiac Arrest: Development and External Validation Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a severe and sudden medical emergency that is characterized by the abrupt cessation of circulatory function, leading to death or irreversible organ damage if not addressed immediately. Emergency department (ED)-based IHCA (EDCA) accounts for 10% to 20% of all IHCA cases. Early detection of EDCA is crucial, yet identifying subtle signs of cardiac deterioration is challenging. Traditional EDCA prediction methods primarily rely on structured vital signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which require additional preprocessing or specialized devices. This study introduces a novel approach using image-based 12-lead ECG data obtained at ED triage, leveraging the inherent richness of visual ECG patterns to enhance prediction and integration into clinical workflows. Objective: This study aims to address the challenge of early detection of EDCA by developing an innovative deep learning model, the ECG-Image-Aware Network (EIANet), which uses 12-lead ECG images for early prediction of EDCA. By focusing on readily available triage ECG images, this research seeks to create a practical and accessible solution that seamlessly integrates into real-world ED workflows. Methods: For adult patients with EDCA (cases), 12-lead ECG images at ED triage were obtained from 2 independent data sets: National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH). Control ECGswererandomlyselected from adult ED patients without cardiac arrest during the same study period. In EIANet, ECG images werefirst converted to binary form, followed by noise reduction, connected component analysis, and morphological opening. A spatial attention module was incorporated into the ResNet50 architecture to enhance feature extraction, and a custom binary recall loss (BRLoss) was used to balance precision and recall, addressing slight data set imbalance. The model was developed and internally validated on the NTUH-ECG data set and was externally validated on an independent FEMH-ECG data set. The model performance was evaluated using the F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results: There were 571 case ECGs and 826 control ECGs in the NTUH data set and 378 case ECGs and 713 control ECGs in the FEMH data set. The novel EIANet model achieved an F1-score of 0.805, AUROC of 0.896, and AUPRC of 0.842 on the NTUH-ECG data set with a 40% positive sample ratio. It achieved an F1-score of 0.650, AUROC of 0.803, and AUPRC of 0.678 on the FEMH-ECG data set with a 34.6% positive sample ratio. The feature map showed that the region of interest in the ECG was the ST segment. Conclusions: EIANet demonstrates promising potential for accurately predicting EDCA using triage ECG images, offering an effective solution for early detection of high-risk cases in emergency settings. This approach may enhance the ability of health care professionals to make timely decisions, with the potentialto improve patient outcomes by enabling earlier interventions for EDCA.

TI  - Unilateral global renal infarction in a patient with ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease in a resource limited setting: a case report
T2  - BMC NEPHROLOGY
AB  - IntroductionRenal infarction is a rare ischemic event, occurring in 0.004-0.007% of emergency room admissions, with global renal infarction being extremely rare and caused by the blockage of the main renal artery or its branches, often due to emboli from the heart or in situ thrombosis, leading to renal ischemia. We present a rare case of complete renal infarction, highlighted not only by its coincidence with ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease, but also by its rapid progression to acute renal failure and cardiac arrest, despite aggressive medical management.Case presentationA 72-year-old female patient, known to be hypertensive with a history of hypertensive heart disease and ischemic stroke, discontinued her follow-up two months prior to her presentation at the emergency department. She presented with a dry, intermittent cough and shortness of breath of five days' duration. She was admitted with a diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia and started on antibiotics, intranasal oxygen, and analgesics. Subsequently, she developed severe right-sided loin pain and vomiting, along with persistent shortness of breath. A contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography scan was performed to rule out acute pulmonary thromboembolism due to her persistent shortness of breath, which incidentally revealed a globally unilateral right renal infarction secondary to renal artery thrombosis. Despite initiating unfractionated heparin, warfarin, and supportive therapies, the patient unfortunately passed away 19 days after admission.ConclusionUnilateral global renal infarction in a patient with hypertensive heart disease and ischemic stroke, though rare, can present with pronounced symptoms of acute renal failure and ultimately cardiac arrest. Prompt recognition and management of risk factors, including hypertension and previous thromboembolic events, are crucial for preventing fatal outcomes.

TI  - Too Late to Treat: Missed Antenatal Syphilis Screening and a Fatal Neonatal Outcome - A Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CASE REPORTS JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction: Syphilis in pregnancy, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be vertically transmitted, leading to serious neonatal complications such as preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Despite global efforts to reduce its prevalence, challenges such as inadequate antenatal screening and delayed treatment persist. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing adverse outcomes.<br /> Case Illustration: A 24-year-old pregnant woman (G3P2A0) was admitted at 29- 30 weeks of gestation with premature rupture of membranes and labor contractions. She had been diagnosed with syphilis at 28 weeks but had not received treatment. The baby boy was delivered prematurely and suffered from severe asphyxia and respiratory distress, requiring resuscitation. Sadly, he passed away three hours after birth. The mother was discharged after receiving the first dose of syphilis treatment.<br /> Conclusion: This case highlights the critical importance of early syphilis screening and timely treatment during pregnancy to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Delayed intervention in this case contributed to a poor prognosis. Comprehensive antenatal screening and prompt follow-up care are essential to reducing the risk of congenital syphilis and its complications.

TI  - Contemporary Burn Survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
CP  - 129th Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association
AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard of burn treatment today reflects major advances. We sought to quantitate the impact of these advances on burn survival via age-stratified mortality ratios compared with other reported mortality analyses in burns.
   STUDY DESIGN: Age, percent of the total body surface area (TBSA) burned, presence of inhalation injury, length of stay, and survival status were recorded at admission and at discharge for all new burn admissions between 1989 and 2017. The expected mortality probability was calculated using historical multiple regression techniques and compared with observed data. We developed a prediction model for our observed data.
   RESULTS: Between 1989 and 2017, there were 10,384 consecutive new burn admissions, with 355-mortalities (median age, 13 years; median percent TBSA burn, 11%). We saw a significant decrease in our observed mortality data compared to historical predictions (p < 0.0001), and a 2% reduction per year in mortality during the 3 decades. The prediction model of mortality for the data is as follows: Pr(dying) = e(x)/(1 + e(x)) where x = -6.44 - 0.12 age + 0.0042 age(2) - 0.0000283 age(3) + 0.0499 TBSA + 1.21 Inhalation Injury + 0.015 third degree TBSA.
   CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in mortality over time may be attributed to successful changes in standard of care protocols in the burn center that improved the outlook for burned individuals, including protocols for management of inhalation injury, nutrition, resuscitation, and early excision and grafting.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Erythropoietin in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Multinational Trial-Based Economic Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB  - The EPO-TBI multi-national randomized controlled trial found that erythropoietin (EPO), when compared to placebo, did not affect 6-month neurological outcome, but reduced illness severity-adjusted mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), making the cost-effectiveness of EPO in TBI uncertain. The current study uses patient-level data from the EPO-TBI trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EPO in patients with moderate or severe TBI from the healthcare payers' perspective. We addressed the issue of transferability in multi-national trials by estimating costs and effects for specific geographical regions of the study (Australia/New Zealand, Europe, and Saudi Arabia). Unadjusted mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 95% confidence interval [CI]) at 6 months were 0.027 (0.020-0.034; p < 0.001) higher in the EPO group, with an adjusted QALY increment of 0.014 (0.000-0.028; p = 0.04). Mean unadjusted costs (95% CI) were $US5668 (-9191 to -2144; p = 0.002) lower in the treatment group; controlling for baseline IMPACT-TBI score and regional heterogeneity reduced this difference to $2377 (-12,446 to 7693; p = 0.64). For a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50,000 per QALY, 71.8% of replications were considered cost-effective. Therefore, we did not find evidence that EPO was significantly cost-effective in the treatment of moderate or severe TBI at 6-month follow-up.

TI  - Factors related to specialized palliative care use and aggressive care at end of life in Japanese patients with advanced solid cancers: a cohort study
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to (1) describe characteristics of aggressive care at the end of life (EOL) and (2) identify factors associated with specialized palliative care use (SPC) and aggressive care at the EOL among Japanese patients with advanced cancer. Methods This single-center, follow-up cohort study involved patients with advanced cancer who received chemotherapy at Tohoku University Hospital. Patients were surveyed at enrollment, and we followed clinical events for 5 years from enrollment in the study. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent factors related to SPC use and chemotherapy in the last month before death. Results We analyzed a total of 135 patients enrolled between January 2015 and January 2016. No patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and few received resuscitation or ventilation. We identified no factors significantly associated with SPC use. Meanwhile, younger age (20-59 years, odds ratio [OR] 4.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-12.91; p = 0.02) and no receipt of SPC (OR 4.32; 95% CI 1.07-17.37; p = 0.04) were associated with chemotherapy in the last month before death. Conclusion Younger age and a lack of SPC were associated with chemotherapy at the EOL in patients with advanced cancer in Japan. These findings suggest that Japanese patients with advanced cancer may benefit from access to SPC.

TI  - Almanac 2013: cardiac arrhythmias and pacing-an editorial overview of selected research that has driven recent advances in clinical cardiology
T2  - ACTA CARDIOLOGICA
AB  - Important advances have been made in the past few years in the fields of clinical cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. Researchers and clinicians have a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF), which has transpired into improved methods of detection, risk stratification, and treatments. The introduction of novel oral anticoagulants has provided clinicians with alternative options in managing patients with AF at moderate to high thromboembolic risk and further data has been emerging on the use of catheter ablation for the treatment of symptomatic AF. Another area of intense research in the field of cardiac arrhythmias and pacing is in the use of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of patients with heart failure. Following the publication of major landmark randomised controlled trials reporting that CRT confers a survival advantage in patients with severe heart failure and improves symptoms, many subsequent studies have been performed to further refine the selection of patients for CRT and determine the clinical characteristics associated with a favourable response. The field of sudden cardiac death and implantable cardioverter defibrillators also continues to be actively researched, with important new epidemiological and clinical data emerging on improved methods for patient selection, risk stratification, and management. This review covers the major recent advances in these areas related to cardiac arrhythmias and pacing.

TI  - In-service training for health professionals to improve care of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   A variety of in-service emergency care training courses are currently being promoted as a strategy to improve the quality of care provided to seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries. Most courses have been developed in high-income countries. However, whether these courses improve the ability of health professionals to provide appropriate care in low-income countries remains unclear. This is the first update of the original review.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of in-service emergency care training on health professionals' treatment of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries.
   Search methods
   For this update, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, part of The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com); MEDLINE, Ovid SP; EMBASE, Ovid SP; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge/Science and eight other databases. We performed database searches in February 2015. We also searched clinical trial registries, websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. We applied no date, language or publication status restrictions when conducting the searches.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted-time-series studies that compared the effects of in-service emergency care training versus usual care were eligible for inclusion. We included only hospital-based studies and excluded community-based studies. Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias and confidence in effect estimates (certainty of evidence) for each outcome using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We described results and presented them in GRADE tables.
   Main results
   We identified no new studies in this update. Two randomised trials (which were included in the original review) met the review eligibility criteria. In the first trial, newborn resuscitation training compared with usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation (trained 66% vs usual care 27%, risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42; moderate certainty evidence) and reduced inappropriate resuscitation (trained mean 0.53 vs usual care 0.92, mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence). Findings from the second trial suggest that essential newborn care training compared with usual care probably slightly improves delivery room newborn care practices (assessment of breathing, preparedness for resuscitation) (moderate certainty evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   In-service neonatal emergency care courses probably improve health professionals' treatment of seriously ill babies in the short term. Further multi-centre randomised trials evaluating the effects of in-service emergency care training on long-term outcomes (health professional practice and patient outcomes) are needed.

TI  - Outcomes, preferences for resuscitation, and physician-patient communication among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
CP  - 19th Annual Meeting of the Society-of-General-Internal-Medicine
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe characteristics, outcomes, and decision making in patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver, and to examine the relationship of doctor-patient communication with patient understanding of prognosis and physician understanding of patients' treatment preferences.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) was a prospective cohort study conducted at five teaching hospitals in the United States between 1989 and 1994. Participants in this study were hospitalized patients 18 years of age or older with known liver metastases who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer at least 1 month earlier. Data were collected by patient interview and chart review at study entry; patients were inteviewed again at 2 and 6 months. Data collected by physician interview included estimates of survival and impressions of patients' preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patients and physicians were also asked about discussions about prognosis and resuscitation preferences.
   RESULTS: We studied 520 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (median age 64, 56% male, 80% white, 2-month survival 78%, 6-month survival 56%). Quality of life (62% "good" to "excellent") and functional status (median number of disabilities = 0) were high at study entry and remained so among interviewed survivors at 2 and 6 months. Of 339 patients with available information, 212 (63%) of 339 wanted CPR in the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest. Factors independently associated with preference for resuscitation included younger age, better quality of life, absence of lung metastases, and greater patient estimate of 2-month prognosis. Of the patients who preferred not to receive CPR, less than half had a do-not-resuscitate note or order written. Patients' self-assessed prognoses were less accurate than those of their physicians. Physicians incorrectly identified patient CPR preferences in 30% of cases. Neither patient prognostication nor physician understanding of preferences were significantly better when discussions were reported between doctors and patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with colorectal cancer have preferences regarding end of life care. The substantial misunderstanding between patients and their physicians about prognosis and treatment preferences appears not to be improved by direct communication. Future research focused on enhancing the effectiveness of communication between patients and physicians about end of life issues is needed. (C) 1998 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

TI  - Examining the Contemporary Use of Hospitals in Canada for Palliative Care Purposes: A Population-Based Study to Enable Policy and Program Developments
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: It is commonly thought that most deaths in developed countries take place in hospital. Death place is a palliative care quality indicator. Objectives: To determine the use of Canadian hospitals by patients who died in hospital during the 2019-2020 year and any additional hospital utilization occurring over their last 365 days of life. Design: An investigation of population-based (2018-2020) Canadian hospital data using SAS. Settings/Subjects: All patients admitted to hospital and discharged alive or deceased. Measurements: Describe patients who died in hospital, and any additional use of hospitals by these patients over their last year of life. Results: Ninety-one thousand six hundred forty inpatients died during 2019-2020; 4.85% of all 1.88 million hospitalized individuals and 41.82% of all deaths in Canada that year. Decedents were primarily 65+ years of age (81.16%), male (53.44%), admitted through an emergency department (80.16%), and arrived by ambulance (72.15%). The most common diagnosis was the nonspecific ICD-10 defined ''factors influencing health status and contact with health services'' (23.75%), followed by ''circulatory diseases'' (18.22%), ''respiratory diseases'' (15.58%), and many other less common diagnoses. The average length of final hospital stay was 16.54 days, with 89.97% having some Alternative Level of Care (ALC) or ALC days recorded, indicating another care setting was preferable. Only 5.78% had cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed during their final hospitalization. Of all 91,640 decedents, 74.33% had only one admission to hospital in their last 365 days of life, while 25.67% (more often younger than older decedents) had two to five admissions. Conclusions: This study confirms a continuing shift of death and dying out of hospital in Canada. Most deaths and end-of-life care preceding death take place outside of hospitals now. Enhanced community-based services are recommended to support optimal dying processes outside of hospitals and also help more dying people avoid hospital deaths.

TI  - Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Severe hyperkalemia, with potassium (K+) levels >= 6.5 mEq/L, is a potentially life- threatening electrolyte imbalance. For prompt and effective treatment, it is important to know its risk factors, clinical manifestations, and predictors of mortality.
   Methods: An observational cohort study was performed at 2 medical centers. A total of 923 consecutive Korean patients were analyzed. All were 19 years of age or older and were hospitalized with severe hyperkalemia between August 2007 and July 2010; the diagnosis of severe hyperkalemia was made either at the time of admission to the hospital or during the period of hospitalization. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis were assessed, and clinical outcomes such as in- hospital mortality were reviewed, using the institutions' electronic medical record systems.
   Results: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was the most common underlying medical condition, and the most common precipitating factor of hyperkalemia was metabolic acidosis. Emergent admission was indicated in 68.6% of patients, 36.7% had electrocardiogram findings typical of hyperkalemia, 24.5% had multi- organ failure (MOF) at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, and 20.3% were diagnosed with severe hyperkalemia at the time of cardiac arrest. The in- hospital mortality rate was 30.7%; the rate was strongly correlated with the difference between serum K+ levels at admission and at their highest point, and with severe medical conditions such as malignancy, infection, and bleeding. Furthermore, a higher in- hospital mortality rate was significantly associated with the presence of cardiac arrest and/ or MOF at the time of diagnosis, emergent admission, and intensive care unit treatment during hospitalization. More importantly, acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with normal baseline renal function was a strong predictor of mortality, compared with AKI superimposed on CKD.
   Conclusions: Severe hyperkalemia occurs in various medical conditions; the precipitating factors are similarly diverse. The mortality rate is especially high in patients with severe underlying disease, coexisting medical conditions, and those with normal baseline renal function.

TI  - Renal impairment and mortality in patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock/cardiac arrest
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
AB  - ObjectivesWe sought to study the association of renal impairment (RI) with mortality in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock and/or cardiac arrest (CS/CA). MethodsPatients with RI (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were identified from the Midwest STEMI consortium, a prospective registry of four large regional programs comprising consecutive patients over 17 years. Primary outcome was in-hospital and 1-year mortality stratified by RI status and presence of CS/CA among patients with STEMI referred for coronary angiography. ResultsIn a cohort of 13,463 STEMI patients, 13% (n = 1754) had CS/CA, 30% (n = 4085) had RI. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 5% (12% RI vs. 2% no-RI, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality 9% (21% RI vs. 4% no-RI, p < 0.001). Among uncomplicated STEMI, in-hospital mortality was 2% (4% RI vs. 1% no-RI, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality 6% (13% RI vs. 3% no-RI, p < 0.001). In STEMI with CS/CA, in-hospital mortality was 29% (43% RI vs. 15% no-RI, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality 33% (50% RI vs. 16% no-RI, p < 0.001). Using Cox proportional hazards, RI was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in STEMI with CS/CA (odds ratio [OR]: 3.86; confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 5.8). ConclusionsThe association of RI with in-hospital and 1-year mortality is disproportionately greater in those with CS/CA compared to uncomplicated STEMI presentations. Factors predisposing RI patients to higher risk STEMI presentations and pathways to promote earlier recognition in the chain of survival need further investigation.

TI  - Nitrite therapy is neuroprotective and safe in cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - NITRIC OXIDE-BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Cardiac arrest results in significant mortality after initial resuscitation due in most cases to ischemia-reperfusion induced brain injury and to a lesser degree myocardial dysfunction. Nitrite has previously been shown to protect against reperfusion injury in animal models of focal cerebral and heart ischemia. Nitrite therapy after murine cardiac arrest improved 22 h survival through improvements in myocardial contractility. These improvements accompanied transient mitochondrial inhibition which reduced oxidative injury to the heart. Based on preliminary evidence that nitrite may also protect against ischemic brain injury, we sought to test this hypothesis in a rat model of asphyxia cardiac arrest with prolonged survival (7 d). Cardiac arrest resulted in hippocampal CA1 delayed neuronal death well characterized in this and other cardiac arrest models. Nitrite therapy did not alter post-arrest hemodynamics but did result in significant (75%) increases in CA1 neuron survival. This was associated with increases in hippocampal nitrite and S-nitrosothiol levels but not cGMP shortly after therapy. Mitochondrial function 1 h after resuscitation trended towards improvement with nitrite therapy. Based on promising preclinical data, the first ever phase I trial of nitrite infusions in human cardiac arrest survivors has been undertaken. We present preliminary data showing low dose nitrite infusion did not result in hypotension or cause methemoglobinemia. Nitrite thus appears safe and effective for clinical translation as a promising therapy against cardiac arrest mediated heart and brain injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The BE-ALIVE score: assessing 30-day mortality risk in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes
T2  - OPEN HEART
AB  - Aim To create and validate a simple scoring system for predicting 30- day mortality in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) at their moment of admission.Methods and results 2407 consecutive patients presenting to Harefield Hospital with measured arterial blood gases, from January 2011 to December 2020, were studied to build the training set. 30- day mortality in this group was 17.2%. A scoring algorithm that was built using binary logistic regression of variables available on admission was then converted to an additive risk score. The resultant scoring system is the BE- ALIVE score, which incorporates the following factors: Base Excess (1 point for <-2 mmol/L), Age (<65 years: 0 points, 65-74: 1 point, 75-84: 2 points, =85: 3 points), Lactate (<2 mmol/L: 0 points, 2-4.9: 1 point, 5-9.9: 3 points, =10: 6 points), Intubated (2 points), Left Ventricular function (mildly impaired or better: -1 point, moderately impaired: 1 point, severely impaired: 3 points) and External/out of hospital cardiac arrest 2 points). The scoring system was validated using a testing set of 515 patients presenting to Harefield Hospital in 2021. The validation metrics were excellent with a c-statistic of 0.9, Brier's score 0.06 vs a naive classifier of 0.15, Spiegelhalter's z-statistic probability of 0.267 and a calibration slope of 1.08.Conclusion The BE- ALIVE score is a simple and accurate scoring system to predict 30- day mortality in patients presenting with ACS. Appreciating this mortality risk can allow prompt involvement of appropriate care such as the shock team.

TI  - Approaching brain injury after cardiac arrest: from bench to bedside
T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL IEEE EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING 2003, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 1st International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering
AB  - The neurological injury after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (CA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The unavailability of primary brain directed measures of injury and effective therapy worsens the problem. We have embarked on better understanding the process of injury and recovery by developing an animal model in our laboratory. Using this model, we have discovered that the use of quantitative EEG (Q-EEG) analysis will allow us to titrate the brain injury, monitor the recovery process, study the electrophysiologicai and biochemical mechanisms of injury and recovery and detect the neuroprotective effect afforded by a drug that prevents neuronal death after injury. With ideas derived from the laboratory research, we have designed a study to test the applicability of QEEG analysis in human subjects resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Our preliminary analysis shows that our measure is able to track the neurological changes of these patients. With this very promising start of this QEEG based measure, we can utilize this technology to develop more rational and effective therapeutic strategies that will improve the neurological outcome in this patient population.

TI  - Measuring outcome after cardiac arrest: construct validity of Cerebral Performance Category
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Approximately half of the survivors of cardiac arrest have cognitive impairments due to hypoxic brain injury. To describe the outcome after a cardiac arrest, the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) is frequently used. Although widely used, its validity is still debatable.
   Objective: To investigate the construct validity of the Cerebral Performance Category in survivors of a cardiac arrest.
   Participants were 18 years and older that survived a cardiac arrest more than six months.
   Methods: Cross-sectional design. A method to administer the CPC in a structured and reproducible manner was developed. This 'Structured CPC' was administered by a structured interview. Construct variables were Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ), Barthel Index (BI), Frenchay Activity Index (FAI), Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and Quality of Life after Brain Injury (Qolibri). Associations were tested based on Spearman correlation coefficients.
   Results: A total of 62 participants responded. In 58 (94%) patients the CPC was determined, resulting in CPC 1 (48%), CPC 2 (23%) and CPC 3 (23%). The CPC-scoring correlated significantly with the CFQ(r = -0.40); BI (r= -0.57); FAI (r= -0.65), CIQ(r = -0.53) and Qolibri (r= -0.67).
   Discussion and conclusions: In this study we developed the 'Structured CPC' to improve the transparency and reproducibility of the original CPC. A moderate correlation between the 'Structured CPC' and the constructs 'activities', 'participation' and 'quality of life' confirmed the validity of the 'Structured CPC'.
   Clinical message: The 'Structured CPC' can be used as an instrument to measure the level of functioning after cardiac arrest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - COMPLICATIONS OF CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS IN CHILDREN - A REVIEW OF 2,281 CATHETER INSERTIONS
T2  - PEDIATRIC SURGERY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Central venous access has become a frequent requirement in the management of seriously ill or injured infants and children with a wide variety of conditions. This report evaluates the complications observed with the use of central venous catheters in 1,378 cases. Central venous catheters (n = 2,281) were placed in 1,378 children (728 boys: 650 girls). There were 1,012 temporary catheters (noncuffed/percutaneously placed) while 1,268 were inserted operatively, including 37 portacaths and 1,231 with dacron cuffs (Hickman, Broviac) for long-term use. A single catheter was inserted in 542 cases and multiple catheters in 836. Indications of catheter insertion included emergency resuscitation or access (501), malignancy (462), and intestinal dysfunction (415). Catheter infection occurred in 430 cases (18.8%). Of 219 infected temporary access catheters, 123 were removed while 96 were changed over a guide wire. Of 211 infected permanent catheters, 18 were immediately removed while 193 were  treated with i.v. (vancomycin, gentamicin) antibiotics. Forty-seven of 193 (24%) catheters were eventually removed because of persistent or recurrent infection (16 cases) or subsequent fungal sepsis due to Candida albicans (31 cases). Only 3 of 37 portacaths were removed because of infection. Bacterial isolates were single in 125 cases and multiple in 86. Organisms included Staphylococcus epidermidis in 104 cases, Staph. aureus in 65, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 51, Escherichia coli in 51, and others in 18. Catheter complications occurred in 107 (5%) cases, including symptomatic vessel thrombosis in 49, pneumothorax in 26, catheter migration in 25, vessel injury in 5, and catheter embolus in 2. Despite the relatively high complication rate there were no catheter-related deaths. Multiple-lumen catheters had twice the complication rate and infection rate of single lumen catheters (P < 0.05). Temporary percutaneous catheters had a complication/infection rate 1.5 times greater than permanent catheters (P < 0.05) that were operatively placed. Bacterial infection cleared with antibiotics in 76% of cases with catheter sepsis, however, secondary fungal infection necessitated prompt catheter removal. These data indicated that precutaneously placed catheters and multilumen catheters are associated with significantly higher complication and infection rates. Surgeons should balance the risks of convenience vs. complications in their choice of catheters and methods of insertion.

TI  - Early and Mid-Term Results of Solid Organ Transplantation After Circulatory Death: A 4-Year Single Centre Experience
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: The use of controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD) donors has significantly increased during the past decades and successfully expanded the donors' pool. However, warm ischemia may have detrimental effects on graft function. Italian Law requires a no-touch period of at least 20 min, which is much longer compared to the 5 min accepted in most European countries. Materials and Methods This is an Italian single-centre retrospective review of all cDCD procedures performed from April 2021 to June 2025. Patients with severe brain injury undergoing withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) were considered for cDCD. After cardiac arrest and a no-touch period of 20 min, organ reperfusion was performed using abdominal or thoraco-abdominal normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) through femoral vessels cannulation. The primary endpoint was 30-day graft survival; secondary endpoints included: incidence of primary non-function (PNF) and non-anastomotic biliary stricture (NAS) in liver transplantation, PNF and delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) in heart and lung transplantation, and recipient's survival. Results: A total of 52 patients, 33 (63%) males, median age 74 (65-79) years, underwent WLST during the study period and were included in the cDCD program. Median functional warm ischemic time (WIT), total WIT, asystolic phase, and NRP duration were 37 (34-40), 40 (37-42), 24 (23-26), and 192 (166-212) min, respectively. A total of 123 organs (46 livers, 61 kidneys, 8 hearts, and 8 lungs) were considered suitable for transplantation, procured, and successfully transplanted in 115 recipients. We report the early and mid-term outcomes of 84 recipients, including 41 liver recipients, 32 kidney recipients, and 8 heart recipients transplanted at the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, and 3 lung recipients transplanted at the Azienda Ospedale Universit & agrave; of Padova. The 30-day graft survival was 95% in liver recipients, 97% in kidney recipients, and 100% in heart and lung recipients. PNF was observed in two liver recipients, and PGD in two lung recipients. DGF was recorded in 3 (9%) kidney recipients. Six recipients died during the follow-up, and the mean survival time was 3.9 +/- 0.1 years. Conclusions: Solid organ transplantation using cDCD donors is feasible and provides excellent early and mid-term results despite longer donor asystolic times. Larger data and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm these promising results.

TI  - Catheter Ablation vs Drug Therapy in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Nonmodifiable Recurrence Risk Factors A Secondary Analysis of the CABANA Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - IMPORTANCE Large-scale randomized studies evaluating the impact of catheter ablation on cardiovascular prognoses across different atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence risk profiles are lacking. OBJECTIVE To investigate the benefits of catheter ablation in patients with varying numbers of nonmodifiable recurrence risk factors (NMRRFs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a post hoc subanalysis of the multinational, multicenter, open-label Catheter Ablation vs Anti-Arrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) randomized clinical trial, for which enrollment occurred from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up until December 31, 2017. Individuals with AF and at least 1 stroke risk factor were recruited in the CABANA trial. Only those with complete NMRRF data were included in this secondary analysis. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2023, to May 12, 2025. EXPOSURE Patients were categorized into 2 subgroups based on their number of NMRRFs (<3 or >= 3 risk factors). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of the CABANA trial was death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Four NMRRFs were examined: AF duration more than 1 year, persistent or long-standing persistent AF, age older than 65 years, and female sex. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment were performed to investigate the benefit of ablation in each subgroup. RESULTS In total, 2185 patients (median age, 67.0 years [IQR, 62.0-72.0 years]; 1373 males [62.8%]) with complete NMRRF data were included. Of these patients, 1100 (50.3%) were randomized to receive catheter ablation and 1085 (49.7%) were randomized to receive drug therapy. Most patients (1469 [67.2%]) had fewer than 3 NMRRFs, while 716 (32.8%) had 3 or more. In patients with fewer than 3 NMRRFs, catheter ablation reduced the primary end point (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.41-0.86]). However, the difference was not significant in those with 3 or more NMRRFs (AHR, 1.55 [95% CI, 0.93-2.58]). The interaction between the primary end point and the NMRRF category was significant (P for interaction = .003). Across all NMRRF groups, ablation did not reduce all-cause mortality (<3 NMRRFs: AHR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41-1.02] and >= 3 NMRRFs: AHR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.66-2.33]) but decreased AF recurrence (<3 NMRRFs: AHR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.40-0.52] and >= 3 NMRRFs: AHR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.69]) and improved quality of life throughout follow-up for symptom frequency (<3 NMRRFs: -1.63 [95% CI, -2.18 to -1.07] and >= 3 NMRRFs: -1.15 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.31]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this secondary analysis of the CABANA randomized clinical trial, the findings suggest that catheter ablation yielded significant cardiovascular benefits in patients with AF with fewer than 3 NMRRFs compared with drug therapy. This study lays the foundation for more personalized AF management, potentially optimizing resource allocation and influencing the direction of research and clinical practice in this field.

TI  - Psychotic symptoms in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and heart valve operation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Objective: Delirium on internal medicine and surgical wards of the general hospital is associated with several predisposing and precipitating factors as well as adverse outcomes. Whether psychosis, the symptom of delirium that may be recognized most promptly, is similarly associated with these factors and outcomes is largely unknown. Methods: Eight thousand one hundred and thirty-nine consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and/or heart valve operation were screened for preoperative predisposing factors and postoperative psychotic symptoms between January 1999 and July 2004. Data on per- and postoperative precipitating factors were collected in 4942 patients enrolled between January 2001 and July 2004. Data were examined using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios. Results: The rate of severe psychotic symptoms was 2.1 % (n = 168). Higher age, renal failure, dyspnoea, heart failure, and left ventricle hypertrophy were independent preoperative predisposing factors. Peroperative hypothermia (< 33 degrees C), hypoxemia, low hematocrit, renal failure, increased sodium, infection and stroke were independent precipitating factors. Psychotic symptoms were independently associated with a prolonged length of stay on the intensive care unit (odds ratio 7.8; 95% confidence interval 5.6-11), multi-organ failure or shock (3.2; 95% CI: 2.2-4.9), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (3.6; 95% CI: 2.1-6.2), and in-hospital death after surgery (2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4.1). Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms are independently associated with several chronic and peroperative problems (including mild hypothermia during surgery), closely resembling those for delirium (with and without psychotic symptoms). Psychotic symptoms are also independently associated with adverse outcomes. Prompt diagnostic and therapeutic intervention aimed at the underlying problem may improve outcomes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Cardiac arrest and hypothermia treatment-function and life satisfaction among survivors in the first 6 months
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: To describe differences over time in outcome, physical and cognitive function among survivors of cardiac arrest treated with hypothermia and to examine survivors' life satisfaction 6 months after cardiac arrest as well as gender differences.
   Methods: The study was prospective and included 45 cardiac arrest survivors admitted to three Swedish hospitals between 2008 and 2012. Participants were followed from intensive care unit discharge to one and six months after cardiac arrest. In addition to cerebral performance category (CPC), participants were asked to complete questionnaires regarding activities in daily life (Barthel index), cognitive function (mini mental state examination), and life satisfaction (LiSat-11).
   Results: Outcome measured using CPC scores improved over time. At 6 months, all participants were classified as having a good outcome. At one month, participants were impaired but improved over time in their activities in daily life and cognitive function. At 6 months satisfaction with "life as a whole" was seen in 70%.
   Conclusions: Cardiac arrest survivors are satisfied with life as a whole despite a severe illness that has impaired their physical and cognitive function, which seemed to improve over time. Predicting patients' functional outcome in early stages is difficult, and the CPC score alone is not sufficient to assess patients' function. It is a need to reach a consensus to which instruments best reflect physical and cognitive function as well as to specify a rehabilitation plan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Low dialysis potassium bath is associated with lower mortality in end-stage renal disease patients admitted to hospital with severe hyperkalemia
T2  - CLINICAL KIDNEY JOURNAL
AB  - Background. Hyperkalemia is a modifiable risk factor for sudden cardiac death, a leading cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The optimal treatment of hyperkalemia in hospitalized end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is nonexistent in literature, which has prompted studies from outpatient dialysis to be extrapolated to inpatient care. The goal of this study was to determine if low-potassium dialysate 1 mEq/L is associated with higher mortality in hospitalized ESRD patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium >6.5mmol/L).
   Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of all adult ESRD patients admitted with severe hyperkalemia between January 2011 and August 2016.
   Results. There were 209 ESRD patients on HD admitted with severe hyperkalemia during the study period. Mean serum potassium was 7.1mmol/L. In-hospital mortality or cardiac arrest in ESRD patients with severe hyperkalemia was 12.4%. Median time to dialysis after serum potassium result was 2.0h (25, 75 interquartile range 0.9, 4.2h). Totally, 47.4% of patients received dialysis with 1mEq/L concentration potassium bath. The use of 1mEq/L potassium bath was associated with significantly lower mortality or cardiac arrest in ESRD patients admitted with severe hyperkalemia (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.80, P=0.01).
   Conclusion. We conclude that use of 1mEq/L potassium bath for treatment of severe hyperkalemia (>6.5mmol/L) in hospitalized ESRD patients is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality or cardiac arrest.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Use of Public Access Defibrillation Systems: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Aim: This meta-analysis presented the impact of pandemic Coronavirus disease-2019 on the use of the public access defibrillation (PAD) system for adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases until January 2024 Results: This meta-analysis included 30 analyzed studies. Pooled analysis showed that activation of PAD among those two periods varied and amounted to 3.8% vs. 3.9%, respectively [odds ratio (OR)=0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66 to 0.89; p<0.001]. There were no statistically significant differences in defibrillation using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) when comparing the pandemic period with the prepandemic period (5.0% vs. 6.2%; OR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.07; p=0.12). Conclusion: The data indicate a substantial decrease in the activation of PAD during the pandemic. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant variations in the usage of shock using AEDs, suggesting that the use of AEDs remained similar to that in the pre-pandemic periods when they were available. It is essential to promote the usage of AEDs among bystanders and perform societal initiatives to achieve this objective.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of aggressive care for patients with nontraumatic coma
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - National Meeting of the Society-of-General-Internal-Medicine
AB  - Objective: To estimate the cost effectiveness of aggressive care for patients with nontraumatic coma.
   Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
   Setting: Five academic medical centers.
   Patients. Patients with nontraumatic coma enrolled in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT). Patients with reversible metabolic causes of coma such as diabetic ketoacidosis or uremia were excluded.
   Measurements. We calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of continuing aggressive care vs. withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and ventilatory support after day 3 of coma. We estimated life expectancy based on up to 4.6 yrs of follow-up. Utilities (quality-of-life weights) were estimated using time trade off questions. Costs were based on hospital fiscal data and Medicare data. Separate analyses were conducted for two prognostic groups based on five risk factors assessed on day 3 of coma: age :70 yrs, abnormal brain stem response, absent verbal response, absent withdrawal to pain, and serum creatinine greater than or equal to132.6 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL).
   Results: For the 596 patients studied, the median (25th, 75th percentile) age was 67 yrs (range, 55-77) and 52% were female. By 2 months after enrollment, 69% had died, 19% were severely disabled, 7% had survived without severe disability, and 4% had survived with unknown functional status. The incremental cost effectiveness of the more aggressive care strategy was $140,000 (1998 dollars) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for high-risk patients (3-5 risk factors, 93% 2-month mortality) and $87,000/ QALY for low-risk patients (0-2 risk factors, 49% mortality). In sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost per OALY did not fall below $50,000/QALY, even with wide variation in our baseline estimates.
   Conclusions: Continuing aggressive care after day 3 of non-traumatic coma is associated with a high cost per QALY gained, especially for patients at high risk for poor outcomes. Earlier decisions to withhold life-sustaining treatments for patients with very poor prognoses may yield considerable cost savings.

TI  - Cardiac rehabilitation outpatient therapy - the current stage
T2  - HERZ
AB  - In contrast to most industrial countries Germany provides inpatient cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction in specialized hospitals, before outpatient therapy is implemented. Within 30 years outpatient exercise therapy has successfully gained a degree of therapeutic importance comparable to medical treatment and interventional therapy. Each ambulatory cardiac patient is eligible for outpatient exercise therapy after qualified assessment by a cardiologist, following specific guidelines. Functional capacity is tested by treadmill or bicycle ergometry. Patients with no ventricular dilatation, no complicated arrhythmias and no signs of angina below 1.0 W/kg are assigned to controlled exercise groups, and above 1.0 W/kg to less limited training groups. Specially licensed therapists qualified in physical education develop programs for improvement of coordination, flexibility muscle strength and endurance.
   A major result of exercise therapy is the reduction of cardiac mortality during the first 3 years after myocardial infarction, according to meta-analyses of a number of randomized studies. Cardiovascular complications have decreased despite a growing number of involved patients with reduced left ventricular function. The rate of cardiac arrest is currently only 1 per 155 000 exercise sessions, and of cardiac death is 1 : 750 000. This is comparable to rates for sport activity by apparently healthy individuals.
   According to longitudinal studies, the success of this intervention was achieved by increases in the efficiency of heart work, the work capacity and the quality of life. The most relevant adaptations take place in skeletal muscles, rather than in the heart. Improved coronary blood perfusion was observed only in intensive, strictly controlled studies. Regular participation in general outpatient groups failed to show significant long-term influences on hypercholesterinemia, dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension, obesity or diabetes mellitus. An exception were patients with nearly normal cardiac function, when training programs including running were possible.
   The anaerobic threshold must be taken more into account, especially in those patients with a high exercise tolerance. The pulse limit derived at the threshold is an excellent parameter for monitoring endurance training and helps to avoid catecholamine increase.
   Although lower rehospitalization costs were found in patients taking part in outpatient therapy, most analyses showed only a small financial benefit.
   More recent investigations involving patients with chronic heart failure have shown clear benefits for improvement of reduced skeletal muscle function and the functional status of peripheral arterioles. Outpatient therapy for these patients was carried out only under strict supervision during exercise and with frequent cardiologic controls.
   New trends for cardiac therapy include muscle training controlled by isokinetic devices. Patients with an exercise tolerance of more than 1.5 W/kg body weight may participate in swim therapy, and may engage in some game activities with-with confirmed positive effects on economy of movement, work capacity and quality of life. Additional therapeutic steps need to be taken to effectively reduce cardiovascular risk factors. out constant medical surveillance. Further therapeutic possibilities include yoga or other beneficial relaxation methods designed to improve life style. Cardiac outpatient therapy can now be regarded as a safe method for secondary prevention

TI  - Risk Prediction in Male Adolescents With Congenital Long QT Syndrome: Implications for Sex-Specific Risk Stratification in Potassium Channel-Mediated Long QT Syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex-specific risk management may improve outcomes in congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). We recently developed a prediction score for cardiac events (CEs) and life-threatening events (LTEs) in postadolescent women with LQTS. In the present study, we aimed to develop personalized risk estimates for the burden of CEs and LTEs in male adolescents with potassium channel-mediated LQTS.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: The prognostic model was derived from the LQTS Registry headquartered in Rochester, NY, comprising 611 LQT1 or LQT2 male adolescents from age 10 through 20 years, using the following variables: genotype/mutation location, QTc-specific thresholds, history of syncope, and beta-blocker therapy. Anderson-Gill modeling was performed for the end point of CE burden (total number of syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, and appropriate defibrillator shocks). The applicability of the CE prediction model was tested for the end point of the first LTE (excluding syncope and adding sudden cardiac death) using Cox modeling. A total of 270 CEs occurred during follow-up. The genotype-phenotype risk prediction model identified low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, comprising 74%, 14%, and 12% of the study population, respectively. Compared with the low-risk group, high-risk male subjects experienced a pronounced 5.2-fold increased risk of recurrent CEs (P<0.001), whereas intermediate-risk patients had a 2.1-fold (P=0.004) increased risk. At age 20 years, the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk adolescent male patients had on average 0.3, 0.6, and 1.4 CEs per person, respectively. Corresponding 10-year adjusted probabilities for a first LTE were 2%, 6%, and 8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Personalized genotype-phenotype risk estimates can be used to guide sex-specific management in male adolescents with potassium channel-mediated LQTS.

TI  - Surgical unroofing of hemodynamically significant myocardial bridges in a pediatric population
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
CP  - 97th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-Thoracic-Surgery
AB  - Background: Although myocardial bridges (MBs) are traditionally regarded as incidental findings, it has been reported that adult patients with symptomatic MBs refractory to medical therapy benefit from unroofing. However, there is limited literature in the pediatric population. The aim of our study was to evaluate the indications and outcomes for unroofing in pediatric patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients with MB in our institution who underwent surgical relief. Clinical characteristics, relevant diagnostic data, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated.
   Results: Between 2012 and 2016, 14 pediatric patients underwent surgical unroofing of left anterior descending artery MBs. Thirteen patients had anginal symptoms refractory to medical therapy, and 1 patient was asymptomatic until experiencing aborted sudden cardiac arrest during exercise. Thirteen patients underwent exercise stress echocardiography, all of which showed mid-septal dyssynergy. Coronary computed tomography imaging confirmed the presence of MBs in all patients. Intravascular ultrasound imaging confirmed the length of MBs: 28.2 +/- 16.3 mm, halo thickness: 0.59 +/- 0.24 mm, and compression of left anterior descending artery at resting heart rate: 33.0 +/- 11.6%. Invasive hemodynamic assessment with dobutamine confirmed the physiologic significance of the MBs with diastolic fractional flow reserve: 0.59 +/- 0.13. Unroofing was performed with the patient under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in the initial 9 cases and without CPB in the subsequent 5 cases. All patients were discharged without complications. The 13 symptomatic patients reported resolution of symptoms on follow-up, and improvement in symptoms and quality of life was documented using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire version 7.
   Conclusions: Unroofing of MBs can be safely performed in pediatric patients, with or without use of CPB. In symptomatic patients, unroofing can provide relief of symptoms refractory to medical therapy.

TI  - Association of Cardiovascular Health With Subclinical Disease and Incident Events: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background-Few adults have ideal cardiovascular health (CVH). We studied associations of an overall CVH score with subclinical cardiovascular disease and events. We assessed whether associations varied by race/ethnicity.
   Methods and Results-Among 5961 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, components of CVH were measured at baseline, 2000-2002: systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, smoking, physical activity, diet, and body mass index. Levels were classified as ideal (2 points), intermediate (1 point), and poor (0 points) according to American Heart Association definitions. Points were summed to produce a CVH score (0-7 low, 8-11 moderate, 12-14 high). Coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness, and left ventricular mass were measured at baseline. Cardiovascular disease was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke, heart failure, or peripheral artery disease. Follow-up was 10.3 years. Regression models were used to examine associations of the CVH score with subclinical disease and events, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity. Adults with high or moderate CVH scores had significantly lower odds of coronary artery calcium and lower carotid intima-media thickness and left ventricular mass than adults with low CVH scores. Adults with high or moderate CVH scores were 67% (95% CI 41% to 82%) and 37% (95% CI 22% to 49%) less likely, respectively, to experience a cardiovascular disease event than adults with low scores. There was no interaction with race/ethnicity.
   Conclusions-There is a graded inverse association between CVH scores and measures of subclinical and overt cardiovascular disease that is similar across race/ethnic groups.

TI  - Ablation versus drug therapy in atrial fibrillation patients with or without prior Pharmacological or direct current cardioversion: results from the CABANA trial
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background Catheter ablation is superior to drug therapy in selected atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, yet the impact of prior non-ablation rhythm control remains unclear. Methods We analyzed data from Catheter Ablation vs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial, which assessed whether catheter ablation was more effective than drugs for improving outcomes in AF patients, including paroxysmal, persistent and long-standing persistent AF. In this study, patients were stratified by whether they had pharmacological or direct current cardioversion (P/DCCV) before randomization. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest.The secondary outcomes included all-cause death, death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiovascular death, AF recurrence and composite of all-cause death, stroke, or cardiovascular hospitalization. Results In CABANA trial, 1,035 (47.0%) had a history of P/DCCV.The effect of catheter ablation on primary outcome did not differ significantly between patients with prior P/DCCV and those without (HR = 1.00, 95%CI [0.66-1.51] and HR = 0.68, 95%CI [0.45-1.03], respectively). For the secondary outcome of death or cardiovascular hospitalization, catheter ablation reduced risk in both groups, with a greater effect observed in patients with prior P/DCCV (HR = 0.72, 95%CI [0.61-0.85] vs. HR = 0.91, 95%CI [0.78-1.07], respectively; P for interaction = 0.032). Ablation also significantly reduced AF recurrence in both groups and improved AF-related quality of life over 60 months of follow-up. Conclusion In this post-hoc analysis of the CABANA trial, catheter ablation was associated with greater benefit in reducing the composite outcome of death or cardiovascular hospitalization among patients with prior P/DCCV.

TI  - Characteristics and outcomes of nonagenarians admitted to the intensive care unit: A single-centre observational study
T2  - ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - There is limited data regarding the mortality risk factors for Australian nonagenarians requiring intensive care unit admission. The objectives of the study were to determine the mortality rates, length of stay, and indicators of poor outcomes in nonagenarian patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Data were retrospectively collected from a single-centre university hospital in Australia over a 10-year period. Cox regression survival analysis, hazard ratios (HRs) and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess characteristics and associated survival. A total of 25,766 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit during the study period, of whom 89 (0.35%) were nonagenarians. The intensive care unit and hospital mortality rates of nonagenarians were 10.1% and 22.5%, respectively. The Australian and New Zealand risk of death model was the most significant predictor of mortality among the risk scoring systems. Nonagenarians who experienced a cardiac arrest had the highest hazard of death in the intensive care unit (HR 7.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 38.66, P = 0.015) and throughout their hospital admission (HR 6.77, 95% CI 1.52 to 30.28, P = 0.012). Acute renal failure and invasive ventilation had a significantly increased hazard of death in the intensive care unit and hospital admission. Lactate levels also demonstrated a significant increase in the hazard of death per 1 mmol/l increase (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.08, P < 0.001). Over the study follow-up period of a minimum of 3.5 years, 50 of 89 patients (56.2%) died. Intensive care unit and hospital mortality among nonagenarians admitted to the intensive care unit was relatively low. These findings support early identification of mortality risk factors, allowing for the timely implementation or withdrawal of interventions.

TI  - REDUCTION IN DEFIBRILLATOR SHOCKS WITH AN IMPLANTABLE DEVICE COMBINING ANTITACHYCARDIA PACING AND SHOCK THERAPY
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Implantable defibrillators reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, but significant restriction in quality of life can occur as a result of frequent device activation. To determine if a device that provides both antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy can safely reduce the frequency of shocks after implantation, 46 consecutive patients undergoing initial implantation of a defibrillator were studied. In all patients, the implanted device provided antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy. Detected tachycardia characteristics and the results of therapy were stored in the device's memory.
   There were 42 men and 4 women, aged 26 to 71 years (mean 58.7 +/- 13.5). Left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 13% to 67% (mean 32.2 +/- 13.4%) and 31 patients had experienced one or more episodes of cardiac arrest. Induced arrhythmias included sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 38 patients, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 2 and ventricular fibrillation in 4.
   Over a total follow-up period of 255 patient-months (range 1 to 13, mean 6.1), 25 patients experienced spontaneous arrhythmic events. In 22 patients, 909 episodes of tachycardia were treated by antitachycardia pacing, which was successful on 840 occasions (92.4%). Acceleration of ventricular tachycardia by pacing therapy was estimated to have occurred 39 times. Syncope occurred once during pacing-induced acceleration of ventricular tachycardia. Forty-four episodes of tachycardia in seven patients were treated directly by shocks because of short tachycardia cycle length; 88% of all detected tachycardias were treated without the need for shocks. Four patients died from cardiorespiratory failure and one patient died suddenly without any detected tachyarrhythmia.
   These initial results demonstrate that a device that provides graded therapy with antitachycardia pacing for ventricular arrhythmias reduces the need for high energy shocks and rarely results in detrimental delays in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia.

TI  - Preventing Lower Limb Amputations in Patients Suffering from Diabetic Foot Syndrome and Peripheral Vascular Disease - Opportunities and Limitations
T2  - HANDCHIRURGIE MIKROCHIRURGIE PLASTISCHE CHIRURGIE
AB  - Background: The number of patients suffering from a diabetic foot syndrome is increasing. In many cases large plantar or heel defects can only be reconstructed by using a free flap. The free parascapular flap is an alternative to free muscle flaps in the reconstruction of plantar or heel defects. Donor site morbidity is low. Autologous bypass reconstruction or an angioplasty can increase extremity perfusion.
   Patients and Operations: 52 patients with a diabetic foot syndrome have been reconstructed since 2007. 23 of them required a free tissue transfer. On average these patients were 68.7 years of age. A parascapular flap was used in 15 cases, a latissimus dorsi flap with a skin graft in 4 cases, a gracilis muscle flap with a skin graft in 3 cases. In one case a free instep flap of the contralateral foot, which had to be amputated, was used. In 13 cases the flap was anastomosed to the autologous bypass, in one case an AV loop was used.
   Results: 22 flaps healed primarily. Only 1 patient was not able to walk at discharge. There was one flap loss. 4 patients required an amputation later on due to bypass failure or infection. 2 patients died due to cardiac arrest at the rehabilitation clinic.
   Conclusion: If the correct indication is met, free flaps can prevent diabetes-derived amputations of the lower limb. The parascapular flap can be used for plantar and heel defects. Flap harvesting is quick due to the constant vascular anatomy. The donor site morbidity is low. Reconstruction requires revascularisation in an interdisciplinary setting including vascular surgeons and radiologists. Limb salvage reduces mortality and improves quality of life. Revascularisation and reconstruction should best be done in a single surgical procedure.

TI  - LEFT-VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM WITH PREDOMINATING CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF MEDICAL AND SURGICAL-TREATMENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - From 1979 to 1985, 109 patients were treated for congestive heart failure caused by postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm. Congestive heart failure was predominant in all patients at the time of diagnosis, 73% of whom were in Functional Class III or IV. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure averaged 23.8 .+-. 0.8 mm Hg (mean .+-. standard error of the mean), total ejection fraction 29.7% .+-. 1.0%, and telediastolic volume of the aneurysm 76.2 .+-. 5.8 ml. Aneurysmectomy was performed in 49  patients (45%), whereas the remaining 60 patients were treated medically. The two groups did not differ in regard to clinical and hemodynamic data on admission, except for a more extensive coronary artery disease in the surgical group. Follow-up was obtained fro all patients (100%) and averaged 48 .+-. 3 months. Actuarial survival curves were similar, and the 5-year survival rates for surgical and medical groups were 70 .+-. 7% and 64% .+-. 7%, respectively (not significant). However, the 5-year complication-free rate was significantly (p = 0.05) higher among surgical patients (52% .+-. 8%) than among the medical group (31% .+-. 7%). Multivariate analysis showed the following variables to influence survival independently (p < 0.05): contractile segment ejection fraction, right ventricular failure, antecedents of cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock, and corrected contractile score. Independent variables decreasing the risk of cardiac-related complications and death (p < 0.05) were as follows: surgical treatment, shorter interval between initial infarction and diagnosis of aneurysm, and absence of right ventricular failure. Functional improvement was directly related to surgical treatment and to residual segment contractile score (p < 0.05). Thus, in patients with congestive heart failure caused by left ventricular aneurysm, surgical treatment improved the quality of life and prognosis for cardiac-related complications, but did not increase overall survival, compared to  medical management of similar patients.

TI  - THE USE OF EPINEPHRINE FOR OUT-OF-HOSPITAL TREATMENT OF ANAPHYLAXIS: RESOURCE DOCUMENT FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EMS PHYSICIANS POSITION STATEMENT
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires both prompt recognition and treatment with epinephrine. All levels of emergency medical services (EMS) providers, with appropriate physician oversight, should be able to carry and properly administer epinephrine safely when caring for patients with anaphylaxis. EMS systems and EMS medical directors should develop a mechanism to review the charts of patients who received epinephrine and were not in cardiac arrest. This will help to ensure the safe and appropriate use of epinephrine in order to provide continued quality improvement. Despite the safety of epinephrine, EMS systems that carry epinephrine autoinjectors should establish protocols to deal with patients or emergency responders who have an unintentional injection of epinephrine into the hand or digit. Continued research is needed to better define the role that EMS plays in the management of anaphylaxis. This paper serves as a resource document to the National Association of EMS Physician position on the use of epinephrine for the out-of-hospital treatment of anaphylaxis.

TI  - Protocolized REDUction of Non-Resuscitation Fluids in SEptic Shock Patients. A Protocol for the REDUSE Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - In septic shock, administration of large fluid volumes is associated with poor outcomes. Recent evidence shows that non-resuscitation fluids are the major modifiable source of fluids for patients with septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs). This clinical trial is designed to test the hypothesis that restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids improves outcomes compared to usual care. Adult patients admitted to ICUs with septic shock will be randomly assigned within 12 h of admission to receive protocolized restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids or usual care. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes are complications during ICU stay up to 90 days (defined as any acute kidney injury or cerebral, coronary, intestinal, or limb ischemia), mechanical ventilation free days within 90 days, and for survivors cognitive function (by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA-BLIND]) and Health-Related Quality of Life (by the EQ Visual Analogue Scale [EQ-VAS]), both at 6 months. In addition, the climate impact of the interventions will be assessed. To detect an absolute reduction in mortality of 7.5%, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 90%, we aim to include 1850 patients. The trial is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Results of primary and secondary clinical outcomes and the environmental outcome will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.Trial Registration: NCT06140147.

TI  - Current summary of the evidence in drone-based emergency medical services care
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Interventions for many medical emergencies including cardiac arrests, strokes, drug overdoses, seizures, and trauma, are critically time-dependent, with faster intervention leading to improved patient outcomes. Consequently, a major focus of emergency medical services (EMS) systems and pre -hospital medicine has been improving the time until medical intervention in these time-sensitive emergencies, often by reducing the time required to deliver critical medical supplies to the scene of the emergency. Medical indications for using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are rapidly expanding, including the delivery of time-sensitive medical supplies. To date, the drone-based delivery of a variety of time-critical medical supplies has been evaluated, generating promising data suggesting that drones can improve the time interval to intervention through the rapid delivery of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), naloxone, antiepileptics, and blood products. Furthermore, the improvement in the time until intervention offered by drones in out-of-hospital emergencies is likely to improve patient outcomes in time-dependent medical emergencies. However, barriers and knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed. Further research demonstrating functionality in real-world scenarios, as well as research that integrates drones into the existing EMS structure will be necessary before drones can reach their full potential. The primary aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence in drone-based Emergency Medical Services Care to help identify future research directions.

TI  - Management of traumatic hemipelvectomy: an institutional experience on four consecutive cases
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background and objective: The incidence of traumatic hemipelvectomy is rare, but it is a devastating injury. Recently, an increasing number of patients with traumatic hemipelvectomy are admitted to trauma centers alive due to improvements of the pre-hospital care. Successful management requires prompt recognition of the nature of this injury and meticulous surgical technique. We present our successful experiences on four cases of traumatic hemipelvectomy in the past nine years.
   Patients and methods: Four cases with traumatic hemipelvectomy were admited to our hospital from June 21, 2002 to September 3, 2011. All injuries occurred due to vehicle accident and all patients were in a state of severe hypotension, with two of them having anal lacerations. These four cases were treated immediately with resuscitation, control of hemorrhage, early amputation, repeated debridement and closure of the wounds. An angiographic embolization was given to control hemorrhage in two of the cases preoperatively. One case underwent fecal diversion. Wound infection occurred in all of cases which was successfully controlled by repeated debridements, effective anti-biotic regimen, split-thickness skin grafts.
   Results: All four cases were saved successfully with well-healed wounds during follow up from 1 to 7 years. They were able to walk by themself using crutches.
   Conclusion: Adhering to the surgery principles of damage control including appropriate resuscitation, hemorrhage control, coagulopathy correction and multiple debridements and closure of the wounds in reasonable period of time can save the life of cases suffering from severe pelvic ring injury.

TI  - Early Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Inotropes - A Randomised Controlled Pilot Study in the Emergency Department (RESPOND ED): Study Protocol and Analysis Plan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Introduction: Septic shock in children still carries substantial mortality and morbidity. While resuscitation with 40-60 mL/kg intravenous fluid boluses remains a cornerstone of initial resuscitation, an increasing body of evidence indicates potential for harm related to high volume fluid administration. We hypothesize that a protocol on early use of inotropes in children with septic shock is feasible and will lead to less fluid bolus use compared to standard fluid resuscitation. Here, we describe the protocol of the Early Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Inotropes - A Randomised Controlled Pilot Study in the Emergency Department (RESPOND ED).
   Methods and analysis: The RESPOND ED study is an open label randomised controlled, two arm, multicentre pilot study conducted at four specialised paediatric Emergency Departments. Forty children aged between 28 days and 18 years treated for presumed septic shock will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to early inotropes vs. standard fluid resuscitation. Early inotrope treatment is defined as the commencement of a continuous intravenous adrenaline infusion after 20 mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation. Standard fluid resuscitation is defined as delivery of 40 to 60 mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation prior to commencement of inotropes. In addition to feasibility outcomes, survival free of organ dysfunction censored at 28 days will be assessed as the main clinical outcome. The study cohort will be followed up at 28 days, and at 6 months post enrolment to assess quality of life and functional status. Biobanking nested in the study cohort will be performed to enable ancillary biomarker studies.
   Ethics and dissemination: The trial has ethical clearance (Children's Health Queensland, Brisbane, HREC/18/QCHQ/49168) and is registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000828123). Enrolment commenced on July 21st, 2019. The primary manuscript will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Stent thrombosis: An increased adverse event after angioplasty following resuscitated cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The leading cause of sudden cardiac death is myocardial ischemia. As for uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI), international guidelines plead for early coronary angiography with, in case of culprit lesion, angioplasty and stent implantation. However after cardiac arrest (CA), shock, hypothermia and changes in antiplatelet pharmacokinetic may promote stent thrombosis (ST). Incidence of ST in this situation has never been studied.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate incidence and determinants of ST after ischemic CA successfully revascularized.
   Methods: We analyzed 208 consecutive patients admitted in our institution for AMI and who underwent PCI with stent implantation. Among these patients, 55 presented a resuscitated CA and were compared to 153 without CA (control group). All patients in the CA group received hypothermia (33 degrees C for 24 h) following resuscitation and PCI.
   Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups for age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, coronary lesions and type of stent. In the CA group, patients were less frequently pre-treated with heparin (50.9% vs 98.7%, p < 0.001) and aspirin (52.7% vs 99%, p < 0.001). In the CA group, we observed a significantly higher incidence of confirmed acute or subacute ST than in the control group: 10.9% vs 2.0% (p = 0.01). None of CA patients had received a dual antiplatelets therapy (0% vs 99%). LVEF at admission was lower in the CA group (40.3% vs 48%; p < 0.001), and shock was more frequent (83.6% vs 8.5%; p < 0.001). Survival at 28 days was 50.1% in CA group vs 98.0% (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, CA before stenting appears to be an independent risk factor for confirmed ST (OR = 12.9; 95% CI 1.3-124.6; p = 0.027).
   Conclusion: In CA patients treated with cooling, stenting for AMI is associated with a high risk of ST. Shock, insufficient antithrombotic treatment, pharmacokinetic changes related to hypothermia may contribute to this higher risk. A strategy aiming to reduce this complication may probably improve prognosis of patients who underwent coronary sudden death. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - An alternative metric for evaluating the potential patient benefit of response-adaptive randomization procedures
T2  - BIOMETRICS
AB  - When planning a two-arm group sequential clinical trial with a binary primary outcome that has severe implications for quality of life (e.g., mortality), investigators may strive to find the design that maximizes in-trial patient benefit. In such cases, Bayesian response-adaptive randomization (BRAR) is often considered because it can alter the allocation ratio throughout the trial in favor of the treatment that is currently performing better. Although previous studies have recommended using fixed randomization over BRAR based on patient benefit metrics calculated from the realized trial sample size, these previous comparisons have been limited by failures to hold type I and II error rates constant across designs or consider the impacts on all individuals directly affected by the design choice. In this paper, we propose a metric for comparing designs with the same type I and II error rates that reflects expected outcomes among individuals who would participate in the trial if enrollment is open when they become eligible. We demonstrate how to use the proposed metric to guide the choice of design in the context of two recent trials in persons suffering out of hospital cardiac arrest. Using computer simulation, we demonstrate that various implementations of group sequential BRAR offer modest improvements with respect to the proposed metric relative to conventional group sequential monitoring alone.

TI  - Establishment of SEP-1 national practice guidelines does not impact fluid administration for septic shock patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background : The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced the Early Management Bundle, Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock (SEP-1) as a national quality measure in October 2015. The purpose of SEP-1 is to facilitate the efficient, effective, and timely delivery of high-quality care to patients presenting along the spectrumof sepsis severity.
   Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether provider practice surrounding emergency department (ED) fluid management of suspected septic shock patients was impacted by SEP-1.
   Methods: The study was a retrospective observational analysis of 470,558 patient encounters at an urban academic center over a five-year period. The sample of suspected septic shock patients was defined by the following: blood cultures collected, antibiotics administered, and vasopressors initiated. Participants were divided into two cohorts based on date of presentation (Pre-SEP-1: May 1, 2013,- August 30, 2015, and Post-SEP-1: November 1, 2015,- February 28, 2018). The primary outcomewas classified as a dichotomous variable based on whether the total volume of fluids administered equaled or exceeded the calculated weight-based (>= 30 cc/kg) goal. Segmented logistic regression analyses were used to assess the immediate impact of SEP-1 as well as to compare the long-term trend of fluid volume administered between Pre-SEP-1 and Post-SEP-1 cohorts.
   Results: A total of 413 and 482 septic shock patients were included in the Pre-SEP-1 and Post-SEP-1 cohorts, respectively. There was no statistically significant change in weight-based fluid management between the cohorts. The odds of compliance with the weight-based goal decreased 22% immediately following dissemination of SEP-1, however, this was not statistically significant (log-odds=-0.25, p= 0.41). A positive trend in compliance was observed during both the Pre-SEP-1 and Post-SEP-1 periods with odds ratios increasing 0.005 and 0.018 each month, respectively, however, these findings were not statistically significant (log-odds= 0.005, p= 0.736, and log-odds = 0.018, p = 0.10, respectively).
   Conclusions: Overall, there were no clinically or statistically meaningful changes in fluid volume resuscitation strategies for suspected septic shock patients following SEP-1. Broad mandates may not be effective tools for promoting practice change in the ED setting. Further research investigating barrier to changes in practice patterns surrounding fluid administration and other SEP-1 bundle elements is warranted.

TI  - Microvolt T-wave alternans distinguishes between patients likely and patients not likely to benefit from implanted cardiac defibrillator therapy - A solution to the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) II conundrum
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background - In 2003, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services recommended QRS duration as a means to identify MADIT II-like patients suitable for implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD) therapy. We compared the ability of microvolt T-wave alternans and QRS duration to identify groups at high and low risk of dying among heart failure patients who met MADIT II criteria for ICD prophylaxis.
   Methods and Results - Patients with MADIT II characteristics and sinus rhythm had a microvolt T-wave alternans exercise test and a 12-lead ECG. Our primary end point was 2-year all-cause mortality. Of 177 MADIT II - like patients, 32% had a QRS duration > 120 ms, and 68% had an abnormal ( positive or indeterminate) microvolt T-wave alternans test. During an average follow-up of 20 +/- 6 months, 20 patients died. We compared patients with an abnormal microvolt T-wave alternans test to those with a normal ( negative) test, and patients with a QRS > 120 ms with those with a QRS less than or equal to 120 ms; the hazard ratios for 2-year mortality were 4.8 ( P = 0.020) and 1.5 ( P = 0.367), respectively. The actuarial mortality rate was substantially lower among patients with a normal microvolt T-wave alternans test (3.8%; 95% confidence interval: 0, 9.0) than the mortality rate in patients with a narrow QRS (12.0%; 95% confidence interval: 5.6, 18.5). The corresponding false-negative rates are 3.5% and 10.2%, respectively.
   Conclusion - Among MADIT II - like patients, a microvolt T-wave alternans test is better than QRS duration at identifying a high-risk group and also better at identifying a low-risk group unlikely to benefit from ICD therapy.

TI  - Evaluating Traditional Prognostic Measures in Patients Undergoing Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Therapeutic hypothermia is one of the few interventions that improve mortality and neurologic outcomes in patients who have experienced cardiac arrest. There is a lack of validated tools to predict survival in patients who have undergone hypothermia after cardiac arrest (HACA).
   Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients who underwent HACA at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center (ASLMC) since the protocol was implemented in September 2008. Initial rhythm, whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, lactate levels, duration of resuscitation, and APACHE II scores were compared for survivors and non-survivors, and a logit binary regression model was constructed.
   Results: A total of 143 patients were identified and had data abstracted. APACHE-II, duration of resuscitation, and initial rhythm were all strongly correlated with survival. Initial serum lactate levels were higher in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.005), though the trend of lactate change at next draw was not predictive. Quantitative TnI was not significantly different between arms.
   Conclusion: Lactate levels show promise as a biomarker for survival in HACA patients resuscitation length, presence of PCI, and APACHE-II scores can provide good prognostic information, even in the early hours following a resuscitation event.

TI  - Effects of adding links to "the chain of survival" for prehospital cardiac arrest: A contrast in outcomes in 1975 and 1995 at a single institution
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Academic-Emergency-Medicine
AB  - Study objective: The concept of a "chain of survival" to improve outcome from prehospital cardiac arrest has been defined and promulgated over the last two decades. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of prehospital cardiac arrest in 1975 and 1995 at a single institution.
   Methods: This longitudinal, before-after study compares published data collected at our municipal, tertiary care in 1974-1975 with data collected prospectively in 1995. The 1975 study group served as control subjects (n=120). We enrolled an equal number of consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria in the 1995 cohort (consecutive patients who experienced prehospital arrest and who received prehospital Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) measures during the two study periods). Patients younger than 18 years or with posttraumatic arrest were excluded. Between 1975 and 1995 the following "links" in the "chain of survival" were added to the prehospital care system: (1)911 access and dispatch, (2) paramedic endotracheal intubation, (3) EMT automated defibrillation, (4) standing out-of-hospital orders before hospital radiotelemetry contact, and (5) introduction of American Heart Association ACLS algorithms.
   Results: The following significant differences (chi(2)) were observed between the study periods: prevalence of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (42% in 1975 versus 28% in 1995, P=.021), prevalence of asystole or pulseless electrical activity as the first documented rhythm (58% versus 72%, P=.021), survival to hospital discharge (22% versus 9%, P=.007), and percent of survivors of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (30% versus 0%, P=.004). Eighty-six percent of the 1995 cohort had advanced chronic disease and 29% experienced cardiopulmonary arrest in a nursing home.
   Conclusion: Survival decreased dramatically during the 20-year study period. This may be because of the high incidence of chronic disease, the greater frequency of asystole and pulseless electrical activity, and the inclusion of patients with "end-of-life" arrests in which ACLS protocol was initiated in the 1995 cohort. The patient population in which ACLS is initiated is the weakest link in the "chain of survival."

TI  - A program encouraging early defibrillation results in improved in-hospital resuscitation efficacy
T2  - JACC-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine whether survival to discharge after in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest could be improved by a program encouraging early defibrillation that included switching from monophasic to biphasic devices.
   BACKGROUND In-hospital resuscitation continues to have a low success rate. Biphasic waveform devices have demonstrated characteristics that might improve survival, and outside the hospital, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have shown promise in improving survival of patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrest.
   METHODS A program including education and replacement of all manual monophasic defibrillators with a combination of manual biphasic defibrillators used in AED mode and AEDs in all outpatient clinics and chronic care units was implemented.
   RESULTS With program implementation, the percentage survival of all patients with resuscitation events improved 2.6-fold, from 4.9% to 12.8%. Factors independently predicting survival included event location outside an intensive care unit, younger age, an initial rhythm of pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), pre-arrest beta-blocker, and program initiation. The outcome was independent of gender, race, work shift, number of previous resuscitation attempts, body mass index, comorbidity index, presence of diabetes, presence of hypertension, or use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The improvement in mortality was attributable solely to an effect on patients presenting with VT/VF. Patients with these initial rhythms were 14-fold (odds ratio = 0.07 of death, confidence interval = 0.02 to 0.3) more likely to survive to discharge after program initiation. Automated external defibrillators performed similarly to biphasic manual defibrillators in AED mode.
   CONCLUSIONS A program including education and use of biphasic manual defibrillators in AED mode and selective use of AEDs improved survival to discharge in hospitalized patients suffering from cardiopulmonary arrest. (C) 2004 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

TI  - A report of heat stroke in two Nigerian siblings
T2  - NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Infants and children are at higher risk of heat stroke for several reasons. We report these cases to highlight the danger of leaving children unsupervised in vehicles, aid prompt diagnosis, and management of heat stroke. Two Nigerian siblings aged ranges 5 and 3 years old, were trapped inside an unlocked vehicle and subsequently developed heat stroke. Both children presented with hyperthermia, severe dehydration, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. One of them also had hematuria. They were treated by spraying water onto their bodies to bring down the temperature, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen therapy, and anticonvulsants. Both eventually recovered and were discharged with no obvious neurologic sequalae, but are being followed-up.

TI  - Mimicking Native Liver Lobule Microarchitecture In Vitro with Parenchymal and Non-parenchymal Cells Using 3D Bioprinting for Drug Toxicity and Drug Screening Applications
T2  - ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB  - Bioengineering an in vitro liver model recapitulating the native liver microarchitecture consisting of parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells is crucial in achieving cellular crosstalk and hepatic metabolic functions for accurate hepatotoxicity prediction. Bioprinting holds the promise of engineering constructs with precise control over the spatial distribution of multiple cells. Two distinct tissue-specific liver extracellular matrix (ECM)-based bioinks with excellent printability and rheological attributes are formulated for supporting parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. A physiologically relevant human vascularized liver model is bioprinted with a novel liver ECM-based bioink laden with human adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and human hepatic stellate cells (HHSCs) using an extrusion-based bioprinting approach and validated for hepatotoxicity assessment. The HLC/HUVEC/HHSC-laden liver model resembles native alternate cords of hepatocytes with a functional sinusoidal lumen-like network in both horizontal and vertical directions, demonstrating enhanced albumin production, urea synthesis, and cytochrome P450 (CPR) activity. Furthermore, the liver model is evaluated for drug toxicity assessment following 24 h exposure to different concentrations of (i) non-hepatotoxicants aspirin and dexamethasone, (ii) idiosyncratic hepatotoxicant trovafloxacin mesylate, and (iii) clinical hepatotoxicant acetaminophen and troglitazone. A follow-up cell viability and metabolic competence evaluation by estimating DNA concentration, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and CPR activity revealed a dose-dependent clinically relevant hepatotoxic response. These results corroborated that the developed clinically relevant vascularized liver model is affordable and would aid pharmaceutical companies in speeding up the drug development and provide a robust platform for hepatotoxicity screening.

TI  - Role of artificial intelligence in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB  - Being an extremely high mortality rate condition, cardiac arrest cases have rightfully been evaluated via various studies and scoring factors for effective resuscitative practices and neurological outcomes postresuscitation. This narrative review aims to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting neurological outcomes postcardiac resuscitation. The methodology involved a detailed review of all relevant recent studies of AI, different machine learning algorithms, prediction tools, and assessing their benefit in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases as compared to more traditional prognostic scoring systems and tools. Previously, outcome determining clinical, blood, and radiological factors were prone to other influencing factors like limited accuracy and time constraints. Studies conducted also emphasized that to predict poor neurological outcomes, a more multimodal approach helped adjust for confounding factors, interpret diverse datasets, and provide a reliable prognosis, which only demonstrates the need for AI to help overcome challenges faced. Advanced machine learning algorithms like artificial neural networks (ANN) using supervised learning by AI have improved the accuracy of prognostic models outperforming conventional models. Several real-world cases of effective AI-powered algorithm models have been cited here. Studies comparing machine learning tools like XGBoost, AI Watson, hyperspectral imaging, ChatGPT-4, and AI-based gradient boosting have noted their beneficial uses. AI could help reduce workload, healthcare costs, and help personalize care, process vast genetic and lifestyle data and help reduce side effects from treatments. Limitations of AI have been covered extensively in this article, including data quality, bias, privacy issues, and transparency. Our objectives should be to use more diverse data sources, use interpretable data output giving process explanation, validation method, and implement policies to safeguard patient data. Despite the limitations, the advancements already made by AI and its potential in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases has been quite promising and boosts a continually improving system, albeit requiring close human supervision with training and improving models, with plans to educate clinicians, the public and sharing collected data.

TI  - Evaluating paramedic comfort with field pronouncement: Development and validation of an outcome measure
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
CP  - Annual Meeting of the National-Association-of-EMS-Physicians
AB  - Objectives: Interventions designed to improve cardiac resuscitation and the quality of field pronouncement need to consider outcomes on paramedic providers. The authors developed and evaluated the reliability and validity of a survey instrument measuring paramedic comfort with field pronouncement. Methods: A mail survey of 120 paramedics (EMT-Ps) was performed using the Modified Dillman survey methodology. Questions were sorted for analysis into subgroups assessing psychological comfort and technical skills. Sixty-five respondents were retested within two weeks. Results: The overall response rate was 96% (115). Respondents had an average age of 36 years (SD +/- 5), with 5.2 years (SD +/- 3.8) of out-of-hospital experience as an EMT-P, and were involved in a median of ten field pronouncements annually (range = 2-60). The face and content validity of the survey instrument was consistent with a content matrix derived by a focus group. The Cronbach's alpha for the survey instrument was 0.91. The retest response rate was 76% (46). The test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.84. Conclusions: This survey is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the paramedic psychological comfort with field pronouncement. The high response rate and intrareliability support its generalizability. This outcome measure may be helpful in evaluating the psychological impact of changes to emergency medical services (EMS) policy with respect to termination of resuscitation promoted by the National Association of EMS Physicians.

TI  - Comparison of three cognitive exams in cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Cognitive deficits may detract from quality of life after cardiac arrest. Their pattern and prevalence are not well documented. We used the Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and the 41 Cent Test (41CT) to assess cognitive impairment in cardiac arrest survivors and examine the exams' diagnostic accuracy. We hypothesized that the scores of these exams would indicate the presence of cognitive impairment in arrest survivors, that the overall scores on the three study assessments would correlate with one another, and that the 41CT, MOCA, and executive function element of the CAMCI would vary independently from other non-executive CAMCI components, reflecting executive function impairment after cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Four researchers administered the CAMCI, MOCA, and/or the 41CT to cardiac arrest survivors after discharge from the intensive care unit between 2010 and 2015. Physicians screened patients with the Mini-Mental State Exam to determine when this cognitive testing was feasible, generally when the patient was able to score 20-25 points on the MMSE. We performed pairwise correlations between the different subscales' and tests' scores.
   Results: One hundred and fourteen participants completed the CAMCI, of which 38 (33.3%) participants additionally completed the MOCA and 41CT. The median (IQR) percentile score for CAMCI for all 114 participants was 33.5 (18.3, 49.8), which corresponds to moderately low risk of impairment. The median (IQR) for the MOCA was 22.0 (19, 24.8) out of a possible 30, which is considered indicative of abnormal cognitive function, and for the 41CT was 6 (5, 7) out of a possible 7 points when all 38 participants were included. MOCA correlated strongly with the overall CAMCI score (r = 0.71); the CAMCI correlated moderately strongly with the 41CT (r = 0.62) and the MOCA and 41CT were moderately strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.56). When all 114 CAMCI scores were considered, the Executive Accuracy subscale was strongly correlated with the overall CAMCI score (r = 0.81).
   Conclusion: The CAMCI detects cognitive impairment after cardiac arrest. The MOCA correlates strongly with the overall CAMCI and the executive function subscale of the CAMCI. The 41CT as appears less effective than the MOCA in detecting cognitive deficits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of smoking on third-degree atrioventricular block outcomes: A propensity-matched analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY CARDIOVASCULAR RISK AND PREVENTION
AB  - Background: Third-degree atrioventricular (AV) blocks are rare but cause significant symptoms and require immediate intervention. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is felt to be the most common etiology. Although smoking is a prominent risk factor for CAD, there is a paucity of data assessing the direct effect of smoking on third-degree AV block. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study on adult -weighted admissions in 2019 -2020 with a primary diagnosis of third-degree AV block and a history of smoking using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. In -hospital mortality, rates of pacemaker insertion, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, mechanical circulatory support, vasopressor use, length of stay (LOS), and total hospitalization costs were analyzed using regression analysis. We performed a secondary analysis using propensity score matching to confirm the results. Results: A total of 77,650 admissions met inclusion criteria (33,625 females [43.3 %], 58,315. Caucasians [75 %], 7030 African American [9 %], 6155 Hispanic [7.9 %]; mean [SD] age 75.4.[10.2] years) before propensity matching. A total of 29,380 (37.8 %) patients with AV block were smokers.A total of 5560 patients with and without a history of smoking were matched for the analysis. Smokers had.decreased odds of mortality (aOR, 0.59; CI, 0.44 -0.78; p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, shorter LOS, and lower total hospital costs in both the multivariable regression and propensity -matched analyses. Conclusion: Third-degree AV block had lower in -hospital mortality, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, LOS, and total hospitalization cost in patients with smoking history.

TI  - An Evidence-Based Review of Epinephrine Administered via the Intraosseous Route in Animal Models of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Intraosseous (TO) access, enabling the rapid administration of epinephrine during cardiac arrest (CA), is crucial in promoting optimal postresuscitation outcomes in patients with poor vascular access. There is a question whether IO-administered epinephrine is equivalent to intravenously administered epinephrine during CA. Methods: The question guiding this evidence-based review was as follows: in adults suffering CA given epinephrine via the IO route, what is the resulting serum concentration of the drug compared to when administered intravenously? A search was conducted and the evidence appraised and leveled. Results: Four animal studies met the inclusion criteria. The sources showed no definitive evidence supporting equivalence between intravenous and IO epinephrine administered during CA. Intravenously administered epinephrine provides increased and faster appearing serum concentrations than IO-administered epinephrine. Evidence indicated epinephrine given via the sternal IO route more closely approaches equivalence with intravenously administered epinephrine than when administered by the tibial IO route. Conclusions: The clinician should consider using proximal IO infusion sites such as the sternum or humerus when administering advanced cardiac life support drugs to rapidly achieve maximal therapeutic concentrations. Further studies are needed to determine the differences seen when epinephrine is administered by these routes during CA.

TI  - The Use of Amantadine in Treating Extrapyramidal Symptoms in Organophosphates Poisoning in a Child
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background. Organophosphates are chemicals that lead to the accumulation of acetylcholine, causing muscarinic symptoms such as salivation and nicotinic manifestations like muscle weakness and hypertension and rarely leading to basal ganglia impairment, manifesting as extrapyramidal symptoms. Literature reported that the use of amantadine, an amine that has both antiviral and dopaminergic activities, improves extrapyramidal manifestations. Most of the studies exploring the effect of amantadine were conducted on adults and there are extremely limited data in regards to this topic in Saudi Arabia. Thus, the purpose of this case study is to report the outcome of treating a child who developed extrapyramidal symptoms due to organophosphates poisoning with amantadine. Case Description. A 6-year-old boy was found by his family drowsy and drooling with an insecticide bottle beside him. He was brought to the ER and arrested on arrival, and he was eventually revived after 5 minutes of CPR. Then, he developed features of extrapyramidal involvement such as delirium, hyperactivity, akathisia, aphonia, and tremors. He was started on oral amantadine 50 mg once daily and then increased to twice daily for two weeks while admitted. During admission, his symptoms were assessed daily, and an improvement was noticed by his family and the medical team. Upon discharge, he was able to form sentences; tremors were almost resolved; and there was no rigidity or agitation. He was followed up postdischarge and showed significant improvement. He continued amantadine for almost 3 months until the full resolution of his symptoms. Discussion and Conclusion. This case illustrates the promising benefits of using amantadine in treating extrapyramidal manifestations following organophosphate ingestion.

T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To describe the factors associated with outcome after accidental deep hypothermia.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with accidental hypothermia (core temperature <28 degrees C) admitted to a Level I emergency room over a 10-year period.
   Results: Forty-eight patients were included with a median temperature of 26 degrees C (range, 16.3-28 degrees C) on admission. The etiology of hypothermia was exposure to a cold environment (n = 27), avalanche (n = 13) or immersion in cold water (n = 8). Mean age was 47 +/- 22 years, and 58% were males. Thirty-two patients had a cardiac arrest (CA): 15 patients presented unwitnessed cardiac arrest (UCA) and 17 patients presented rescue collapse (RC). Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was implemented in 21 patients with refractory cardiac arrest and in two patients with hemodynamic instability. Overall mortality was 50%. For cardiac arrest patients, only three out of 15 patients with UCA survived at day 28, whereas eight out of 17 patients with RC survived. The cerebral performance category score was 4 for all the survivors of UCA and 1 [range, 1-2] for survivors of RC. Patients with poor outcome presented more UCA, a lower pH, a higher serum potassium, creatinine, serum sodium or lactate level as well as more severe coagulation disorders.
   Conclusion: Cardiac arrest related to rescue collapse was associated with favorable outcome. On-scene rescue collapse should prompt prolonged resuscitation and ECLS rewarming in all CA patients with deep hypothermia. Conversely, unwitnessed cardiac arrest was associated with unfavorable outcome and will likely not benefit from ECLS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stereological assessment of the blood-air barrier and the surfactant system after mesenchymal stem cell pretreatment in a porcine non-heart-beating donor model for lung transplantation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANATOMY
AB  - More frequent utilization of non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) organs for lung transplantation has the potential to relieve the shortage of donor organs. In particular with respect to uncontrolled NHBD, concerns exist regarding the risk of ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury-related graft damage or dysfunction. Due to their immunomodulating and tissue-remodelling properties, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suspected of playing a beneficial role regarding short- and long-term survival and function of the allograft. Thus, MSC administration might represent a promising pretreatment strategy for NHBD organs. To study the initial effects of warm ischaemia and MSC application, a large animal lung transplantation model was generated, and the structural organ composition of the transplanted lungs was analysed stereologically with particular respect to the blood-gas barrier and the surfactant system. In this study, porcine lungs (n = 5/group) were analysed. Group 1 was the sham-operated control group. In pigs of groups 2-4, cardiac arrest was induced, followed by a period of 3 h of ventilated ischaemia at room temperature. In groups 3 and 4, 50 x 10(6) MSCs were administered intravascularly via the pulmonary artery and endobronchially, respectively, during the last 10 min of ischaemia. The left lungs were transplanted, followed by a reperfusion period of 4 h. Then, lungs were perfusion-fixed and processed for light and electron microscopy. Samples were analysed stereologically for IR injury-related structural parameters, including volume densities and absolute volumes of parenchyma components, alveolar septum components, intra-alveolar oedema, and the intracellular and intra-alveolar surfactant pool. Additionally, the volume-weighted mean volume of lamellar bodies (lbs) and their profile size distribution were determined. Three hours of ventilated warm ischaemia was tolerated without eliciting histological or ultrastructural signs of IR injury, as revealed by qualitative and quantitative assessment. However, warm ischaemia influenced the surfactant system. The volume-weighted mean volume of lbs was reduced significantly (P = 0.024) in groups subjected to ischaemia (group medians of groups 2-4: 0.180-0.373 mu m(3)) compared with the sham control group (median 0.814 mu m(3)). This was due to a lower number of large lb profiles (size classes 5-15). In contrast, the intra-alveolar surfactant system was not altered significantly. No significant differences were encountered comparing ischaemia alone (group 2) or ischaemia plus application of MSCs (groups 3 and 4) in this short-term model.

TI  - Hand-held thoracic sonography for detecting post-traumatic pneurnothoraces: The Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (EFAST)
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - Background: Thoracic ultrasound (EFAST) has shown promise in inferring the presence of post-traumatic pneumothoraces (PTXs) and may have a particular value in identifying occult pneumothoraces (OPTXs) missed by the AP supine chest radiograph (CXR). However, the diagnostic utility of hand-held US has not been previously evaluated in this role.
   Methods. Thoracic US examinations were performed during the initial resuscitation of injured patients at a provincial trauma referral center. A high frequency linear transducer and a 2.4 kg US attached to a video-recorder were used. Real-time EFAST examinations for PTXs were blindly compared with the subsequent results of CXRs, a composite standard (CXR, chest and abdominal CT scans, clinical course, and invasive interventions), and a CT gold standard (CT only). Charts were reviewed for in-hospital outcomes and follow-up.
   Results: There were 225 eligible patients (207 blunt, 18 penetrating); 17 were excluded from the US examination because of battery failure or a lost probe. Sixty-five (65) PTXs were detected in 52 patients (22% of patients), 41 (63%) being occult to CXR in 33 patients (14.2% whole population, 24.6% of those with a CT). The US and CXR agreed in 186 (89.4%) of patients, EFAST was better in 16 (7.7%), and CXR better in 6 (2.9%). Compared with the composite standard, the sensitivity of EFAST was 58.9% with a likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+) of 69.7 and a specificity of 99.1%. Comparing EFAST directly to CXR, by looking at each of 266 lung fields with the benefit of the CT gold standard, the EFAST showed higher sensitivity over CXR (48.8% versus 20.9%). Both exams had a very high specificity (99.6% and 98.7%), and very predictive LR+ (46.7 and 36.3).
   Conclusion: EFAST has comparable specificity to CXR but is more sensitive for the detection of OPTXs after trauma. Positive EFAST findings should be addressed either clinically or with CT depending on hemodynamic stability. CT should be used if detection of all PTXs is desired.

TI  - Critical care of the patient with acute pancreatitis
T2  - ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Acute pancreatitis is air inflammatory process of the pancreas with variable involvement of regional tissues and remote organs. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the aetiolog, pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy of acute pancreatitis relevant to the intensivist. Recent international guidelines on the management of acute pancreatitis are summarised.
   Eighty percent of acute pancreatitis episodes are related either to gallstones or to alcohol abuse. Independent of its aetiology, the pathophysiologic hallmark of acute pancreatitis is the premature activation of trypsin, which leads to massive pancreas inflammation, systemic overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators and ultimately remote organ dysfunction. All guidelines agree that the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should include clinical symptoms, increased serum amylase or lipase levels and/or characteristic findings on computed tomography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is recommended as a causative therapy in patients with acute cholangitis or a strong suspicion of gallstones. All guidelines underline the importance of vigorous fluid resuscitation and supplemental oxygen therapy and prefer enteral over parenteral nutrition, with the majority favouring the nasojejunal route. In view of lacking scientific evidence, antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection of pancreatic necroses is discouraged by most guidelines. Computed tomography-guided fine needle aspiration is the technique of choice to differentiate between sterile and infected pancreas necrosis. While sterile pancreatic necrosis should be managed conservatively, infected pancreatic necrosis requires debridement and drainage supplemented by antibiotic therapy. Surgical necrosectomy is the traditional approach, but less invasive techniques (retroperitoneal or laparoscopic necrosectomy, computed tomography-guided percutaneous catheter drainage) may be equally effective.

TI  - Randomized trial of rate-control versus rhythm-control in persistent atrial fibrillation - The Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) study
T2  - JACC-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study was designed to compare two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF): rhythm-control (restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm) and rate-control (pharmacologic or invasive rate-control and anticoagulation).
   BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia. It is unclear whether a strategy of rhythm-or rate-control is better in terms of mortality, morbidity, and quality of life.
   METHODS The Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) multicenter pilot trial randomized 200 patients (100 per group) with persistent AF to rhythm- or rate-control. The combined primary end point was a combination of death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cerebrovascular event, and systemic embolism.
   RESULTS After 19.6 +/- 8.9 months (range 0 to 36 months) there was no difference in the primary end point between rhythm-control (9/100; 5.54%/year) and rate-control (10/100; 6.09%/year; p = 0.99). The percentage of patients in sinus rhythm in the rhythm-control group after up to four cardioversions during the follow-up period (rate-control group) was 23% (0%) at 36 months. Eighteen primary end points occurred in atrial fibrillation; only one occurred in sinus rhythm (p = 0.049).
   CONCLUSIONS The STAF pilot study showed no differences between the two treatment strategies in all end points except hospitalizations. These data suggest that there was no benefit in attempting rhythm-control in these patients with a high risk of arrhythmia recurrence. It remains unclear whether the results in the rhythm-control group would have been better if sinus rhythm had been maintained in a higher proportion of patients, as all but one end point occurred during AF.

TI  - Severe Idiopathic Secretory Diarrhoea With a Profound Sustained Response to Somatostatin Analogues: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundChronic secretory diarrhoea is a diagnostic challenge with a broad differential and significant impact on patient's quality of life. While common causes include microscopic colitis, bile acid diarrhoea, and laxative use, rarer aetiologies such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-secreting neuroendocrine tumours (VIPomas) must be considered when standard investigations fail.Case PresentationWe present a 35-year-old woman with a two-year history of progressively worsening, fasting-persistent, high-volume watery diarrhoea leading to severe electrolyte abnormalities and weight loss requiring resuscitation in intensive care. Extensive biochemical, endoscopic, and radiological investigations-including faecal analysis, colonoscopy, neuroendocrine markers, multiphase CT, endoscopic ultrasound, and Ga-68 Dotatate PET imaging-failed to identify an underlying cause. Serum VIP levels remained within the normal range. Despite the absence of a definitive diagnosis, empirical treatment with the somatostatin analogue octreotide led to rapid and sustained symptom resolution. The patient was subsequently maintained on long-acting lanreotide with complete remission. Notably, diarrhoea recurred upon cessation of therapy, again resolving with reinitiation. After 4 years, the patient self-ceased lanreotide without symptom recurrence, and follow-up imaging remained unremarkable.DiscussionThis case highlights a diagnostic dilemma: clinical and biochemical features were highly suggestive of a VIPoma, yet no tumour was identified despite repeated advanced imaging and biochemical workup. The patient's remarkable therapeutic response to somatostatin analogue therapy, in the absence of confirmed neuroendocrine neoplasia, suggests that somatostatin analogues may have a broader role in the management of idiopathic secretory diarrhoea than currently appreciated.ConclusionWe present a rare case of chronic secretory diarrhoea with suspected but unproven VIPoma, demonstrating sustained and reproducible response to somatostatin analogue therapy. This case supports the consideration of therapeutic trials of somatostatin analogues in refractory secretory diarrhoea of unknown origin.

TI  - What is confirmed in the treatment of sepsis? An update
T2  - INNERE MEDIZIN
AB  - Background: Sepsis is defined as "being evoked as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an inadequate host response to infection". The most recent German S3 guidelines were published in 2018 and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) last published the current recommendations for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock in 2021.
   Objective: This article explores and discusses which evidence in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock has been confirmed.
   Material and methods: Discussion of the 2018 German S3 guidelines, supplementation of the content of the 2021 international guidelines and recent research results since 2021.
   Results: The primary objective for managing sepsis and septic shock still includes rapid identification, early initiation of anti-infective treatment, and focus cleansing when feasible. In addition, the focus is on hemodynamic stabilization, including the early use of vasopressors for prevention of hypervolemia and, if necessary, the use of organ support procedures. Supportive treatment, such as the administration of corticosteroids and the use of apheresis, can be advantageous in specific scenarios. The focus is increasingly shifting towards post-intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up care, improving the quality of life after surviving sepsis and the close involvement of relatives of the patient.
   Conclusion: Despite the fact that considerable progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of sepsis, the early administration of anti-infective agents, focus control, nuanced volume therapy and the use of catecholamines continue to be fundamental to sepsis management. New recommendations emphasize the early use of vasopressors (primarily norepinephrine) and the administration of corticosteroids, especially in cases of septic shock and pneumonia.

TI  - Clinical practice recommendations for depression
T2  - ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - To provide clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for the management of depression in adults that are informative, easy to assimilate and facilitate clinical decision making.
   A comprehensive literature review of over 500 articles was undertaken using electronic database search engines (e.g. MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Cochrane reviews). In addition articles, book chapters and other literature known to the authors were reviewed. The findings were then formulated into a set of recommendations that were developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians who routinely deal with mood disorders. The recommendations then underwent consultative review by a broader advisory panel that included experts in the field, clinical staff and patient representatives.
   The clinical practice recommendations for depression (Depression CPR) summarize evidence-based treatments and provide a synopsis of recommendations relating to each phase of the illness. They are designed for clinical use and have therefore been presented succinctly in an innovative and engaging manner that is clear and informative.
   These up-to-date recommendations provide an evidence-based framework that incorporates clinical wisdom and consideration of individual factors in the management of depression. Further, the novel style and practical approach should promote uptake and implementation.

TI  - Meckel diverticulum in children: Evaluation of macroscopic appearance for guidance in subsequent surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
AB  - Background: The treatment of incidentally encountered asymptomatic Meckel diverticulum(MD) is controversial. We evaluated whether the macroscopic appearance correlates with clinical features, histopathological findings, future complications, and management decisions.
   Methods: Patients who underwent MD resection at a single institution from 2000 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in terms of age, sex, clinical features, laboratory data, perioperative findings (diverticulum length, diameter, depth, thickening, and height-to diameter ratio [HDR]), pathology, and postoperative follow-up.
   Results: Fifty children were enrolled. Sixteen percent of the resected MDs were found incidentally. Of 42 complicated MDs, 17 (40%) were long (HDR >= 2), 14 (33%) were thickened, and 29 (70%) exhibited base widening. Histopathologically, ectopic mucosa was found in 32 (64%) of all MDs and in 5 (62%) of incidentally removed MDs. There was no statistical difference between the macroscopic appearance and clinical signs, sex, or presence of ectopic tissue based on palpation.
   Conclusion: The macroscopic appearance of MD does not indicate the presence or absence of HGM and cannot be used to guide subsequent surgery. Additionally, 40% of symptomatic patients in our study had life-threatening complications requiring prompt fluid resuscitation. We consider that incidentally detected MD should be removed regardless of its macroscopic appearance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temporal patterns of change in vital signs and Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage scores over the 48 hours preceding fatal in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim. To determine temporal patterns of vital sign and Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage score changes over the 48-hour period preceding cardiac arrest in an ICU setting.
   Background. Vital sign instability usually occurs prior to cardiac arrest. However, few studies have been conducted on the temporal patterns of individual vital signs preceding cardiac arrest.
   Design. A retrospective case-control study.
   Methods. The study subjects were 140 ICU patients (1 June 2011-31 December 2012): 46 died of cardiac arrest (case group), 45 died of other illnesses (control I group) and 49 were discharged after recovering (control II group).
   Results. Initial detectable changes in blood pressure appeared 18-20 hours and became dramatic at 5-10 hours before cardiac arrest. Noticeable changes in heart rates began at 4 hours and became more prominent at 2 hours pre-arrest. No apparent patterns in respiratory rate changes were observed. Body temperatures usually indicated a hypothermic state pre-arrest. Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage scores were 16-18 at 48 hours pre-arrest and then continuously increased to 20. Only mean values of systolic blood pressures were significantly different between the three study groups. Mean diastolic blood pressures, heart rates, respiratory rates and Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage scores differed between the case and control II groups and between the control I and II groups.
   Conclusion. The study demonstrates vital sign instability preceded cardiac arrest and that the temporal patterns of changes in individual vital signs and Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage scores differed between groups. The findings of this study may aid the development of management strategies for cardiac arrest.

TI  - Parent Medical Traumatic Stress and Associated Family Outcomes After Pediatric Critical Illness: A Systematic Review*
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To critically review, analyze, and synthesize the literature on parent medical traumatic stress from a child's critical illness requiring PICU admission and its association with outcomes of parent mental and physical health, and family functioning. Data Sources: Systematic literature search of Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychInfo. Study Selection: Two reviewers identified peer-reviewed published articles with the following criteria: 1) published between January 1, 1980, and August 1, 2018; 2) published in English; 3) study population of parents of children with a PICU admission; and 4) quantitative studies examining factors associated with outcomes of parent mental health, parent physical health, or family functioning. Data Extraction: Literature search yielded 2,476 articles, of which 23 studies met inclusion criteria. Study data extracted included study characteristics, descriptive statistics of parent outcomes after critical illness, and variables associated with parent and family outcomes. Data Synthesis: Studies examined numerous variables associated with parent and family outcomes and used multiple survey measures. These variables were categorized according to their phase in the Integrative Trajectory Model of Pediatric Medical Traumatic Stress, which included peri-trauma, acute medical care, and ongoing care or discharge from care. The majority of objective elements of a child's illness, such as severity of illness and length of hospitalization, did not have a clear relationship with parent and family outcomes. However, familial preexisting factors, a parent's subjective experience in the PICU, and family life stressors after discharge were often associated with parent and family outcomes. Conclusions: This systematic literature review suggests that parent and family outcomes after pediatric critical illness are impacted by familial preexisting factors, a parent's subjective experience in the PICU, and family life stressors after discharge. Developing parent interventions focused on modifying the parent's subjective experience in the PICU could be an effective approach to improve parent outcomes.

TI  - Extremely Preterm Birth Outcome: A Review of Four Decades of Cognitive Research
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Premature birth incidence and survival rates are increasing steadily due to advances in obstetric and neonatal intensive care. Those born at the limits of viability are highly at-risk of adverse neurocognitive function over their lifespan, leading to current controversy regarding aggressive resuscitation efforts for these extremely preterm children. However, data from earlier generation cohorts who were born in substantially different eras of neonatal intensive care cannot be relied on to predict outcome of today's newborn. Our review by the crucial variable of birth cohort year shows a changing developmental trajectory in which today's extremely preterm survivor is likely to have fewer severe medical complications, better neurological outcomes, and fewer adverse cognitive late effects. Such data further underscore the importance of concurrently considering medical, familial, socioenvironmental, and neurobiological factors in combination with individual neonatal intensive care center protocols when studying outcomes of the preterm child. This complex, interrelated range of factors directly affects the immature, rapidly developing premature brain. However, ongoing surveillance to detect subsequent delay or impairment and to apply interventional strategies early in the developmental course holds promise for further enhancement of functional outcome.

TI  - Death in correctional facilities: Opportunities for automated external defibrillation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Death due to cardiovascular disease occurs more frequently in prisons than the national average. Due to close surveillance 24h/day, the ability to reach the patient within 3 min and time consuming access for the EMS crews, it was hypothesised that the deployment of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) might make improvements regarding Call-to-the-Fi rst-AED- Prompt (CTP) interval and formed the aim of this study.
   Methods: Our investigation was analysed on an intention to treat basis and conducted in a prospective, open and observational design. As the primary outcome, the CTP-intervals were compared to the arrival intervals of the EMS. As a secondary outcome, an analysis of all deceased inmates was described.
   Results: The average daily population of inmates in Austrian correctional facilities is 7714. During a period of 13 months, 10 instances in which an AED was activated and electrodes attached to a collapsed inmate, were reported. The CTP-intervat (median +/- S.D.) was 2.3 +/- 1.6 S.D. min. It took the EMS 10.0 +/- 4.3 S.D. min. to arrive at the patient's side. Four out of 10 cases of cardiac arrest occurred due to myocardial infarction. Of 39 deceased inmates, a post mortern examination was completed in 34 cases. In 13 cases, cardiovascular disease was the cause of death.
   Discussion: The main finding was a four-fold reduction of the CTP-interval. This fact indicates the potential improvements which could be achieved with the deployment of AEDs. Our secondary objective revealed that death due to cardiovascular disease was found in a high proportion and could be considered to be a strong incentive to initiate programmes to counter cardiovascular death in prison.

TI  - Hypothermia and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest: state of the art
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
CP  - Brain Annual Meeting
AB  - Multi-centred studies in patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest and also in newborn babies with perinatal asphyxia have clearly demonstrated that mild hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) can improve neurological outcome after post-anoxic injury. This represents a highly promising development in the field of neurocritical care. This review discusses the place of mild therapeutic hypothermia in the overall therapeutic strategy for cardiac arrest patients. Cooling should not be viewed in isolation but in the context of a 'treatment bundle,' which together can significantly improve outcome after cardiac arrest. Favourable outcomes of 50-60% are now routinely achieved in many centres in patients with witnessed arrest and an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. These results have been achieved by combining a number of therapeutic strategies, including early and effective resuscitation with greater emphasis on continuing chest compressions throughout various procedures (including resumption of compressions immediately after defibrillation even if rhythm has been restored) as well as prevention of hypoxia and hypotension in all stages following restoration of spontaneous circulation. Regarding the use of hypothermia, early induction and proper management of side-effects are the key elements of successful implementation. Treatment should include the rapid infusion of 1500-3000 mL of cold fluids to induce hypothermia and prevent hypovolaemia and hypotension. Educational activities to increase awareness and acceptance of new therapeutic options and European Resuscitation Council guidelines are urgently required.

TI  - Follow-Up Evaluation of the US Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Flow Sheet for En Route Care Documentation of Burned Combat Casualties
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: In 2006, burn clinical practice guidelines were developed to provide recommendations for optimal care of U.S. military and local national burn casualties. As part of that effort, a paper-based Burn Flow Sheet (BFS) was included to document the burn resuscitation of combat casualties with >= 20% total body surface area burns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the BFS in terms of ongoing utilization, resuscitation management, and outcomes of patients transported. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was performed of hard-copy BFSs received from January 2007 to December 2013. En route injury and treatment data from these flowsheets were manually transcribed into the research database. Outcomes and complications of BFS subjects were extracted from the Burn Center Registry and added to the research database. Results: A total of 73 BFSs were collected from the study period. On average, BFSs were 61 +/- 30% complete with a total of 14.7 +/- 7 hours documented per patient in the first 24-hours postburn. Patients received nearly 7 L more fluid than estimated by traditional formulas. Sixteen patients (26%) received greater than 250 mL/kg of fluid, half of whom had concomitant traumatic injuries. Fifteen patients received a fasciotomy (21%), 4 received a laparotomy (5%), and 8 (11%) received both. No patients developed abdominal compartment syndrome associated with fluid resuscitation. Overall mortality was 21%. Conclusions: Although the majority of providers did initiate a BFS, it was not always used as intended; problems included missing data and miscalculations. Although there was a clear improvement with decline in the incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, mortality did not change for severely burned patients. Simplification of the recommendations, additional built-in prompts, and automated tools such as computerized decision support software may help standardize practice and improve outcomes.

TI  - Adhesive Hemostatic Hydrogel with Ultrafast Gelation Arrests Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage in Pigs
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB  - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common clinical emergency worldwide. Endoscopic hemostasis is the current first line treatment. Nevertheless, for patients with severe active bleeding and challenging anatomy, endoscopic management can be still difficult and usually requires a higher level of surgical expertise. A simple and effective method of endoscopic hemostasis is therefore in acute clinical demand. Herein a hemostatic hybrid hydrogel comprised of hyaluronic acid and polyethylene glycol stabilized by thiourea-catechol coupling and disulfide bonds is reported. The hybrid hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical properties, short gelation time, and good blood clotting ability compared with fibrin gels. The in vivo hemostatic efficacy is confirmed in a rat model of arterial bleeding, in which the rapid gelation of hybrid hydrogels after topical application effectively arrests blood loss with no rebleeding occurring during resuscitation when blood pressure approximately recovers to normal. A large animal study further demonstrates the efficacy of hybrid hydrogels to achieve endoscopic hemostasis against upper GI hemorrhage in pigs. Follow-up observations show that the hybrid hydrogels can remain adherent at the bleeding wound for 48 h, indicating the sustained hemostatic function in vivo. Collectively, this work demonstrates a promising hemostatic hydrogel for endoscopic hemostasis in upper GI hemorrhage.

TI  - Ileosigmoid knotting: A case report of unique cause of acute abdomen in a Nepalese patient
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and importance: Ileosigmoid knotting is a surgical emergency. Common in Asian males, it is presented with signs and symptoms of diffuse peritonitis. Aggressive resuscitation with intravenous fluids and antibiotics followed by workup enable the patient hemodynamically stable. Explorative laparotomy followed by colo-colic anastomosis and double barrel ileostomy is curative.
   Case presentation: A 32-year-old-male from Nepal with a chief complain of diffuse abdominal pain for a day and signs of peritonitis presented to Emergency room. After assessing and stabilizing the patient, explorative laparotomy was performed. Ileal and sigmoid resection followed by colo-colic anastomosis and double barrel ileostomy was done. On regular follow-up, he is in his usual state of health.
   Discussion: The incidence of ileosigmoid knotting is reported to be about 1.6 cases per year. It is often misdiagnosed as non-specific intestinal obstruction which confers poor prognostic value to the patient. It should be identified promptly and intervened timely.
   Conclusion: Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare but dangerous differential of acute abdomen not to be missed. Early assessment and quick decision making is the key to provide excellent prognosis to the patient in need, provided adequate surgical skills are demonstrated.

TI  - Traumatic injuries to the renal blood vessels and in-hospital renal complications in patients with penetrating or blunt trauma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundTraumatic injuries to renal blood vessels (IRBV) can have significant consequences for patients, impacting their mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare trauma types and injury characteristics, vital signs, and outcomes in patients with and without IRBV (nIRBV) and examine whether IRBV and pre-existing renal dysfunction affected the likelihood of in-hospital renal complications (iHRC). Materials and MethodsAfter identifying penetrating and blunt trauma victims with IRBV in the National Trauma Data Bank, patient demographics, injury-related variables, treatment outcomes, and deaths under care were analyzed and compared. ResultsOf the 994,184 trauma victims, 610 (0.6%) experienced IRBV. Victims in the IRBV group (IRBVG) had a significantly higher frequency of penetrating injuries (19.5% vs. 9.2%, P < 0.001) and higher injury severity score (ISS >= 25, 61.5% vs. 6.7%). Most injuries in both groups were unintentional, although a higher frequency of assault was noted in the IRBVG. The incidence of iHRC was higher in the IRBVG (6.6%) than in the nIRBVG (0.4%; P < 0.001). The IRBV {OR = 3.5 [95% CI = (2.4-5.0)]}, preexisting renal disorders {OR = 2.5 [95% CI = (2.1-2.9)]}, and in-hospital cardiac arrest {OR = 8.6 [95% CI = (7.7-9.5)]} were found to be among the factors associated with a higher risk of iHRC. ConclusionsIRBV and pre-existing renal disorders considerably increased the risk of developing iHRC. Due to the long- and short-term consequences of associated cardiovascular, renal, and hemodynamic complications, victims of IRBV require specialized renal management and close monitoring.

TI  - Differentially culturable tubercle bacteria dynamics during standard anti-tuberculosis treatment: A prospective cohort study
T2  - TUBERCULOSIS
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of culture filtrate dependent subpopulations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a prospective cohort study following 17 patients through a standard 6-month anti-tuberculosis regimen, performing monthly sputum collection. We performed the limiting dilution method with culture filtrate supplementation of liquid media in pre- and post-treatment sputum samples to assess the bacillary load and to evaluate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulation dynamics within the 6-months standard anti-tuberculosis regimen. We found that supplementation increased the bacillary load by 30% in pre-treatment samples (p = 0.0005) and 35% in samples after one month of treatment (p = 0.0977). We found a weak linear correlation between the decrease of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in liquid media with and without culture filtrate supplementation (rho = 0.54; p = 0.026). None of the patients had bacilli recovery after two months of treatment. Our study constitutes the first follow-up regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulation dynamics throughout a standard 6-month anti-tuberculosis treatment and also supports the use of culture filtrate to increase bacillary load in liquid media. Moreover, it highlights that any new treatment regimens should test the efficacy of the drugs in all Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulations.

TI  - Mortality and Management of 96 Shark Attacks and Development of a Shark Bite Severity Scoring System
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
AB  - Humans share a fascination and fear of sharks. We predict that most shark attacks are nonfatal but require skilled, timely medical intervention. The development of a shark bite severity scoring scale will assist communication and understanding of such an injury. We retrospectively reviewed records of the prospectively maintained International Shark Attack File (ISAF) at the University of Florida. The ISAF contains 4409 investigations, including 2979 documented attacks, 96 of which have complete medical records. We developed a Shark-Induced Trauma (SIT) Scale and calculated the level of injury for each attack. Medical records were reviewed for the 96 documented shark attack victims since 1921. Calculated levels of injury in the SIT Scale reveal 40 Level 1 injuries (41.7%), 16 Level 2 injuries (16.7%), 18 Level 3 injuries (18.8%), 14 Level 4 injuries (14.6%), and eight Level 5 injuries (8.3%). The overall mortality of shark attacks was 8.3 per cent. However, SIT Scale Level I injuries comprised the greatest percentage of cases at 41.7 per cent. Injury to major vascular structures increases mortality and necessitates immediate medical attention and definitive care by a surgeon. Shark bites deserve recognition with prompt resuscitation, washout, debridement, and follow up for prevention of infection and closure of more complex wounds.

TI  - Neonatal palliative care
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose of review
   A significant number of newborns are affected by life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. When prolongation of survival is no longer a goal, or prognosis is uncertain, a plan of care focused on the infant's comfort is essential. The aim of this article is to review the most recent and relevant literature regarding neonatal palliative care (NPC).
   Recent findings
   A variety of perinatal and NPC programs are described, but most programs focus exclusively on end-of-life care. Moreover, there is a great need to standardize practices and obtain follow-up quality measures. Guidelines to address infants' basic needs, to achieve a state of comfort, are proposed. A multidisciplinary team addressing the infants' medical and nonmedical needs, parental grieving process, and providers' distress is recommended.
   Summary
   NPC is a unique multidisciplinary approach for the care of newborns affected by life-limiting or complex medical conditions with uncertain prognosis. Standardized guidelines should be implemented with the goal of achieving a state of comfort for newborns throughout the course of illness. Further studies are warranted to assess whether NPC effectively promotes newborns' comfort and parents and providers' satisfaction.

TI  - Review: sepsis guidelines and core measure bundles
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis is a major cause of mortality worldwide and is the third-leading cause of death in the United States. Sepsis is resource-intensive and requires prompt recognition and treatment to reduce mortality. The impact of sepsis is not only on in-hospital survival but extends into post-discharge quality of life and risk of re-admission. As the understanding of sepsis physiology evolved, so have the recommended screening tools and treatment protocol which challenge prior standards of care. There have been noteworthy efforts by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to establish core measure bundles. This review highlights both the 2021 SSC International Guidelines and the 2015 CMS Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Core Measure Bundle, or SEP-1. Notably, the SEP-1 bundle was implemented as a value-based purchasing program, linking care of sepsis patients to financial incentives. The objective is to explore the most current evidence-based data to inform clinical practice while utilizing the available guidelines as a roadmap.

TI  - Disparities in cardiovascular disease and treatment in the Nordic countries
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
AB  - The Nordic countries, inc luding Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have seen a steep decline in cardiovascular mortality in recent decades. They are among the most egalitarian countries by several measures, and all have universal, publicly funded welfare systems providing healthcare for all citizens. However, despite these seemingly ideal conditions, disparities in access to cardiovascular care and outcomes persist. To address this challenge, The Lancet Region Health-Europe convened experts from a broad range of countries to sum-ma rize the current state of knowledge on cardiovascular disease disparities across Europe. This Series Paper presents the main challenges in Nordic countries based on evidence from high-quality nationwide registries. Focusing on major cardiovascular health determinants, areas in need of improvement were identified. There is a need for addressing structural causes underlying these disparities, such as poverty and discrimination, but also to improve access to healthcare in deprived neighborhoods and to address underlying social determinants of health that may mitigate disparities in cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, while the Nordic countries have made great strides in promoting egalitarianism and providing universal healthcare, there is still much work to be done to ensure equitable access to care and improved cardiovascular outcomes for all members of society.

TI  - Strategy of endovascular versus open repair for patients with clinical diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: the IMPROVE RCT
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular emergency. The mortality from emergency endovascular repair may be much lower than the 40-50% reported for open surgery.
   Objective: To assess whether or not a strategy of endovascular repair compared with open repair reduces 30-day and mid-term mortality (including costs and cost-effectiveness) among patients with a suspected ruptured AAA.
   Design: Randomised controlled trial, with computer-generated telephone randomisation of participants in a 1:1 ratio, using variable block size, stratified by centre and without blinding.
   Setting: Vascular centres in the UK (n = 29) and Canada (n = 1) between 2009 and 2013.
   Participants: A total of 613 eligible participants (480 men) with a ruptured aneurysm, clinically diagnosed at the trial centre.
   Interventions: A total of 316 participants were randomised to the endovascular strategy group (immediate computerised tomography followed by endovascular repair if anatomically suitable or, if not suitable, open repair) and 297 were randomised to the open repair group (computerised tomography optional).
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality, with 30-day reinterventions, costs and disposal as early secondary outcome measures. Later outcome measures included 1- and 3-year mortality, reinterventions, quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness.
   Results: The 30-day mortality was 35.4% in the endovascular strategy group and 37.4% in the open repair group [odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.28; p = 0.62, and, after adjustment for age, sex and Hardman index, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.33]. The endovascular strategy appeared to be more effective in women than in men (interaction test p = 0.02). More discharges in the endovascular strategy group (94%) than in the open repair group (77%) were directly to home (p < 0.001). Average 30-day costs were similar between groups, with the mean difference in costs being -1186 pound (95% CI -2997 pound to 625) pound, favouring the endovascular strategy group. After 1 year, survival and reintervention rates were similar in the two groups, QoL (at both 3 and 12 months) was higher in the endovascular strategy group and the mean cost difference was -2329 pound (95% CI -5489 pound to 922) pound. At 3 years, mortality was 48% and 56% in the endovascular strategy group and open repair group, respectively (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00; p = 0.053), with a stronger benefit for the endovascular strategy in the subgroup of 502 participants in whom repair was started for a proven rupture (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89; p = 0.009), whereas aneurysm-related reintervention rates were non-significantly higher in this group. At 3 years, considering all participants, there was a mean difference of 0.174 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% CI 0.002 to 0.353 QALYs) and, among the endovascular strategy group, a cost difference of -2605 pound (95% CI -5966 pound to 702) pound, leading to 88% of estimates in the cost-effectiveness plane being in the quadrant showing the endovascular strategy to be 'dominant'.
   Limitations: Because of the pragmatic design of this trial, 33 participants in the endovascular strategy group and 26 in the open repair group breached randomisation allocation.
   Conclusions: The endovascular strategy was not associated with a significant reduction in either 30-day mortality or cost but was associated with faster participant recovery. By 3 years, the endovascular strategy showed a survival and QALY gain and was highly likely to be cost-effective. Future research could include improving resuscitation for older persons with circulatory collapse, the impact of local anaesthesia and emergency consent procedures.

TI  - Genetic variants in SCN5A promoter are associated with arrhythmia phenotype severity in patients with heterozygous loss-of-function mutation
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND Heterozygous SCN5A mutations have been associated with varied arrhythmia phenotypes; phenotype severity may range from asymptomatic electrocardiographic changes (mild phenotype) to symptomatic arrhythmias resulting in syncope, cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death (severe phenotype) even among family members carrying the same mutation. Risk-stratification schemes for SCN5A mutation carriers remain uncertain.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the role of SCN5A promoter variants and DNA methylation by using a family-based approach in predicting phenotype severity in a kindred with loss-of-function SCN5A mutation.
   METHODS In a large kindred with a heterozygous SCN5A loss-of-function mutation (1936delC, Q646RfsX5; 22 mutation carriers), we sought SCN5A promoter variants. In addition, we assessed SCN5A and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles on genomic DNA derived from blood (Illumina Human Methylation27 BeadChip).
   RESULTS During systematic survey of the 2.8-kb SCN5A promoter region, we identified 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms in complete linkage disequilibrium (rs41310749 and rs41310239). These promoter variants were significantly associated with disease severity (mild vs severe phenotype) (P = .0007), as all 3 patients with severe phenotype carried the 2-SNP variant on both mutant and wild-type alleles. Analysis did not support a role for the methylation of SCN5A-related genes.
   CONCLUSION These family-based genetic findings suggest that the presence of specific promoter variants increase the risk of a severe phenotype in heterozygous carriers of an SCN5A loss-of-function mutation.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of reviewSurvival statistics for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests remain unsatisfactory. Prompt defibrillation of shockable rhythms, such as ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, is crucial for improving survival. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and wearable cardiac defibrillators (WCDs) seek to improve the survival rates following out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. We aim to review the indications, utility, advancements, and limitations of AEDs and WCDs, as well as their role in contemporary and future clinical practice.Recent findingsRecent advancements in these technologies, such as smartphone applications and drone delivery of AEDs and less inappropriate shocks and decreased size of WCDs, have increased their ubiquity and efficacy. However, implementation of this technology remains limited due to lack of resources and suboptimal patient adherence.SummaryOut of hospital cardiac arrests continue to pose a significant public health challenge. Advancements in AEDs and WCDs aim to facilitate prompt defibrillation of shockable rhythms with the goal of improving survival rates. However, they remain underutilized due to limited resources and suboptimal patient adherence. As these technologies continue to evolve to become smaller, lighter and more affordable, their utilization and accessibility are expected to improve.

This study aimed to evaluate whether comorbidity burden modifies the effectiveness of catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy.Methods and results In this post hoc analysis of the CABANA trial, patients were stratified by overall comorbidity burden using a data-driven threshold based on the distribution of 15 pre-specified conditions. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. Additional outcomes included AF recurrence and AF-related quality of life in a sub-cohort. Of 2204 patients, 736 had high comorbidity burden {>= 4 conditions, based on a data-driven threshold; median age 68.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 63.0-73.0], 67.1% male} and 1468 had low burden [median age 67.0 (IQR: 61.0-71.0), 60.7% male]. Over a median follow-up of 3.9 years (IQR: 2.4-5.1), for the primary outcome, the adjusted hazard ratio for catheter ablation vs. drug therapy was 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-0.93] in patients with high comorbidity burden and 1.16 (95% CI: 0.76-1.77) in those with low burden (interaction P = 0.038). Secondary outcomes also tended to favour ablation in the high comorbidity burden group. Moreover, catheter ablation significantly reduced AF recurrence, with relative risk reductions of 49% and 40% in the low- and high-burden groups, respectively. Furthermore, catheter ablation improved AF-related quality of life in both comorbidity groups, with more sustained and pronounced benefits over time in patients with high comorbidity burden.Conclusion Catheter ablation was associated with more favourable clinical outcomes in AF patients with high comorbidity burden, which support broader consideration of ablation in this population, though prospective trials are needed to confirm and guide clinical decision-making in personalized rhythm management.Pre-registered clinical trial number NCT00911508

TI  - Validity and sensitivity to change of the Clinical Frailty Scale-Spain in patients admitted to intensive care
T2  - ENFERMERIA INTENSIVA
AB  - Introduction: Frailty scales, developed to assess elderly patients, are being implemented in critically ill patients. One of the most widely used is Clinical Frailty Scale, wrecently adapted to Spanish (CFS-Spain). Objective: To evaluate the validity and sensitivity to change of the CFS-Espa & ntilde;a in a cohort of critically ill patients aged >= 18 years. Methodology: A prospective, multicenter, observational, metric-based study was conducted between January-2020 and July-2024. Adult patients with ICU stays >48 hours were included. Follow-up was performed during the stay and up to one year after discharge. Variables: frailty, sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life, comorbidities, severity (SAPS3), ICU outcome variables, length of stay, and discharge destination. Statistical analysis: exploratory, bivariate regression to assess the relationship between frailty and the recorded variables; multivariate regression of significant variables in bivariate. Spearman correlation of CFS-Spain with quantitative variables. Comparison of means with Student's t-test for sensitivity to change. Results: A total of 493 patients were included, 17.4% of whom were frail (CFS-Spain = 5-9). Age, being female, and being dependent increased the risk of frailty, as did previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, poorer physical quality of life, low academic level, and low annual income. Frailty predicts muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, the need for extrarenal blood pressure, invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or limitation of life-sustaining treatment, and is associated with mortality. Frailty was not associated with mental quality of life, SAPS3, SOFA or ICU/hospital stay. The greatest change observed was between admission and 3 months after discharge. The effect size for changes in CFS-Es between admission, midpoints, and discharge was high (d = 0.832). Conclusions: The CFS-Spain shows good convergent validity with age, women, dependency, poorer physical quality of life, days of previous hospitalization, academic level and low annual income. Good predictive validity for the level of vital support in ICU, mortality and destination at hospital discharge. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

TI  - Do sepsis biomarkers in the emergency room allow transition from bundled sepsis care to personalized patient care?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   There is convincing evidence linking early start of fluid resuscitation and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy to improved outcomes in patients with sepsis in the emergency department. Blood biomarkers measured on admission and during follow-up have the ability to guide early sepsis recognition, severity assessment and therapeutic decisions in individual patients and may allow transition from bundled sepsis care to more individualized management in single patients.
   Recent findings
   Although a large number of promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have been put forward in observational studies, only few have been evaluated in prospective randomized-controlled intervention trials. Markers such as lactate for risk stratification and guidance of fluid resuscitation, procalcitonin for assessing risk of bacterial infections and guiding therapeutic decisions about initiation and duration of antimicrobial therapy, and recently proadrenomedullin for early mortality prediction and site-of-care decisions in respiratory infections, have shown to improve patient management.
   Summary
   For few biomarkers, recent study results demonstrate that well defined clinical protocols have the potential to guide decisions about the individual risk stratification and treatment of patients with suspicion of sepsis ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes. For other biomarkers, promising observation data have been put forward, but their potential needs to be evaluated in large-scale, well designed prospective intervention studies before clinical use can be recommended.

TI  - The Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness of Public-Access Defibrillation
T2  - CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Many sudden cardiac deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). The use of defibrillators in hospitals or by outpatient emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can save many cardiac-arrest victims. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) permit defibrillation by trained first responders and laypersons. AEDs are available at most public venues, and vast sums of money are spent installing and maintaining these devices. AEDs have been evaluated in a variety of public and private settings. AEDs accurately identify malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and frequently result in successful defibrillation. Prompt application of an AED shows a greater number of patients in VF compared with initial rhythms documented by later-arriving EMS personnel. Survival is greatest when the AED is placed within 3 to 5 minutes of a witnessed collapse. Community-based studies show increased cardiac-arrest survival when first responders are equipped with AEDs rather than waiting for paramedics to defibrillate. Wide dissemination of AEDs throughout a community increases survival from cardiac arrest when the AED is used; however, the AEDs are utilized in a very small percentage of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. AEDs save very few lives in residential units such as private homes or apartment complexes. AEDs are cost effective at sites where there is a high density of both potential victims and resuscitators. Placement at golf courses, health clubs, and similar venues is not cost effective; however, the visible devices are good for public awareness of the problem of sudden cardiac death and provide reassurance to patrons.

TI  - Surviving Sudden Cardiac Arrest: A Pilot Qualitative Survey Study of Survivors
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Research describing survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) has centered on quantifying functional ability, perceived quality of life, and neurocognitive assessment. Many gaps remain, however, regarding survivors' psychosocial perceptions of life in the aftermath of cardiac arrest. An important influence upon those perceptions is the presence of support and its role in a survivor's life. An Internet-based pilot survey study was conducted to gather data from SCA survivors and friends and/or family members (FFMs) representing their support system. The survey was distributed to members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation (SCAF) via the Internet by SCAF leadership. Questions included both discrete multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Inductive thematic analyses were completed by three independent researchers trained in qualitative research methodology to identify primary themes consistent among study participants until thematic saturation was achieved. No statistical inferences were made. A total of 205 surveys were returned over the 5-month study period (July to November 2013); nine were received blank, leaving 196 surveys available for review. Major themes identified for survivors (N=157) include the significance of and desire to share experiences with others; subculture identification (unique experience from those suffering a heart attack); and the need to seek a new normal, both personally and inter-personally. Major themes identified for FFMs (N=39) include recognition of loved one's memory loss; a lack of information at discharge, including expectations after discharge; and concern for the patient experiencing another cardiac arrest. This pilot, qualitative survey study suggests several common themes important to survivors, and FFMs, of cardiac arrest. These themes may serve as a basis for future patient-centered focus groups and the development of patient-centered guidelines for patients and support persons of those surviving cardiac arrest.

TI  - Use of artificial intelligence in predicting in-hospital cardiac and respiratory arrest in an acute care environment-implications for clinical practice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - <bold>Background:</bold> Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can augment clinical decision-making, including prediction, diagnosis, and treatment, in all aspects of medicine. <bold>Research questions:</bold> The current systematic review aims to provide a summary of existing data about the role of machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and respiratory arrest. <bold>Methods:</bold> The study was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science without any restriction were searched to extract relevant manuscripts until October 20, 2023. Additionally, the reference list of all potential studies was searched to identify further relevant articles. Original publications were regarded as eligible if they only recruited adult patients (>= 18 years of age), employed AI/ML algorithms for predicting cardiac arrest, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and respiratory arrest in the setting of critical care, used data gathered from wards with critically ill patients (ICUs, cardiac ICUs, and emergency departments), and were published in English. The following information was extracted: first author, journal, ward, sample size, performance and features of ML and conventional models, and outcomes. <bold>Results:</bold> ML algorithms have been used for cardiac arrest prediction using easily obtained variables as inputs. ML algorithms showed promising results (AUC 0.73-0.96) in predicting cardiac arrest in different settings, including critically ill ICU patients, patients in the emergency department and patients with sepsis, they demonstrated variable performance (AUC 0.54-0.94) in predicting respiratory arrest in COVID-19 patients, as well as other clinical settings. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> ML algorithms have shown promising results in predicting in-hospital cardiac and respiratory arrest using readily available clinical data. These algorithms may enhance early identification of high risk patients and support timely interventions, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity rates. However, the prospective validation of these algorithms and their integration into clinical workflows need further exploration. Introduction

TI  - A case report of familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a novel mutation in the ryanodine receptor 2
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is suspected by clinical characteristics involving fatal arrhythmic events in childhood and adolescence. On the other hand, genetic testing is also important because the mutation site in the specific genes of CPVT is related to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and gene penetrance.Case summary We present a case of a 15-year-old male with a familial history of CPVT and a history of syncope at the age of 5. He experienced a cardiac arrest prompting out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and his circulatory dynamics recovered. Multiple premature ventricular contractions inducted by a treadmill exercise test disappeared after a dosage of verapamil, flecainide, and nadolol, and a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. The novel pathogenic mutation with an insertion of histidine near the C-terminus of the RYR2 protein was identified by genetic testing in this case and his mother.Discussion The RYR2 mutation in this case has not been previously reported and may be an intractable phenotype of CPVT associated with a strong familial history and fatal cardiac events even under adequate medical therapy.

TI  - Case report of a very late dual coronary stent thrombosis in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulability and a high rate of thrombosis. Few cases of coronary stent thrombosis associated with COVID-19 have been reported.
   Case summary In this report, we describe the case of a 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction revealing a very late dual coronary stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending and posterior descending arteries. Ten days prior to admission, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with dexamethasone, which led to rapid clinical improvement. After resuscitation, coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion in the two previous drug-eluting stents (implanted in 2010 and 2018), with a high thrombus burden. He was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient did not present any further complications during his hospital stay and was transferred to a cardiac rehabilitation centre.
   Discussion Dual stent thrombosis is an exceptional event highlighting the high procoagulant state promoted by coronavirus 19. This case suggests that strengthening of antithrombotic therapy in CAD patients presenting with COVID-19 should be discussed.

TI  - Is Hypothermia Helpful in Severe Subarachnoid Hemorrhage? An Exploratory Study on Macro Vascular Spasm, Delayed Cerebral Infarction and Functional Outcome after Prolonged Hypothermia
T2  - CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB  - Background: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is an established treatment after cardiac arrest and growing evidence supports its use as neuroprotective treatment in stroke. Only few and heterogeneous studies exist on the effect of hypothermia in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A novel approach of early and prolonged TH and its influence on key complications in poor-grade SAH, vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) was evaluated. Methods: This observational matched controlled study included 36 poor-grade (Hunt and Hess Scale > 3 and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Scale > 3) SAH patients. Twelve patients received early TH (<48 h after ictus), mild (35 degrees C), prolonged (7 +/- 1 days) and were matched to 24 patients from the prospective SAH database. Vasospasm was diagnosed by angiography, macrovascular spasm serially evaluated by Doppler sonography and DCI was defined as new infarction on follow-up CT. Functional outcome was assessed at 6 months'by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and categorized as favorable (mRS score 0-2) versus unfavorable (mRS score 3-6) outcome. Results: Angiographic vasospasm was present in 71.0% of patients. TH neither influenced occurrence nor duration, but the degree of macrovascular spasm as well as peak spastic velocities were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Frequency of DCI was 87.5% in non-TH vs. 50% in TH-treated patients, translating into a relative risk reduction of 43% and preventive risk ratio of 0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.77, p = 0.036). Favorable functional outcome was twice as frequent in TH-treated patients 66.7 vs. 33.3% of non-TH (p = 0.06). Conclusion: Early and prolonged TH was associated with a reduced degree of macrovascular spasm and significantly decreased occurrence of DCI, possibly ameliorating functional outcome. TH may represent a promising neuroprotective therapy possibly targeting multiple pathways of DCI development, notably macrovascular spasm, which strongly warrants further evaluation of its clinical impact.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundGlobal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (GHIBI) results in variable degrees of neurological dysfunction. Limited data exists to guide prognostication on likelihood of functional recovery. HypothesisProlonged duration of hypoxic-ischemic insult and absence of neurological improvement in the first 72 hours are negative prognostic indicators. AnimalsTen clinical cases with GHIBI. MethodsRetrospective case series describing 8 dogs and 2 cats with GHIBI, including clinical signs, treatment, and outcome. ResultsSix dogs and 2 cats experienced cardiopulmonary arrest or anesthetic complication in a veterinary hospital and were promptly resuscitated. Seven showed progressive neurological improvement within 72 hours of the hypoxic-ischemic insult. Four fully recovered and 3 had residual neurological deficits. One dog presented comatose after resuscitation at the primary care practice. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed diffuse cerebral cortical swelling and severe brainstem compression and the dog was euthanized.Two dogs suffered out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest, secondary to a road traffic accident in 1 and laryngeal obstruction in the other. The first dog was euthanized after MRI that identified diffuse cerebral cortical swelling with severe brainstem compression. In the other dog, spontaneous circulation was recovered after 22 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the dog remained blind, disorientated, and ambulatory tetraparetic with vestibular ataxia and was euthanized 58 days after presentation. Histopathological examination of the brain confirmed severe diffuse cerebral and cerebellar cortical necrosis. Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceDuration of hypoxic-ischemic insult, diffuse brainstem involvement, MRI features, and rate of neurological recovery could provide indications of the likelihood of functional recovery after GHIBI.

TI  - Temporal effect of hemoglobin resuscitation on sepsis survival
T2  - ARTIFICIAL CELLS BLOOD SUBSTITUTES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers are promising resuscitation fluids for hemorrhagic shock. However, infusion of large amounts of Hb-based material could interfere with reticuloendothelial function potentiating postresuscitation sepsis mortality. We investigated the temporal relationship between hemorrhage-resuscitation and sepsis survival. Male SD rats were subjected to hemorrhage and resuscitated with shed blood volumes of purified human hemoglobin solution (HS). Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) 24h before, 0, 24, or 72h after hemorrhage/resuscitation (H/R) and survival was monitored. In additional animals with or without Hb resuscitation, hepatic heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression and HO activity were assessed. Seven-day survival for animals resuscitated with HS prior to sepsis induction was significantly higher than other groups. Animals resuscitated with HS showed hepatic HO-1 gene expression while non-HS resuscitated animals did not. In addition, hepatic HO activity levels were significantly higher in HS resuscitated animals than non-HS resuscitated animals. In conclusion, HS resuscitation does not appear to enhance postresuscitation sepsis mortality. Rather, when conducted concomitantly or prior to sepsis, HS resuscitation appears to improve survival from a subsequent sepsis challenge.

TI  - Neuropsychological Outcomes of Children 1 Year After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Secondary Analysis of 2 Randomized Clinical Trials
T2  - JAMA NEUROLOGY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Little is known about neuropsychological outcomes of children who survived pediatric cardiac arrest (CA).
   OBJECTIVE To describe the neuropsychological outcomes of CA survivors enrolled in the Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital (THAPCA-IH) and Out-of-Hospital (THAPCA-OH) trials and compare the results with the primary outcome measure for these trials.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Secondary analysis of 222 CA survivors aged 1 to 18 years who received chest compressions for 2 minutes or more, remained comatose and required mechanical ventilation after return of circulation, and were enrolled in targeted temperature-management trials from 41 pediatric intensive care units. Data were collected from September 3, 2009, to February 3, 2016, and analyzed from March 10, 2017, to April 20, 2018.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II), a standardized measure of neurobehavioral functioning based on caregiver report (age-corrected mean [SD] scores = 100 [15]), was used to evaluate pre-CA functioning within 24 hours after enrollment; VABS-II<70 indicated significant developmental delays; VABS-II and neuropsychological testing were completed 1year after CA. Neuropsychological testing included the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Mullen) for children younger than 6 years and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and neuropsychological measures of attention, memory, processing speed, and executive functioning for older children.
   RESULTS Of 160 participants who completed neuropsychological testing, 96 (60.0%) were male; the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 2.5 years (1.3-6.1years). Ninety-six (60.0%) were white, 41(25.6%) were black, and 23 (14.4%) were of other/unknown race; 343 (21.2%) were Hispanic or Latino; 119 (74.4%) were non-Hispanic or Latino; and 7 (4.4%) were of unknown ethnicity. One hundred fourteen participants (71.2%) were classified as having favorable outcomes (VABS-II >= 70). Impairments (>2 SD below the mean for age) across neuropsychological measures ranged from 7% to 61%. Correlations between global cognitive and VABS-II scores were strong for younger children (Mullen, r = 0.69-0.87) but moderate for older children (r = 0.21-0.54 for the WASI). Of 111children with favorable outcomes on VABS-II, 25.2% had global cognitive impairment and 30 of 35 older children (85.7%) had selective neuropsychological deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prospectively evaluated cohort of pediatric CA survivors who were initially comatose, although 71.2% were classified as having favorable outcomes, significant neuropsychological deficits were identified in pediatric CA survivors who were classified as having favorable outcomes. The findings provide clinicians with a greater understanding of the spectrum of neuropsychological outcomes of pediatric CA survivors and the complex relationship between standardized caregiver-reported functional outcome measures incorporated in clinical trials and performance-based neuropsychological assessments.

TI  - Influence of prior myocardial infarction on outcome in patients with ischaemic HFrEF: insights from the EVIdence based TreAtment in Heart Failure (EVITA-HF) registry
T2  - CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background There is scarce information about the influence of prior myocardial infarction (pMI) on outcomes in patients (pts) with ischaemic HFrEF. We analysed data from the EVIdence based TreAtment in Heart Failure (EVITA-HF) registry. Methods EVITA-HF comprises web-based case report data on demography, diagnostic measures, adverse events and 1-year follow-up of patients hospitalized for chronic heart failure >= 3 months (CHF) and an ejection fraction <= 40%. In the present study, we focused on the outcomes of pts with and without pMI in ischaemic HFrEF. Results Between February 2009 and November 2015, a total of 2075 consecutive pts with ischaemic HFrEF were included from 16 centres in Germany. A total of 81.2% were male, and the mean age was 71 years. A total of 61.5% of the pts with ischaemic HFrEF had a history of pMI. These pts were treated less often with PCI (20.0 vs. 31.0%, p < 0.001) or CABG (3.8 vs. 7.7%, p < 0.001). They more often received an ICD (40.9 vs. 28.7%, p < 0.001), but less often a CRT-D (11.3 vs. 19.4%, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, pts with pMI had a greater all-cause mortality after 1 year than those without pMI (hazard ratio 1.4; 95% CI, 1.10-1.79, p = 0.007). The combined endpoint of death, resuscitation or ICD shock after 1 year was greater in patients with pMI (20.8 vs. 16.4%, p = 0.03). Mobility was more often reduced in pts with pMI (46.8% vs. 40.1%, p = 0.03), and overall health status was more frequently worse in patients with pMI than in those 12 months ago (23.1 vs. 15.9%, p = 0.01). More than a quarter of the pts with ischaemic HFrEF were anxious or depressive. Conclusion pMI in patients with CHF and ischaemic HFrEF was associated with increased mortality, increased event rates, and worsened health status. Hence, the subgroup of pts with ischaemic HFrEF and pMI is at higher risk and deserves special attention.

TI  - How I Cool Children in Neurocritical Care
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Brain injury is the leading cause of death in our pediatric ICU [Au et al. Crit Care Med 36:A128, 2008]. Clinical care for brain injury remains largely supportive. Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to be effective in improving neurological outcome after adult ventricular-arrhythmia-induced cardiac arrest and neonatal asphyxia, and is under investigation as a neuroprotectant after cardiac arrest and traumatic brain injury in children in our ICU and other centers. To induce hypothermia in children comatose after cardiac arrest we target 32-34A degrees C using cooling blankets and intravenous iced saline as primary methods for induction, for 24-72 h duration with vigilant re-warming. The objective of this article is to share our hypothermia protocol for cooling children with acute brain injury.

TI  - Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Metabolic Resuscitation-A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (RESPOND PICU): Study Protocol and Analysis Plan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Introduction: Septic shock remains amongst the leading causes of childhood mortality. Therapeutic options to support children with septic shock refractory to initial resuscitation with fluids and inotropes are limited. Recently, the combination of intravenous hydrocortisone with high dose ascorbic acid and thiamine (HAT therapy), postulated to reduce sepsis-related organ dysfunction, has been proposed as a safe approach with potential for mortality benefit, but randomized trials in paediatric patients are lacking. We hypothesize that protocolised early use of HAT therapy ("metabolic resuscitation") in children with septic shock is feasible and will lead to earlier resolution of organ dysfunction. Here, we describe the protocol of the Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Metabolic Resuscitation-A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (RESPOND PICU).
   Methods and Analysis: The RESPOND PICU study is an open label randomized-controlled, two-sided multicentre pilot study conducted in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Australia and New Zealand. Sixty children aged between 28 days and 18 years treated with inotropes for presumed septic shock will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either metabolic resuscitation (1 mg/kg hydrocortisone q6h, 30 mg/kg ascorbic acid q6h, 4 mg/kg thiamine q12h) or standard septic shock management. Main outcomes include feasibility of the study protocol and survival free of organ dysfunction censored at 28 days. The study cohort will be followed up at 28-days and 6-months post enrolment to assess neurodevelopment, quality of life and functional status. Biobanking will allow ancillary studies on sepsis biomarkers.
   Ethics and Dissemination: The study received ethical clearance from Children's Health Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/18/QCHQ/49168) and commenced enrolment on June 12th, 2019. The primary study findings will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Transportation of heavily exsanguinated patients - a personal experience
T2  - HEALTHMED
AB  - Introduction: The significant cause of death at traumatized persons is active bleeding which lead on haemorrhagic shock and exsanguinations, which is defined as the most extreme form of hemorrhage, with an initial blood loss of >40%.
   Aim: The goal of this study was to point to the problems observed in the out-of-hospital treatment and transportation of the heavily exsanguinated patients at out-of-hospital conditions and to describe our experience at threatment of the heavily exsanguinated patients.
   Matherial and methods: Study was performed in Clinical Centre of Vojvodina, Institute of Surgery, Clinic of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care in Novi Sad, Serbia and Emergency Medical Services of Vojvodina region, Serbia, as prospective, randomized and controlled study from 2002 to 2009 year. The study included traumatized victims who had symptoms and signs of haemorrhagic shock and exsanguinations with an estimated blood loss of >40%. The approach, blood loss estimation and threatment for all victims were standardised by Advanced Trauma Life Support for doctors. All patients were administered multiple large bore intra-venous catheters (IV) (<17 gauge). Prompt liquid compensation was administered in the following manner: 4 liters of balanced crystalloid solution, 1 liter of 5% Albumin (which is given after first bolus of 1-2 liters of crystalloids) and 1 liter of colloid solution due to need, until arterial pressure and hart rate were normalized with goal of systolic pressure from 90 to 100 mmHg-permissive hypotension. During transportation all patients were sedated, intubated and artificialy ventilated by lung protective strategy. In the study we followed: Causes, transportations, urine output, vital signs, biochemical parameters, outcome to hospital, 1 day and 30 day outcome, pregnant victims outcome to hospital, 1 and 30 day.
   Results: Thirty four traumatized persons, aging from 23 to 35 (28 +/- 2 on average), were primary assesed and threated in the above mention conditions. All thirty four evacuated patients survived the out-of-hospital threatment and transportation. During the transportation no incidents occurred and all patients were satisfactory hemodynamic stabile with an average urine output of 0,89 ml/kg/h. All patients had the following observed blood test results: hematocrit levels between 0.099 +/- 0.02; average blood lactate 3.02 +/- 0.6 mmol/l; and pH-7,23 +/- 0,11. Two patients died (5,42%) 24 hours after being admitted Clinical Centre of Vojvodina and 12(34,8%) victims didn"t survive first 30 days. Overal mortality after 30 day was 40,12% (14 victims). All three pregnant woman survived first 24 hours after admission at Clinical Centre of Vojvodina and surrvied after 30 days.
   Conclusion: Early out-of-hospital inensive threatment of exsanguinated victim, which goal is hemodinamic stabilisation by fluid resuscitation and providing advanced ventilation, during the appropriate and rapid transportation can impove outcome. Threatment of exsanguinated injurys by anaesthesiologysts, emergency or special educated physicians in out-of-hospital condition can contribute also to inproved outcome. Particularlly skills are needed.

TI  - Complications of regional anaesthesia - Incidence and prevention
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
AB  - The complications of failure. neural injury and local anaesthetic toxicity are common to all regional anaesthesia techniques, and individual techniques are associated with specific complications. All potential candidates for regional anaesthesia should be thoroughly evaluated and informed of potential complications. If there is significant risk of injury, then these techniques should he avoided.
   Central neural blockade (CNB) still accounts for more than 70% of regional anaesthesia procedures. Permanent neurological injury is rare (0.02 to 0.07%); however transient injuries do occur and are more common (0.01 to 0.8%). Pain oil injection and paraesthesiae while performing regional anaesthesia are danger signals of potential injury and must not be ignored.
   The incidence of systemic toxicity to local anaesthetics has significantly reduced in the past 30 years, from 0.2 to 0.01%. Peripheral nerve blocks are associated with the highest incidence of systemic toxicity (7.5 per 10 000) and the lowest incidence of serious neural injury (1.9 per 10 000).
   Intravenous regional anaesthesia is one of the safest and most reliable forms of regional anaesthesia for short procedures on the upper extremity. Brachial plexus anaesthesia is one of the most challenging procedures. Axillary blocks are performed most frequently and are safer than supraclavicular approaches.
   Ophthalmic surgery is particularly suited to regional anaesthesia. Serious risks include retrobulbar haemorrhage, brain stem anaesthesia, and globe perforation, but are uncommon with skilled practitioners.
   Postdural puncture headache remains a common complication of epidural and spinal anaesthesia; however, the incidence has decreased significantly in the past 2 to 3 decades from 37 to approximately 1% largely because of advances in needle design.
   Backache is frequently linked with CNB; however, other causes should also be considered. Duration of surgery, irrespective of the anaesthetic technique, seems to be the most important factor. The syndrome of transient neurological symptoms is a form of backache that is associated with patient position and use of lidocaine (lignocaine).
   Disturbances of micturition are a common accompaniment of CNB,especially in elderly males. Hypotension is the most common cardiovascular disturbance associated with CNB. Severe bradycardia and even cardiac arrest have been reported in healthy patients following neuraxial anaesthesia, with a reported incidence of cardiac arrest of 6.4 per 10 000 associated with spinal anaesthesia. Prompt diagnosis, immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and aggressive vasopressor therapy with epinephrine (adrenaline) are required.
   New complications of regional anaesthesia emerge occasionally, e.g. cauda equina syndrome with chloroprocaine, microspinal catheters and 5% hyperbaric lidocaine, and epidural haematoma formation in association with low molecular weight heparin. Even so, after 100 years of experience, most discerning physicians appreciate the benefits of regional anaesthesia.

TI  - The stability of preferences for life-sustaining care among persons with AIDS in the Boston health study
T2  - MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - Background. Clinicians recognize the importance of eliciting patient preferences for life-sustaining care, yet little is known about the stability of those preferences for patients with serious disease. Objectives. To examine the stability of preferences for life-sustaining care among persons with AIDS and to assess factors associated with changes in preferences. Design. Two patient surveys and medical record reviews, administered four months apart in 1990-1991. Setting. Three health care settings in Boston. Patients. 252 of 505 eligible persons with AIDS who participated in both baseline and follow-up surveys. Main outcome measures. A single question assessing desire for cardiac resuscitation and a scale of preferences for life-extending treatment conditional on hypothetical health states. Results. Approximately one-fourth of the respondents changed their minds about life-sustaining care during a four-month period. Of patients who initially desired cardiac resuscitation, 23% decided to forego it four months later, and of those who initially said they would decline care, 34% later said they would accept it. Of those who initially desired any of the life-extending treatments, 25% decided to forego them four months later, and of those who initially said they would decline life-extending care, 24% later said they would accept some treatment. Patients reporting changes in physical function, pain, or suicide ideation were more likely to modify their desires to be resuscitated (all p less than or equal to 0.05). Patients lacking an advance directive, not completing high school, or becoming more severely ill were more likely to change their preferences on the Life Extension scale (p less than or equal to 0.05). Patients who discussed their preferences with at least one physician were just as likely as others to change desires for cardiac resuscitation. Age, gender, race, emotional health, clinical severity, social support, and site of care were not significant correlates of change for either measure. Conclusions. Health care providers should periodically reassess preferences for life-sustaining care, particularly for patients with progressive disease, given the instability in patient preferences. However, predictors of instability may vary with how preferences are measured. In particular, changes in health status may be related to instability of preferences for certain types of treatments.

TI  - Noise or sound management in the neonatal intensive care unit for preterm or very low birth weight infants (Review)
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to diJerent types of stress, including sounds of high intensity. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is 45 decibels (dB). Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants compared to only 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Bringing sound levels under 45 dB can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit; by treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled; or by reducing sound levels at the individual level using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering sound levels, the resulting stress can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.
   This review is an update of one originally published in 2015 and first updated in 2020.
   Objectives To determine the benefits and harms of sound reduction on the growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates.
   Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. On 21 and 22 August 2023, a Cochrane Information Specialist searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, two other databases, two trials registers, and grey literature via Google Scholar and conference abstracts from Pediatric Academic Societies.
   Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in preterm infants (less than 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or less than 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or stepdown unit. We specified three types of intervention: 1) intervention at the unit level (i.e. the entire neonatal department), 2) at the section or room level, or 3) at the individual level (e.g. hearing protection).
   Data collection and analysis We used the standardised review methods of Cochrane Neonatal to assess the risk of bias in the studies. We used the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for dichotomous data. We used the mean difference (MD) for continuous data. Our primary outcome was major neurodevelopmental disability. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
   Main results We included one RCT, which enroled 34 newborn infants randomised to the use of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs for hearing protection. It was a single-centre study conducted at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston, Texas, USA. Earplugs were positioned at the time of randomisation and worn continuously until the infants were 35 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or discharged (whichever came first). Newborns in the control group received standard care.
   The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of silicone earplugs on the following outcomes.
   center dot Cerebral palsy (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 61.74)and Mental Developmental Index (MDI) (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months' corrected age (MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87); no other indicators of major neurodevelopmental disability were reported. center dot Normal auditory functioning at discharge (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.94) center dot All-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 2.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 6.70; RD 0.20, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.50) center dot Weight (kg) at 18 to 22 months' corrected age (MD 0.31, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16) center dot Height (cm) at 18 to 22 months' corrected age (MD 2.70, 95% CI -3.13 to 8.53) center dot Days of assisted ventilation (MD -1.44, 95% CI -23.29 to 20.41) center dot Days of initial hospitalisation (MD 1.36, 95% CI -31.03 to 33.75)
   For all outcomes, we judged the certainty of evidence as very low.
   We identified one ongoing RCT that will compare the eJects of reduced noise levels and cycled light on visual and neural development in preterm infants.
   Authors' conclusions No studies evaluated interventions to reduce sound levels below 45 dB across the whole neonatal unit or in a room within it. We found only one study that evaluated the benefits of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit for hearing protection in preterm infants. The study compared the use of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs in newborns of very low birth weight (less than 1500 g). Considering the very small sample size, imprecise results, and high risk of attrition bias, the evidence based on this research is very uncertain and no conclusions can be drawn.
   As there is a lack of evidence to inform healthcare or policy decisions, large, well designed, well conducted, and fully reported RCTs that analyse different aspects of noise reduction in NICUs are needed. They should report both short- and long-term outcomes.

TI  - Midterm outcomes of emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection in octogenarians
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
CP  - 99th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-Thoracic-Surgery (AATS)
AB  - Objective: The incidence of elderly patients with acute type A aortic dissection is increasing. A recent analysis of the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection failed to show a mortality benefit with surgery compared with medical management in octogenarians. Therefore, we compared our institutional outcomes of emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection in octogenarians versus septuagenarians to understand the outcomes of surgical intervention in elderly patients.
   Methods: From 2002 to 2017, 70 octogenarians (aged >= 80 years) and 165 septuagenarians (70-79 years) underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (N = 235, total). Quality of life was assessed by the RAND Short Form-36 quality of life survey. Midterm clinical and functional data were obtained retrospectively.
   Results: At baseline, septuagenarians had a higher prevalence of diabetes (20.6% vs 5.7%, P = .01). The prevalence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 4.8% versus 10.0% (P = .24) in septuagenarians and octogenarians. The prevalence of cardiogenic shock was 18.2% versus 27.1% (P = .17). Thirty-day/in-hospital mortality was 21.2% versus 28.6% (P = .29). Multivariable logistic regression identified cardiogenic shock as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 10.07; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-44.03) in octogenarians. Survival at 5 years was 49.7% (42.1%-58.6%) versus 34.2% (23.9%-48.8%) in septuagenarians and octogenarians, respectively. Responses to the quality of life survey were no different between septuagenarians and octogenarians across all 8 quality of life categories.
   Conclusions: Clinical outcomes after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection are similar in octogenarians and septuagenarians. For discharged survivors, quality of life remains favorable and does not differ between the 2 groups.

T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
AB  - Background: Even in patients who survive resuscitation through multidisciplinary treatment, minor persistent symptoms can make hospital discharge difficult. Herein, we report a case of myocardial infarction with intractable symptoms following resuscitation, which were successfully treated using Kampo medicine. Case presentation: A 71-year-old man experienced intractable cough and hiccups following resuscitation for acute myocardial infarction. Despite successful invasive treatment for his cardiac condition, the patient's persistent symptoms hindered his recovery and discharge from hospital. The patient was diagnosed with qi and blood deficiency, qi stagnation, and fluid retention, before being prescribed the Kampo medicine "bukuryoingohangekobokuto (BRIHK)". Within days of treatment initiation, his symptoms notably improved, allowing him to be discharged. Conclusion: This case highlights the potential of Kampo medicine for addressing post-resuscitation symptoms that are refractory to conventional treatments, and emphasizes the importance of integrating Kampo medicine with Western medical practices to enhance patient care and quality of life.

TI  - Neuroprotection by Methylene Blue in Cerebral Global Ischemic Injury Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption and Brain Pathology: A Review
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Transient global ischemic cerebral injury is a consequence of cardiac arrest and accounts for approximately 450,000 annual deaths with a mortality of approximately 90%. Serious morbidity follows for many of the survivors and up to 16% of patients achieving restoration of spontaneous circulation develop brain death. Other survivors are left with persistent cognitive impairment such as memory and sensimotor deficits, reducing quality of life and resulting in heavy costs on society. Many studies over the years have been devoted to improving outcome after cardiac arrest and have, to a certain degree succeeded, especially locally in areas where improvement of ambulance organizations have been effective. In spite of this serious problems remain and the chances of cerebral survival need to increase if over-all results, i.e. survival as well as cognitive function, are to improve. Methylene blue, a textile dye synthesized in the late 19th century has also been used in medicine for different purposes. One of its effects is to increase systemic blood pressure, but other effects have been documented, among which are its neuroprotective effects well-noted during the last few years. In this review we have appraised these findings in relation to global ischemic injury.

TI  - Plasma growth differentiation factor 15 levels for predicting serious adverse events and bleeding in acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective observational study
T2  - POLISH ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE-POLSKIE ARCHIWUM MEDYCYNY WEWNETRZNEJ
AB  - INTRODUCTION Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine induced in the myocardium by pressure overload and ischemia, has a well-established prognostic role for diseases of the left ventricle. Plasma GDF-15 concentrations were shown to predict bleeding events in patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation.
   OBJECTIVES To investigate the prognostic value of GDF-15 in acute pulmonary embolism (PE).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a prospective observational study of 77 patients hospitalized for PE. The median length of hospital stay and follow-up was 9 days. Plasma GDF-15 levels were measured using an automated sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The outcome measures were: 1) in-hospital serious adverse events (SAE; death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, need for urgent reperfusion therapy, catecholamine administration), and 2) major bleeding or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding.
   RESULTS There were 12 SAE and 5 bleeding events. The median (interquartile range) GDF-1 5 concentration at admission was 2354 ng/l (1151-4750 ng/l). GDF-15 concentrations increased according to risk subgroup. Patients with serious adverse events or bleeding events had higher baseline concentrations of GDF-15 (median [interquartile range], 3460 ng/l [2 531-12 363 ng/l] vs 2034 ng/I [1121-4449 ng/l]; P = 0.01). The area under the curve for GDF-15, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations for predicting SAE was similar, the area under the curve of GDF-15 levels for predicting bleeding was 0.783 (95% CI, 0.62-0.946; P = 0.001) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.567-0.853; P = 0.004) for predicting any adverse event. In the multivariable analysis, GDF-15 greater than 1680 ng/l emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (odds ratio, 8.9; P = 0.047).
   CONCLUSION Plasma GDF-15 concentrations may be a promising biomarker for predicting hemodynamic destabilization and bleeding complications in PE.

TI  - Family experiences and health outcomes following a loved ones? hospital discharge or death after cardiac arrest: A scoping review
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Synthesise the existing literature on experiences and health outcomes of family members of adult cardiac arrest patients either after hospital discharge or death and identify gaps and targets for future research. Methods: Following recommended scoping review guidelines and reporting framework, we developed an a priori protocol and searched five large biomedical databases for all relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language through 8/8/2022. Studies reporting either on the experiences or health outcomes of family members of adult cardiac arrest patients who survived to hospital discharge (i.e., co-survivors) or bereaved family members were included. Study characteristics were extracted and findings were reviewed for co-survivors and bereaved family members. We summarised practice recommendations and evidence gaps as reported by the studies. Results: Of 44 articles representing 3,598 family members across 15 countries and 5 continents, 89% (n = 39) were observational. Co-survivors described caregiving challenges and difficulty transitioning to life at home after hospital discharge. Co-survivors as well as bereaved family members reported significant and persistent psychological burden. Enhanced communication, information on what to expect after hospital discharge or the death of their loved ones, and emotional support were among the top recommendations to improve family members' experiences and health outcomes. Conclusion: Family members develop significant emotional burdens and physical symptoms as they deal with their loved ones' critical illnesses and uncertain, unpredictable recovery. Interventions designed to reduce family members' psychological distress and uncertainty prevalent throughout the illness trajectory of their loved ones admitted with cardiac arrest are needed.

TI  - Prognostic accuracy of antenatal neonatology consultation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonatologists provide antenatal counseling to support shared decision-making for complicated pregnancies. Poor or ambiguous prognostication can lead to inappropriate treatment and parental distress. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of antenatal prognosticaltion.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort was assembled from a prospectively populated database of all outpatient neonatology consultations. On the basis of the written consultation, fetuses were characterized by diagnosis groups (multiple anomalies or genetic disorders, single major anomaly and obstetric complications), assigned to five prognostic categories (I= survivable, IIA= uncertain but likely survivable, II= uncertain,IIB= uncertain but likely non-survivable, Ill non-survivable) and two final outcome categories (fetal demise/in-hospital neonatal death or survival to hospital discharge). When possible, status at last follow-up was recorded for those discharged from the hospital. Prognostic accuracy was assessed using unweighted, multi-level likelihood ratios (LRs).
   RESULTS: The final cohort included 143 fetuses/infants distributed nearly evenly among the three diagnosis groups. Over half (64%) were assigned an uncertain prognosis, but most of these could be divided into 'likely survivable' or 'likely non-survivable' subgroups. Overall survival for the entire cohort was 62% (89/143). All but one of the fetuses assigned a non-survivable prognosis suffered fetal demise or died before hospital discharge. The neonatologist's antenatal prognosis accurately predicted the probability of survival by prognosis group (LR I = 4.56, LR IIA = 10.53, LR II=4.71, LR IIB=0.099, LR III = 0.040). The LRs clearly differentiated between fetuses with high and low probability of survival. Eleven fetuses (7.7%) had misalignment between the predicted prognosis and outcome. Five died before discharge despite being given category I or IIA prognoses, whereas six infants with category 118 or III prognoses survived to discharge, though some of these were discharged to hospice care.
   CONCLUSIONS: The neonatologist's antenatal prognosis accurately predicted fetal neonatal outcome. Infants with non -survivable or uncertain but likely poor prognoses had a very low probability of survival, whereas those with good or uncertain prognoses had a high probability of survival. There were few cases of prognostic failure with most occurring in fetuses with one major or multiple anomalies. The few cases of prognostic failure suggest a need for caution. Honest disclosure of prognostic uncertainty and shared decision-making with families utilizing their personal values is critical in the antenatal encounter.

TI  - Quantitative cistern effacement and reduced gray to white matter ratio for prognostication in early brain computed tomography of patients with cardiac arrest
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Background: The impact of cerebral edema on brain cells and ventricles in cardiac arrest patients can manifest as effacement of cortical sulci, diminished ventricle size, altered gray matter to white matter ratio (GWR), and increased optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in brain CT scans. However, a complete investigation of GWR in whole lobes, quantitative cistern size, and comprehensive comparison of various brain CT parameters has not been conducted. This study aimed to comprehensively compare various early brain CT parameters along with conventional significant variables in relation to poor neurological outcome and diffuse cortical necrosis.Methods: This retrospective study included 86 adult patients with cardiac arrest who underwent brain CT/MRI. GWRs, the distance of the posterior ambient cistern, and ONSD in early brain CT and regions of interest (ROIs) in brain MRI were measured and analyzed along with clinical characteristics.Results: ROIs in the putamen and parietal white matter showed significant differences (p = 0.05, p = 0.022, respectively). The distance of the posterior ambient cistern and the GWR of the putamen and parietal white matter were newly developed predictors that were not used previously and demonstrated a significant correlation with the presence of diffuse cortical necrosis (OR 0.4, p = 0.006, AUC 0.637; OR 0.478, p = 0.02, AUC 0.603, respectively) or poor neurological outcomes (AUC 0.637, AUC 0.603, respectively), but were not more significant than pupil reflex (OR 0.06, p < 0.001). ONSD was not significantly associated with the outcomes.Conclusions: Quantitative cistern effacement and reduced GWR of the putamen and parietal white matter in early brain CT measurements of cardiac arrest patients were promising predictors in early brain CT for prognostication, but compared with clinical characteristics, the clinical significance of the CT predictors was not considerable. The relationship and clinical significance between the parameters in early brain CT and the outcomes might have to be separately considered.

TI  - Admission to intensive care of very old patients
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - The extent of the problem Because of the costs of intensive care, there is a possibility that access to this sector may be limited for those above a certain age. It would therefore appear necessary to develop an ethical clinical strategy in order to assess as precisely as possible and on individual level, the benefits and risks of these techniques, since age itself is simply a criterion among so many others. Among the elements that are important for the decision is the respect of the patient's wish, when it can be obtained since this is a fundamental point. In studies conducted in the United States, 50 to 90% of the elderly persons interviewed did not wish to be resuscitated in the case of cardiac arrest.
   Criteria for admission The decision to admit an elderly patient in an intensive care unit must take into account the functional state of the patient, appreciated on daily activity and mobility scores and the neuro-psychological assessment, before hospitalization. In parallel, the severity of the underlying disease and the impact on visceral failures, assessed by the severity scores on admission appear to be more reliable prognostic elements than the patients' age itself.
   Following resuscitation The quality of life of elderly patients within the months following resuscitation is difficult to assess, but is considered as acceptable in the majority of surviving patients. In practice The choice of admission in intensive care of an elderly patient requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes into account the patient's and/or family's wishes, the benefit/risk ratio of the technical act but which also, in certain cases, bears in mind the principle of end of life and the patient's dignity.

TI  - Expanding the criteria of renal kidneys for transplantation: use of donors with acute renal failure
T2  - NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Background. Increased numbers of patients waiting for renal transplantation have led to widening selection criteria for grafts. Thus, we have evaluated the outcome of transplanted kidneys procured in the presence of acute renal failure (ARF).
   Methods. Transplant patients (n = 52) with a kidney procured with ARF were studied. Clinical data from donors and recipients, serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], cold ischaemia duration, time to urine flow recovery or renal function recovery, and the number of haemodialysis sessions, were collected retrospectively.
   Results. Mean donor age was 45.7 +/- 12.7 years, and the mean SCr at the time of harvesting was 276.3 +/- 104.2 mu mol/l. Recipients' mean age was 51.1 +/- 12.1 years. After transplantation, recovery of renal function was observed after 7.6 +/- 7.1 days, and required 1.9 +/- 3.0 haemodialysis sessions. SCr was 124.6 +/- 49.5 mu mol/l, and eGFR was 56.2 +/- 19.8 ml/min at last follow-up. eGFR was significantly lower if the donor's death was due to stroke or cerebral haemorrhage (CH), or if the donors had previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) (P < 0.02). Patients with eGFR of <50 ml/min (n = 23) had donors who were older, and whose cause of death was more frequently related to CVD factors or to CH/stroke (P < 0.03). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age of recipient, gender of the donor or recipient, cold ischaemia time, occurrence of cardiac arrest, collapse or acute rejection. Linear regression analysis indicated that donor age and occurrence of acute rejection were independent factors associated with eGFR.
   Conclusions. ARF before organ procurement does not have a negative effect on subsequent renal function. However, old age, CVD risk factors or CH, and late renal function recovery after transplantation are correlated with subsequent lower renal function. Thus, renal grafts with ARF can be used for renal transplantations.

TI  - Spontaneous perforation and intraabdominal abscess due to Meckel's diverticulum revealed on SPECT/CT with 99m-technetium pertechnetate A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is common congenital abnormality of gastrointestinal tract, only about 6.4% of patients become symptomatic. A smaller minority develop potential fatal complications such as hemorrhage, perforation, abscess, and bowel obstruction.
   Patient concerns: A 15-year-old boy with history of appendicitis was admitted due to worsening abdominal pain and nausea for 1 day. The physical examination showed the abdomen was soft, with the diffuse tenderness to palpation and voluntary guarding.
   Diagnosis: Abdominal computed tomography showed a probable MD in the distal ileum. Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) fusion imaging revealed the focal concentration at the right lower quadrant of abdomen region.
   Intervention: After the initial management including antibiotic administration and intravenous fluid resuscitation, MD with perforation and localized suppurative peritonitis was confirmed in surgery. The patient underwent a diverticulectomy. Histological examination was confirmed as MD with focal heterotopic gastric tissue.
   Outcomes: After surgery, the patient had uneventful recovery during 3 months follow-up.
   Lessons: Spontaneous perforation and intraabdominal abscess due to MD is very rare. Accurate diagnosis of MD remains challenging as clinical symptoms from these complications occur nonspecifically. SPECT/CT fusion imaging is critical for prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis in the successful management of this rarely life-threating complication.

TI  - Cardiac function in Ghanaian children with severe malaria
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The aim was to assess whether impaired cardiac function contributes to symptoms of severe malaria in general or to metabolic acidosis in particular in children living in endemic regions.
   In a prospective observational investigation, 183 children with severe malaria were investigated for hemodynamic status and cardiac function upon admission (day 0) and after recovery (day 42). Cardiac function parameters were assessed by cardiac ultrasonography. Blood gas analyses and cardiac enzymes were measured at hospitalization and follow-up. Differences in subgroups with and without metabolic acidosis as well as other severe malaria-defining symptoms and conditions were assessed.
   Cardiac index (CI) was significantly increased on day 0 compared to day 42 (5.8 ml/m(2), SD +/- A 1.8 ml/m(2), versus 4.7 ml/m(2), SD +/- A 1.4 ml/m(2); P < 0.001). CI correlated negatively with hemoglobin levels but not with parameters indicating impaired tissue perfusion or metabolic acidosis. Parasite levels had a significant influence on metabolic acidosis but not on CI. Alterations related to cardiac function, hemoglobin levels and metabolic acidosis were most prominent in children younger than 2 years.
   Increased CI reflecting high output status is associated with low hemoglobin levels while metabolic acidosis is linked to parasite levels.

TI  - Premature baby with extreme hyponatraemia (95 mmol per litre): a case report
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: Whilst mild neonatal hyponatraemia is common and relatively harmless, extreme hyponatraemia of 95 mmol per litre has never been reported in a premature baby and such a level could be associated with immediate as well as long-lasting detrimental effects on health.
   Case presentation: Twenty-four days old baby boy born at 28 weeks gestation (triplet one) unexpectedly became moribund with hypovolaemic shock and was found to have blood sodium of 95 mmol per litre. Diagnostic work up revealed a combination of a urinary tract infection, inadvertently low sodium provision with donor breast milk, and weak renin-angiotensin-aldosterone response. Commencement of treatment with intravenous fluids and extra sodium led to unanticipated diuresis and faster than expected increase of sodium level. Ultimately, treatment resulted in clinical recovery and normalisation of sodium level, which subsequently remained normal with no additional sodium supplementation. Follow up revealed mild spastic diplegia.
   Conclusion: Continuous monitoring and daily medical reviews may not be sensitive enough to recognise development of extreme hyponatraemia. Blood sodium levels should be monitored closely and any abnormalities promptly addressed. Treatment of hypovolaemic hyponatraemia should be centred on fluid resuscitation, anticipation of "paradoxical" diuresis, and blood sodium correction rate of 8 to 10 mmol per litre per day.

TI  - THE DUBLIN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF INTRAPARTUM FETAL HEART-RATE MONITORING
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - In a randomized controlled trial involving 12,964 women, a policy of continuous electronic intrapartum fetal heart monitoring was compared with an alternative policy of intermittent auscultation, both policies including an option to measure fetal scalp blood pH. Women allocated to electronic fetal heart monitoring had shorter labors and received less analgesia. The cesarean delivery rates were 2.4% for electronic fetal heart monitoring and 2.2% for intermittent auscultation but this small difference arose from the identification of nearly twice as many fetuses with low scalp pH (< 7.20) in the electronic fetal heart monitoring group. The forceps delivery rate was 8.2% in the electronic fetal heart monitoring group compared with 6.3% in the intermittent auscultation group; this excess was explained by more instrumental deliveries prompted by fetal heart rate abnormalities. There were 14 stillbirths and neonatal deaths in each group, with a similar distribution of causes. There were no apparent differences in the rates of low Apgar scores, need for resuscitation, or transfer to the special care nursery. Cases of neonatal seizures and persistent abnormal neurological signs followed by survival were twice as frequent in the intermittent auscultation group; this differential effect was related to duration of labor. Follow-up at 1 yr of babies who survived neonatal seizures revealed 3 clearly abnormal infants in each group. The implications of these findings for both  theory and practice are discussed.

TI  - Identifying organ donors attended by prehospital healthcare professionals - A scoping review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY NURSING
AB  - Introduction: Organ donation is a life-saving intervention that provides hope for patients with end-stage organ failure, improving their longevity and quality of life. However, the demand for organs far exceeds the supply, leading to a significant disparity between patients on transplant waiting lists and the availability of suitable organs. To address this issue, innovative strategies, such as uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) programs, have been proposed to expand the donor pool to the prehospital setting. Aim: This study aimed to systematically map the literature and comprehensively evaluate the involvement of prehospital healthcare professionals in identifying potential organ donors, as well as the barriers and systems impacting this process. Methods: A scoping literature review was conducted guided by the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. Four electronic databases and grey literature were searched for articles examining the participation of prehospital healthcare professionals in the organ or tissue donation process. Relevant data were extracted, organised into narrative and tabular formats, and presented. Results: A total of 33 articles were included for analysis, predominantly focusing on uDCD programs. The review identified a limited evidence-base regarding the role of prehospital healthcare professionals in organ donation. Four common themes emerged: discrepancies in criteria, decision-making processes, bridging strategies, and ethical considerations. Conclusion: This scoping literature review highlights the significant role of prehospital healthcare professionals in identifying and recruiting organ donors from non-traditional settings. Established uDCD systems show promise in alleviating the burden on transplant waitlists. However, there is a lack of consensus on enrolment criteria, transportation, and ethical considerations for uDCD. Further research is needed to address these gaps, establish evidence-based guidelines, and ensure the efficient and ethical utilisation of potential organ donors from unconventional settings.

TI  - A Case Report on Life-Threatening Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Rare Presentation of Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Appendix
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN SURGERY
AB  - Introduction. A life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding from mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a rare occurrence. Diagnosing and management of such a condition are challenging. Case Presentation. A 73-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with intermittent per rectal bleeding for two weeks, which progressed to the passage of a large number of blood clots and fresh blood. He had features of class III shock on admission. An endoscopic evaluation followed initial resuscitation to locate the source of bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed a large blood clot at the opening of the appendicular orifice with no active bleeding. Oesophagoduodenoscopy, contrast-enhanced CT abdomen, and CT angiogram findings were unremarkable. Due to repeated episodes of rebleeding leading to haemodynamic instability, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. A retrocaecal appendix was noticed with a macroscopically suspicious-looking dilated tip adhered to the posterior caecal wall. Right hemicolectomy was performed as the lesion was suspicious and to stop bleeding from the site. Ileocolic side-to-side hand-sewn anastomosis was performed using 3/0 polyglactin. Postoperatively, per rectal bleeding was settled. Microscopy revealed appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma with AJCC staging of pT3NoMx. The patient was discharged on postoperative day seven and referred to oncological management. He was offered six cycles of chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin. At the six-month follow-up visit, the patient had no features of recurrence clinically. Conclusion. Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix can rarely present as life-threatening lower GI bleeding. Prompt resuscitation, endoscopic evaluation, and operative management with right hemicolectomy and chemotherapy provided a good outcome.</p>

TI  - Treatment Outcome and Risk Factors Associated with Diffuse Axonal Injury in Patients with Moderate to Severe Head Injury
T2  - TURKISH NEUROSURGERY
AB  - AIM: To evaluate diffuse axonal injury (DAI) patients according to DAI stage to identify risk factors that may affect clinical outcome.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: A total of 992 traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients visited our hospital between 2011 and 2016. Thirty-seven patients diagnosed with DAI were enrolled in this study and stratified by DAI stage: Stage I, 20 patients (54.1%); Stage II, 4 patients (10.8%); and Stage III, 13 patients (35.1%).
   RESULTS: The mean age and the median follow-up period were 45.43 years and 13 months, respectively. Patient demographic data and clinical findings on admission showed no differences according to DAI stage, except for the revised trauma score (RTS) (p=0.026). In univariate analysis, stages I and II vs. III (p=0.001) and stages I vs. II and III (p=0.019), transfusion within 24 hours of visit (p=0.033), shock or cardiac arrest (p=0.006), traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (T-SAH) (p=0.011), and subdural hematoma (SDH) (p=0.009) were significantly correlated with Glasgow outcome score (GOS). In multivariate analysis, DAI stage I and II vs. III (p=0.005) and SDH (p=0.040) were significant.
   CONCLUSION: Clinically, Stage II was more correlated with Stage I, rather than stage III. Stage III showed a much poorer outcome compared to stages I and II. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be promptly performed in all TBI patients when a patient's level of consciousness and cranialcomputed tomography (CT) does not match, as there is a possibility of stage III DAI.

TI  - Delayed Adult Gastric Perforation Following Insertion of a Feeding Nasogastric Tube
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Although complications of a nasogastric tube (NGT) are identified and managed in daily clinical practice, gastric perforation following NGT insertion is a serious and rarely reported condition in adults. We present a case of a 71-year-old male who was brought to the hospital after having a cardiac arrest. Following stabilisation and receiving an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he required NGT for feeding purposes. A few days later, abdominal distension was noted, and chest imaging was requested mainly for worsening respiratory parameters. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed gastric perforation and a misplaced NGT. Being a high-risk patient and in the absence of peritonism and frank sepsis, conservative management was adopted and included proton pump inhibitors (PPI), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), stomach aspiration via a Ryle tube and consideration of imaging-guided drainage. No risk factor for gastric perforation was identified in this presented case. The stable course of follow-up suggested sealed perforation; however, he died due to an extensive intracardiac thrombus. Though this incidence did not contribute directly to the patient's death, it definitely added to the overall morbidity and negatively influenced the management of the other medical conditions.
   For complement, we also report a review of the ten similar cases in the literature, highlighting the associated risk factors, relevant clinical challenges, lines of management executed. The main aim of this case report is to enhance doctors' awareness of this serious complication, especially in patients with risk factors, and its diagnostic dilemmas. Early recognition and prompt intervention are recommended for a better outcome.

TI  - 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emitted tomography for predicting neurological outcome in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - Background: F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emitted tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising yet unexplored functional neuroimaging tool in the study and prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) after cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. The present study aimed to correlate clinical data and FDG-PET scans for both analysis and prognostic use. Methods: 24 patients from an intensive rehabilitation ward were retrospectively evaluated. Data collected included age, gender, cause of anoxic event, length of stay in acute and rehabilitation units, discharge destination, and evaluation at admission and discharge using three clinical scales to assess cognitive function, independence and disability. Subjects were identified as good and bad performers on the basis of quantitative analysis of FDG-PET scans with the Cortex ID software. The relation between glucose uptake reduction and neurological outcome was evaluated. Results: good and bad performers presented no statistically significant difference regarding demographical data and in-hospital length of stay. The two categories significantly differed for impairment and disability levels both at admission and at discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Conclusions: FDG-PET considerably facilitates the early identification of patients with HIE who will have poor neurological outcome and could inform planning for their rehabilitation and care.

TI  - Heterogeneous distribution of substrates between the endocardium and epicardium promotes ventricular fibrillation in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy
T2  - EUROPACE
AB  - Whether the distribution of scar in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) plays a role in predicting different types of ventricular arrhythmias is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of scar distribution in patients with ARVC.
   We studied 80 consecutive ARVC patients (46 men, mean age 47 +/- 15 years) who underwent an electrophysiological study with ablation. Thirty-four patients receive both endocardial and epicardial mapping. Abnormal endocardial substrates and epicardial substrates were characterized. Three groups were defined according to the epicardial and endocardial scar gradient (< 10%: transmural, 10-20%: intermediate, > 20%: horizontal, as groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Sinus rhythm electrograms underwent a Hilbert-Huang spectral analysis and were displayed as 3D Simultaneous Amplitude Frequency Electrogram Transformation (SAFE-T) maps, which represented the arrhythmogenic potentials. The baseline characteristics were similar between the three groups. Group 3 patients had a higher incidence of fatal ventricular arrhythmias requiring defibrillation and cardiac arrest during the initial presentation despite having fewer premature ventricular complexes. A larger area of arrhythmogenic potentials in the epicardium was observed in patients with horizontal scar. The epicardial-endocardial scar gradient was independently associated with the occurrence of fatal ventricular arrhythmias after a multivariate adjustment. The total, ventricular tachycardia, and VF recurrent rates were higher in Group 3 during 38 +/- 21 months of follow-up.
   For ARVC, the epicardial substrate that extended in the horizontal plane rather than transmurally provided the arrhythmogenic substrate for a fatal ventricular arrhythmia circuit.

TI  - Portal vein reconstruction using bovine pericardium graft after traumatic injury in a 6-year-old male: A case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction: Traumatic portal vein injury (PVI) is a rare but life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, the management of complex portal vein injuries remains challenging.<br /> Case presentation: A 6-year-old male presented with abdominal trauma after being hit by a motor rickshaw. Despite inconclusive initial diagnostic imaging including a bedside abdominal ultrasound showing minimal ascites, the deterioration of all clinical parameters prompted an exploratory laparotomy.Intra-operative exploration revealed a transected portal vein with significant tissue loss and an avulsed common bile duct. Portal vein reconstruction was done using commercially available bovine pericardium, which was tubularized and grafted proximally and distally with polypropylene 6-0. Intra-operative Doppler ultrasound confirmed the successful restoration of portal venous flow. Additionally, we closed the common bile duct and did a cholecysto-duodenostomy to restore bile flow. Postoperative anticoagulation therapy included unfractionated heparin (10U/kg/hour) for 72 hours followed by aspirin (75mg daily) for six months, frequently monitoring the patency of the graft by Doppler ultrasound. He had a brief cardiac arrest 3 days after the operation due to ventilator-associated complications and suffered an ischemic brain injury that led to sensorimotor deficits. After an initial recovery in the intensive care unit, he was transferred to a rehabilitation unit and was discharged on postoperative day 19. At six-month of follow-up, Doppler ultrasound have confirmed graft patency. Liver function tests remain normal.<br /> Conclusion: Bovine pericardium grafts appear to be a valuable option for the management of complex portal vein injuries.

TI  - Peritransplantation ruxolitinib administration is safe and effective in patients with myelofibrosis: a pilot open-label study
T2  - BLOOD ADVANCES
AB  - We report results of our prospective pilot trial evaluating safety/feasibility of peritransplantation ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis treatment. Primary objectives were to determine safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib was administered at 2 dose levels (DLs) of 5 and 10 mg twice daily, with fludarabine/melphalan conditioning regimen and tacrolimus/sirolimus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We enrolled 6 and 12 patients at DL1 and DL2, respectively. Median age at transplantation was 65 years (range, 25-73). Per Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System, 4 patients were high and 14 intermediate risk. Peripheral blood stem cells were graft source from matched sibling (n = 5) or unrelated (n = 13) donor. At each DL, 1 patient developed dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs): grade 3 cardiac and gastrointestinal with grade 4 pulmonary DLTs in DL1, and grade 3 kidney injury in DL2. All patients achieved engraftment. Grade 2 to 4 and 3 to 4 acute GVHD cumulative incidence was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6-47) and 11% (95% CI, 3-41), respectively. Cumulative incidence of 1-year chronic GVHD was 42% (95% CI, 24-74). With 22.6-month (range, 6.2-25.8) median follow-up in surviving patients, 1-year overall and progression-free survival were 77% (95% CI, 50-91) and 71% (95% CI, 44-87), respectively. Causes of death (n = 4) were cardiac arrest, GVHD, respiratory failure, and refractory GVHD of liver. Our results show peritransplantation ruxolitinib is safe and well tolerated at MTD of 10 mg twice daily and associated with dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and cytokine profile. Early efficacy data are highly promising in high-risk older patients with myelofibrosis.

TI  - Camrelizumab-Related Lethal Arrhythmias and Myasthenic Crisis in a Patient with Metastatic Thymoma
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged in recent years as promising treatment options for several malignant tumors. However, ICI therapy has also been associated with various immune-related adverse events (irAEs), especially for patients with preexisting autoimmune status, which sometimes can be life-threatening. A 68-year-old woman diagnosed with metastatic thymoma was treated with camrelizumab, a new ICI, as her antitumor protocol. Eleven days after the first dose of camrelizumab, the patient was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and poor appetite. Workups on admission indicated dramatically elevated transaminase, troponin I, creatine kinase, and a new-onset conduction abnormality on electrocardiography. After detailed evaluation, ICI-related myocarditis, myositis, and hepatitis were diagnosed, and therapies including intravenous methylprednisolone were administered. Coronary angiography was performed to exclude acute coronary syndrome due to dynamic electrocardiography changes on day 3. She lapsed into a coma with respiratory muscle failure on the next day, which was highly suspected of myasthenic crisis. Mechanical ventilation and higher dose of methylprednisolone plus intravenous immunoglobulin were applied immediately. However, the third atrioventricular block occurred within the same day, and an urgent temporary pacemaker was placed. More seriously, refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred subsequently, and even multiple antiarrhythmic drugs used in combination failed to alleviate the VT storm. On day 5 of hospitalization, she suffered from ventricular fibrillation and died of cardiac arrest. In clinical practice, close follow-up should be conducted after ICI treatment, especially for patients already with or at high risk for autoimmune disorders. A multidisciplinary team approach is of importance for better management of patients with multiple organ involvement.

TI  - Clinical significance of J-wave in elite athletes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - The J-wave pattern on 12-lead ECG is traditionally defined as a positive deflection at junction between the end of the QRS and the beginning of the ST-segment. This pattern has recently been associated with increased risk for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation in the absence of cardiovascular disease.
   The interest for the clinical significance of J-wave pattern as a potential ECG hallmark of high risk for cardiac arrest has recently been reinforced by the growing practice of ECG screening, such as occurs in large population of young competitive athletes.
   The available scientific evidence shows that the J-wave pattern is relatively common in trained athletes (ranging from 14% to 44%) and, differently from subjects who suffered from ventricular fibrillation, commonly localized in lateral leads while it is relatively rare to be found in inferior leads. Furthermore the J-wave pattern has been demonstrated to be a dynamic phenomenon related to the training status, with the larger prominence at the peak of training and with an inverse relation between magnitude of J-wave and heart rate. In addition the J-wave pattern is usually associated with other ECG changes, such as increased QRS voltages and ST-segment elevation, as well as LV remodeling, suggesting that it likely represents another expression of the physiologic athlete's heart.
   Finally the scientific data available demonstrated that during a medium follow-up period the I-wave pattern does not convey risk for adverse cardiac events, including sudden death or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A KCNQ1 Mutation Causes a High Penetrance for Familial Atrial Fibrillation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - R231H Causes a High Penetrance for Familial AF Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and its incidence is expected to grow. A genetic predisposition for AF has long been recognized, but its manifestation in these patients likely involves a combination of rare and common genetic variants. Identifying genetic variants that associate with a high penetrance for AF would represent a significant breakthrough for understanding the mechanisms that associate with disease. Method and Results Candidate gene sequencing in 5 unrelated families with familial AF identified the KCNQ1 missense mutation p.Arg231His (R231H). In addition to AF, several of the family members have abnormal QTc intervals, syncope or experienced sudden cardiac arrest or death. KCNQ1 encodes the voltage-gated K+ channel that conducts the slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current in the heart. Functional and computational analyses suggested that R231H increases KCNQ1 current (IKCNQ1) to shorten the atrial action potential (AP) duration. R231H is predicted to minimally affect ventricular excitability, but it prevented the increase in IKCNQ1 following PKA activation. The unique properties of R231H appeared to be caused by a loss in voltage-dependent gating. Conclusions The R231H variant causes a high penetrance for interfamilial early-onset AF. Our study indicates R231H likely shortens atrial refractoriness to promote a substrate for reentry. Additionally, R231H might cause abnormal ventricular repolarization by disrupting PKA activation of IKCNQ1. We conclude genetic variants, which increase IKs during the atrial AP, decrease the atrial AP duration, and/or shorten atrial refractoriness, present a high risk for interfamilial AF.

TI  - Usefulness of Abnormal Heart Rate Turbulence to Predict Cardiovascular Mortality in High-Risk Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Left Ventricular Dysfunction (from the EPHESUS Study)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a promising marker for risk of mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated HRT for risk stratification in high-risk patients after MI. HRT from 24-hour Holter monitoring in 481 hospitalized patients after AMI with heart failure and/or diabetes with left ventricular dysfunction before randomization in the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS). Over a 1-year follow-up, 55 died, 49 of cardiovascular causes. HRT onset (TO) and slope (TS) were calculated using previous and cohort-optimized cutpoints and their, independent contribution to risk of cardiovascular death determined. Models were tested with <5 ventricular premature complexes (PVCs) categorized as normal (n = 452) and with <5 VPCs excluded (n = 342). In EPHESUS, optimal cutpoints were TS :53.0 and TO >= 0.0. The strongest model for predicting cardiovascular mortality used EPHESUS cutpoints excluding subjects with <5 VPCs. On 3-category HRT model multivariate analysis (TS and TO normal, TS or TO abnormal, TS and TO abnormal), both TS and TO abnormal (relative risk 3.64, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 8.55, p = 0.003) and left ventricular ejection fraction <= 30% (relative risk 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 3.73, p = 0.037) independently predicted cardiovascular death. In conclusion, HRT is an independent predictor of cardiovascular death in a high-risk population after AMI, with a possibly higher optimal cutpoint for HRT slope than previously reported.

TI  - Time to detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using culture filtrate H37rv supplementation on MGIT 960 System
T2  - BALI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background: The fundamental priority program for controlling Tuberculosis (TB) is accurate and rapid diagnosis. Variable Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) phenotypes were discovered in sputum samples from pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. Active replicating bacteria and differentially culturable tubercle bacteria (DCTB) are present in the sputum. Differentially culturable tubercle bacilli did not grow on the standard medium. Culture filtrate (CF) H37Rv supplementation containing resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs) has the potential to increase sensitivity and reduce time to detection (TTD) on culture-based diagnostics.
   Methods: This study was a true experimental laboratory. A clinical sample was taken from the sputum of 15 PTB patients, which was "MTB detected" by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Sputum samples were divided into two groups and inoculated on MGIT 960 in one group with CF-H37Rv supplementation and without in the other as standard MGIT medium.
   Results: On both standard MGIT medium and MGIT+CF H37Rv, the recovery rate was 100%. Seven samples (47%) show a growth promotion effect with CF H37Rv supplementation (Delta TTD > 10 hours), while eight samples (53%) show no change in TTD (Delta TTD < 10 hours). There is no evidence that CF H37Rv supplementation inhibits growth. Six of the seven samples with Delta TTD > 10 jam (85,7%) were dominated by samples with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) grading 1+, which could be an assumption related to re-treatment PTB cases, chronic cases, treatment stages, TB-HIV, or follow up of treatments.
   Conclusion: There was no difference in recovery rate or TTD between standard MGIT medium and MGIT+CF H37Rv. The supplementation of culture filtrate H37Rv has a greater advantage on samples with low bacterial load (AFB 1+).

TI  - Patient survival and limb salvage after shark attack with major vascular injury: A case report
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF TRAUMATOLOGY
AB  - Shark attacks are rare unique pathological processes. Some of them represent devastating injuries with a high morbidity and significant mortality. Related published articles are limited. The increased human interaction within the environment of sharks is the cause of rising incidence of such attacks. This study reported a case of level 4 shark injuries (shark-induced trauma scale) in a 33-year-old male patient, who presented with an extensive injury of the right lower limb with the characteristic features of shark bite. At admission the patient was in a state of shock with profuse bleeding that was controlled by tourniquet. The patient was resuscitated according to the advanced trauma life support. Clinical examination showed hard signs of vascular injury with absent pedal pulse, associated neurological deficits and severance at the knee joint. Prompt vascular intervention after resuscitation was performed to manage the major vascular injuries, together with proper washout and debridement of all the necrotic tissues under strong antibiotic coverage to prevent infection. After that, the patient underwent sequenced plastic, orthopedic, and neurological interventions. Strict follow-up was conducted, which showed that the patient was saved and achieved a functioning limb. This study aims to highlight the management of level 4 shark injuries, which are considered serious and challenging with a high fatality rate and a great risk of amputation due to the associated major vascular injuries. Immediate well organized management plan is crucial. Prompt resuscitation and surgical intervention by a highly-skilled medical team are required to improve the chance of patient survival and limb salvage. (C) 2021 Chinese Medical Association.

TI  - End-tidal CO2 monitoring in emergency medicine
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - Currently,even in prehospital emergency medicine (PEM), continuous end-tidal CO2 monitoring is frequently used as a sensitive and non-invasive technique in ventilated patients. Due to its central role, the continuous measurement of exhaled CO2 provides immediate information about the status of three essential functions ofthe organism: ventilation, circulation, and metabolism.
   Methods: Recent literature, obtained by a computer-guided search (Winspirs((TM))), and product information of all currently available capnometry devices were reviewed in detail. Firstly, the theoretical background of different CO2-measurement methods and techniques is described. Secondly, indications and specific implications for the out-of-hospital use of capnometry are discussed. Thirdly, different monitoring systems suitable for prehospital care are evaluated.
   Results: There are two basic principles to reliably determine end-tidal CO2 (EtpCO(2)) that can be realised in portable monitors: qualitative measurements with a paper indicator and quantitative measurements using nondispersive infrared spectroscopy. Capnography is a feature of more advanced units to provide the emergency physician with additional information by displaying EtpCO(2) values versus time. Multiple indications for capnometry in emergency situations are listed, all related to the evaluation of patient's ventilation, circulation, and metabolism. Specific implications regarding mobility, ease of use, patient hygiene and accuracy of measurements are mentioned. Five units, each representing a different type of CO2 monitor,are described and evaluated for their use in PEM.
   Conclusions: Some current portable CO2 monitors allow fast and reliable measurement of EtpCO(2) even in the out-of-hospital care of critically ill patients. However,the development of a new portable monitoring system comprising the three most important ventilation parameters (ventilation rate, EtpCO(2), and peripheral O-2 saturation) seems to be a promising step for the improvement of monitoring in out-of-hospital emergencies.

TI  - RETRACTED: Effects of Ringer's sodium pyruvate solution on serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 upon septic shock (Retracted Article)
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objective: To study the effects of Ringer's sodium pyruvate solution on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon septic shock.
   Methods: Ninety emergency patients with septic shock were divided into a treatment group and a control group by random draw. The control group was resuscitated with 50 ml of compound sodium chloride (Ringer's solution), and the treatment group was given 50 ml of Ringer's sodium pyruvate solution. Both groups were basically treated.
   Results: All patients were successfully resuscitated. After treatment, extravascular lung water index, intrathoracic blood volume index, systemic vascular resistance index and cardiac index of the two groups were significantly improved compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). However, there were no significant inter-group differences at different time points (P>0.05). Blood lactic acid level, central venous oxygen saturation index and urine output were also improved after treatment, with significant inter-group differences (P<0.05). Serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels of both groups significantly decreased after treatment (P<0.05), and the levels of the treatment group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). During 28 days of follow-up, the mortality rate of the treatment group (4.4%) was significantly lower than that of the control group (20.0%) (P<0.05).
   Conclusion: Patients with septic shock are complicated with disordered expressions of inflammatory factors. During resuscitation, Ringer's sodium pyruvate solution can effectively promote blood circulation, mitigate inflammation and maintain acid-base equilibrium, thus decreasing the prognostic mortality rate.

TI  - Use of a novel smartphone-based application tool for enrolment and randomisation in pre-hospital clinical trials
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The effective recruitment and randomisation of patients in pre-hospital clinical trials presents unique challenges. Owing to the time critical nature of many pre-hospital emergencies and limited resourcing, the use of traditional methods of randomisation that may include centralised telephone or web-based systems are often not practicable or feasible. Previous technological limitations have necessitated that pre-hospital trialists strike a com-promise between implementing pragmatic, deliverable study designs, with robust enrolment and randomisation methodologies. In this commentary piece, we present a novel smartphone-based solution that has the potential to align pre-hospital clinical trial recruitment processes to that of best-in -practice in-hospital and ambulatory care based studies.

TI  - Automated cardiac arrest detection using a photoplethysmography wristband: algorithm development and validation in patients with induced circulatory arrest in the DETECT-1 study
T2  - LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Background Unwitnessed out -of -hospital cardiac arrest is associated with low survival chances because of the delayed activation of the emergency medical system in most cases. Automated cardiac arrest detection and alarming using biosensor technology would offer a potential solution to provide early help. We developed and validated an algorithm for automated circulatory arrest detection using wrist -derived photoplethysmography from patients with induced circulatory arrests. Methods In this prospective multicentre study in three university medical centres in the Netherlands, adult patients (aged 18 years or older) in whom short -lasting circulatory arrest was induced as part of routine practice (transcatheter aortic valve implantation, defibrillation testing, or ventricular tachycardia induction) were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were a known bilateral significant subclavian artery stenosis or medical issues interfering with the wearing of the wristband. After providing informed consent, patients were equipped with a photoplethysmography wristband during the procedure. Invasive arterial blood pressure and electrocardiography were continuously monitored as the reference standard. Development of the photoplethysmography algorithm was based on three consecutive training cohorts. For each cohort, patients were consecutively enrolled. When a total of 50 patients with at least one event of circulatory arrest were enrolled, that cohort was closed. Validation was performed on the fourth set of included patients. The primary outcome was sensitivity for the detection of circulatory arrest. Findings Of 306 patients enrolled between March 14, 2022, and April 21, 2023, 291 patients were included in the data analysis. In the development phase (n=205), the first training set yielded a sensitivity for circulatory arrest detection of 100% (95% CI 94-100) and four false positive alarms; the second training set yielded a sensitivity of 100% (94-100), with six false positive alarms; and the third training set yielded a sensitivity of 100% (94-100), with two false positive alarms. In the validation phase (n=86), the sensitivity for circulatory arrest detection was 98% (92-100) and 11 false positive circulatory arrest alarms. The positive predictive value was 90% (95% CI 82-94). Interpretation The automated detection of induced circulatory arrests using wrist -derived photoplethysmography is feasible with good sensitivity and low false positives. These promising findings warrant further development of this wearable technology to enable automated cardiac arrest detection and alarming in a home setting.

TI  - Plasma hypoxanthine levels during crystalloid and blood cardioplegias: Warm blood cardioplegia increases hypoxanthine levels with a greater risk of oxidative stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Background. Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are subjected to severe oxidative stress, and frequently show evidence of acute lung injury post surgery. Associations between acute lung injury, oxidative stress, and aberrant ATP catabolism have been made and prompted us to consider whether the purine metabolites xanthine and hypoxanthine alter significantly during CPB when different types of cardioplegia are used.
   Methods. Experimental design: retrospective follow up study on stored plasma samples from patients randomly selected to receive either warm blood, cold blood, or crystalloid cardioplegia. Setting: adult intensive care unit of post graduate teaching hospital. Patients: thirty-eight patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, with or without artery grafting. Operation was carried out by a single surgeon. Interventions: all patients received either a homograft aortic valve or a stentless porcine valve.
   Results. No significant differences in xanthine levels at any time points during CPB, or between the different cardioplegic groups. Hypoxanthine levels were, however, significantly higher in patients receiving warm blood cardioplegia (74.84+/-16.715 mu M, p=0.0151), and was most marked at time point 3 when the aortic cross clamp was released. Patients receiving crystalloid cardioplegia showed higher levels of hypoxanthine (44.56+/-10.16 mu M) than those receiving cold blood cardioplegia (21.57+/-7.106 mu M).
   Conclusions. Considering these data together, it suggests that aberrant ATP catabolism, characteristic of ischaemia/reperfusion, is further disturbed during warm blood cardioplegia leading to a marked increase in plasma hypoxanthine levels. This has the potential to further increase oxidative stress during CPB.

TI  - Immunoinformatic-driven design and evaluation of multi-epitope mRNA vaccine targeting HIV-1 gp120
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) presents a global health crisis, causing significant AIDS-related deaths and over one million new infections annually. The curbing of HIV is an intricate and continuously evolving domain, marked by numerous challenges, including drug resistance and the absence of a significant cure or vaccine because of its mutating ability and diverse antigens in its envelope, prompting research for functional cures and long-term remission strategies. The endeavor to devise an HIV vaccine capable of eliciting robust and broadly cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses is a formidable undertaking, primarily due to the pronounced genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1, the variances observed in virus subtypes (clades) across distinct geographic regions, and the polymorphic nature of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The viral envelope protein (gp120) selectively interacts with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the surface of target cells. It serves as the key initiator in the intricate viral entry into host cells, rendering it a compelling candidate for vaccine development. This study used bioinformatic tools to design a safe, hypoallergenic, and non-toxic mRNA HIV-1 vaccine by assembling immunogenic B- and T-cell epitopes from the gp120 protein. We identified antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergic B-cell epitopes (IEPLGIAPTRAKRRVVER) and T-cell epitopes (QQKVHALFY, ITIGPGQVF, WQGVGQAMY, APTRAKRRV, KQQKVHALFYRLDIV, QQKVHALFYRLDIVQ, QKVHALFYRLDIVQI, SLAEEEIIIRSENLT, and IRSENLTNNVKTIIV). For designing the mRNA vaccine against HIV-1 gp120, we assembled the epitopes with 5 ' m7G cap, 5 ' UTR (untranslated region), Kozak sequence, signal peptide (tPA), RpfE (resuscitation-promoting factor E) adjuvant at N-terminal and MITD (MHC class I trafficking domain) adjuvant, stop codon, 3 ' UTR, and 120-nucleotide long poly(A) tail at the C-terminal with immunogenic robustness linkers. The mRNA vaccine is translated into a protein-based vaccine by the host body's ribosomes. Their comprehensive computational findings, including physicochemical, structural, and 3D refinement analyses, substantiated the stability and quality of the translated vaccine. Molecular docking and simulation revealed a strong and stable binding affinity of vaccine immunization with immune cells' pattern recognition receptors (TLR4). Immune simulations demonstrated a potent primary immune response characterized by a gradual increase in immunoglobulins and a corresponding decline in antigen concentration. This bioinformatics-driven study presents a promising HIV-1 mRNA vaccine candidate, underscoring the need for further experimental validation through preclinical and clinical trials. At the same time, its methodologies hold the potential for addressing other challenging infectious diseases, thereby impacting vaccinology broadly.

TI  - EMERGENCY CENTER THORACOTOMY - IMPACT OF PREHOSPITAL RESUSCITATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 51ST ANNUAL SESSION OF THE AMERICAN ASSOC FOR THE SURGERY OF TRAUMA
AB  - Emergency center thoracotomy was performed at our facility on 389 patients from 1984 through 1989. There were no patients excluded from the study, and survival for all patients was 8.3% with survival rates of 15.2% and 7.3% for stab and gunshot wounds, respectively. Emergency center thoracotomy was performed on 42 patients suffering from isolated extrathoracic injuries with 7% survival. There were no survivors of blunt trauma in this study. Fifty-three percent of the patients arrived with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in progress. The average time of prehospital CPR for survivors was 5.1 minutes compared with 9.1 minutes for nonsurvivors. Of the survivors, prehospital endotracheal intubation prolonged successful toleration of CPR to 9.4 minutes compared with 4.2 minutes for nonintubated surviving patients (p < 0.001). Emergency center thoracotomy is useful in the resuscitation of victims dying of penetrating truncal trauma. Prehospital endotracheal intubation significantly lengthened the time of successful CPR.

TI  - Public access defibrillation: Psychological consequences in responders
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Adverse psychological reactions are relatively frequent in professional ambulance crews who attend traumatic events, yet appear unusual in lay persons who attempt resuscitation of victims of out of hospital cardiac arrest.
   Aim: To investigate the psychological profile of first responders to gain insight into possible factors that might protect them against such reactions.
   Methods: Qualitative study of first responders in a community scheme in Barry, South Wales. In depth semi-structured interviews with six subjects were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).
   Results: The study identified a resilience phenomenon in first responders accounted for by certain enabling core beliefs about their role, their capacity, and about the meaning of negative and positive outcomes for themselves. A realistic appreciation of their own limitations, confidence in their ability to perform as trained and being able to handle positive and negative outcomes were prominent features. The ability to act with emotional detachment appears a further protective mechanism. This mindset, loosely described as 'a philosophy', protects against the development of adverse reactions to stress or from becoming unduly concerned about negative outcomes.
   The responders had altruistic motives for undertaking the role yet were capable of operating with a high degree of naturally occurring resilience to stress or undermining anxiety. It is the combination of being motivated by altruism coupled with an inherent resilience that appears to be the crucial protective mechanism.
   Conclusions: The group demonstrated an apparently innate resilience to the adverse psychological effects of responding with an AED in a PAD scheme. This enables them to operate optimally in stressful situations without experiencing the negative psychological consequences that might otherwise arise. This information may be used to raise awareness about the psychological requirements for the role and to assist screening or selection processes. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Temperature Control in the Era of Personalized Medicine: Knowledge Gaps, Research Priorities, and Future Directions
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is the leading cause of death and disability after cardiac arrest. To date, temperature control is the only intervention shown to improve neurologic outcomes in patients with HIBI. Despite robust preclinical evidence supporting hypothermia as neuroprotective therapy after cardiac arrest, there remains clinical equipoise regarding optimal core temperature, therapeutic window, and duration of therapy. Current guidelines recommend continuous temperature monitoring and active fever prevention for at least 72 h and additionally note insufficient evidence regarding temperature control targeting 32 degrees C-36 degrees C. However, population-based thresholds may be inadequate to support the metabolic demands of ischemic, reperfused, and dysregulated tissue. Promoting a more personalized approach with individualized targets has the potential to further improve outcomes. This review will analyze current knowledge and evidence, address research priorities, explore the components of high-quality temperature control, and define critical future steps that are needed to advance patient-centered care for cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - TREATMENT OF INTRACTABLE VENTRICULAR-FIBRILLATION WITH PROMPT CIRCULATORY SUPPORT USING A BIVENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE IN PIGS - AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY
T2  - THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON
AB  - Refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF), intractable to conventional therapy, can be converted into a stable cardiac rhythm by immediate ventricular volume unloading using a form of mechanical circulatory assist (MCA). We investigated the efficacy of MCA in a controlled animal study in which 20 pigs were subjected to intermittent occlusions (5 times) of the left descending coronary artery (5 min. occlusion +10 min. reperfusion). 12 of the 20 animals (60 %) developed 14 events of VF. 64 % of VF developed during reperfusion (p < 0.05). Countershock was attempted up to eight times and was successful in 5 of the 14 events (36%) (primary defibrillation, PD). When conversion was not achieved, total biventricular bypass was instituted. Mean perfusion time between countershock attempts was 24.4 +/- 15.3 min. All animals (n = 9) with cardiac assistance were successfully defibrillated (secondary defibrillation, SD), (p < 0.05). Hemodynamic parameters after SD were not significantly different from those after PD (p > 0.05). Survival rate following PD was 66.6%. Six animals were ultimately weaned from cardiac assistance following SD. Three others died of progressive cardiogenic shock in the six hour follow-up period following SD. These non-survivors had a significantly longer VF time than the survivors (41.7 +/- 10.4 vs. 15.8 +/- 8.0, p < 0.05). Overall survival after SD was the same as that for PD: 66.6% (p > 0.05). These results show that prompt conversion of VF into a stable cardiac rhythm is a prerequisite to recovery.
   Our data did not reveal to what extent reduction of myocardial distention or restoration of coronary perfusion contributed to successful defibrillation during cardiac assistance. In this study MCA proved an effective adjuvant to conventional therapy for the treatment of intractable VF.

TI  - Neurological complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children Clinical article
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB  - Object. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potentially life-saving treatment for patients in refractory cardiorespiratory failure. Neurological complications that result from ECMO treatment are known to significantly impact patient survival and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to review the incidence of neurological complications of ECMO in the pediatric population and the role of neurosurgery in the treatment of these patients.
   Methods. Data were obtained from the national Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry for the years 1990 to 2009. The neurological complications recorded by the registry include CNS hemorrhage, CNS infarction, and seizure. The ECMO Registry at the authors' institution was then searched, and 3 pediatric patients who had undergone craniotomy during ECMO treatment were identified.
   Results. Children in the ELSO Registry who were treated with ECMO survived to hospital discharge in 65% of cases. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 7.4% of the ECMO-treated patients, with 36% of those surviving to hospital discharge. Hemorrhage was more likely in patients younger than 30 days old and in those requiring ECMO for cardiac indications. Cerebral infarction occurred in 5.7% of all ECMO-treated patients. Clinically diagnosed seizures occurred in 8.4% of all ECMO-treated patients. The ECMO Registry at the authors' institution revealed that 1898 patients were treated there. Intracranial hemorrhage was diagnosed in 81 patients (5.8%), and 3 of these patients were treated with craniotomy. Two of the patients were alive with minimal neurological impairment and normal school performance at 10 and 16 years of follow-up.
   Conclusions. Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious complication of ECMO treatment. While the surgical risk is substantial, there may be a role for surgical evacuation of hemorrhage in well-selected patients. (DOI: 10.3171/2011.1.PEDS10443)

TI  - Assessment of arousal recovery after cardiac arrest using diffusion kurtosis MRI with higher b-values: a pilot study
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - ObjectiveComatose survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) pose a complex challenge for physicians reliant on imperfect studies to determine the extent of neurologic injury. Clinically available imaging is frequently relied upon despite limited sensitivity. We conducted a prospective pilot study comparing diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-MRI and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in comatose survivors of CA to investigate the benefit of utilizing higher diffusion b-values to enhance prediction of arousal recovery.MethodsSurvivors of CA admitted from June 2015 through November 2019 with DKI-MRI and SSEPs were evaluated. Advanced diffusion metrics differentiating present or absent SSEPs were analyzed using whole-brain voxelwise nonparametric permutation inference with threshold-free cluster enhancement.ResultsTwenty survivors of CA were included, mean age 52, 45% female and out-of-hospital arrests accounting for 75% of cases. Baseline characteristics and examination findings were not statistically different between groups at admission or 48 h after achieving normothermia. A decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and increase in mean kurtosis (MK) was demonstrated in subjects without arousal recovery potential, most prominently in the posterior mesial temporal, parietal and occipital lobes.ConclusionDKI-MRI may improve early arousal recovery prediction during the immediate phase of post-CA care, especially where SSEPs are unavailable or unreliable.

TI  - Antenatal management in case of preterm premature rupture of membranes before fetal viability: CNGOF Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes Guidelines
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
AB  - Objectives. - To evaluate the maternal, perinatal and long-term prognosis in the event of previable premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and to specify the interventions likely to reduce the risks and improve the prognosis.
   Methods. - The PubMed database, the Cochrane Library and the recommendations from the French and foreign obstetrical societies or colleges have been consulted.
   Results. - Previable PROM is a rare event whose frequency varies from 0.3 to 1% according to estimates (NP4). When occurring as a complication of amniocentesis, the prognosis is generally better than when spontaneous (NP3). Between 23 and 39% of women will deliver in the week following PROM and nearly 40% of women will not have given birth 2 weeks after (NP3). The frequency of medical termination of pregnancy varies greatly according to the studies (NP4), as does that of fetal death (NP4). Hospital survival and survival rates without major morbidity as a proportion of conservatively treated patients range from 17-55% and 26-63%, respectively (NP4). Neonatal prognosis is largely dominated by prematurity and its complications (NP3). The frequency of maternal sepsis varies from 0.8 to 4.8% in the most recent studies (NP4). Only one case of maternal death is reported, although 3 cases were identified in France between 2007 and 2012 (NP3). Information is a major component of the care to be provided to women and their partners (Professional consensus). An initial period of hospitalization may be proposed after previable PROM (Professional consensus). Thereafter, there is no argument to recommend hospital management rather than extra-hospital management when there is no argument in favour of intrauterine infection (Professional consensus). An evaluation of the amount of amniotic fluid by ultrasound may be proposed at the initial consultation and after a period of 7 to 14 days if pregnancy continues (Professional consensus). Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is recommended as soon as PROM is diagnosed (Professional consensus). The gestational age at which corticosteroid therapy may be proposed will depend on the thresholds selected for neonatal resuscitation care. In particular, it will take into account parental positioning (Professional consensus). From the time of the decision to perform neonatal resuscitation until the gestational age of 32 weeks, it is recommended to administer MgSO4 to the woman whose delivery is imminent (Grade A). Tocolysis is not recommended in this context (Professional consensus). In certain situations, meeting strictly the conditions mentioned by the CSP article L. 2213-1, a maternal request for medical interruption of pregnancy may be discussed.
   Conclusion. - The levels of evidence of scientific work on the management of previable PROM are low, therefore, most of the recommendations proposed here are based on professional agreement by "reasonable" extension of recommendations valid for later gestational ages.

TI  - Contemporary Approach to Neurologic Prognostication of Coma Aft er Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Coma after cardiac arrest (CA) is an important cause of admission to the ICU. Prognosis of post-CA coma has significantly improved over the past decade, particularly because of aggressive postresuscitation care and the use of therapeutic targeted temperature management (TTM). TTM and sedatives used to maintain controlled cooling might delay neurologic reflexes and reduce the accuracy of clinical examination. In the early ICU phase, patients' good recovery may often be indistinguishable (based on neurologic examination alone) from patients who eventually will have a poor prognosis. Prognostication of post-CA coma, therefore, has evolved toward a multimodal approach that combines neurologic examination with EEG and evoked potentials. Blood biomarkers (eg, neuron-specific enolase [NSE] and soluble 100-beta protein) are useful complements for coma prognostication; however, results vary among commercial laboratory assays, and applying one single cutoff level (eg,. 33 mu g/L for NSE) for poor prognostication is not recommended. Neuroimaging, mainly diffusion MRI, is emerging as a promising tool for prognostication, but its precise role needs further study before it can be widely used. This multimodal approach might reduce false-positive rates of poor prognosis, thereby providing optimal prognostication of comatose CA survivors. The aim of this review is to summarize studies and the principal tools presently available for outcome prediction and to describe a practical approach to the multimodal prognostication of coma after CA, with a particular focus on neuromonitoring tools. We also propose an algorithm for the optimal use of such multimodal tools during the early ICU phase of post-CA coma.

TI  - Prognosis After Cardiac Arrest: The Additional Value of DWI and FLAIR to EEG
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Despite application of the multimodal European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine algorithm, neurological prognosis of patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest remains uncertain in a large group of patients. In this study, we investigate the additional predictive value of visual and quantitative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to electroencephalography (EEG) for outcome estimation of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Methods We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in patients after cardiac arrest submitted in a comatose state to the intensive care unit of two Dutch hospitals. Continuous EEG was recorded during the first 3 days and MRI was performed at 3 +/- 1 days after cardiac arrest. EEG at 24 h and ischemic damage in 21 predefined brain regions on diffusion weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery on a scale from 0 to 4 were related to outcome. Quantitative MRI analyses included mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and percentage of brain volume with ADC < 450 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s, < 550 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s, and < 650 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s. Poor outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 3-5 at 6 months. Results We included 50 patients, of whom 20 (40%) demonstrated poor outcome. Visual EEG assessment correctly identified 3 (15%) with poor outcome and 15 (50%) with good outcome. Visual grading of MRI identified 13 (65%) with poor outcome and 25 (89%) with good outcome. ADC analysis identified 11 (55%) with poor outcome and 3 (11%) with good outcome. EEG and MRI combined could predict poor outcome in 16 (80%) patients at 100% specificity, and good outcome in 24 (80%) at 63% specificity. Ischemic damage was most prominent in the cortical gray matter (75% vs. 7%) and deep gray nuclei (45% vs. 3%) in patients with poor versus good outcome. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging is complementary with EEG for the prediction of poor and good outcome of patients after cardiac arrest who are comatose at admission.

TI  - Clinical validation of pinopode as a marker of endometrial receptivity: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB  - Objective: To determine the clinical value of pinopodes in the human.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Academic fertility center.
   Patient(s): From December 2014 to December 2016, in a phase I trial, 363 patients were recruited in their first IVF cycles. In a phase II trial, 136 patients with at least two previous embryo implantation failures were recruited.
   Intervention(s): In the phase I trial, in the midluteal phase, endometrial tissues were obtained for scanning electron microscopy, and their IVF treatment outcomes were followed up. In the phase II trial, participants were allocated into two groups by random number table, and the experimental group had twice the number of the control group. Individual ETs (iETs) were performed in the experimental group, while frozen-thawed embryos were routinely transferred in the control group.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR).
   Result(s): In the phase I trial, through receiver operation characteristic curve analysis, the optimal pinopode scoring for successful clinical pregnancy was determined to be 85. The CPR (74.29% vs. 19.77%) and OPR (62.86% vs 11.86%) were significantly higher in the patients whose pinopode scoring was > 85. In the phase II trial, the CPR was dramatically higher in the iET group (33.82% vs. 8.11%).
   Conclusion(s): Pinopode scoring is a reliable marker of endometrial receptivity, and iET based on pinopode scoring is a promising solution for recurrent implantation failure. (C) 2017 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

TI  - Manufacturing and Design Improvements of an Everting Airway Device Prototype
T2  - 2024 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MEDICAL ROBOTICS, ISMR 2024
CP  - International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR)
AB  - Airway management is critical to patient survival in cases of cardiac arrest, drug overdose, and trauma. In 2021, there were nearly 150,000 reported cases of out of hospital cardiac arrest with over 90% leading to death. Current methods of establishing airways in response to cardiac arrest require a high level of expertise, and improper use can result in serious side-effects and death. This poses a need for a safer emergency airway device. Our solution is based on everting vine robots, which are pressurized tubes that passively navigate via tip extension. This paper aims to evaluate whether our Everting Airway Device (EAD) prototype can deploy into the airway at safe pressures with effective sealing. Our device was made with novel material sealing techniques and sealing feature design. The deployed sealing efficacy and minimum pressure required during deployment were measured within a 0.9 '' diameter straight chamber. The ability of the tube to passively navigate the airway was tested by observing deployment patterns into an anatomically accurate, rigid 3D-printed airway derived from the Advanced Joint Airway Management Simulator. The insertion forces of the device into an airway phantom are similar to those of market devices, ranging from 20-39 N. The sealing cuffs can provide adequate sealing at the same pressure values similar to manual insertion market airway devices, which have a recommended sealing pressure of 120 cmH(2)O. The proposed Everting Airway Device design shows promise for future refinement and integration with automated deployment mechanisms and breath delivery systems.

TI  - Histological Correlation for Radiofrequency and Microwave Ablation in the Local Control of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) before Liver Transplantation: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - CANCERS
AB  - Simple Summary: Liver cancer is a growing problem around the world. Drugs for liver cancer have limited effect, there are not enough donors for liver transplants and many patients are not candidates for surgery to remove the tumor. In many of these cases, hyperthermia can destroy the tumor in situ with minimally invasive methods such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation. In this paper we review the literature evaluating success rates for complete ablation as judged by actual examination of treated tumors that were removed when patients received a liver transplant. While notable successes can be achieved with ablation, the published studies indicate both that complete treatment is not as common as thought and that imaging methods such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans do not completely identify residual cancer. There is therefore an important opportunity for improvement in the treatment of this disease.
   Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are the most widely studied and applied ablation techniques for treating primary and secondary liver tumors. These techniques are considered curative for small hepatic tumors, with post-ablation outcomes most commonly assessed by an imaging follow up. However, there is increasing evidence of a discrepancy between radiological and pathological findings when ablated lesions are evaluated following liver resection or liver transplantation. A comprehensive review of the available literature reporting the complete pathological response (cPR) following RFA and MWA was performed to estimate the success rate and identify the factors associated with treatment failure. Following RFA, cPR is reported in 26-96% of tumors compared to 57-95% with MWA. Larger tumor size and vessels larger than 3 mm adjacent to the treated tumor are the most important factors identified by previous studies associated with viable residual tumors after RFA. Correlating post-ablation radiological studies with pathological findings shows that computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting residual viable or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. There are promising recent reports combining multiprobe ablation techniques with three-dimensional treatment planning software and stereotactic-aiming instrumentation to achieve more than 90% cPR in both small and large HCC tumors. In conclusion, the reported success for achieving cPR in HCC following RFA and MWA is highly variable in different studies and decreases with increasing lesion size and unfavorable tumor characteristics. Very few studies have reported a high rate of cPR. As these studies are single-center and retrospective, they need to be further validated and reproduced in other clinical settings.

TI  - Complementary therapy with Chinese aromatic herbs to promote awakening in a comatose patient: A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:Traumatic brain injury frequently leads to prolonged coma, posing significant medical management challenges. Complementary therapies, including traditional Chinese herbal medicine, have been investigated as potential interventions in comatose patients. Chinese aromatic herbs, such as Borneolum (Bingpian), Moschus (Shexiang), and Acori tatarinowii rhizoma (Shichangpu), have long been believed to be "resuscitation with aromatics" based on traditional Chinese medicines theory.Patient concerns:A 16-year-old male was admitted to the intensive rehabilitation unit for further treatment due to prolonged coma and frequent seizures following traumatic brain injury.Diagnoses:Western medicine diagnosed the patient as coma, diffuse axonal injury, and epilepsy. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, the syndrome differentiation indicates a Yin-closed disease.Interventions:According to the patient's condition, we use the Chinese aromatic herbs as a complementary therapy.Outcomes:Following a month-long administration, the patient's consciousness and electroencephalogram (EEG) background progressively improved. A 6-month follow-up demonstrated full arousal, though with ambulatory EEG revealing mild to moderate abnormality in the background.Lessons:The addition of Chinese aromatic herbs appears to have a beneficial effect on the patient's consciousness and EEG background. This could be attributed to the herbs' inherent pharmacological properties, as well as their potential to enhance the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to other drugs. This makes them a promising option for complementary therapy.

TI  - Safer obstetric anesthesia through education and mentorship: a model for knowledge translation in Rwanda
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
AB  - High rates of maternal mortality remain a widespread problem in the developing world. Skilled anesthesia providers are required for the safe conduct of Cesarean delivery and resuscitation during obstetrical crises. Few anesthesia providers in low-resource settings have access to continuing education. In Rwanda, anesthesia technicians with only three years of post-secondary training must manage complex maternal emergencies in geographically isolated areas. The purpose of this special article is to describe implementation of the SAFE (Safer Anesthesia From Education) Obstetric Anesthesia course in Rwanda, a three-day refresher course designed to improve obstetrical anesthesia knowledge and skills for practitioners in low-resource areas. In addition, we describe how the course facilitated the knowledge-to-action (KTA) cycle whereby a series of steps are followed to promote the uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice. The KTA cycle requires locally relevant teaching interventions and continuation of knowledge post intervention. In Rwanda, this meant carefully considering educational needs, revising curricula to suit the local context, employing active experiential learning during the SAFE Obstetric Anesthesia course, encouraging supportive relationships with peers and mentors, and using participant action plans for change, post-course logbooks, and follow-up interviews with participants six months after the course. During those interviews, participants reported improvements in clinical practice and greater confidence in coordinating team activities. Anesthesia safety remains challenged by resource limitations and resistance to change by health care providers who did not attend the course. Future teaching interventions will address the need for team training.

TI  - Assessment of neurocognitive function after cardiac arrest
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Impaired neurocognitive function is common in cardiac arrest survivors and the use of specific neurocognitive assessments are recommended in both clinical trials and daily practice. This review examines the most recent evidence to guide in the selection of neurocognitive outcome assessment tools after cardiac arrest.
   Recent findings
   Neurocognitive impairment after cardiac arrest was recently reported as one of the major predictors for societal participation, highlighting the need for neurocognitive assessments. A subjective report is a simple method to screen for cognitive problems, but divergent findings were reported when comparing with objective measures. A standardized observer report may be useful for cognitive screening postcardiac arrest. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was recommended for cognitive screening after cardiac arrest. Detailed neurocognitive assessments were reported as valuable for in-depth evaluation of patients in interventional studies. The best time-point for neurocognitive assessments remains unknown. Recent findings report that most neurocognitive recovery is seen within the first months after cardiac arrest, with some improvement also noted between 3 and 12 months postcardiac arrest.
   Summary
   Neurocognitive assessments after cardiac arrest are important and the approach should differ depending on the clinical situation. Large, prospective, well designed studies, to guide the selection of neurocognitive assessments after cardiac arrest, are urgently needed.

TI  - Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock and Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation: Pulling Out All the Stops
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANGIOLOGY
AB  - We report the case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular fibrillation. Following prolonged resuscitation in the emergency room, she was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where, as a first step, mechanical circulatory support with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was established. Next, a right heart catheterization study was performed, followed by coronary angiography and angioplasty of the infarct-related artery. Promptly on transfer to the intensive care unit, a hypothermia protocol was initiated. By postprocedure day 1, the patient's ventricular fibrillation had resolved, mean arterial pressure was > 65 mm Hg, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was 10 mm Hg. Echocardiography demonstrated complete recovery of left ventricular systolic function. Lactate levels had fallen from 11.0 mmol/L (pre-ECMO) to 1.2 mmol/L. The patient was successfully weaned off pressor and ECMO support within 24 hours of the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure. She was extubated on postprocedure day 2 and discharged home on day 6. At 26-month follow-up, she remains well, angina free, neurologically intact, and without evidence of heart failure. The treatment algorithm used in this case should be considered favorably in the management of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular fibrillation.

TI  - Management following resuscitation from cardiac arrest: recommendations from the 2003 Rocky Mountain Critical Care Conference
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
AB  - Purpose: To propose a strategy for the management of patients evidence base. A standard post-arrest management strategy could admitted to critical care units after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. help facilitate future research.
   Source: Prior to the conference relevant studies were identified via literature searches and brief reviews circulated on the following topics: glucose and blood pressure management; therapeutic hypothermia; prearrest outcome prediction post-arrest outcome prediction; and management of myocardial ischemia. Two days were devoted to assessing evidence and developing a management strategy at the conference. Consensus opinion of conference participants [intensive care unit (ICU) physicians] was used when high grade evidence was unavailable. Additional literature searches and data grading were performed post-conference.
   Principal findings: High grade evidence was lacking in most areas. Specific goals of treatment were proposed for: general care; neurologic care; respirator/care; cardiac care; and gastrointestinal care. There was adequate evidence to recommend therapeutic hypothermia for comatose patients who had witnessed ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia arrests. Conference participants supported extending therapeutic hypothermia to other presenting rhythms in selected circumstances. Additional goals included mean arterial pressure 80 to 100 mmHg, glucose 5 to 8 mmol(.)L(-1) using insulin infusions, and PaO2 > 100 mmHg for the first 24 hr. Absent withdrawal to pain 72 hr after resuscitation should prompt consideration of palliative care. The level of evidence for other recommendations was low.
   Conclusions: The proposed management strategy represents an approach to manage patients in the ICU following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Most of the recommendations are based on low grade evidence. Additional research is needed to improve the

TI  - An unusual presentation of takotsubo syndrome in an elderly patient
T2  - OXFORD MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - Takotsubo syndrome occurs predominantly in women and is usually preceded by acute emotional and/or physical stress. Patients commonly present with chest pain and/or dyspnea. Syncope or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a rare presentation. We report an unusual case of takotsubo syndrome in an elderly patient who presented with left facial droop, slurred speech, and syncopal episode. Initial presumed diagnosis was an ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. However, the patient was then treated for acute myocardial ischemia/infarction based on abnormal electrocardiogram, elevated cardiac troponin, and unremarkable neurological workup. Eventually diagnosed with takotsubo syndrome. Our case illustrates the importance of prompt identification particularly in the context of atypical presentation and further evaluation to rule out serious causes to mitigate related morbidity and mortality while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary investigations.

TI  - Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation in Long QT Syndrome Analysis of Therapeutic Nonresponders
T2  - CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background-Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a potentially lethal but highly treatable cardiac channelopathy. Treatment options include pharmacotherapy, device therapy, and left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD). Here, we sought to determine the characteristics of LQTS patients who have had >= 1 LQTS-related breakthrough cardiac event (BCE) after LCSD.
   Methods and Results-We performed retrospective chart review for 52 consecutive patients (24 males; mean age at diagnosis, 10.0 +/- 10 years; mean QTc, 528 +/- 74 ms) with LQTS who underwent LCSD between 2005 and 2010 (mean age at LCSD, 14.1 +/- 10 years) and have been followed up for 3.6 +/- 1.3 years. A BCE was defined as either (1) an appropriate ventricular fibrillation-terminating implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock or (2) arrhythmogenic syncope, seizures, or aborted cardiac arrest after LCSD. Thirty-three patients (61%) had LCSD as primary prevention because of either high-risk assessment or beta-blocker intolerance. So far, 12 of 52 (23%) patients (7 males) have experienced >= 1 BCE post LCSD. The clinical phenotype of patients with BCEs was significantly more severe than patients without a BCE. No BCEs were seen in patients undergoing LCSD for beta-blocker intolerance (0/12 versus 17/40; P<0.001).
   Conclusions-Although a marked reduction in number of cardiac events is usually seen after LCSD, approximate to 50% of high-risk LQTS patients have experienced >= 1 post-LCSD breakthrough. Therefore, LCSD must not be viewed as curative or as an alternative in implantable cardioverter defibrillator for high-risk patients. Prophylactic LCSD may provide another option to counter a suboptimal quality of life resulting from medication-related side effects.

TI  - Down the Wrong Pipe: Tension Pneumoperitoneum from Esophageal Intubation
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - background: Tension pneumoperitoneum (TPP) is a rare but life-threatening pathology in which significant accumulation of free air in the peritoneum pressurizes the abdominal cavity, creating conditions similar to abdominal compartment syndrome. Due to compression of intra-abdominal vasculature, TPP results in hemodynamic instability. While it most commonly occurs due to viscus perforation in the setting of recent endoscopy, gastric perforation from resuscitative efforts can also lead to TPP. Case Report: We present a case of a 58-year-old female who was intubated out-of-hospital for unresponsiveness, then subsequently developed abdominal distension, mottled lower extremities, and hemodynamic instability. In the emergency department, the patient self-extubated for a brief time before suffering cardiac arrest. During resuscitative efforts, imaging showed significant abdominal free air concerning for tension pneumoperitoneum. The likely etiology was positive pressure ventilation after esophageal intubation, resulting in gastric perforation and rapid accumulation of air in the peritoneal cavity. Despite emergent abdominal needle decompression and prompt exploratory surgery, the patient expired. Why should an Emergency Physician be aware of this?: TPP is a critical pathology that should be on the differential for any patient with recent unverified intubation presenting with hemodynamic instability and abdominal distension. Abdominal needle decompression is a key intervention for the patient with TPP and should be in the emergency physician's skillset. It is also a reminder that intubated patients require confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement to prevent negative outcomes. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Organ Donation after Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Clinical and Ethical Perspectives
T2  - ACTA MEDICA OKAYAMA
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has evolved into a life-saving therapy for select cardiac arrest patients, yet a growing body of evidence suggests it also holds promise as a bridge to organ donation in non-survivors. This review explores the clinical outcomes, ethical complexities, and evolving policies surrounding organ donation after ECPR. We summarize recent international and Japanese data demonstrating favorable graft function from ECPR donors, with the exception of lung transplantation. The ethical challenges - particularly those involving brain death determination on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and adherence to the dead donor rule - are discussed in the context of Japan's recent regulatory reforms. Additionally, we highlight the importance of structured end-of-life communication through multidisciplinary team meetings in facilitating ethically sound transitions from rescue efforts to donation pathways. Moving forward, improvements in donor management, standardized legal frameworks, and public and professional education are essential to optimizing the life-saving and life-giving potential of ECPR.

AB  - In experiments on rats we studied the effects of antioxidant and membrane-protecting agent mexidol and neuropeptides delta sleep-inducing peptide and oxytocin administered during resuscitation after 12-min clinical death. Individual and combination treatment with these substances accelerated recovery of the neurological status and partially or completely corrected behavioral disorders associated with changes in the emotional and motivational status. Combined administration of mexidol and oxytocin most significantly promoted postresuscitation recovery of functional activity in the central nervous system.

TI  - The utility of brain biomarkers in predicting survival and neurological outcomes in pediatric patients after cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CARDIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest in children is associated with high morbidity and mortality, primarily due to neurological injury. Biomarkers linked to brain injury, released into circulation from compromised elements of the neurovascular unit, act as significant prognostic indicators in patients suffering from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) subsequent to the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after pediatric cardiac arrest. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the prognostic utility of brain injury biomarkers in predicting neurological outcomes and survival in patients following cardiac arrest in the pediatric population. Methods: Bibliographic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase) were searched from their inception to November 2024. A random-effect model was used for all analyses. Results: Our meta-analysis demonstrates significant associations between various biomarkers and survival or neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were consist-ently elevated in non-survivors and patients with unfavorable neurological outcomes, with pronounced differences observed on Days 2 and 3 (e.g., Day 3 mean difference: -88.48, 95%CI: -146.77 to-30.19, P = 0.003). Emerging biomarkers, including UCH-L1 and GFAP, showed striking differences, such as elevated UCH-L1 levels on Day 1 (mean difference: -415.41, 95%CI: -474.41 to-356.61, P < 0.001) and GFAP levels exceeding 4000 ng/mL in non-survivors on Day 2 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings underscore the significant prognostic value of biomarkers in predicting survival and neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) consist-ently demonstrated its reliability across multiple time points, while emerging biomarkers like UCH-L1 and GFAP showed promising potential for early outcome stratification.

TI  - Hospital Outcomes Among COVID-19 Hospitalizations With Myocarditis from the California State Inpatient Database
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Many case reports have indicated that myocarditis could be a prognostic factor for predicting morbidity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. In this study, using a large database we examined the association between myocarditis among COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality and other adverse hospital outcomes. The present study was a retrospective analysis of data collected in the California State Inpatient Database during 2020. All hospitalizations for COVID-19 were included in the analysis and grouped into those with and without myocarditis. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Propensity score matching, followed by conditional logistic regression, was performed to find the association between myocarditis and outcomes. Among 164,417 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 578 (0.4%) were with myocarditis. After propensity score matching, the rate of in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among COVID-19 hospitalizations with myocarditis (30.0% vs 17.5%, p <0.001). Survival analysis with logrank test showed that 30-day survival rates were significantly lower among those with myocarditis (39.5% vs 46.3%, p <0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of cardiac arrest (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16 to 3.14), cardiogenic shock (OR 4.13, 95% CI 2.14 to 7.99), mechanical ventilation (OR 3.30, 95% CI 2.47 to 4.41), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.66) were significantly higher among those with myocarditis. Myocarditis was associated with greater rates of in-hospital mortality and adverse hospital outcomes among patients with COVID-19, and early suspicion is important for prompt diagnosis and management.

TI  - Theoretical knowledge and skill retention 3 and 6 months after a European Newborn Life Support provider course
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: The European Resuscitation Council Newborn Life Support Course (ERC-NLS) aims at training healthcare professionals, involved in perinatal care, in order to intervene efficiently and promptly to assist transition or resuscitate neonates who require help at birth. However, limited data exists for the retention of the theoretical knowledge and practical skills provided by the course. This study aims to evaluate the degree of knowledge and skill retention 3 and 6 months after the ERC-NLS provider course.
   Methods: This is a prospective study. Theoretical knowledge was evaluated using the ERC-approved NLS written test (50 True/False questions). Evaluation of technical skills included performance, on an Advanced Life Support neonatal maniquin (LAERDAL), of airway management, ventilation and support of circulation (21 detailed skills). The effect of certain factors on theoretical skill retention was also evaluated.
   Results: One hundred and sixteen (n = 116) participants were initially recruited in the study (12 males and 104 females). Theoretical knowledge was evaluated in 113 participants (3 participants missed follow-up appointments) and technical skills in 80 participants. The mean score for theoretical knowledge was 86.24% +/- 5.3, 80.88% +/- 7.43 and 80.04% +/- 7.04 at baseline, at 3 and 6 months, respectively. This difference was significant among the three time points (baseline vs 3 months: p < 0.001; baseline vs 6 months: p < 0.001; 3 month's vs 6 months: p = 0.034). Although gender did not have an effect, doctors and participants of higher education yielded higher score of success. Regarding technical skills, 9 skills showed a continuous decline of performance from baseline to 6 months, while no difference existed for 12 skills.
   Conclusions: Healthcare professionals after the NLS provider course retain satisfactory levels of theoretical knowledge and technical skills even at 6 months post-training, although, there is a decline compared to baseline. Further research is needed in order to establish the proper time and type of refreshment course in order to improve outcomes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - New World Health Organization recommendations for care of preterm or low birth weight infants: health policy
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - Approximately 11% of infants are born preterm, and complications of prematurity are the most common cause of death in children aged under five years. Almost one million preterm infants die each year across low, high and middle income countries. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a Guideline Development Group (GDG) to examine evidence and formulate recommendations for care of preterm or low birthweight (LBW) infants according to WHO Guideline Review Committee (GRC) criteria. GRADE methods were used to assess the certainty of evidence and the GDG developed judgements using the DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating Communication strategies to support Informed Decisions and practice based on Evidence) framework. Twenty-five recommendations were made; 11 rec-ommendations were new, and 16 were for preventive and promotive care. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) was rec-ommended to start immmediately after birth as routine care for all preterm or LBW newborns (except for critically ill infants who are in shock, unable to breath spontaneously after resuscitation, or require ventilatory support) both in the facility and at home. New recommendations were also made for caffeine to treat apnoea and for extubation; family involvement in routine care for preterm or LBW infants; and for post-discharge home-visit follow-up care. New rec-ommendations were also made to consider use of probiotics, emollient therapy, caffeine for prevention of apnoea, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) immediately after birth (with or without respiratory distress) in infants less than 32 weeks gestational age; and for family support to enable the care of preterm or LBW infants. The recom-mendations confirm the pivotal role of preventive and promotive care for preterm and LBW infants, especially the importance of keeping the baby and mother together, and empowering and supporting families to care for their preterm or LBW infant. WHO is now working to help scale up care for small and sick newborns, including organizational shifts in all 'health system building blocks' such as infrastructure, commodities, workforce and monitoring.

TI  - Effect of hydrogen gas inhalation on patient QOL after hepatectomy: protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Introduction: Molecular hydrogen had been considered inactive in vivo but is an antioxidant that selectively reduces highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Animal studies have reported that hydrogen gas inhalation helped alleviate cerebral and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In humans, hydrogen inhalation therapy is presently approved as a treatment under Advanced Medical Care B in Japan (jRCTs031180352: limited to adult patients who suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and are in a continuous coma) and its effectiveness is being examined in a clinical trial. The Japanese government has introduced the "Advanced Medical Care System" to promote the development of drugs and devices under governmental regulations. Advanced Medical Care B is a system designed for unapproved or off-label drugs or medical technologies used in a clinical trial setting. Hepatectomy is generally performed with repeated hepatic blood-flow occlusion and then reperfusion (ischemia and reperfusion). No report, however, has been made on ROS inhibition by hydrogen inhalation therapy or its effectiveness in post-hepatectomy patients. Hydrogen gas inhalation in the early stages after hepatectomy is anticipated to inhibit liver dysfunction by inhibiting ROS.
   Methods and analysis: This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind superiority trial, which will be conducted as a "specified clinical trial" in accordance with the Clinical Trials Act in Japan. Trial registration was prospectively completed before the first participant was enrolled. The subjects will be patients who will undergo hepatectomy and will be allocated randomly into group A with hydrogen gas inhalation or group B with air inhalation after hepatectomy. The study will examine if hydrogen gas inhalation improves QOL of post-hepatectomy patients. The primary endpoint is patient QOL (score of a 40-item quality of recovery questionnaire, QoR40) on postoperative day 3 and the secondary endpoints are QoR40s besides that on postoperative day 3, grade of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo score), level of pain (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)), amount of dietary intake, liver function, inflammation level, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (urinary 8-OHdG) level, and number of pedometer-assessed steps.
   Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been approved by the Niigata University Central Review Board of Clinical Research. The findings of this study will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

TI  - Loading with Oral P2Y12 Receptor Inhibitors: To Crush or Not to Crush?
T2  - THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS
AB  - Oral P2Y(12) receptor inhibitors represent a mainstay treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. In the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, when early platelet inhibition is highly desirable, the onset of action of oral P2Y(12) receptor inhibitors is, however, delayed, likely due to delayed drug absorption. Crushing the tablets, which are to be used for patient loading with an oral P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor, has been shown to provide earlier platelet inhibition than standard, integral tablets administration. Chewed ticagrelor tablets may also result in a similar effect. Such findings should be interpreted with caution, mainly due to the small number of patients enrolled and the nature (pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic) of the respective studies. Furthermore, in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, who remain comatose, crushing tablets is commonly applied in clinical practice for platelet P2Y(12) receptor inhibition. In this review, we focus on current evidence regarding the role of crushed P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor pills, analyzing clinical scenarios where most of the promise exists along with future expectations from this type of formulation. Large randomized studies are needed to draw firm conclusions regarding the clinical benefit of 'crushing' over the usual 'not-crushing' practice.

TI  - Pulsatile Normothermic Perfusion With Cardiopulmonary Bypass for Thoracic Organ Recovery in Donation After Uncontrolled Circulatory Death: A Feasible Strategy for Expanding the Donor Pool
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Objectives: Donation after circulatory death offers a promising solution to expand the thoracic organ donor pool, yet its application remains limited because of warm ischemia and technical barriers, especially in uncontrolled donation after circulatory death. We aimed to evaluate a pulsatile normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass-based strategy for thoracic organ recovery of uncontrolled donors after circulatory death and the effects of this strategy on graft function and recipient outcomes. Materials and Methods: In this prospective single-center study, we studied thoracic organs recovered from uncontrolled donors after circulatory death after >= 60 minutes of unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After heparinization and pharmacologic optimization, donors underwent median sternotomy and were connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with pulsatile flow. Organ assessment was performed in vivo. Donor, graft, and recipient functional data were recorded, with follow-up results studied through at least 1 year. Results: Forty-two donors were included. All hearts (n = 42) and 40 lungs (from 84 donors) were successfully transplanted. Despite prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, no graft failure or recipient mortality occurred. One year survival for both heart and lung recipients was 100%. Heart grafts showed progressive improvement in functional status, including left ventricular ejection fraction, lactate levels, and New York Heart Association classification; lungs demonstrated sustained gains in gas exchange, pulmonary function tests, and 6-minute walk distance. Mild primary graft dysfunction (grade 1-2) occurred in 10% of lung recipients (all unilateral transplants). Pericardial effusion increased, likely because of trauma before procurement, but resolved without effects on function. Conclusions: Pulsatile normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass enables successful procurement of thoracic organs from uncontrolled donors after circulatory death with excellent outcomes. This low-cost physiological approach may offer a viable strategy to expand availability of donors in resource-limited settings.

TI  - Mannitol and Hypertonic Saline Reduce Swelling and Modulate Inflammatory Markers in a Rat Model of Intracerebral Hemorrhage
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) leaves most survivors dependent at follow-up. The importance of promoting M2-like microglial responses is increasingly recognized as a key element to ameliorate brain injury following ICH. The osmotherapeutic agents, mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS), which are routinely used to reduce intracranial pressure, have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation in experimental ischemic and traumatic brain injury, but anti-inflammatory effects of osmotherapies have not been investigated in ICH.
   Methods: We studied the effects of iso-osmotic mannitol and HTS in rat models of ICH utilizing high-dose and moderate-dose collagenase injections into the basal ganglia, associated with high and low mortality, respectively. We studied the effects of osmotherapies, first given 5 h after ICH induction, and then administered every 12 h thereafter (4 doses total). Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify microglial activation and polarization.
   Results: Compared to controls, mannitol and HTS increased plasma osmolarity 1 h after infusion (301 +/- 1.5, 315 +/- 4.2 and 310 +/- 2.0 mOsm/kg, respectively), reduced mortality at 48 h (82, 36 and 53%, respectively), and reduced hemispheric swelling at 48 h (32, 21, and 17%, respectively). In both perihematomal and contralateral tissues, mannitol and HTS reduced activation of microglia/macrophages (abundance and morphology of Iba1 + cells), and in perihematomal tissues, they reduced markers of the microglia/macrophage M1-like phenotype (nuclear p65, TNF, and NOS2), increased markers of the microglia/macrophage M2-like phenotype (arginase, YM1, and pSTAT3), and reduced infiltration of CD45 + cells.
   Conclusions: Repeated dosing of osmotherapeutics at regular intervals may be a useful adjunct to reduce neuroinflammation following ICH.

TI  - Current status of intensive end-of-life care in children with hematologic malignancy: a population-based study
T2  - BMC PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - Background Adult patients with hematologic malignancies are less likely to receive palliative care and more likely to accept intensive anti-cancer treatments until end-of-life than those with solid tumors, but limited data are available regarding the quality of end-of-life care (EOLC) for children with hematologic malignancies. To improve the quality of EOLC for children with hematologic malignancies, the aims of this study were (i) to compare intensive EOLC between children with hematologic malignancies and those with solid tumors; and (ii) to describe factors associated with intensive EOLC in children with hematologic malignancies. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 0- to 18-year-old patients with cancer, who died in hospital between April 2012 and March 2016 in Japan using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination per-diem payment system. Indicators of intensive inpatient EOLC were defined as intensive care unit admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation and/or mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation in the last 30 days of life, or intravenous chemotherapy in the last 14 days. We determined factors associated with intensive EOLC using regression models. Data regarding use of blood transfusion were also obtained from the database. Results Among 1199 patients, 433 (36%) had hematological malignancies. Children with hematologic malignancies were significantly more likely than those with solid tumors to have intubation and/or mechanical ventilation (37.9% vs. 23.5%), intensive care unit admission (21.9% vs. 7.2%), CPR (14.5% vs. 7.7%), hemodialysis (13.2% vs. 3.1%) or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (2.5% vs. 0.4%) in their last 30 days, or intravenous chemotherapy (47.8% vs. 18.4%; all P < .01) within their last 14 days of life. Over 90% of children with hematological malignancies received a blood transfusion within the last 7 days of life. For hematological malignancies, age under 5 years was associated with CPR and >= 2 intensive EOLC indicators. Longer hospital stays had decreased odds of >= 2 intensive EOLC indicators. Conclusion Children with hematologic malignancies are more likely to receive intensive EOLC compared to those with solid tumors. A younger age and shorter hospital stay might be associated with intensive EOLC in children with hematologic malignancies.

TI  - Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Agonists Reduce Cardiovascular Events in Cancer Patients on Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP1a), initially developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have shown promising results in reducing cardiovascular events. We aimed to investigate the effect of GLP1a on cardiovascular events in patients receiving ICIs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study using the TriNetX database. We identified adults with cancer and T2DM who received ICIs between April 2013 and May 2023. The primary efficacy outcome was incident MACE, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, need for coronary revascularization, heart failure, ischemic stroke, and cardiac arrest. The secondary efficacy outcomes were the individual components of MACE as well as myocarditis and pericarditis. Safety outcomes included the occurrence of immune-related adverse events, serious adverse events related to GLP1a use, and all-cause mortality. Results: We identified 7651 patients eligible for inclusion, among which 479 received GLP1a and 7172 received non-GLP1a diabetes medications. After matching (469 patients each), baseline characteristics were wellbalanced. Over a median 12-month follow-up, the GLP1a cohort had a significantly lower MACE incidence than the non-GLP1a cohort (9.0 vs. 17.1 events per 100 patient-years) with a 54 % lower risk of MACE (Hazard ratio (HR),0.46 [95 % CI: 0.32-0.67]). There were reductions in myocardial infarction or need for coronary revascularization, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, with no differences in other cardiovascular events. GLP1a use did not increase risk of adverse events, including pancreatitis, biliary disease, bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, and immune-related adverse events. Conclusion: GLP1a use in cancer patients with T2DM receiving ICIs was associated with reduced MACE and allcause mortality without an increased risk in serious adverse events.

TI  - Toward Better Risk Stratification for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Recipients: Implications of Explainable Machine Learning Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE
AB  - Background: Current guideline-based implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implants fail to meet the demands for precision medicine. Machine learning (ML) designed for survival analysis might facilitate personalized risk stratification. We aimed to develop explainable ML models predicting mortality and the first appropriate shock and compare these to standard Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression in ICD recipients. Methods and Results: Forty-five routine clinical variables were collected. Four fine-tuned ML approaches (elastic net Cox regression, random survival forests, survival support vector machine, and XGBoost) were applied and compared with the CPH model on the test set using Harrell's C-index. Of 887 adult patients enrolled, 199 patients died (5.0 per 100 person-years) and 265 first appropriate shocks occurred (12.4 per 100 person-years) during the follow-up. Patients were randomly split into training (75%) and test (25%) sets. Among ML models predicting death, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy and outperformed the CPH model (C-index: 0.794 vs. 0.760, p < 0.001). For appropriate shock, survival support vector machine showed the highest accuracy, although not statistically different from the CPH model (0.621 vs. 0.611, p = 0.243). The feature contribution of ML models assessed by SHAP values at individual and overall levels was in accordance with established knowledge. Accordingly, a bi-dimensional risk matrix integrating death and shock risk was built. This risk stratification framework further classified patients with different likelihoods of benefiting from ICD implant. Conclusions: Explainable ML models offer a promising tool to identify different risk scenarios in ICD-eligible patients and aid clinical decision making. Further evaluation is needed.

TI  - Needle in the heart: a rare case of cardiac tamponade caused by a migrated foreign body and mimicking ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background Pericardial tamponade is a serious condition which may eventually lead to severe haemodynamic disturbances and cardiac arrest. It is most often caused by the accumulation of fluid inside the pericardium, as a result of different aetiological factors such as pericarditis, neoplastic diseases, lymphatic dysfunctions, or idiopathic pericardial disease. Pericardial tamponade can develop after cardiac surgical procedures or as a complication of myocardial infarction. Collection of blood inside the pericardial sack can be the result of pericardial or cardiac trauma. It is exceedingly rare for the injury to be caused by a migrating foreign body. Although a typical picture of pericardial tamponade has been previously described, the disorder may clinically resemble an acute myocardial infarction. Case presentation We report the case of a 58-year-old female patient complaining of new onset thoracic pain and shortness of breath. Electrocardiographic examination results were suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction. However, echocardiography revealed significant pericardial tamponade. The cause was found to be a needle which remained inside the pelvis following a previous cesarean delivery, which the patient had undergone 18 years prior. In emergency setting, the needle was removed and the pericardial tamponade was resolved. Due to the prompt and efficient management, the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and presented no recurrence at the follow-up examinations. Conclusions The migration of foreign bodies through tissues is exceedingly rare. If present, it may cause life-threatening complications. Since the aetiology of pericardial tamponade is vast, a thorough assessment is highly important. Therefore, echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice. We wish to highlight the possibility of migrating foreign bodies as probable cause for pericardial tamponade, as well as the importance of echocardiographic methods in the fast-track evaluation of such critical conditions.

TI  - Increased lipoprotein(a) levels independently predict a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias: A comprehensive retrospective cohort study
T2  - HEART RHYTHM O2
AB  - BACKGROUND Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Beyond its role in cholesterol metabolism, Lp(a) promotes endothelial dysfunction, thrombogenesis, and inflammation, which may contribute to arrhythmogenesis independent of ASCVD. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the association between Lp(a) levels and the incidence of VA in a large, population-based cohort. METHODS Adults aged >= 18 years with available Lp(a) measurements were identified from the TriNetX research network. Patients were stratified into low (<= 75 nmol/L) and high Lp(a) groups (>75 nmol/L). The primary outcome was the incidence of VA, defined as ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, flutter, or cardiac arrest owing to cardiac causes. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for demographics, ASCVD risk factors, and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were performed after matching. RESULTS Before propensity score matching, 75,655 patients were in the low Lp(a) group and 40,860 in the high Lp(a) group. After matching, each cohort included 39,414 patients. VA occurred in 889 patients in the low and 718 in the high Lp(a) cohort. Mean follow-up was 3.35 years [low Lp(a)] and 1.90 years [high Lp(a)]. The high Lp(a) group had lower VA-free survival (84.30% vs 86.06%, P < .01). High Lp(a) was associated with increased VA risk (hazard ratio 0.855, 95% confidence interval 0.771-0.922, P 5 .045). CONCLUSION Elevated Lp(a) levels are independently associated with a higher incidence of VA, even after adjusting for ASCVD and its downstream consequences. Future research should explore mechanisms and therapeutic implications.

TI  - The TCRAT Technique (Total Coronary Revascularization via Left Anterior Thoracotomy): Renaissance in Minimally Invasive On-Pump Multivessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE
AB  - Total Coronary Revascularization via left Anterior Thoracotomy (TCRAT) represents a modern evolution of sternum-sparing, on-pump multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting. In this review, we will summarize the historical development, detail the surgical principles, and provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical outcomes of TCRAT. The technique combines cardiopulmonary bypass using peripheral arterial as well as venous cannulation and cardioplegic cardiac arrest using transthoracic aortic cross-clamping with surgical access through a left anterior minithoracotomy. By applying special slinging and rotational maneuvers, both a stable exposition of all coronary territories-in particular those of the right and the circumflex coronary artery-and a quiet, bloodless operating field enable complete anatomical revascularization and complex coronary surgery procedures, including all variations in multiarterial grafting in unselected patients. Data from all published clinical series were integrated, and a weighted analysis of a total of 2282 patients was performed. TCRAT proved to be very effective with regard to complete anatomical revascularization and modern grafting strategies, and it showed excellent perioperative safety in an all-comers population. Both the 30-day mortality and perioperative stroke incidence were distinctly below 1.0%. Data from mid-term follow-up, although rare so far, are promising and compare well to those of the important RCTs. The TCRAT approach eliminates sternal complications completely and accelerates recovery. As an on-pump arrested-heart surgery, TCRAT inherently permits the combination of minimally invasive multivessel CABG with a variety of other cardiac operations, mainly the combination with valve procedures. The integration of robotic and endoscopic assistance represents the next evolutionary step. With its reproducibility and broad applicability, TCRAT holds strong potential to become a standard routine technique in the field of minimally invasive cardiac surgery.

TI  - Managerial leadership and ischaemic heart disease among employees: the Swedish WOLF study
T2  - OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between managerial leadership and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) among employees.
   Methods: Data on 3122 Swedish male employees were drawn from a prospective cohort study (WOLF). Baseline screening was carried out in 1992-1995. Managerial leadership behaviours (consideration for individual employees, provision of clarity in goals and role expectations, supplying information and feedback, ability to carry out changes at work successfully, and promotion of employee participation and control) were rated by subordinates. Records of employee hospital admissions with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina and deaths from IHD or cardiac arrest to the end of 2003 were used to ascertain IHD. Cox proportional-hazards analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios for incident IHD per 1 standard deviation increase in standardised leadership score.
   Results: 74 incident IHD events occurred during the mean follow-up period of 9.7 years. Higher leadership score was associated with lower IHD risk. The inverse association was stronger the longer the participant had worked in the same workplace (age-adjusted hazard ratio 0.76 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.96) for employment for 1 year, 0.77 (0.61 to 0.97) for 2 years, 0.69 (0.54 to 0.88) for 3 years, and 0.61 (0.47 to 0.80) for 4 years); this association was robust to adjustments for education, social class, income, supervisory status, perceived physical load at work, smoking, physical exercise, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, fibrinogen and diabetes. The dose response association between perceived leadership behaviours and IHD was also evident in subsidiary analyses with only acute myocardial infarction and cardiac death as the outcome.
   Conclusion: If the observed associations were causal then workplace interventions should focus on concrete managerial behaviours in order to prevent IHD in employees.

TI  - Clinical Significance of Early Repolarization in Long QT Syndrome
T2  - JACC-CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine the prevalence of early repolarization pattern (ERP) within a large cohort of patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) and examine the correlation and clinical significance of ERP with symptomatic status and subsequent risk of breakthrough cardiac events (BCEs).
   BACKGROUND The electrocardiographic ERP is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death.
   METHODS ERP was defined as an end-QRS notch or slur on the downslope of a prominent R-wave with a J point >= 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous leads of the 12-lead electrocardiogram, excluding V1 to V3. A patient was considered previously symptomatic if they had a suspected LQTS-triggered cardiac event prior to diagnosis. BCEs were defined as LQTS-attributable syncope/seizures, aborted cardiac arrest, appropriate ventricular fibrillation-terminating implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, and sudden cardiac death following diagnosis and institution of a LQTS-directed treatment program.
   RESULTS In this study, 528 patients (57% female) with genotype-confirmed LQTS (283 with LQT1, 193 with LQT2, and 52 with LQT3) were reviewed from which 2,618 electrocardiograms were analyzed over a median follow-up of 6.7 (interquartile range, 3.6 to 10 years) years. Eighty-two (15.5%; female 51%) patients were identified as having ERP; 40 (50%) of these ERP-positive patients showed persistent ERP. One hundred twenty-four patients (23.5%) were classified as previously symptomatic LQTS and 39 (7.2%) experienced a subsequent BCE. ERP was not associated with either symptomatic status (p = 0.62) or BCE (p = 0.61).
   CONCLUSIONS Although ERP is common in LQTS, this extensive study suggests that the presence of concomitant ERP does not correlate with either those with a history of LQTS-triggered events prior to diagnosis or those with subsequent BCEs from their treated LQTS substrate.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Spironolactone in Patients With HFpEF and Chronic Kidney Disease
T2  - JACC-HEART FAILURE
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study investigated the association between baseline renal function and the net benefit of spironolactone in patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
   BACKGROUND Guidelines recommend consideration of spironolactone to reduce HF hospitalization in HFpEF. However, spironolactone may increase risk for hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease.
   METHODS This investigation analyzed data from patients enrolled in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) Americas study (N = 1,767) to examine the association between the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest, as well as safety outcomes, including hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and permanent drug discontinuation for adverse events (AEs). Variations in the efficacy and safety of spironolactone according to eGFR were examined in Cox models using interaction terms.
   RESULTS The incidence of both the primary outcome and drug-related AEs increased with declining eGFR. Compared with placebo, across all eGFR categories, spironolactone was associated with lower relative risk for the primary efficacy outcome and for hypokalemia, but higher relative risk for hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and drug discontinuation. During 4-year follow-up, the absolute risk for AEs that prompted drug discontinuation was amplified in the lower eGFR categories, which suggested heightened risk for drug intolerance with declining renal function.
   CONCLUSIONS Although consistent efficacy of spironolactone was observed across the range of eGFR, the risk of AEs was amplified in the lower eGFR categories. These data supported use of spironolactone to treat HFpEF patients with advanced chronic kidney disease only when close laboratory surveillance is possible.

TI  - Coronary vasospasms and other cardiac manifestations in Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Clinical impact and frequency in a monocentre study of 103 patients
T2  - RMD OPEN
AB  - Background Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic necrotising vasculitis characterised by tissue and blood hypereosinophilia. Cardiac involvement has previously been identified as the most significant predictor of mortality.Objective To identify and characterise previously untreated patients with EGPA and their cardiac manifestations at disease onset.Methods A retrospective monocentre study was conducted on 103 patients. Upon patient presentation, detailed multidisciplinary physical evaluations and laboratory diagnostics were performed. Cardiac events were defined as EGPA-related abnormalities in ECG, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, invasive coronary angiography or cardiac histopathology.Results Cardiac manifestations were diagnosed in 36 of 103 patients with EGPA (35%). Patients with EGPA with cardiac involvement (EGPA-CI) exhibited typical symptoms of EGPA concomitant with elevated cardiac biomarkers. Pericarditis (77%), cardiomyopathy with cardiac failure (55%) and definite myocarditis (36%) were the most common diagnoses, which in some cases resulted in cardiogenic shock (14%) or cardiac arrest (6%). Vasospastic coronary arteries causing myocardial infarctions were identified as a life-threatening cardiac manifestation in 8% of patients with EGPA-CI. Overall, patients with EGPA-CI presented with significantly higher disease activity and worse prognosis, with elevated median eosinophilic count and C-reactive protein levels.Conclusions Cardiac involvement is a common initial manifestation of EGPA and is associated with elevated systemic disease activity. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, coronary vasospasms were identified as a rare and severe manifestation of EGPA that may mimic myocardial infarction. Consequently, at the early stage of disease, patients may present with advanced cardiac impairment, emphasising the necessity of prompt diagnostic and therapeutic intervention to positively affect prognosis.

TI  - Radical surgery versus organ preservation via short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery for early-stage rectal cancer (TREC): a randomised, open-label feasibility study
T2  - LANCET GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
AB  - Background Radical surgery via total mesorectal excision might not be the optimal first-line treatment for early-stage rectal cancer. An organ-preserving strategy with selective total mesorectal excision could reduce the adverse effects of treatment without substantially compromising oncological outcomes. We investigated the feasibility of recruiting patients to a randomised trial comparing an organ-preserving strategy with total mesorectal excision.
   Methods TREC was a randomised, open-label feasibility study done at 21 tertiary referral centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with rectal adenocarcinoma, staged T2 or lower, with a maximum diameter of 30 mm or less; patients with lymph node involvement or metastases were excluded. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) by use of a computer-based randomisation service to undergo organ preservation with short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery after 8-10 weeks, or total mesorectal excision. Where the transanal endoscopic microsurgery specimen showed histopathological features associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, patients were considered for planned early conversion to total mesorectal excision. A non-randomised prospective registry captured patients for whom randomisation was considered inappropriate, because of a strong clinical indication for one treatment group. The primary endpoint was cumulative randomisation at 12, 18, and 24 months. Secondary outcomes evaluated safety, efficacy, and health-related quality of life assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 and CR29 in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN14422743.
   Findings Between Feb 22, 2012, and Dec 19, 2014, 55 patients were randomly assigned at 15 sites; 27 to organ preservation and 28 to radical surgery. Cumulatively, 18 patients had been randomly assigned at 12 months, 31 at 18 months, and 39 at 24 months. No patients died within 30 days of initial treatment, but one patient randomly assigned to organ preservation died within 6 months following conversion to total mesorectal excision with anastomotic leakage. Eight (30%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation were converted to total mesorectal excision. Serious adverse events were reported in four (15%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation versus 11 (39%) of 28 randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (p=0.04, chi(2) test). Serious adverse events associated with organ preservation were most commonly due to rectal bleeding or pain following transanal endoscopic microsurgery (reported in three cases). Radical total mesorectal excision was associated with medical and surgical complications including anastornotic leakage (two patients), kidney injury (two patients), cardiac arrest (one patient), and pneumonia (two patients). Histopathological features that would be considered to be associated with increased risk of tumour recurrence if observed after transanal endoscopic microsurgery alone were present in 16 (59%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation, versus 24 (86%) of 28 randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (p=0 . 03, chi(2) test). Eight (30%) of 27 patients assigned to organ preservation achieved a complete response to radiotherapy. Patients who were randomly assigned to organ preservation showed improvements in patient-reported bowel toxicities and quality of life and function scores in multiple items compared to those who were randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision, which were sustained over 36 months' follow-up. The non-randomised registry comprised 61 patients who underwent organ preservation and seven who underwent radical surgery. Non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation were older than randomised patients and more likely to have life-limiting comorbidities. Serious adverse events occurred in ten (16%) of 61 non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation versus one (14%) of seven who underwent total mesorectal excision. 24 (39%) of 61 non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation had high-risk histopathological features, while 25 (41%) of 61 achieved a complete response. Overall, organ preservation was achieved in 19 (70%) of 27 randomised patients and 56 (92%) of 61 non-randomised patients.
   Interpretation Short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery achieves high levels of organ preservation, with relatively low morbidity and indications of improved quality of life. These data support the use of organ preservation for patients considered unsuitable for primary total mesorectal excision due to the short-term risks associated with this surgery, and support further evaluation of short-course radiotherapy to achieve organ preservation in patients considered fit for total mesorectal excision. Larger randomised studies, such as the ongoing STAR-TREC study, are needed to more precisely determine oncological outcomes following different organ preservation treatment schedules.

TI  - Prognostic value of right ventricular trabecular complexity in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
AB  - ObjectivesThe present study aimed to investigate the incremental prognostic value of the right ventricular fractal dimension (FD), a novel marker of myocardial trabecular complexity by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM).MethodsConsecutive patients with ACM undergoing CMR were followed up for major cardiac events, including sudden cardiac death, aborted cardiac arrest, and appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator intervention. Prognosis prediction was compared by Cox regression analysis. We established a multivariable model supplemented with RV FD and evaluated its discrimination by Harrell's C-statistic. We compared the category-free, continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) and integrated discrimination index (IDI) before and after the addition of FD.ResultsA total of 105 patients were prospectively included from three centers and followed up for a median of 60 (48, 66) months; experienced 36 major cardiac events were recorded. Trabecular FD displayed a strong unadjusted association with major cardiac events (p<0.05). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, RV maximal apical FD maintained an independent association with major cardiac events (hazard ratio, 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p<0.002). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test displayed good fit (X-2=0.68, p=0.99). Diagnostic performance was significantly improved after the addition of RV maximal apical FD to the multivariable baseline model, and the continuous net reclassification improvement increased 21% (p=0.001), and the integrated discrimination index improved 16% (p=0.045).ConclusionsIn patients with ACM, CMR-assessed myocardial trabecular complexity was independently correlated with adverse cardiovascular events and provided incremental prognostic value.Clinical relevance statementThe application of FD values for assessing RV myocardial trabeculae may become an accessible and promising parameter in monitoring and early diagnosis of risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events in patients with ACM.Key Points center dot Ventricular trabecular morphology, a novel quantitative marker by CMR, has been explored for the first time to determine the severity of ACM.center dot Patients with higher maximal apical fractal dimension of RV displayed significantly higher cumulative incidence of major cardiac events.center dot RV maximal apical FD was independently associated with major cardiac events and provided incremental prognostic value in patients with ACM.

TI  - Lifesaving surgical approaches for severe penetrating knife injury to the neck
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundPenetrating neck injuries are rare and require urgent surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. This report highlights a unique case involving complex surgical repair of tracheal, esophageal, and vascular injuries following a homicidal assault, emphasizing the challenges and techniques used in managing such severe trauma.Case presentationA 45-year-old female presented with a severe penetrating neck injury after an alleged homicidal assault with a knife. The patient was in hypovolemic shock and required immediate resuscitation. Endotracheal intubation was performed through the transected tracheal segment, followed by surgical exploration in the operating room. Findings included partial transection of the carotid sheath, complete transection of the trachea, and oesophagus. Surgical repair involved using lateral polypropylene 5-O sutures for the carotid sheath, end-to-end oesophageal repair with absorbable 3 - 0 polygalactin sutures. As tracheal repair was not possible posterior wall was approximated with 3 - 0 polypropylene and size 7 tracheostomy tube was inserted and secured. The patient was managed post-operatively in the ICU and was discharged in stable condition on the 25th day adviced regular follow-up. This case underscores the importance of prompt airway management and surgical intervention in penetrating neck injuries. The meticulous repair of all injured structures and diligent post-operative care are crucial to a successful outcome. This report contributes to the limited literature on managing complex penetrating stab injuries to the neck and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in such cases.

TI  - Case Report: Anaphylactic shock and ST-elevation myocardial infarction following a bee sting: two deadly diseases in a patient with Kounis syndrome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Kounis syndrome is an acute coronary syndrome occurring in the setting of an allergic reaction, usually caused by drug administration, food ingestion, or insect sting. We report the case of an elderly woman who presented to the emergency room suffering from an anaphylactic shock caused by a bee sting and who was diagnosed with an anterolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with moderately impaired left ventricular ejection. The patient was successfully managed with the administration of intravenous antihistaminic drugs and steroids, intravenous fluid volume resuscitation, and intramuscular epinephrine. The patient then underwent emergency coronary angiography, which showed a thrombotic subtotal occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and occlusion of the very distal apical LAD due to a spontaneous embolism. This was treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention with thrombus aspiration and drug-eluting stent implantation in the proximal LAD, achieving a good angiographic result. Nevertheless, on day 3, the patient developed a left ventricular apical thrombosis, as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance, requiring oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, de-escalation of dual antiplatelet therapy from ticagrelor to clopidogrel with acetylsalicylic acid, and finally a switch to dual antithrombotic therapy. The 3-month follow-up was uneventful. This case highlights the importance of prompt identification of Kounis syndrome in patients presenting with severe allergic reactions to allow for the timely implementation of appropriate reperfusion strategies in such high-risk patients with STEMI.

TI  - Case report: Dieulafoy's lesion as a rare cause of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and importance: Dieulafoy's lesion is a rare but serious cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, typically affecting older adults. It involves an aberrant arteriole eroding the gastric mucosa, resulting in severe, recurrent bleeding that poses diagnostic and management challenges. We present a case report of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability associated with a Dieulafoy's lesion. Case presentation: A 55-year-old male with no significant medical history presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, showing signs of hematemesis and melena. He was hemodynamically unstable upon admission, with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL. After resuscitation and stabilization, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a 5 mm Dieulafoy lesion in the fundus, treated successfully with hemostatic clips. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth day, with normal follow-up at one year and no complications. Clinical discussion: Dieulafoy's lesion, a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, is found in 1-2 % of cases, primarily in males over 60 years old. First described by Dieulafoy, it results from an aberrant arteriole erosion, commonly in the upper stomach. Diagnosis is challenging during active bleeding and often requires multiple endoscopies. Mechanical hemostasis methods during endoscopy are effective, with recurrence rates of 8-10 %. Surgical intervention is reserved for severe, uncontrolled cases. Conclusion: Dieulafoy's lesion, though rare, requires prompt diagnosis and effective endoscopic treatment to manage severe bleeding. Combining hemostatic techniques or surgical options may be necessary to address persistent cases and improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Management of pediatric blunt abdominal trauma with split liver or spleen injuries: a retrospective study
T2  - PEDIATRIC SURGERY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - BackgroundBlunt abdominal trauma is a prevailing cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. It constitutes the most frequent type of pediatric injuries. Contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are considered pivotal diagnostic modalities in hemodynamically stable patients.AimTo report the experience in management of pediatric split liver and spleen injuries using CEUS and CECT.Patients and methodsThis study included 246 children who sustained blunt abdominal trauma, and admitted and treated at three tertiary hospitals in the period of 5 years. Primary resuscitation was offered to all children based on the advanced trauma and life support (ATLS) protocol. A special algorithm for decision-making was followed. It incorporated the FAST, baseline ultrasound (US), CEUS, and CECT. Patients were treated according to the imaging findings and hemodynamic stability.ResultsAll 246 children who sustained a blunt abdominal were studied. Patients' age was 10.5 +/- 2.1. Road traffic accidents were the most common cause of trauma; 155 patients (63%). CECT showed the extent of injury in 153 patients' spleen (62%) and 78 patients' liver (32%), while the remaining 15 (6%) patients had both injuries. CEUS detected 142 (57.7%) spleen injury, and 67 (27.2%) liver injury.ConclusionsCEUS may be a useful diagnostic tool among hemodynamically stable children who sustained low-to-moderate energy isolated blunt abdominal trauma. It may be also helpful for further evaluation of uncertain CECT findings and follow-up of conservatively managed traumatic injuries.

TI  - Myocardial salvage with early anistreplase treatment
T2  - CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY
AB  - This randomized, double-blind trial in 311 patients with acute myocardial infarction has shown that very early therapy with anistreplase outside the hospital is not only feasible, but provides a major survival advantage. The difference in the median delay to treatment between the group treated in the hospital and those treated earlier was 2 1/4 h. After 30 months, mortality in the early group was less than half that in the later group, so that every hour of delay beyond 2 h resulted in almost 7 additional deaths per 100 patients treated. This is a greater percentage loss of life than would have resulted from a similar delay in the provision of resuscitation for the prehospital cardiac arrest. Multivariate analysis showed that age, treatment delay, and time of presentation were significant risk factors, with patients presenting at 1 h having more than twice the mortality of those presenting at 4 h; the sicker the patient, the earlier the presentation. By 5 years, prehospital administration of anistreplase, by saving 2 h, resulted in an additional 57% of a year's survival per patient. This compares favorably with the projected 14% of a year survival per patient reported with TPA versus streptokinase in GUSTO. Prehospital therapy with anistreplase was highly cost effective when compared with streptokinase given in hospital, and the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio was much lower than that for TPA versus streptokinase derived from GUSTO.

TI  - Hepatosplanchnic and peripheral tissue oxygenation during treatment of hemorrhagic shock:: The effects of pentoxifylline administration
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
AB  - Objective
   To evaluate the effects of pentoxifylline (PF) administration on liver, gut, and peripheral oxygenation during crystalloid resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock.
   Summary Background Data
   Hypoperfusion of the hepatosplanchnic vascular bed and hypoxia of vital organs may be prolonged despite adequate therapy of hemorrhagic shock. Vasoconstriction, leukostasis, platelet aggregation, and red blood cell plugging could be the underlying causes. PF has been shown to counteract these effects, but its effects in a large animal shock model have been less studied,
   Methods
   Thirteen anesthetized piglets (mean weight 19.6 kg) were bled steadily to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 to 50 mmHg and a 70% reduction in cardiac output during 1 hour. These levels were maintained for an additional hour. The animals were resuscitated with acetated Ringer's solution according to MAP and cardiac output values and followed for 80 minutes (total 3 hours and 20 minutes). Seven piglets were given PF boluses (12.5 mg/kg) and infusion (0.2 mg/kg.min), and the rest (n = 6) served as controls. Hemodynamic and systemic oxygen transport variables were recorded. Liver parenchymal and peripheral tissue (subcutaneous, transcutaneous, conjunctival) oxygen tensions (P-O2) were measured continuously with polarographic electrodes. Jejunal intramucosal pH (pHi) was calculated every hour by the luminal P-CO2, obtained with a balloon tonometer, and arterial bicarbonate concentration.
   Results
   Cardiac output decreased by a mean of 76% during shock and was restored during resuscitation in both groups. MAP decreased from 110 to 40 mmHg but remained at 70 to 80 mmHg during resuscitation in both groups despite remarkable volume load (2.6 ml/min per kg). Liver parenchymal P-O2 decreased from 29 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 1 mmHg during shock and inc;eased to 36 +/- 2 mmHg in the PF group, whereas in control group it remained at 26 mmHg. The difference between groups was significant, but at the end of follow-up the liver P-O2 decreased to 21 mmHg in both groups. Gut pHi, peripheral tissue oxygen tensions, and the plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations did not differ between the groups.
   Conclusions
   Pentoxifylline improved specifically, although only transiently, liver tissue oxygenation. Perhaps;the microvascular abnormalities after resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock are more prominent in the hepatic vascular bed, rendering PF specifically effective in that area. The lack of any effect of PF on gut and peripheral tissue oxygenation may have resulted from the persistent vasoconstriction and inadequate restoration of blood volume with crystalloid solution.

TI  - Safer obstetric anesthesia through education and mentorship: a model for knowledge translation in Rwanda
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
AB  - High rates of maternal mortality remain a widespread problem in the developing world. Skilled anesthesia providers are required for the safe conduct of Cesarean delivery and resuscitation during obstetrical crises. Few anesthesia providers in low-resource settings have access to continuing education. In Rwanda, anesthesia technicians with only three years of post-secondary training must manage complex maternal emergencies in geographically isolated areas. The purpose of this special article is to describe implementation of the SAFE (Safer Anesthesia From Education) Obstetric Anesthesia course in Rwanda, a three-day refresher course designed to improve obstetrical anesthesia knowledge and skills for practitioners in low-resource areas. In addition, we describe how the course facilitated the knowledge-to-action (KTA) cycle whereby a series of steps are followed to promote the uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice. The KTA cycle requires locally relevant teaching interventions and continuation of knowledge post intervention. In Rwanda, this meant carefully considering educational needs, revising curricula to suit the local context, employing active experiential learning during the SAFE Obstetric Anesthesia course, encouraging supportive relationships with peers and mentors, and using participant action plans for change, post-course logbooks, and follow-up interviews with participants six months after the course. During those interviews, participants reported improvements in clinical practice and greater confidence in coordinating team activities. Anesthesia safety remains challenged by resource limitations and resistance to change by health care providers who did not attend the course. Future teaching interventions will address the need for team training.

TI  - "Shortly Afterwards I Was Practically Dead"-Temporal Experiences of Middle-Aged Individuals With Heart Disease: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - Changes in the experience of time have originally been described in mental disorders within the framework of the phenomenological psychopathology of the lived time. Both phenomenological and qualitative empirical studies have shown that physical illnesses, such as cancer or chronic pain, can be accompanied by a change in experienced temporality. Likewise, the sudden onset of severe heart disease in early and middle age represents a biographical break for the patient and can lead to numerous changes in the experience of time. In our qualitative study, a purposive sample of sixteen patients aged 30-59 years was included. Of these, four patients had sudden cardiac arrest, seven had myocardial infarction, and five had other severe cardiac diseases. Phenomenological semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Patients reported that their temporality changed after serious heart disease. The experience of the participants can be summarized in five themes: "Heart disease as a biographical turning point," "The clock can stop any moment," "Feeling prematurely aged by heart disease," "Other people's time is not my time," and "Just living in the moment." From a psychocardiological perspective, a temporal analysis of severe heart disease can help caregivers understand and support patients better. Further studies should be conducted on cardiac patients with a lower disease burden, sex-specific issues, and young cardiac patients with congenital heart disease.

TI  - Take-home naloxone to reduce heroin death
T2  - ADDICTION
AB  - Background This paper reviews the relevant literature related to the distribution of take-home naloxone.
   Methods A Medline search was conducted on articles published between January 1990 and June 2004 to identify scientific literature relevant to this subject. Those publications were reviewed, and from them other literature was identified and reviewed.
   Results The prevalence, pathophysiology and circumstances of heroin overdose, and also bystander response are included in this review. Naloxone peer distribution has been instituted to varying degrees in the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom.
   Conclusion At this point the evidence supporting naloxone distribution is primarily anecdotal, although promising. Although the distribution of naloxone holds promise for further reducing heroin overdose mortality, problems remain. Naloxone alone may be insufficient in some cases to revive the victim, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially rescue breathing, may also be needed. A second dose of naloxone might be necessary. Complications following resuscitation from overdose may infrequently need in-hospital care. Mortality from injecting without anyone else present will be unaffected by take-home naloxone. Take-home naloxone should be studied in a rigorous scientific manner.

TI  - Successful management of a delayed presentation of traumatic descending thoracic aorta pseudoaneurysm: a literature review based on a case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundBlunt traumatic aortic injury (BTAI) is the second leading cause of death due to traumas in young patients. The primary presentation might be chest or interscapular pain, difficulty in breathing, and, in severe cases, hypotension. Considering the rapid deterioration of these patients' clinical conditions, prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation are crucial. In these injuries, the most involved parts of the aorta are the isthmus (distal to the left subclavian artery) and the descending part in the thorax. Therefore, the main diagnostic strategies include transthoracic echocardiography, CT angiography, and endovascular diagnostic approaches.Case presentationThe patient was a 19-year-old male presenting with the symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, and extremities excruciating pain after a car turnover. The initial evaluation showed no abnormal cardiovascular finding except bilateral hemothorax, addressed with chest tubes. Twelve hours later, when the patient was under observation for orthopedic surgeries, his chest pain and dyspnea started, and TTE and CTA showed a grade three descending aneurysm of the aorta. The patient was treated immediately with an endovascular procedure of stent implantation. A delayed debranching surgery was also performed, which resulted in desirable outcomes and uneventful follow-up.BackgroundBlunt traumatic aortic injury (BTAI) is the second leading cause of death due to traumas in young patients.

Debranching surgery, which can be done simultaneously or with delay after the initial procedure, has proven protective against thromboembolic cerebral events.Clinical key pointPatients with an aneurysm of the aorta should be transported to a medical center with a multidisciplinary team for an urgent evaluation and treatment. The initial resuscitation and diagnosis are challenging, considering the fatal nature of these injuries, and the selection of the treatment is based on the patient's clinical condition and evaluated anatomy in cardiovascular imaging.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes, and Preferences of Advance Decisions, End-of-Life Care, and Place of Care and Death in Hong Kong. A Population-Based Telephone Survey of 1067 Adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objectives: According to the 2015 Quality of Death Index published by the Intelligence Unit of the Economist, Hong Kong is ranked 22nd in terms of quality of palliative care in the world, behind many other major developed countries in Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. The objectives of the present study were to describe the knowledge, attitude, and preferences of the general Hong Kong adult population across different age groups regarding end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, place of care and death, as well as advance directive (AD).
   Methods: This was a population-based cross-sectional survey conducted by telephone. A total of 1067 adults over 30 years old were contacted through residential telephone lines using a random sampling method and were interviewed. Information on sociodemographic factors, general health status, chronic diseases, knowledge, attitude and preferences of advance decisions, EOL care, and place of death were collected.
   Results: A total of 85.7% had not heard of AD, but 60.9% would prefer to make their own AD if legislated after explanation; and for those who did not prefer to have an AD, the predominant concern was the possible change of mind afterward. Adjusted logistic regression suggested that female participants were less willing to make an AD, whereas those with prior knowledge of do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation significantly increased the chance of making an AD. In terms of life-sustaining treatments, a predominant 87.6% preferred to receive appropriate palliative care that gives comfort rather than to prolong life if being diagnosed to be terminally ill; 43% disagreed that doctors should generally try to keep patients alive for as long as possible; and 86.2% agreed that the patient's own wishes should determine what treatment he/she should receive. Adjusted logistic regression showed that palliative care was more preferred by age groups 50 years or above but was less preferred by those who did not care for their family members with chronic diseases. Regarding place of death, 31.2% of the participants would choose to die at home, and among those, 19.5% would still prefer to die at home even if they did not have sufficient support. Adjusted logistic regression showed a decreased trend for all older age groups from 40-49 years to 80+years, as well as having poor self-rated health, to prefer to die at home. Being a female participant and having education level of tertiary or above, however, had higher preference for death at home.
   Conclusions: This is the first population-representative survey of the general Hong Kong adult population on the knowledge, attitude, and preferences of AD, EOL care, and place of care/death. The main implication of this study was that preferences to have autonomy over own EOL care, to receive palliative care, and to die at home were greater than the actual practice currently, highlighting the service gaps for better EOL care in the future.

TI  - Learning by teaching basic life support: a non-randomized controlled trial with medical students
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundCardiopulmonary resuscitation is usually taught in universities through theoretical lectures and simulations on mannequins with low retention of knowledge and skills. New teaching methodologies have been used to improve the learning, placing the student at the center of the process. Likewise, the outside community knows next to nothing about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patients who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest will die if the effective maneuvers are not promptly done. Learning by teaching could be a way to answer both requirements. It was therefore decided to evaluate whether the medical students' cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance would improve when they teach other people, and if those people could learn with them effectively.MethodsA non-randomized controlled trial was designed to assess whether teaching Basic Life Support would increase students' learning. Socially engaged, seeking to disseminate knowledge, 92 medical students were trained in Basic Life Support and who subsequently trained 240 community health professionals. The students performed theoretical and practical pre- and post-tests whereas the health professionals performed theoretical pre- and post-tests and one practical test. In order to assess the impact of teaching on students' learning, they were divided into two groups: a case group, with 53 students, reassessed after teaching health professionals, and a control group, with 39 students, reassessed before teaching.ResultsThe practical students' performance of the case group went from 13.32.1 to 15.3 +/- 1.2 (maximum=17, p<0.001) and theoretical from 10.1 +/- 3.0 to 16.4 +/- 1.7 (maximum=20, p<0.001) while the performance of the control group went from 14.4 +/- 1.6 to 14.4 +/- 1.4 (p=0.877) and from 11.2 +/- 2.6 to 15.0 +/- 2.3 (p<0.001), respectively. The theoretical performance of the health professionals changed from 7.9 +/- 3.6 to 13.3 +/- 3.2 (p<0.001) and the practical performance was 11.7 +/- 3.2.Conclusions<p The students who passed through the teaching activity had a theoretical and practical performance superior to that of the control group. The community was able to learn from the students. The study demonstrated that the didactic activity can be an effective methodology of learning, besides allowing the dissemination of knowledge. The University, going beyond its academic boundaries, performs its social responsibility.

TI  - Clinical frailty score for hospital outcome for patients aged ≥ 75 following emergency department resuscitation room admission: a retrospective monocenter study
T2  - INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Elderly patients (>= 75 years) often require resuscitation room (RR) care in the emergency department (ED), yet decisions regarding intensive care unit (ICU) admission remain complex. Assessment of quality of life and frailty is necessary to determine the level of care required for elderly patients. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a validated tool for assessing frailty and predicting mortality, but its role in ICU triage remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the CFS of patients admitted to the ICU with those admitted to the general inpatient unit (GIU) after receiving initial intensive care. This was a retrospective, single-center study including patients aged >= 75 years admitted to the ED RR from November 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. The primary outcome was the comparison of CFS between ICU and GIU admissions after RR management. Secondary outcomes included predictive performance of CFS for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Of the 392 patients enrolled, 170 (43%) were admitted to the ICU and 222 (57%) to the GIU. The median CFS was 3 (2-4) in ICU-admitted patients and 4 (3-5) in GIU-admitted patients (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality rate was 30/170 (18%) in the ICU-admitted group and 35/222 (16%) in the GIU-admitted group (p = 0.72). CFS predictive value for ICU admission had an area under the curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.63-0.73) and for in-hospital mortality of 0.62 (95%CI: 0.55-0.69). In elderly patients admitted to the RR, CFS values differed between those admitted to ICU and those admitted to GIU. However, the discriminative performance of CFS for hospital orientation and in-hospital mortality was limited. These findings suggest that frailty assessment may contribute to the overall evaluation of elderly patients in the ED RR but should be interpreted in conjunction with acute severity scores and clinical judgment.

TI  - Transtracheal oxygenation - An alternative to endotracheal intubation during cardiac arrest
T2  - CHEST
CP  - 30th Educational and Scientific Symposium of the Society-of-Critical-Care-Medicine
AB  - Study objectives: Because efforts to secure adequate arterial oxygenation during cardiac resuscitation are more important than efforts to promote CO2 elimination, we investigated whether continuous transtracheal oxygenation (TTO) could represent a potentially simpler alternative to conventional positive-pressure ventilation with 100% O-2 through an endotracheal tube.
   Design: Controlled and randomized.
   Setting: Animal laboratory.
   Participants: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Interventions: The technique for TTO was initially developed and tested in five rats. A model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was then used to compare the effects of TTO (n = 5) with the effects of O-2 delivery through an endotracheal tube as part of positive-pressure ventilation (n = 5) or through a mask without additional airway intervention (n = 5). VF was induced and left untreated for 4 min, after which chest compression and one of the three oxygenation interventions was started. Defibrillation was attempted after 6 min of chest compression. In a subsequent series, defibrillation was attempted after 10 min of chest compression in rats treated with either TTO (n = 5) or endotracheal intubation (ET; n = 5).
   Measurement and results: TTO and ET secured adequate arterial Pot during chest compression (213 +/- 77 mm Hg and 154 +/- 36 mm Hg; not significant), whereas the mask yielded an arterial Po-2 of only 49 +/- 38 mm Hg (p < 0.05). Each rat treated with TTO or ET was successfully resuscitated and survived the postresuscitation interval, but none of the rats treated with the mask survived. TTO maintained its efficacy after increased duration of chest compression.
   Conclusion: TTO was as effective as conventional positive-pressure ventilation with 100% O-2 for securing oxygenation, resuscitation, and short-term survival and more effective than O-2 delivered through a mask.

TI  - Outcome Prediction in Postanoxic Coma With Deep Learning*
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Visual assessment of the electroencephalogram by experienced clinical neurophysiologists allows reliable outcome prediction of approximately half of all comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Deep neural networks hold promise to achieve similar or even better performance, being more objective and consistent. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Medical ICU of five teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients: Eight-hundred ninety-five consecutive comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Continuous electroencephalogram was recorded during the first 3 days after cardiac arrest. Functional outcome at 6 months was classified as good (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2) or poor (Cerebral Performance Category 3-5). We trained a convolutional neural network, with a VGG architecture (introduced by the Oxford Visual Geometry Group), to predict neurologic outcome at 12 and 24 hours after cardiac arrest using electroencephalogram epochs and outcome labels as inputs. Output of the network was the probability of good outcome. Data from two hospitals were used for training and internal validation (n = 661). Eighty percent of these data was used for training and cross-validation, the remaining 20% for independent internal validation. Data from the other three hospitals were used for external validation (n = 234). Prediction of poor outcome was most accurate at 12 hours, with a sensitivity in the external validation set of 58% (95% CI, 51-65%) at false positive rate of 0% (CI, 0-7%). Good outcome could be predicted at 12 hours with a sensitivity of 48% (CI, 45-51%) at a false positive rate of 5% (CI, 0-15%) in the external validation set. Conclusions: Deep learning of electroencephalogram signals outperforms any previously reported outcome predictor of coma after cardiac arrest, including visual electroencephalogram assessment by trained electroencephalogram experts. Our approach offers the potential for objective and real time, bedside insight in the neurologic prognosis of comatose patients after cardiac arrest.

TI  - THE CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE OF SEIZURES IN CRITICALLY ILL YOUNG INFANTS REQUIRING INTENSIVE-CARE
T2  - NEUROPEDIATRICS
AB  - The aetiology, severity of systemic and biochemical abnormalities, seizure duration, EEGs and CT scans have been reviewed in previously normal young infants with an acute critical illness occurring after the first week of life; none of whom had birth asphyxia.  Findings were related to outcome in an attempt to evaluate the significance of seizures during the acute phase of severe illness.
   In three years seizures occurred in 54/251 (22%) young infants requiring ventilatory support.  In these patients the acute illness was most commonly infection and encephalitis/encephalopathy.  Twenty-one died, 24 had good or moderate outcome and 9 poor outcome (follow-up 6-27 months).  The outcome was not directly related to diagnosis, but to systemic and biochemical changes, the most important being severe hypotension (40/54).  After correction of these factors, in survivors, increasing number of days over which seizures occurred during the acute phase of illness was related to worsening outcome (tau(c) = 0.66, p < 0.0001).  In many of these patients one of three abnormal low density changes (generalized, boundary zone and focal) were seen on CT scan and were not uncommonly associated with focal/multifocal clonic seizures and characteristic type, distribution and evolution of EEG discharge.  In the 45 patients with EEGs from presentation, severity of encephalopathy assessed by predominant background EEG activity was most closely related to outcome, irrespective of aetiology and seizures.  There was a significant relationship between graded severity of background EEG activities and outcome both in the initial and serial recordings (tau(B) = 0.70, p < 0.0001 and 0.75, p < 0.0001 respectively).
   Seizures are a common occurrence in the previously well young infant with an acute critical illness necessitating intensive care.  Prompt recognition and treatment may influence outcome in patients with a potentially reversible encephalopathy.  However, in many patients seizures reflect severe, often multifactorial cerebral insult with variable morphological changes, EEG patterns and clinical outcome.

TI  - Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Death in United States Marathons
T2  - MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE
AB  - WEBNER, D., K. M. DUPREY, J. A. DREZNER, P. CRONHOLM, and W. O. ROBERTS. Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Death in United States Marathons. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 10, pp. 1843-1845, 2012. Purpose: There is no reporting system for marathon-associated sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death in the United States. The purpose of this study was to estimate and characterize the risk of marathon-related SCA to assist with emergency planning. Methods: A retrospective Web-based survey was sent out to all US marathon medical directors (n = 400) to gather details of SCA including demographics, resuscitation efforts, mortality, and autopsy results, if available. Results: A total of 88 surveys (22%) were returned from marathons run from 1976 to 2009 for a total of 1,710,052 participants. Risks of SCA and sudden cardiac death were 1 in 57,002 and 1 in 171,005, respectively. Men made up the vast majority of SCA victims (93%, mean age = 49.7 yr, range = 19-82 yr). Arrest site distributions were 0-5, 6-14, 15-22, and 23-26.2 miles. CAD was reported as the cause of death at autopsy in 7 of the 10 fatalities. An automated external defibrillator (AED) was used in 20/30 cases and associated with a higher survival (17/20 survivors vs 3/10 deaths, P = 0.0026). Conclusions: SCA occurs in approximately 1 in 57,000 marathon runners, is more common in older males, and usually occurs in the last 4 miles of the racecourse. Prompt resuscitation including early use of an AED improves survival. Emergency planning to include trained medical staff and sufficient AEDs throughout the racecourse is recommended.

TI  - Hyperoxia during extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory cardiac arrest is associated with severe circulatory failure and increased mortality
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background High levels of arterial oxygen pressures (PaO2) have been associated with increased mortality in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), but there is limited information regarding possible mechanisms linking hyperoxia and death in this setting, notably with respect to its hemodynamic consequences. We aimed therefore at evaluating a possible association between PaO2, circulatory failure and death during ECPR. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 44 consecutive cardiac arrest (CA) patients treated with ECPR to determine the association between the mean PaO2 over the first 24 h, arterial blood pressure, vasopressor and intravenous fluid therapies, mortality, and cause of deaths. Results Eleven patients (25%) survived to hospital discharge. The main causes of death were refractory circulatory shock (46%) and neurological damage (24%). Compared to survivors, non survivors had significantly higher mean 24 h PaO2 (306 +/- 121 mmHg vs 164 +/- 53 mmHg, p < 0.001), lower mean blood pressure and higher requirements in vasopressors and fluids, but displayed similar pulse pressure during the first 24 h (an index of native cardiac recovery). The mean 24 h PaO2 was significantly and positively correlated with the severity of hypotension and the intensity of vasoactive therapies. Patients dying from circulatory failure died after a median of 17 h, compared to a median of 58 h for patients dying from a neurological cause. Patients dying from neurological cause had better preserved blood pressure and lower vasopressor requirements. Conclusion In conclusion, hyperoxia is associated with increased mortality during ECPR, possibly by promoting circulatory collapse or delayed neurological damage.

TI  - Hypothermia: Beyond the Narrative Review-The Point of View of Emergency Physicians and Medico-Legal Considerations
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB  - Hypothermia is a widespread condition all over the world, with a high risk of mortality in pre-hospital and in-hospital settings when it is not promptly and adequately treated. In this review, we aim to describe the main specificities of the diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia through consideration of the physiological changes that occur in hypothermic patients. Hypothermia can occur due to unfavorable environmental conditions as well as internal causes, such as pathological states that result in reduced heat production, increased heat loss or ineffectiveness of the thermal regulation system. The consequences of hypothermia affect several systems in the body-the cardiovascular system, the central and peripheral nervous systems, the respiratory system, the endocrine system and the gastrointestinal system-but also kidney function, electrolyte balance and coagulation. Once hypothermia is recognized, prompt treatment, focused on restoring body temperature and supporting vital functions, is fundamental in order to avert preventable death. It is important to also denote the fact that CPR has specificities related to the unique profile of hypothermic patients.

TI  - Utilization of Multi-Parameter Blood Gas Analysis in Prehospital Emergency Medicine-A Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Prehospital blood gas analysis (BGA) is an evolving field that offers the potential for early identification and management of critically ill patients. However, the utility and accuracy of prehospital BGA are subjects of ongoing debate. Objectives: We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on prehospital BGA, including its indications, methods, and feasibility. Methods: We performed a scoping review of prehospital BGA. A thorough search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant studies focusing on prehospital BGA in adult patients. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Prehospital BGA was most frequently performed in patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, followed by traumatic and nontraumatic cases. The parameters most commonly analyzed were pH, pCO2, 2 , pO2, 2 , and lactate. Various sampling methods, including arterial, venous, and intraosseous, were reported for prehospital BGA. While prehospital BGA shows promise in facilitating early identification of critical patients and guiding resuscitation efforts, logistical challenges are to be considered. The handling of preclinical BGA is described as feasible and useful in most of the included studies. Conclusion: Prehospital BGA holds significant potential for enhancing patient care in the prehospital setting, though technical challenges need to be considered. However, further research is required to establish optimal indications and demonstrate the benefits for prehospital BGA in specific clinical contexts. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

TI  - One-stage embolization in patients with acutely ruptured poor-grade aneurysm
T2  - SURGICAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: Early or ultra-early surgery for patients in poor neurological condition (Hunt and Hess grade IV or V) after ictus of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is increasingly reported to prevent early rebleeding. To prevent any rebleeding after hospital admission, we have treated patients with poor-grade aneurysm during the same session as when diagnostic angiography is performed ("one-stage embolization"). The aim of the present study is to determine whether this treatment modality is a viable management option for this group of patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 18 consecutive patients who presented with acutely ruptured aneurysms and were in very poor neurological condition and who were treated with one-stage embolization.
   Results: 'We observed 2 complications related to the endovascular procedure: partial occlusion of the parent artery and aneurysm rupture during the procedure. According to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, good recovery occurred in 8 patients, and moderate and severe disabilities occurred in 4 and 3 patients, respectively, and 3 patients died. No rebleeding occurred after the procedure. The mean follow-up of the surviving patients (those who were alive more than 30 days after embolization) was 13.7 months (4-25 months). Three patients had surgery after endovascular procedure: 2 surgical clipping of failed or partial aneurysm embolization and 1 emergency coil removal with clipping. A permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed in 11 patients.
   Conclusions: We achieved promising results by using one-stage ernbolization to prevent ultra-early rebleeding followed by aggressive resuscitation. The active involvement of the endovascular team from the stage of diagnostic angiogram is a prerequisite for this treatment strategy. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia for brain injury after cardiac arrest
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Morbidity and mortality in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest primarily depends on neurological outcome. Clinical trials of therapies directed toward reducing the extent of neuronal damage by means of pharmacological agents have been disappointing. To date, the only clinically effective tool for amelioration of brain damage by ischemia and reperfusion is mild to moderate induced hypothermia. The pathophysiology of global hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, the mechanisms by which hypothermia confers neuroprotection, and the encouraging beneficial effects of mild to moderate hypothermia in experimental studies and clinical trials are discussed.

TI  - The Location Problem of Medical Drone Vertiports for Emergency Cardiac Arrest Needs
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The implementation of medical drones can quickly and efficiently expand the coverage range of an area, allowing for a faster response to incidences of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and improving the subsequent survival rate of such incidences, while promoting sustainable health development goals under the configuration standards for automatic external defibrillators in China. In response to the problem of the selection of locations for medical drone vertiports (for take-off and landing) that are equipped with automatic external defibrillation facilities, a survival function was introduced to establish a model for site selection, with the primary optimization objective of maximizing the average survival rate of patients and taking the operating costs of a system into account. At the same time, considering the constraints of drone phase operation time, energy consumption, coverage range, etc., a medical drone vertiport site selection model was established for emergency cardiac arrest needs. An improved immune algorithm was applied to the model's calculations and the analysis of the results, using the Jinnan District in Tianjin as an example. The results show that the proposed model and algorithm are feasible and applicable. The Jinnan District in the city of Tianjin requires a total of 24 medical drone vertiports in order to achieve full coverage of an area under the "golden 4-minute" rescue time. When the average survival rate of patients is 0.9, the operation results are deemed optimal, and the average survival rate of patients is 64.06%. Compared to ground ambulances currently used in hospitals, the implementation of medical drones could significantly shorten response time, improve the average survival rate of patients by 41.96%, and effectively improve the existing low survival rate and the accessibility of medical services. The results of this study can provide decision-making support for the planning of automatic external defibrillators in public places and the construction of sustainable and efficient emergency medical service systems.

TI  - What Evidence is Available on Rapid Response Systems Across Europe? Findings From a Scoping Review
T2  - NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Rapid Response Systems (RRS) aim to implement systematic processes for the early detection and management of emergencies in hospitals. Exploring the current characteristics and organisation of RRS in Europe and evaluating clinical outcomes may help identify areas for improvement. Aim: To provide an overview of the studies conducted in Europe, summarising the characteristics of RRS, their organisational structure and the clinical outcomes documented to date. Study Design: A scoping review was conducted according to the framework of Levac and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The review protocol was registered with Open Science Framework (OSF); CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Scopus were then searched. Quantitative primary studies about RRS conducted in Europe and published in English were included. Results: Twenty-three studies were found, of which 18 (78.3%) were published in the last 10 years. Eleven (47.8%) aimed to describe the function and activities of RRS, while 12 (52.2%) analysed patient outcomes and two (8.7%) the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of RRS. Heterogeneous organisational patterns of RRS emerged, including terminologies (Medical Emergency Team [MET], Rapid Response Team [RRT], Cardiac Arrest Team [CAT], Critical Care Outreach [CCO]), team composition, availability, activation systems and activities. Conclusions: The number of RRS studies is increasing, especially to compare their organisational structure under heterogeneous terminologies. Future research should investigate the outcome variations between different RRS structures. In addition, guidelines that standardise the minimum data set in the field of RRS by also introducing registries could increase consistency between European practices and studies. Relevance to Clinical Practise: Knowledge of the current situation of RRS in Europe can serve as a basis for policies and benchmark models to promote better patient care.

TI  - Trauma resuscitation with Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood Or Products: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial (the TROOP trial)
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundHemorrhage is the most common cause of potentially preventable death after injury. Balanced transfusion with red blood cells, plasma, and platelets (component therapy, CT) has been shown to reduce mortality, and is the standard of care. Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) is an attractive alternative to CT, but existing evidence comprises observational studies, and a small single center pilot randomized controlled trial, which evaluated a type of whole blood that is no longer in use. The aim of the "Trauma Resuscitation with Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood Or Products" (TROOP) trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of LTOWB and CT in critically injured patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.MethodsThis is a pragmatic, multicenter, Bayesian, sequential non-inferiority/superiority, randomized clinical trial, performed within 15 level I trauma centers in the United States. We aim to randomize 1,100 injured patients to resuscitation with either CT or LTOWB. The primary outcome is 6-h mortality. Secondary outcomes include 24-h and 30-day or hospital mortality (whichever is earlier); prespecified complications; adjudicated cause of death; time to death; length of stay (ICU and hospital); and hospital-, ventilator- and ICU-free days; the incidence of major surgical procedures; time to hemostasis in those undergoing procedures with a hemostatic component; number and type of blood products used until hemostasis is achieved (and randomized products are discontinued), as well as after hemostasis has been achieved, to 24 h post-admission; discharge destination and functional status and quality of life at hospital discharge or 30 days, as measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and EuroQol (EQ-5D) quality of life measurement.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.

TI  - Predictors of major complications after elective abdominal surgery in cancer patients
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Patients undergoing abdominal surgery for solid tumours frequently develop major postoperative complications, which negatively affect quality of life, costs of care and survival. Few studies have identified the determinants of perioperative complications in this group.
   Methods: We performed a prospective observational study including all patients (age > 18) undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer at a single institution between June 2011 and August 2013. Patients undergoing emergency surgery, palliative procedures, or participating in other studies were excluded. Primary outcome was a composite of 30-day all-cause mortality and infectious, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, renal and surgical complications. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors for major perioperative adverse events.
   Results: Of a total 308 included patients, 106 (34.4%) developed a major complication during the 30-day follow-up period. Independent predictors of postoperative major complications were: age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.012 per year), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status greater than or equal to 3 (OR 2.61 [95% CI 1.33-5.17], p = 0.003), a preoperative haemoglobin level lower than 12 g/dL (OR 2.13 [95% CI 1.21-4.07], p = 0.014), intraoperative use of colloids (OR 1.89, [95% CI 1.03-4.07], p = 0.047), total amount of intravenous fluids (OR 1.22 [95% CI 0.98-1.59], p = 0.106 per litre), intraoperative blood losses greater than 500 mL (2.07 [95% CI 1.00-4.31], p = 0.043), and hypotension needing vasopressor support (OR 4.68 [95% CI 1.55-27.72], p = 0.004). The model had good discrimination with the area under the ROC curve being 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.84, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a perioperative strategy aimed at reducing perioperative complications in cancer surgery should include treatment of preoperative anaemia and an optimal fluid strategy, avoiding fluid overload and intraoperative use of colloids.

TI  - Rinaldo's role in the medical emergency team and rapid response systems
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - In the 1990s, there was emerging evidence that patients admitted to hospitals frequently suffered inhospital cardiac arrest, unplanned admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and potentially preventable in-hospital death. These events were often preceded by objective signs of instability and suboptimal recognition and response by hospital ward staff. Rinaldo Bellomo collaborated with key Australian and international leaders to develop a novel and paradigm-shifting model of care referred to as the medical emergency team (MET). This team is comprised of senior staff members who are experts in the assessment and management of acutely deteriorating patients. In Australia and New Zealand, staff members from the ICU are frequently the team leaders for the MET. The team is called when a patient develops objective signs of clinical deterioration, prior to the onset of cardiac arrest. Rinaldo led, mentored, and supervised a systematic and structured research program that evaluated the nature and effectiveness of the MET at Austin Health and throughout Australia. This commenced with single-centre before-and-after studies and progressed to the first Australian ICU cluster-randomised controlled trial. His unique skillset was pivotal in the emergence and promulgation of this model of care worldwide resulting in countless lives saved from preventable morbidity and mortality.

TI  - A THEORETIC PERSPECTIVE ON POSTCODE STRESS EXPERIENCED BY CRITICAL CARE NURSES
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - Death and dying are among the factors that produce stress in critical care nurses.  Resuscitation attempts, often associated with dearth and dying in critical care areas, also predispose to stress.  However, a dearth of information exists in the literature concerning the psychologic impact of resuscitation on critical care nurses.  To promote scholarly thought and dialogue, role theory is applied as a framework to comprehend stress in relation to resuscitation attempts.  Information from published literature, the theoretic framework, and the authors' clinical experiences and observations are synthesized to provide suggested guidelines for postcode conferences to reduce critical care nurses' stress in the postresuscitation period.

TI  - Albumin versus balanced crystalloid for resuscitation in the treatment of sepsis: A protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study, "ABC-Sepsis"
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INTENSIVE CARE SOCIETY
AB  - BackgroundPatients presenting with suspected sepsis to secondary care often require fluid resuscitation to correct hypovolaemia and/or septic shock. Existing evidence signals, but does not demonstrate, a benefit for regimes including albumin over balanced crystalloid alone. However, interventions may be started too late, missing a critical resuscitation window.MethodsABC Sepsis is a currently recruiting randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing 5% human albumin solution (HAS) with balanced crystalloid for fluid resuscitation in patients with suspected sepsis. This multicentre trial is recruiting adult patients within 12 hours of presentation to secondary care with suspected community acquired sepsis, with a National Early Warning Score >= 5, who require intravenous fluid resuscitation. Participants are randomised to 5% HAS or balanced crystalloid as the sole resuscitation fluid for the first 6 hours.ObjectivesPrimary objectives are feasibility of recruitment to the study and 30-day mortality between groups. Secondary objectives include in-hospital and 90-day mortality, adherence to trial protocol, quality of life measurement and secondary care costs.DiscussionThis trial aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a trial to address the current uncertainty around optimal fluid resuscitation of patients with suspected sepsis. Understanding the feasibility of delivering a definitive study will be dependent on how the study team are able to negotiate clinician choice, Emergency Department pressures and participant acceptability, as well as whether any clinical signal of benefit is detected.

TI  - Effect of increased systemic oxygen delivery on postoperative outcomes and quality of life in elderly undergoing major abdominal surgery: A randomised controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERIOPERATIVE PRACTICE
AB  - Studies comparing the intentional increase in oxygen delivery and normal oxygen delivery during general anaesthesia in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery are limited and have reported contradictory findings. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of intraoperative increase in systemic oxygen delivery on postoperative outcomes and quality of life in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. This randomised, blinded, parallel-arm, pragmatic clinical trial included elderly patients of >60 years of age undergoing major abdominal surgery. The patients in the intervention arm received noradrenaline or increased fractional inspiration of oxygen to augment central venous oxygen saturation >= 75%. The primary outcome measure was composite of in-hospital mortality and major organ complications. The secondary outcome measure included comparison of quality of life. A total of 160 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 146 were randomised in the study groups. The mean arterial and central venous oxygen saturation increased and were significantly higher in the intervention arm. The composite primary outcome occurred in 49.31% in the intervention arm and 57.53% in the usual care arm (relative risk; 95% confidence interval: 0.85; 0.63-1.16; absolute risk reduction; 8.22%; p = 0.32). Furthermore, quality of life at the end of three months was similar (0.658 +/- 0.19 versus 0.647 +/- 0.19; p = 0.771). In conclusion, central venous oxygen saturation-guided increase in systemic oxygen delivery during the intraoperative period of major abdominal surgery in elderly patients did not reduce predefined composite outcome of in-hospital mortality or organ-specific complications.

TI  - Mobile phone-based systems for community-led injury response and coordination: a scoping review protocol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY PROTOCOLS
AB  - Traumatic injuries remain a leading cause of preventable death globally, and continue to burden global healthcare services, particularly in low-resource settings. Mobile phone-based community injury response and coordination (mCIRC) systems represent a promising solution in facilitating rapid identification of injured persons, and coordinating a community-led response as an alternative or adjunct to a formal emergency service. mCIRC systems may use technologies such as geolocation and push notifications to mobilize trained responders in the vicinity of the incident, ensuring timely intervention before professional medical services arrive. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of mCIRC systems in response to trauma as well as other medical emergencies, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We will evaluate their deployment in both high- and low-resource settings. In particular, the review will assess how these systems improve health outcomes of patients, such as reducing mortality and morbidity, and the feasibility and uptake of such systems by the global community. Additionally, the review will explore the operational challenges and facilitators of implementing such systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where healthcare infrastructure is often limited. This review will offer a comprehensive insight into the role of mobile technologies in improving trauma care at the community level, highlighting possible avenues for future research in this domain.

TI  - Case report: Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion after iatrogenic injury of the common iliac artery during neurosurgical dorsal lumbar microdiscectomy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction and importanceThis case report describes resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA) of the aorta in a patient with life-threatening iatrogenic bleeding of the right common iliac artery during elective dorsal lumbar spine surgery. REBOA is an emergency procedure for temporary intra-aortic balloon occlusion being increasingly reported and published since its inauguration in 1954. The interdisciplinary management of hemorrhage and technical notes for a successful REBOA procedure will be presented. Case presentationA 53-year-old female patient was admitted to the neurosurgery clinic suffering from left-sided L5 radiculopathy. During surgery, the anterior longitudinal ligament was perforated and an arterial vessel was lacerated. The patient became hemodynamically unstable demanding prompt supine repositioning and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). REBOA enabled cardiovascular stabilization after 90 min of CPR and laparotomy with vascular reconstruction and contributed to the survival of the patient without major clinical deficits. The patient was discharged from the ICU after 7 days. Clinical discussionResuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta is an emergency procedure to control life-threatening hemorrhage. REBOA should be available on-scene and applied by well-trained vascular surgery personnel to control vascular complications or extend to emergency laparotomy and thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping in case of in-hospital non-controllable hemorrhages. In case of ongoing CPR, we recommend surgical groin incision, open puncture of the pulseless common femoral artery, and aortic balloon inflation in REBOA zone I. Hereby, fast access and CPR optimization for heart and brain perfusion are maintained. ConclusionTraining for REBOA is the decisive factor to control selected cases of in-house and outpatient massive arterial abdominal bleeding complications.

TI  - A Combination of Three Repurposed Drugs Administered at Reperfusion as a Promising Therapy for Postischemic Brain Injury
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL STROKE RESEARCH
AB  - Cerebral ischemia leads to multifaceted injury to the brain. A polytherapeutic drug that can be administered immediately after reperfusion may increase protection to the brain by simultaneously targeting multiple deleterious cascades. This study evaluated efficacy of the combination of three clinically approved drugs: lamotrigine, minocycline, and lovastatin, using two mouse models: global and focal cerebral ischemia induced by transient occlusion of the common carotid arteries or the middle cerebral artery, respectively. In vitro, the combination drug, but not single drug, protected neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death. The combination drug simultaneously targeted cell apoptosis and DNA damage induced by ischemia. Besides acting on neurons, the combination drug suppressed inflammatory processes in microglia and brain endothelial cells induced by ischemia. In a transient global ischemia model, the combination drug, but not single drug, suppressed microglial activation and inflammatory cytokine production, and reduced neuronal damage. In a transient focal ischemia model, the combination drug, but not single drug, attenuated brain infarction, suppressed infiltration of peripheral neutrophils, and reduced neurological deficits following ischemic stroke. In summary, the combination drug confers a broad-spectrum protection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and could be a promising approach for early neuroprotection after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or ischemic stroke.

TI  - Outcome of comatose patients following cardiac arrest: When mRS completes CPC
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Good outcome in patients following cardiac arrest (CA) is usually defined as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2, while CPC 3 is debated, and CPC 4-5 represent poor outcome. We aimed to assess when the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) can improve CPC outcome description, especially in CPC 3. We further aimed to correlate neuron specific enolase (NSE) with both functional measures to explore their relationship with neuronal damage. Methods: Peak NSE within the first 48 hours, and CPC and mRS at 3 months were prospectively collected for 665 consecutive comatose adults following CA treated between April 2016 and April 2023. For each CPC category, mRS was described. We considered good outcome as mRS 1-3, in line with existing recommendations. CPC and mRS were correlated to peak serum NSE using non-parametric assessments. Results: CPC 1, 2, 4 and 5 correlated almost perfectly with mRS in terms of good and poor outcomes. However, CPC 3 was heterogeneously associated to the dichotomized mRS (53.1% had good outcome (mRS 0-3), 46.9% poor outcome (mRS 4-6)). NSE was strongly correlated with CPC (Spearman's rho 0.616, P < 0.001) and mRS (Spearman's rho 0.613, P < 0.001). Conclusion: CPC and mRS correlate similarly with neuronal damage. Whilst CPC 1-2 and CPC 4-5 are strongly associated with mRS 0-3 and, respectively, with mRS 5-6, CPC 3 is heterogenous: both good and poor mRS scores are found within this category. Therefore, we suggest that the mRS should be routinely assessed in patients with CPC 3 to refine outcome description.

TI  - EEG signal varies with different outcomes in comatose patients: A quantitative method of electroencephalography reactivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB  - Background: Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG-R) is a major predictor of outcome in comatose patients; however, the inter-rater reliability is limited due to the lack of homogeneous stimuli and quantitative interpretation.
   New Methods: EEG-R testing was employed in comatose patients by quantifiable electrical stimulation. Reactivity at different frequency bands was computed as the difference between pre- and post-stimulations in power spectra and connectivity function (including magnitude squared coherence and transfer entropy). The clinical outcomes were dichotomized as good and poor according to the recovery of consciousness. Signal discrimination of EEG-R was compared between the two groups.
   Results: A total of 18 patients (43%) regained consciousness at a 3-month follow-up. In the patients who regained consciousness, the EEG power increased significantly (P < 0.05) at the Alpha and Beta frequency bands after stimulation as compared to those with no behavioral awakening. Also, connectivity enhancement (including linear and nonlinear analysis) in the Beta and Gamma bands and connectivity decrease (nonlinear transfer entropy analysis) in the Delta band after stimulus were observed in the good outcome group.
   Comparison with Existing Method(s): In this study, the combined use of quantifiable stimulation and quantitative analysis shed new light on differentiating brain responses in comatose patients with good and poor outcomes as well as exploring the nature of EEG changes concerning the recovery of consciousness.
   Conclusions: The combination of quantifiable electrical stimulation and quantitative analysis with spectral power and connectivity for the EEG-R may be a promising method to predict the outcome of comatose patients.

TI  - Variation in Pediatric Palliative Care Allocation Among Critically Ill Children in the United States*
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES:
   The objectives are as follows: 1) estimate palliative care consult rates and trends among critically ill children and 2) characterize which children receive palliative care consults, including those meeting previously proposed ICU-specific palliative care screening criteria.
   DESIGN:
   Retrospective cohort.
   SETTING:
   Fifty-two United States children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems database.
   PATIENTS:
   Hospitalized children with nonneonatal ICU admissions from 2007 to 2018.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
   The primary outcome was palliative care consultation, as identified by the palliative care International Classification of Disease code. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between those with and without palliative care. We used a mixed-effects multivariable model to estimate the independent association between the palliative care and patient characteristics accounting for institution and subject clustering. Hospitalizations were categorized into three mutually exclusive groups for comparative analyses: 1) meeting ICU-specific palliative care criteria, 2) presence of a complex chronic condition not in ICU-specific palliative care criteria, or 3) not meeting ICU-specific palliative care or complex chronic condition criteria. Rates and trends of palliative care consultation were estimated including variation among institutions and variation among subcategories of ICU-specific palliative care criteria. The study cohort included 740,890 subjects with 1,024,666 hospitalizations. About 1.36% of hospitalizations had a palliative care consultation. Palliative care consult was independently associated with older age, female sex, government insurance, inhospital mortality, and ICU-specific palliative care or complex chronic condition criteria. Among the hospitalizations, 30% met ICU-specific palliative care criteria, 40% complex chronic condition criteria, and 30% neither. ICU-specific palliative care patients received more mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, had longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay, and had higher inhospital mortality (p < 0.001). Palliative care utilization increased over the study period with considerable variation between the institutions especially in the ICU-specific palliative care cohort and its subgroups.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Palliative care consultation for critically ill children in the United States is low. Palliative care utilization is increasing but considerable variation exists across institutions, suggesting inequity in palliative care allocation among this vulnerable population. Future studies should evaluate factors influencing allocation of palliative care among critically ill children in the United States and the drivers of differences between the institutional practices.

TI  - C-terminal provasopressin (copeptin) is a strong prognostic marker in patients with heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction: results from the OPTIMAAL study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the prognostic value of a novel and promising marker, copeptin, with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), on death or a composite cardiovascular endpoint in patients who developed heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   From a subset of 224 patients of the OPTIMAAL study, blood samples were drawn at a mean of 3 days after AMI when all patients had signs and/or symptoms of heart failure or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35. Endpoints of interest were mortality (primary endpoint of OPTIMAAL) and a composite cardiovascular endpoint, including death, MI, stroke, and/or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Mean age was 67 +/- 10 years, and mean follow-up was 33 +/- 7 months. Using univariable Cox proportional hazards survival analysis, higher levels of copeptin, BNP, and NT-proBNP were all significantly related to both mortality and the composite cardiovascular endpoint (all P < 0.01). In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, including all three biomarkers and other relevant covariates, a doubling of copeptin was related to a 1.83 (1.26-2.64) times increased risk of mortality (P < 0.0001) and a 1.35 (1.05-1.72) times increased risk of the composite cardiovascular endpoint (P = 0.018). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that copeptin [area under curve (AUC) 0.81] was a stronger predictor of mortality compared with both BNP (AUC 0.66; P = 0.0063 vs. copeptin) and NT-proBNP (AUC 0.67; P = 0.0016 vs. copeptin). Finally, changes of copeptin levels after 1 month significantly added prognostic information to the baseline value.
   Copeptin is a strong and novel marker for mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure after AMI. In this population, the predictive value of copeptin was even stronger than BNP and NT-proBNP.

TI  - Safety and Feasibility of Closed Chest Epicardial Catheter Ablation Using Electroporation
T2  - CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background-Permanent coronary artery damage is a hazardous complication of epicardial radiofrequency ablation. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising nonthermal ablation modality able to create deep myocardial lesions. We investigated the effects of epicardial IRE on luminal coronary artery diameter and lesion depth.
   Methods and Results-In 5 pigs (60-75 kg), the pericardium was exposed using surgical subxiphoidal epicardial access. A custom deflectable octopolar 12-mm circular catheter with 2-mm ring electrodes was introduced in the pericardium via a steerable sheath. After coronary angiography (CAG), the proximal, mid, and distal left anterior descending, and circumflex coronary arteries were targeted with a single, cathodal 200 J application. CAG was repeated after IRE and after 3 months follow-up. Using quantitative CAG, the minimal luminal diameter at the lesion site was compared with the average of the diameters just proximal and distal to that lesion. Intimal hyperplasia and lesion size were measured histologically. CAG directly postablation demonstrated short-lasting luminal narrowing with normalization in the targeted area, suggestive of coronary spasm. After 3 months, all CAGs were identical to preablation CAGs: mean reference luminal diameter was 2.2 +/- 0.3 mm, mean luminal diameter at the lesion site was 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm (P=0.35). Average intimal hyperplasia in all arteries was 2 +/- 4%. Median lesion depth was 6.4 +/- 2.6 mm.
   Conclusions-Luminal coronary artery diameter remained unaffected 3 months after epicardial IRE, purposely targeting the coronary arteries. IRE can create deep lesions and is a safe modality for catheter ablation on or near coronary arteries.

TI  - Sigmoid colon volvulus in children: review of 19 cases
T2  - PEDIATRIC SURGERY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The records of 19 patients with sigmoid colon volvulus (SCV) who were treated surgically in a 36.5-year-period were reviewed. Seven of them (37 %) had ileosigmoidal knotting (ISK). The age range was between 10 weeks and 17 years (mean 10 years), and 17 patients (90%) were male. In two cases (11%) there was previous SCV history. The mean symptom duration was 57 h (range 24-96), and three patients (16%) were in shock. The main symptoms were abdominal pain (90%), distention (79%), vomiting (74%), and obstipation (58%), and the main signs were abdominal tenderness (90%), distention (79%), absence of stool in the rectum and hypo- or akinetic bowel sounds (58%), muscular rigidity (53%), hyperkinetic bowel sounds (32%), and melanotic stool in the rectum (21%). The torsion was found in a clockwise direction in 47%, and the torsion degree was 360 in 42%. In four patients (21%) there was no gangrene (one with ISK), whereas in 15 (79%) sigmoid colon was gangrenous (six with ISK, in whom small bowel was also gangrenous). In nongangrenous cases, detorsion (11%) or sigmoidopexy (11%) was performed. In gangrenous cases, gangrenous sigmoid colon was resected, and Hartmann's procedure (74%) or primary anastomosis (5%) was performed. In those with associated gangrene of the small bowel, resection and enteroenteric anastomosis were done. Four patients (21%) died, with the most common cause of death being toxic shock. In 11 patients, including five with SCV and six with ISK, no recurrence was seen in a mean 18-year follow-up period (range 8-39). As a result, preoperative resuscitation, prompt surgery, and postoperative support are important in emergent SCV in children.

TI  - Acute Esophageal Necrosis (Gurvits Syndrome): A Rare Cause of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Somalia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CASE REPORTS JOURNAL
AB  - Acute esophageal necrosis, also known as Gurvits syndrome, is a rare condition due to ischemic compromise and thromboembolic injury to esophagus associated with high mortality. Endoscopically, it is characterized by the circumferential black discoloration of the esophagus. We present the case of a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple comorbidities, including uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoker, peripheral arterial disease, and a right above-ankle amputation, who presented with active hematemesis and melena with hemodynamic instability. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse, circumferential necrotizing esophagitis with black discoloration and ulcerations affecting the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. The severity increased from the proximal to the distal esophagus, abruptly ending at the gastroesophageal junction. These endoscopic findings, combined with the patient's medical history, were consistent with a diagnosis of acute esophageal necrosis. The patient was admitted to the ward and managed conservatively with intravenous fluid resuscitation, IV proton pump inhibitor twice daily, sucralfate 1 gram every six hours, strict glycemic control using insulin, total parenteral nutrition, empirical IV antibiotics, and placed on nil-peroral (NPO) for three days. A follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted twenty-two days post-admission showed complete healing of the esophageal mucosa without stricture formation. Despite its rarity, prompt diagnosis and management of acute esophageal necrosis are crucial due to its association with high morbidity and mortality, as well as the need to minimize complications such as perforations and strictures, particularly in patients with comorbidities. This case report aims to raise awareness among clinicians in Somalia of this condition as a differential diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding and to highlight the importance of timely intervention to prevent adverse outcomes.

TI  - The aftermath of surviving a sudden cardiac arrest for young exercisers-a qualitative study in Norway
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundWhen surviving a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving may be present for months or years. The survivors' family and colleagues are also highly affected by the incident. There is little knowledge about experiences of surviving SCA in individuals who prior to the incident were young and reported to exercise regularly. Consequently, the aim of this study was to explore the aftermath of surviving a SCA in young, regular exercisers. MethodsThe study had a qualitative design, conducting in-depth individual interviews with SCA survivors < 50 years of age reporting to exercise & GE; 5 h/week and/or who suffered SCA during or less than 60 min after exercise. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation in-line with recommendations from Malterud. Results18 of 31 eligible participants were included in the study. Through analysis we identified 'Establishing a new everyday life' as superordinate category, with subordinate categories a) being part of my surroundings, b) expecting normality but facing a new reality and c) lucky to be alive! ConclusionThis study adds knowledge about young and regular exercisers' experiences after surviving a SCA. The obligations of everyday life in young survivors of SCA often imply a high work load and complex tasks, e.g. due to being in the beginning of their career or even still studying. Healthcare personnel, as well as the society, need to acknowledge that although lucky to be alive and apparently well-functioning, young survivors of SCA may have persistent challenges that cause frustration and reduced quality of life.

TI  - Maternal Mental Health and Offspring Brain Development: An Umbrella Review of Prenatal Interventions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The idea that risk for psychiatric disorders may be transmitted intergenerationally via prenatal programming places interest in the prenatal period as a critical moment during which intervention efforts may have a strong impact, yet studies testing whether prenatal interventions also protect offspring are limited. The present umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) of randomized controlled trials aimed to synthesize the available evidence and highlight promising avenues for intervention. Overall, the literature provides mixed and limited evidence in support of prenatal interventions. Thirty SRMAs were included. Of the 23 SRMAs that reported on prenatal depression interventions, 16 found a significant effect (average standard mean difference =-0.45, SD = 0.25). Similarly, 13 of the 20 SRMAs that reported on anxiety outcomes documented significant reductions (average standard mean difference =-0.76, SD = 0.95 or-0.53/0.53 excluding one outlier). Only 4 SRMAs reported child outcomes, and only 2 (of 10) analyses showed significant effects of prenatal interventions (massage and telephone support on neonatal resuscitation [relative risk = 0.43] and neonatal intensive care unit admissions [relative risk = 0.91]). Notably missing, perhaps due to our strict inclusion criteria (inclusion of randomized controlled trials only), were interventions focusing on key facets of prenatal health (e.g., whole diet, sleep). Structural interventions (housing, access to health care, economic security) were not included, although initial success has been documented in non-SRMAs. Most notably, none of the SRMAs focused on offspring mental health or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Given the possibility that interventions deployed in this period will positively impact the next generation, randomized trials that focus on offspring outcomes are urgently needed.

TI  - Ruptured granulosa cell tumor of the ovary presenting with catastrophic intra-abdominal hemorrhage: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and importance: Adult granulosa cell tumor (GCT) is a rare stromal cell neoplasm that most often arises from the ovary. Presenting symptoms are related to external compression of adjacent structures (mass effect) or secretion of hormones such as estrogen. Patients most commonly present with irregular menstruation, postmenopausal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Prolonged estrogen exposure can contribute to endometrial adenocarcinoma development in untreated patients. The highly vascular nature of GCTs can lead to hemorrhagic rupture in rare cases.
   Presentation of case: We describe a case of adult GCT in a 44-year-old female with a history of irregular menstrual bleeding and anemia. The patient presented with shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated possible hemorrhagic ascites of unclear etiology and a pelvic mass. The patient was brought to the operating room in hemorrhagic shock for surgical exploration where she was found to have active bleeding of a ruptured ovarian tumor for which she underwent left salpingo-oophorectomy. Postoperative course was unremarkable, and pathology demonstrated ruptured GCT.
   Clinical discussion: Although rare, ovarian tumors can present with massive bleeding following rupture. Granulosa cell tumors are surreptitious as they grow slowly, and symptoms such as distention, abdominal pain, and irregular vaginal bleeding are nonspecific.
   Conclusion: CT findings demonstrating a pelvic mass in the setting of spontaneous intra-abdominal bleeding should raise clinical suspicion, particularly in patients with histories of menstrual abnormalities. Patients with suspected intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to any cause are best treated by prompt surgical exploration and aggressive resuscitation.

TI  - Tranexamic acid induced seizure during spine surgery: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and importance: The management of perioperative blood loss is a significant concern in spine surgery, directly affecting patient recovery and outcomes. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely used to minimize intraoperative bleeding and reduce the need for transfusions. Despite its benefits, TXA can pose risks, including rare but severe complications such as seizures. Understanding the balance between its hemostatic advantages and potential adverse effects is critical. This case discusses a 66-year-old female who experienced a generalized tonicclonic seizure after TXA administration during spine surgery. Presentation of case: A 66-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, depression, anxiety, and multiple spine surgeries presented with severe back and hip pain after a fall. She was found to have a fracture through her posterior fusion mass at L1-2. She underwent T10-L5 reinstrumentation, fusion, and L1-L2 laminectomy. She received a standard bolus of TXA and after being flipped supine developed a generalized tonicclonic seizure which was controlled with propofol and versed. She experienced a subsequent seizure and PEA while in the CT suite, followed by successful resuscitation. She was discharged uneventfully to rehab with neurology follow up. Clinical discussion: TXA is effective in reducing surgical blood loss but can cause seizures by crossing the cerebrovascular barrier and antagonizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). The incidence of TXA-induced seizures is rare, particularly in orthopedic surgery. Conclusion: Careful preoperative assessment and vigilant perioperative monitoring are essential when utilizing TXA in spine surgery. Increased awareness and prompt management of seizures can improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Evaluation of World Health Organization partograph implementation by midwives for maternity home birth in Medan, Indonesia
T2  - MIDWIFERY
AB  - Objective: to assess the effectiveness of promoting the use of the World Health Organization (WHO) partograph by midwives for tabour in a maternity home by comparing outcomes after birth.
   Setting: Medan city, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia.
   Participants: 20 midwives who regularly conducted births in maternity homes, randomly allocated into two equal groups.
   Design: cluster randomised-control trial.
   Intervention: under supervision from a team of obstetricians, midwives in the intervention group were introduced to the WHO partograph, trained in its use and instructed to use it in subsequent labours.
   Measurements and findings: there were 304 eligible women with vertex presentations among 358 labouring women in the intervention group and 322 among 363 in the control group. Among the intervention group, 304 (92.4%) partographs were correctly completed. From 71 women with the graph beyond the alert tine, 42 (65%) were referred to hospital. Introducing the partograph significantly increased referral rate, and reduced the number of vaginal examinations, oxytocin use and obstructed tabour. The proportions of caesarean sections and prolonged tabour were not significantly reduced. Apgar scores of less than 7 at 1 min was reduced significantly, whereas Apgar scores at 5 mins and requirement for neonatal resuscitation were not significantly different. Fetal death and early neonatal death rates were too tow to compare.
   Implications for practice: a training programme with follow-up supervision and monitoring may be of use when introducing the WHO partograph in other similar settings, and the findings of this study suggest that the appropriate time of referral needs more emphasis in continuing education.
   Conclusion: the WHO partograph should be promoted for use by midwives who care for labouring women in a maternity home. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incorrect blood typing and mis-transfusion due to low-titer group O whole blood resuscitation
T2  - TRANSFUSION
AB  - BackgroundResuscitation strategies for massive hemorrhage increasingly involve the use of low-titer group O whole blood (LTOWB) due to evidence suggesting improved patient outcomes. However, the potential risk of incorrect ABO typing following LTOWB administration, possibly leading to mis-transfusion, remains insufficiently explored. This case series aims to highlight the potential risk of ABO mistyping associated with LTOWB transfusions in trauma settings.Study Design and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed three cases involving trauma patients who received LTOWB transfusions at a high-volume urban Level 1 Trauma Center. ABO and RhD typing were performed using automated column agglutination technology (Ortho ID-MTS (TM)), and discordant typing results prompted further investigations to confirm patients' true ABO type and identify mis-transfusions.ResultsAll three patients initially received LTOWB due to traumatic hemorrhage. Initial ABO typing after LTOWB administration incorrectly identified the patients as group O. Follow-up investigations later confirmed their true blood types as group A. Two cases resulted in subsequent inadvertent transfusions of ABO-incompatible plasma. Although no severe adverse clinical outcomes occurred, these events were reported to regulatory bodies as biologic product deviations.DiscussionOur findings highlight a rare but clinically significant risk of ABO typing errors following LTOWB transfusion, primarily due to contamination of patient samples with donor blood. Such errors carry the potential for acute hemolytic reactions, underscoring the critical need for strict adherence to sampling protocols. Whenever possible, ABO typing should be performed prior to LTOWB administration, and samples should be drawn from a site contralateral to the transfusion.

TI  - Brain imaging in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: Pathophysiological correlates and prognostic properties
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the main cause of death and disability of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Early and reliable prognostication is challenging. Common prognostic tools include clinical neurological examination and electrophysiological measures. Brain imaging is well established for diagnosis of focal cerebral ischemia but has so far not found worldwide application in this patient group.
   Objective: To review the value of Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for early prediction of neurological outcome of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.
   Methods: A literature search was performed to identify publications on CT, MRI or PET in comatose patients after cardiac arrest.
   Results: We included evidence from 51 articles, 21 on CT, 27 on MRI, 1 on CT and MRI, and 2 on PET imaging. Studies varied regarding timing of measurements, choice of determinants, and cut-off values predicting poor outcome. Most studies were small (n = 6-398) and retrospective (60%). In general, cytotoxic oedema, defined by a grey-white matter ratio < 1.10, derived from CT, or MRI-diffusion weighted imaging < 650 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s in > 10% of the brain could differentiate between patients with favourable and unfavourable outcomes on a group level within 1-3 days after cardiac arrest. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI or diffusion tensor imaging show promising results, but need further evaluation.
   Conclusion: CT derived grey-white matter ratio and MRI based measures of diffusivity and connectivity hold promise to improve outcome prediction after cardiac arrest. Prospective validation studies in a multivariable approach are needed to determine the additional value for the individual patient.

TI  - Fournier's gangrene due to rectal cancer: A case report
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - Fournier's gangrene (FG) is an extremely rare necrotizing fasciitis that is insidious, rapidly spreading and life-threatening. FGs due to rectal cancer occur rarely and there is a lack of clinical reference. In the present study, a severe FG due to rectal cancer perforation was described and the features of this rare disease were summarized with a literature review. A 57-year-old man was admitted because of rectal cancer-induced FG. The patient was misdiagnosed with extensive perianal abscess until the intraoperative biopsy confirmed that rectal cancer was the culprit. Incision, debridement and drainage were carried out to reduce infectious burdens. After that, the patient was transferred to Peking University People's Hospital for the subsequent therapy. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was used at the initial stage. Diversional transverse loop colostomy was performed to control infection and resume oral feeding. After four rounds of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy, radical resection and wound closure were accomplished. The scrotal defect was repaired by a skin flap. Pathological results indicated a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with perforation. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 15 without any post-operative complications. No signs of recurrence were observed during a 22-month follow-up. In the setting of rectal cancer-induced FGs, the liquid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and prompt debridement are the cornerstones of the initial management. Diversional colostomy and VAC therapy were effective in the management of severe infection and large wounds. The present case report also provided a clinical reference for the implementation of staged surgeries and the perioperative multidisciplinary management of FGs.

TI  - Case report of a ventricular fibrillation storm with a cardiac conduction disorder and HCN4 variant 18 years after ablation of atrial flutter
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Genetic abnormalities causing various arrhythmias including atrial arrhythmias, specialized cardiac conduction disorders, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias have been reported. However, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose and treat patients with various arrhythmias. Case summary A 49-year-old woman who underwent ablation of typical atrial flutter (AFL) at 31 years of age visited the emergency room due to a cardiopulmonary arrest. Her 12-lead electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm after resuscitation exhibited first-degree atrioventricular block with right bundle branch block and right axis deviation. No structural heart disease was evident on standard imaging screening. An implantation of a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was indicated. After the ICD implantation, she then experienced multiple ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of triggered ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) was performed but failed because the clinical VPCs could not be induced during the session. Although no pathogenic variants associated with Brugada syndrome or long-QT syndrome were found, a rare HCN4 variant, c.1209+2_1209+3insGAGT (rs786205418), was identified in a gene panel analysis. Because high-frequency clinical pacing was effective for suppressing the VF, the single-chamber ICD was upgraded to a dual-chamber ICD. Thereafter, high-rate pacing successfully prevented any further ventricular arrhythmias during the follow up. Discussion A clinical course with prominent wide QRS complexes and AFL in one's early 30s followed by sudden onset of a VF storm about 20 years later is extremely rare. Her clinical phenotype expression was possibly associated with a rare HCN4 variant; however, further study is needed to confirm whether this variant was pathological or not.

TI  - Justifying video-assisted thoracic surgery for spontaneous hemopneumothorax
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Study objectives: Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has gained a prominent role in routine thoracic surgery practice. This study discusses the clinical aspects and utility of VATS in spontaneous hemopneumothorax (SHP).
   Patients: Of 363 spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) cases, 24 patients presented with SHP (6.6%). The clinical features, surgical indications, emergency VATS technique, and patient outcomes are discussed.
   Results: All 24 patients were male (mean age, 25.3 years). Eleven patients were in hypovolemic shock, and their hemoglobin levels ranged from 6.7 to 12.7 g/dL; therefore, they received fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion. The amount of blood drained through the chest tube varied from 200 to 3,500 mL. Emergency VATS revealed that 5 cases were simple hemothoraces and 19 cases were associated with pneumothorax. The cause of bleeding was identified by thoracoscopy, as from an aberrant vessel (n = 11), torn parietal pleura (n = 4), ruptured vascularized bullae (n = 2), and lung parenchyma (n = 1). Six patients had no evidence of an obvious bleeding site. Bullous lesions were at the apex of the upper lobe in 14 patients, and multiple lobar involvement was seen in 2 patients. All the bullae were resected with endoscopic stapler in eight patients and ligated with a homemade endoloop in eight patients. The mean operation time was 42 min. The mean chest tube removal time was 3.5 days after insertion, and mean postoperative stay was 4.5 days. There is no recurrence of SHP or SP during the follow-up period.
   Conclusion: SHP complicated by severe bleeding presents a potentially grave emergency. VATS may be considered as feasible treatment for patients with SHP.

TI  - Induced hypothermia in critical care medicine: A review
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Background. Clinical trials of induced hypothermia have suggested that this treatment may be beneficial in selected patients with neurologic injury.
   Objectives. To review the topic of induced hypothermia as a treatment of patients with neurologic and other disorders.
   Design. Review article.
   Interventions. None.
   Main Results. Improved outcome was demonstrated in two prospective, randomized, controlled trials in which induced hypothermia (33degreesC for 12-24 hrs) was used in patients with anoxic brain injury following resuscitation from prehospital cardiac arrest. In addition, prospective, randomized, controlled trials have been conducted in patients with severe head injury, with variable results. There also have been preliminary clinical studies of induced hypothermia in patients with severe stroke, newborn hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, neurologic infection, and hepatic encephalopathy, with promising results. Finally, animal models have suggested that hypothermia that is induced rapidly following traumatic cardiac arrest provides significant neurologic protection and improved survival.
   Conclusions. Induced hypothermia has a role in selected patients in the intensive care unit. Critical care physicians should be familiar with the physiologic effects, current indications, techniques, and complications of induced hyperthermia.

TI  - Treatment and Prognosis After Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review This review summarizes current and emerging treatments for hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). Guidance on neuroprognostication after HIBI is also presented. Recent findings After two 2002 studies demonstrated cooling improved neurologic outcome after HIBI, a 2013 trial found targeting 36 degrees C was non-inferior to targeting 33 degrees C. Research is ongoing, but there is no other definitive human data on therapies to prevent secondary brain injury after HIBI. Guideline-recommended treatment of HIBI includes early, optimal cardiopulmonary resuscitation to prevent primary brain injury, and targeted temperature management to mitigate secondary brain injury. Multiple novel treatment options, including anti-inflammatory agents, anesthetics, and neuroprotective cocktails, are currently being investigated. Additionally, neurostimulants may help promote wakefulness after HIBI. Neuroprognostication after HIBI requires a multimodal approach using the neurologic exam, electroencephalography, somatosensory evoked potentials, neuroimaging, and serum biomarkers. It is important to avoid premature prognostication and nihilism.

TI  - The dead and the dying - a difficult part of EMS transport: A Swiss cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objective
   Most deaths occur in the pre-hospital setting, whereas mortality in the emergency department (ED) is low (<1 %). However, our clinical impression is that some patients are being transported to hospital in devastating conditions with no likelihood of survival, but demanding extensive hospital resources. The decision on whether to transport a dying person to hospital or not is a difficult task for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. As there is little epidemiological data about these patients, this paper aims to describe this special population.
   Methods
   Retrospective cross-sectional study on adult patients transported by ground ambulance to the ED of a Swiss university hospital, who died during their stay in the ED between January 2008 and December 2012. Data was collected on the basis of ambulance report forms and discharge summaries of the ED.
   Results
   One hundred and sixty-one patients were analysed. Most deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases (43%). Only 9% of patients died of trauma. The median age was 70 years (IQR 56-81 years) and 70% (n = 112) were men. Trauma patients were significantly younger (median age 55 years, p<0.001). The overall mortality rate was 0.9% for all patients transported by EMS to the ED. About one third of all patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from bystanders (n = 53). The most common electrocardiogram (ECG) findings were asystole (n = 57) and pulseless electrical activity (n = 91). Fifty percent (n = 64) of the resuscitated patients were defibrillated. Three quarters (n = 115, 72%) of all patients were intubated on site. The mechanical chest compression device Lucas (TM) 2 was mainly used in cases of cardiovascular or uncertain cause of death and did not reduce the operating time on site.
   Conclusion
   The low ED mortality rate of 0.9% shows that only a few dying patients are transported to hospital. However, transport to hospital has to be carefully evaluated, especially for elderly patients with asystole or PEA due to medical conditions. The low CPR rate from bystanders demonstrates that public CPR training should be promoted further. The use of Lucas (TM) 2 did not reduce the operating time on site. For further investigations, comparison with survivors would be needed.

TI  - Postresuscitation tissue neutrophil infiltration is time-dependent and organ-specific
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background. Hemorrhagic shock with conventional resuscitation (CR) primes circulating neutrophils and activates vascular endothelium for increased systemic inflammation, superoxide release, and end-organ damage. Adjunctive direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) with intraperitoneal instillation of a clinical peritoneal dialysis solution decreases systemic inflammation and edema formation by enhancing tissue perfusion. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of adjunctive DPR on neutrophil and fluid sequestration.
   Methods. Anesthetized rats were hemorrhaged to 40% mean arterial pressure for 60 min. Animals were randomized for CR with the return of the shed blood plus two volumes of saline, or CR plus adjunctive DPR with 30 mL of intraperitoneal injection of a clinical peritoneal dialysis solution. Tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) level, a marker of neutrophil sequestration, and total water content were assessed in the gut, lung, and liver in sham animals and at time-points 1, 2, 4, and 24 h postresuscitation.
   Results. Resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock increases MPO level in all tissues in a near-linear fashion during the first 4 h following resuscitation. This occurs irrespective of the resuscitation regimen used. Tissue MPO level returned to baseline at 24 h following resuscitation except in the liver where CR and not adjunctive DPR caused a significant rebound increase. Adjunctive DPR prevented the CR-mediated obligatory fluid sequestration in the gut and lung and maintained a relative normal tissue water in these organs compared with CR alone (n = 7, F = 10.1, P < 0.01).
   Conclusion. Hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation produces time-dependent organ-specific trends of neutrophil sequestration as measured with tissue levels of myeloperoxidase, a marker of neutrophil infiltration. Modulation of the splanchnic blood flow by direct peritoneal resuscitation did not alter the time-dependent neutrophil infiltration in end-organs, suggesting a subordinate role of blood rheology in the hemorrhage-induced neutrophil sequestration. Vulnerable window for neutrophil-mediated tissue damage exists during the first 4 h following resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in rats. Direct peritoneal resuscitation prevents the early obligatory fluid sequestration and promotes early fluid mobilization. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of a nationwide public campaign on delays and outcome in Swiss patients with acute coronary syndrome
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PREVENTION & REHABILITATION
AB  - Background: To improve the outcome in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), public campaigns have been launched aimed at shortening presentation delays and allowing more efficient treatment. Their impact is uncertain.
   Methods: Pre-hospital delays and outcome in patients with ACS included in the Swiss National AMIS Plus registry were assessed prospectively before and after a nationwide multimedia campaign ('HELP') by the Swiss Heart Foundation in 2007. The campaign aimed at better awareness of symptoms, increasing knowledge in laymen of resuscitation and more rapid access to medical services. The primary study endpoint was the time between onset of symptoms and hospital admission. Secondary endpoints were successful out-of-hospital resuscitation, symptoms upon admission, and outcome.
   Results: Between January 2005 and December 2008, 8906 ACS patients (61% ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 39% non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction/unstable angina pectoris (NSTEMI/UAP), mean age 65 +/- 13 years, 75% males) admitted within 24 hours after onset of symptoms were enrolled. The median pre-hospital delay was reduced from 197 minutes during the pre-intervention period to 180 minutes during the post-intervention period (reduction 10% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6-14%); P < 0.001), in STEMI (reduction 10% (95% CI 5-14%); P < 0.001) and NSTEMI patients (reduction 11% (95% CI 4-17%); P = 0.001), due to pronounced effects in males (reduction 12% (95% CI 7-16%); P < 0.001) and in patients <= 75 years (reduction 12% (95% CI 8-16%); P < 0.001). Out-of-hospital resuscitation increased (odds ratio (OR) 1.26 (95% CI 1.06-1.54); P = 0.02). Overall outcome remained unchanged, however, the rate of re-infarction showed a decrease (OR 0.58 (95% CI 0.36-0.91); P = 0.021).
   Conclusions: After a nationwide educational campaign, shorter pre-hospital delays were observed, and more patients were able to be treated promptly. These results may be useful in planning future health strategies to improve management and outcome of patients with ACS, especially in female and elderly patients.

TI  - In-hospital left ventricular thrombus following ST-elevation myocardial infarction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: In-hospital left ventricular (LV) thrombus following acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has not been evaluated on a national scale and was the focus of this investigation.
   Methods: We used the 2003 to 2013 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to identify adults >= 18 years old with a principal diagnosis code of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Patients were divided into two groups defined by the presence or absence of LV thrombus. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were studied using relevant statistics. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were conducted to identify factors associated with LV thrombus.
   Results: Of 1,035,888 STEMI patients hospitalized in the U.S from 2003 to 2013, 1982 (0.2%) developed acute in-hospital LV thrombus. Compared to no LV thrombus, patients with LV thrombus were more likely to have in-hospital complications; acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, cardiogenic shock, in-hospital cardiac arrest and mortality. They also had longer mean length of stay and higher hospital charges. Factors associated with LV thrombus included: anterior/anterolateral STEMI, acute or chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, LV aneurysm, Left heart valvular disease, acute or chronic deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism and alcohol abuse. Patients with LV thrombus were less likely to be female [AOR 0.66, 95% CI (0.51-0.84)].
   Conclusion: The identification of factors associated with early development of LV thrombus following STEMI, will help direct resources for specific high-risk group and prompt cost-effective therapies. Gender variability in LV thrombus development warrants further investigations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Survival after multiple in-hospital cardiac arrests due to severe amitriptyline poisoning- a case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Amitriptyline, a classic tricyclic antidepressant, can produce toxic effects ranging from mild antimuscarinic symptoms to severe cardiotoxicity due to sodium channel blockade. In severe cases, toxicity may rapidly progress to cardiac arrest if not promptly recognized and managed. Case presentation We present a 25-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting 3.25 g of amitriptyline. He developed two episodes of cardiac arrest and recurrent life-threatening arrhythmias but was resuscitated and later discharged without neurological deficits. Management included aggressive supportive care, administration of sodium bicarbonate as the main antidotal therapy, and prolonged resuscitative efforts in the intensive care unit. Conclusion This case highlights that survival with good neurological outcome is possible even after multiple toxin-induced cardiac arrests when timely and persistent resuscitative measures are undertaken. It emphasizes the importance of early recognition of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity, prompt initiation of specific therapy, and preparedness for cardiac complications-particularly in low-resource settings. In addition, this report draws attention to the public health concern related to the accessibility and misuse of tricyclic antidepressants.

TI  - Vagal nerve stimulation in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury: from bench to bedside
T2  - BIOELECTRONIC MEDICINE
AB  - The identification of acute cardioprotective strategies against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury that can be applied in the catheterization room is currently an unmet clinical need and several interventions evaluated in the past at the pre-clinical level have failed in translation. Autonomic imbalance, sustained by an abnormal afferent signalling, is a key component of I/R injury. Accordingly, there is a strong rationale for neuromodulation strategies, aimed at reducing sympathetic activity and/or increasing vagal tone, in this setting. In this review we focus on cervical vagal nerve stimulation (cVNS) and on transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS); the latest has the potential to overcome several of the issues of invasive cVNS, including the possibility of being used in an acute setting, while retaining its beneficial effects. First, we discuss the pathophysiology of I/R injury, that is mostly a consequence of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Second, we describe the functional anatomy of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system and the most relevant principles of bioelectronic medicine applied to electrical vagal modulation, with a particular focus on taVNS. Then, we provide a detailed and comprehensive summary of the most relevant pre-clinical studies of invasive and non-invasive VNS that support its strong cardioprotective effect whenever there is an acute or chronic cardiac injury and specifically in the setting of myocardial I/R injury. The potential benefit in the emerging field of post cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is also mentioned. Indeed, electrical cVNS has a strong anti-adrenergic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic effect; most of the involved molecular pathways were already directly confirmed to take place at the cardiac level for taVNS. Pre-clinical data clearly show that the sooner VNS is applied, the better the outcome, with the possibility of a marked infarct size reduction and almost complete left ventricular reverse remodelling when VNS is applied immediately before and during reperfusion. Finally, we describe in detail the limited but very promising clinical experience of taVNS in I/R injury available so far.

TI  - Levetiracetam Versus Fosphenytoin Infusions as Second-Line Treatment for Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Multicenter Study Examining Effectiveness, Tolerability, and Ease of Use
T2  - PEDIATRIC DRUGS
AB  - Background and ObjectivesStatus epilepticus is a life-threatening neurological emergency that requires rapid and effective treatment to prevent long-term complications or death. Traditionally, phenytoin and its prodrug fosphenytoin have been used as second-line therapies following benzodiazepines. However, intravenous levetiracetam has emerged as a promising alternative because of its favorable safety profile and ease of administration, particularly in pediatric populations. This study aimed to evaluate whether intravenous levetiracetam was non-inferior to intravenous fosphenytoin as a second-line treatment for managing pediatric status epilepticus.MethodsFrom November 2021 to May 2023, we implemented an updated local protocol that replaced fosphenytoin with levetiracetam as the second-line treatment for status epilepticus. Following this change, we conducted a 2-year multicenter study to evaluate its impact. For comparison, we also included patients treated under the previous protocol during the 2 years prior to the change, as a control group. An inverse probability of treatment weighting approach, based on the propensity score, was used to adjust for baseline characteristics between the two groups. Bayesian regression models were used to assess treatment effects in the weighted cohort. Treatment effectiveness was assessed using a composite measure of need for subsequent interventions, recurrence of status epilepticus within 24 h, seizure duration and length of hospital stay. We tested non-inferiority hypotheses for effectiveness criteria and if the probability of non-inferiority was greater than 95%, we also tested a superiority hypothesis. Safety was assessed by analyzing adverse events, mortality, admission to the intensive care unit, and transfer to the resuscitation unit. For safety criteria, only superiority was tested.ResultsIn total, 127 patients with status epilepticus were evaluated during the study period; 84 patients in the fosphenytoin group (66%) and 43 patients in the levetiracetam group (34%). Of these, 52 patients had febrile status epilepticus (40.9%), 27 patients were treated with oral levetiracetam as part of their daily treatment regimen at the time of status epilepticus (21.3%), and 12 (9.4%) patients had been treated with levetiracetam during their lifetime but stopped at the time of status epilepticus. With intravenous levetiracetam, 62.8% of children were seizure free, compared with 37.2% of children taking fosphenytoin. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter with levetiracetam than with fosphenytoin (reduction of 1.9 days with levetiracetam) and children were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (reduction of 18.1% with levetiracetam). The need for third-line treatment or seizure recurrence was significantly lower in the levetiracetam group (16.3% reduction compared with fosphenytoin). Adverse effects and seizure duration were not significantly different between the two groups.ConclusionsUsing a composite outcome measure, we demonstrated that levetiracetam was not inferior to fosphenytoin with respect to seizure recurrence, the need for third-line therapy, intensive care unit admission, and the total length of hospital stays.

TI  - SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID ALLEVIATES ACUTE LUNG INJURY INDUCED BY SEVERE HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK AND RESUSCITATION IN RATS
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Background: This study aimed to assess the severity of acute lung injury after mild or severe hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, and to examine the therapeutic effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on lung injury. Methods: Mild and severe hemorrhagic shock were induced by total blood volume loss of 20% or 40%, respectively, which was maintained for 60 min. Then, resuscitation was performed by autologous blood and SAHA or a vehicle solution accordingly. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and arterial blood gas were measured during the experiment. Histological assays, wet/dry weight ratio, inflammatory cytokines, and the extent of histone acetylation were evaluated at 3 h post-resuscitation. Results: There were no significant differences of the most indicators measured between the mild hemorrhagic shock and Sham groups. Although in severe hemorrhagic shock group, mean arterial pressure was markedly reduced, lactic acid was significantly increased after hemorrhage. Moreover, the lung injury score was increased, the wet/dry weight ratio was elevated, inflammatory factor expression levels were upregulated, the expression of phosphorylated NF-kappa B/p65 was enhanced, and the extent of histone acetylation was decreased at 3 h post-resuscitation. Remarkably, adjuvant treatment with SAHA decreased the lactic acid, the pathological injury score, the wet/dry weight ratio, the content of inflammatory factor, as well as the level of activated NF-kappa B/p65, but promoted the expression of acetylated H4. Conclusions: Total blood volume loss of 40% results in acute lung injury, whereas loss of 20% does not. Treatment with SAHA alleviates lung injury induced by severe hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation and the underlying mechanism involves a reversal of decreased histone acetylation and inhibition of the NF-kappa B pathway.

TI  - Provision of Spiritual Support to Patients With Advanced Cancer by Religious Communities and Associations With Medical Care at the End of Life
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Importance: Previous studies report associations between medical utilization at the end-of-life (EoL) and religious coping and spiritual support from the medical team. However, the influence of clergy and religious communities on EoL outcomes is unclear.
   Objective: To determine whether spiritual support from religious communities influences terminally ill patients' medical care and quality of life (QoL) near death.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: A US-based, multisite cohort study of 343 patients with advanced cancer enrolled from September 2002 through August 2008 and followed up (median duration, 116 days) until death. Baseline interviews assessed support of patients' spiritual needs by religious communities. End-of-life medical care in the final week included the following: hospice, aggressive EoL measures (care in an intensive care unit [ICU], resuscitation, or ventilation), and ICU death.
   Main Outcomes and Measures: End-of-life QoL was assessed by caregiver ratings of patient QoL in the last week of life. Multivariable regression analyses were performed on EoL care outcomes in relation to religious community spiritual support, controlling for confounding variables, and were repeated among high religious coping and racial/ethnic minority patients.
   Results: Patients reporting high spiritual support from religious communities (43%) were less likely to receive hospice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20-0.70 [P=.002]), more likely to receive aggressive EoL measures (AOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.14-6.06 [P=.02]), and more likely to die in an ICU (AOR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.71-15.60 [P=.004]). Risks of receiving aggressive EoL interventions and ICU deaths were greater among high religious coping (AOR, 11.02; 95% CI, 2.83-42.89 [P<.001]; and AOR, 22.02; 95% CI, 3.24-149.58 [P=.002]; respectively) and racial/ethnic minority patients (AOR, 8.03; 95% CI, 2.04-31.55 [P=.003]; and AOR, 11.21; 95% CI, 2.29-54.88 [P=.003]; respectively). Among patients well-supported by religious communities, receiving spiritual support from the medical team was associated with higher rates of hospice use (AOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.03-5.44 [P=.04]), fewer aggressive interventions (AOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.79 [P=.02]) and fewer ICU deaths (AOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.80 [P=.02]); and EoL discussions were associated with fewer aggressive interventions (AOR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63 [P=.01]).
   Conclusions and Relevance: Terminally ill patients who are well supported by religious communities access hospice care less and aggressive medical interventions more near death. Spiritual care and EoL discussions by the medical team may reduce aggressive treatment, highlighting spiritual care as a key component of EoL medical care guidelines.

TI  - Effectiveness of intraosseous access during resuscitation: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose During resuscitation in emergency situations, establishing intravascular access is crucial for promptly initiating delivery of fluids, blood, blood products, and medications. In cases of emergency, when intravenous (IV) access proves unsuccessful, intraosseous (IO) access serves as a viable alternative. However, there is a notable lack of information concerning the frequency and efficacy of IO access in acute care settings. This study aims to assess the efficacy of intraosseous (IO) access in acute care settings, especially focusing on children in a level 1 trauma center. Methods This retrospective study included patients with IO access presented in a level 1 trauma center emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and April 2020. Data regarding medication and fluid infusion was documented, and the clinical success rate was calculated. Results Of the 109,548 patients that were admitted to the ED, 25,686 IV lines were inserted. Documentation of 188 patients of which 73 (38.8%) children was complete and used for analysis. In these 188 patients, a total of 232 IO accesses were placed. Overall, 182 patients had a functional IO access (204 needles) (88%). In children (age < 18 years) success rate was lower as compared to adults, 71-84% as compared to 94%. However, univariate regression showed no association between the percentage of functional IO access and gender, age, weight, health care location (prehospital and in hospital), anatomical position (tibia as compared to humerus) or type of injury. Conclusion Intraosseous access demonstrates a high success rate for infusion, independent of gender, age, weight, anatomical positioning, or healthcare setting, with minimal complication rates. Caution is especially warranted for children under the age of six months, since success rate was lower.

TI  - The effect of Glibenclamide on somatosensory evoked potentials after cardiac arrest in rats
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Science continues to search for a neuroprotective drug therapy to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest (CA). The use of glibenclamide (GBC) has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its effects on neuroprognostication tools are not well understood. We aimed to investigate the effect of GBC on somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) waveform recovery post CA and how this relates to the early prediction of functional outcome, with close attention to arousal and somatosensory recovery, in a rodent model of CA. Methods Sixteen male Wistar rats were subjected to 8-min asphyxia CA and assigned to GBC treatment (n = 8) or control (n = 8) groups. GBC was administered as a loading dose of 10 mu g/kg intraperitoneally 10 min after the return of spontaneous circulation, followed by a maintenance dosage of 1.6 mu g/kg every 8 h for 24 h. SSEPs were recorded from baseline until 150 min following CA. Coma recovery, arousal, and brainstem function, measured by subsets of the neurological deficit score (NDS), were compared between both groups. SSEP N10 amplitudes were compared between the two groups at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post CA. Results Rats treated with GBC had higher sub-NDS scores post CA, with improved arousal and brainstem function recovery (P = 0.007). Both groups showed a gradual improvement of SSEP N10 amplitude over time, from 30 to 120 min post CA. Rats treated with GBC showed significantly better SSEP recovery at every time point (P < 0.001 for 30, 60, and 90 min; P = 0.003 for 120 min). In the GBC group, the N10 amplitude recovered to baseline by 120 min post CA. Quantified Cresyl violet staining revealed a significantly greater percentage of damage in the control group compared with the GBC treatment group (P = 0.004). Conclusions Glibenclamide improves coma recovery, arousal, and brainstem function after CA with decreased number of ischemic neurons in a rat model. GBC improves SSEP recovery post CA, with N10 amplitude reaching the baseline value by 120 min, suggesting early electrophysiologic recovery with this treatment. This medication warrants further exploration as a potential drug therapy to improve functional outcomes in patients after CA.

TI  - Interventionall catheterization after the Norwood procedure
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - Introduction and objectives. To carry out a retrospective analysis of the indications for, and the results and complications of interventional catheterization after the Norwood procedure.
   Methods. Between February 1993 and December 2006, 25 interventional catheterizations were performed in 14 patients who had undergone the Norwood procedure, prior to the Glenn or Fontan procedure.
   Results. Nine angioplasties were carried out for recoarctation in seven of the 14 patients (2 patients developed restenosis after their first angioplasty). Detachment of the left pulmonary artery occurred either immediately or during follow-up in 3 patients who underwent the classical Norwood procedure. Overall, 10 pulmonary artery angioplasties were required in 7 patients. Three patients needed embolization: one of venous collaterals (using coils), one of the left superior vena cava (using an Amplatzer duct occluder), and one of a left Blalock-Taussig shunt (using an Amplatzer duct occluder). Two patients required a cavopulmonary (Glenn) anastomosis, and another underwent fibrinolysis for thrombosis of the superior vena cava and pulmonary artery. Other findings, which were not treated percutaneously, included: stenosis of the supra-aortic trunk (n=6), femoral artery stenosis (n=2), femoral vein thrombosis (n=5), and subclavian vein thrombosis (n=1). The following complications were recorded: arterial ischemia (n=2), cardiac arrest or bradycardia (n=4), and transient atrioventricular block (n=1).
   Conclusions. Following stage I of the Norwood procedure, the angiographic and hemodynamic assessments needed for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary artery or aortic arch stenosis must be carried out promptly. Although treating recoarctation by angioplasty can be effective, restenosis frequently occurs. With the Sano procedure, detachment of the left pulmonary artery, but not pulmonary artery stenosis, can be avoided. After stage II, the presence of venovenous collaterals must be ruled out, because they frequently require embolization. In these patients, interventional catheterization is associated with a higher incidence of complications than in other groups.

TI  - Prognostic role of global longitudinal strain by feature tracking in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The STRAIN-HCM study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The assessment of myocardial fiber deformation with cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) has shown to be promising in terms of prognostic information in several structural heart diseases. However, little is known about its role in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Aims of the present study were: 1) to assess the prognostic role of CMR-FT derived strain parameters in patients with HCM.
   Methods: CMR was performed in 130 consecutive HCM patients (93 males, mean age (54 +/- 17 years) with an estimated 5-year risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) <6% according to the HCM Risk-SCD calculator. 2D- and 3D-Global Radial (GRS), Longitudinal (GLS) and Circumferential (GCS) Strain was evaluated by FT analysis. The primary outcome of the study was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including SCD, resuscitated cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT), and hospitalization for heart failure.
   Results: After a median follow-up of 51.7 (37.1-68.8) months, 4 (3%) patients died (all of them suffered from SCD) and 36 (28%) were hospitalized for heart failure. After multivariable adjustment for clinical and imaging covariates, among all strain parameters, only GLS remained a significant independent predictor of outcome events in both the model including 2D strain (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23, p = 0.01) and the model including 3D strain (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.30, p = 0.04). The addition of 2D-GLS into the model with clinical and imaging predictors resulted in a significant increase in the C-statistic (from 0.48 to 0.65, p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: CMR-FT derived GLS is a powerful independent predictor of MACE in patients with HCM, incremental to common clinical and CMR risk factors including left ventricular ejection fraction and late gadolinium enhancement.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Ventricular Arrhythmias in Patients with Nonischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy by Strain Echocardiography
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
AB  - Background: Indications for prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are based on left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), although LVEF has limited ability to predict arrhythmias. It has recently been shown that strain echocardiography can predict ventricular arrhythmias in patients after myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether strain echocardiography may help in the risk stratification of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DCM.
   Methods: Ninety-four patients with nonischemic DCM were prospectively included. By speckle-tracking strain echocardiography, global longitudinal strain was calculated as the average of peak longitudinal strain from a 16-segment LV model. The time interval from electrocardiographic peak R to peak negative strain was assessed in each LV segment. Mechanical dispersion was defined as the standard deviation of time to peak negative strain from 16 LV segments.
   Results: After a median of 22 months of follow-up (range, 1-46 months), 12 patients (13%) had experienced arrhythmic events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest. LVEF and global longitudinal strain were reduced in patients with DCM with arrhythmic events compared with those without (28 +/- 10% vs 38 +/- 13%, P = .01, and 6.4 +/- 3.3% vs 12.3 +/- 5.2%, P < .001, respectively). Global longitudinal strain showed greater area under the curve than LVEF to identify arrhythmic events in receiver operating characteristic curve analyses (P = .05). Patients with arrhythmic events had increased mechanical dispersion (98643 vs 56618 ms, P < .001). Mechanical dispersion predicted arrhythmias independently of LVEF (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.49; P = .001).
   Conclusions: Global longitudinal strain is a promising marker of arrhythmias. Mechanical dispersion predicted arrhythmic events in patients with DCM independently of LVEF. Strain echocardiography may help in the risk stratification of patients with DCM not fulfilling current implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2012;25:667-73.)

TI  - Cardioprotection with sildenafil: Implications for clinical practice
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in a wide spectrum of patients, ranging from survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to acute myocardial infarction victims as well as patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and represents a major public health burden: This injury contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality, despite meticulous adherence to presently known principles of myocardial protection. Despite the considerable progress that has been made in the field of myocardial protection, high-risk subsets of patients continue to exhibit ischemia-reperfusion-related complications, including prolonged contractile dysfunction (stunning), low-output syndrome, perioperative myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure, requiring prolonged intensive care. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, currently licensed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension has shown great promise in animal studies as a possible pharmacologic agent for cardioprotection. This review article discusses the pharmacology of sildenafil and focuses on the available evidence from animal studies on the potential role of sildenafil for treating ischemia-reperfusion injury with its implications for clinical practice.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and Arrhythmias A Meta-Analysis of 38 Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - JACC-ADVANCES
AB  - BACKGROUND Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown promising results in reducing hospitalizations from heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular mortality. However, their effect on arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) is not well established. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to evaluate the association between SGLT2i and the risk of arrhythmias and SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, HF, or chronic kidney disease. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus for relevant randomized controlled trials from inception until February 10, 2023. ORs and 95% CIs were pooled using a random effect model. RESULTS A total of 38 randomized controlled trials with 88,704 patients (48,435 in the SGLT2i group and 40,269 in the control group) were included in the study. The mean age of patients among SGLT2i and control groups was 56.8 and 56.7 years, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 1.6 years. Pooled analysis of primary and secondary outcomes showed that SGLT2i significantly reduced the risk of incident atrial arrhythmia (OR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75-0.98], P = 0.02), SCD (OR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.55-0.94], P = 0.02) compared with placebo. However, the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.84-1.26], P = 0.77) and cardiac arrest (OR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.72-1.23] P = 0.67) was comparable between both groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS SGLT2i therapy was associated with an overall lower risk of atrial arrythmia and SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or HF or chronic kidney disease. However, SGLT2i therapy was not associated with a lower risk of ventricular arrhythmia. (JACC Adv. 2025;4:101615) (c) 2025 The Authors.

TI  - Revisiting the promise, practice and progress of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   The use of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) to temporarily control bleeding and improve central perfusion in critically injured trauma patients remains a controversial topic. In the last decade, select trauma services around the world have gained experience with REBOA. We discuss the recent observational data together with the initial results of the first randomized control trial and provide a view on the next steps for REBOA in trauma resuscitation.
   Recent findings
   While the observational data continue to be conflicting, the first randomized control trial signals that in the UK, in-hospital REBOA is associated with harm. Likely a result of delays to haemorrhage control, views are again split on whether to abandon complex interventions in bleeding trauma patients and to only prioritize transfer to the operating room or to push REBOA earlier into the post injury phase, recognizing that some patients will not survive without intervention.
   Summary
   Better understanding of cardiac shock physiology provides a new lens in which to evaluate REBOA through. Patient selection remains a huge challenge. Invasive blood pressure monitoring, combined with machine learning aided decision support may assist clinicians and their patients in the future. The use of REBOA should not delay definitive haemorrhage control in those patients without impending cardiac arrest.

TI  - Quantitative measures of EEG for prediction of outcome in cardiac arrest subjects treated with hypothermia: a literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Early and accurate prediction of CA outcomecan help clinicians and families to make a better-informed decision for the patient's healthcare. Studies have shown that electroencephalography (EEG) may assist in early prognosis of CA outcome. However, visual EEG interpretation is subjective, labor-intensive, and requires interpretation by a medical expert, i.e., neurophysiologists. These limiting factors may hinder the applicability of such testing as the prognostic method in clinical settings. Automatic EEG pattern recognition using quantitative measures can make the EEG analysis more objective and less time consuming. It also allows to detect and display hidden patterns that may be useful for the prognosis over longer time periods of monitoring. Given these potential benefits, there have been an increasing interest over the last few years in the development and employment of EEG quantitative measures to predict CA outcome. This paper extensively reviews the definition and efficacy of various measures that have been employed for the prediction of outcome in CA subjects undergoing hypothermia (a neuroprotection method that has become a standard of care to improve the functional recovery of CA patients after resuscitation). The review details the State-of-the-Art and provides some perspectives on what seems to be promising for the early and accurate prognostication of CA outcome using the quantitative measures of EEG.

TI  - Permissive hypotension versus conventional resuscitation strategies in adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Aggressive fluid resuscitation in trauma promotes deleterious effects such as clot disruption, dilutional coagulopathy and hypothermia. Animal studies suggest that permissive hypotension maintains appropriate organ perfusion, reduces bleeding and improves mortality. This review assesses the efficacy and safety of permissive hypotension in adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock.
   METHODS We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to May 2017 for randomized controlled trials comparing permissive hypotension vs. conventional resuscitation following traumatic injury. We included preoperative and intraoperative resuscitation strategies. The primary outcome was 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization, estimated blood loss and in-hospital complications. Pooling was performed with a random-effects model.
   RESULTS We screened 722 abstracts, from which five randomized trials evaluating 1,158 patients were included. Blood pressure targets in the intervention arms varied from systolic BP 50 mm Hg to 70 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg or higher as compared to systolic BP 65 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure of 65 or higher in the control arms. Two studies evaluated only patients with penetrating injury while the remaining three additionally included blunt injuries. Four trials suggested a survival benefit for 30-day or in-hospital mortality with hypotensive resuscitation, although three studies were insufficiently powered to find statistical significance. Studies were of poor to moderate quality due to poor protocol reporting and lack of blinding. The pooled odds ratio was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.92), suggesting a survival benefit for permissive hypotension. Those patients received fewer blood products and had lesser estimated blood loss.
   CONCLUSION Permissive hypotension may offer a survival benefit over conventional resuscitation for patients with hemorrhagic injury. It may additionally reduce blood loss and blood product utilization. However, the majority of studies were underpowered, thus reflecting a need for high quality, adequately powered trials.

TI  - Hypertonic/hyperoncotic saline attenuates microcirculatory disturbances after traumatic brain injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 14th Bodensee Symposium on Microcirculation: Small Volume Resuscitation in Head Injury
AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces an acute inflammatory response characterized by early recruitment of inflammatory cells (white blood cells). Rapid resuscitation of TBI with hypertonic saline/dextran (HS/DEX) yields promising results in clinical and experimental studies. The purpose of this paper was to test the hypothesis that HS/DEX exerts its effects in part through a modulation of the acute inflammatory response to TBI.
   Methods: Rabbits equipped with chronic cranial windows underwent fluid-percussion injury and were followed up for 6 hours. Intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy technique was used to visualize white blood cell trafficking and to measure pia vessel diameters and venular shear rates. Three groups were studied: sham (group I, n = 5), trauma (group II, n = 7), and trauma and 4 mL/kg 7.2% NaCl/10% dextran 60 IV over 5 minutes at 10 minutes after TBI (group III, n = 7).
   Results: TBI in groups TI and III led to significant increases of intracranial pressure. Arteriolar diameters after trauma increased by 17 +/- 8% at 6 hours in group LT. Infusion of HS/DEX completely prevented this secondary diameter increase. At 6 hours, the increase of ''sticking'' white blood cells in group III was reduced by approximately 90% compared with group II.
   Conclusion: Whether the anti-inflammatory effect of HS/DEX plays a role in reducing delayed brain damage (> 6 hours after TBI) or other systemic complications of TBI arises as an important question and should be investigated further.

TI  - Hypothermia for neuroprotection in adults after cardiac arrest
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Good neurological outcome a(er cardiac arrest is difficult to achieve. Interventions during the resuscitation phase and treatment within the first hours a(er the event are critical for a favourable prognosis. Experimental evidence suggests that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial, and several clinical studies on this topic have been published. This review was originally published in 2009; updated versions were published in 2012 and 2016.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the benefits and harms of therapeutic hypothermia a(er cardiac arrest in adults compared to standard treatment.
   Search methods
   We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 30 September 2022.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults comparing therapeutic hypothermia a(er cardiac arrest with standard treatment (control). We included studies with adults cooled by any method, applied within six hours of cardiac arrest, to target body temperatures of 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C. Good neurological outcome was defined as no or only minor brain damage allowing people to live an independent life.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. neurological recovery. Our secondary outcomes were 2. survival to hospital discharge, 3. quality of life, 4. cost-effectiveness and 5. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty.
   Main results
   We found 12 studies with 3956 participants reporting the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on neurological outcome or survival. There were some concerns about the quality of all the studies, and two studies had high risk of bias overall. When we compared conventional cooling methods versus any type of standard treatment (including a body temperature of 36 degrees C), we found that participants in the therapeutic hypothermia group were more likely to reach a favourable neurological outcome (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.76; 11 studies, 3914 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low.
   When we compared therapeutic hypothermia with fever prevention or no cooling, we found that participants in the therapeutic hypothermia group were more likely to reach a favourable neurological outcome (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 8 studies, 2870 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low.
   When we compared therapeutic hypothermia methods with temperature management at 36 degrees C, there was no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.53; 3 studies; 1044 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low.
   Across all studies, the incidence of pneumonia, hypokalaemia and severe arrhythmia was increased amongst participants receiving therapeutic hypothermia (pneumonia: RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.18; 4 trials, 3634 participants; hypokalaemia: RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.84; 2 trials, 975 participants; severe arrhythmia: RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.64; 3 trials, 2163 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low (pneumonia, severe arrhythmia) to very low (hypokalaemia). There were no differences in other reported adverse events between groups.
   Authors' conclusions
   Current evidence suggests that conventional cooling methods to induce therapeutic hypothermia may improve neurological outcomes a(er cardiac arrest. We obtained available evidence from studies in which the target temperature was 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C.

TI  - Awareness of guidelines for use of automated external defibrillators in children within emergency medical services
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Ventricular fibrillation occurs in 10-20% of pediatric cardiac arrests. Survival rates in children with ventricular fibrillation can be as high as 30% when the rhythm is identified and treated promptly. In the last 5 years, recommendations have been made for the use of automated external defibrillators in children between 1 and 8 years of age.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the awareness of the ILCOR guidelines and statewide protocols concerning AED use in children ages 1-8 among emergency medical. providers after new guideline release. Availability of pediatric capable AED equipment was also assessed.
   Methods: Surveys were distributed to EMS providers in Iowa and Montana within 1 year of the ILCOR advisory statement in 2003 recommending use of AEDs in children ages 1-8, and again approximately 1 year after the 2005 ILCOR guidelines on cardiopulmonary resuscitation were published. In Iowa, there were concentrated efforts to disseminate information about AED use in children, white there were minimal efforts in Montana.
   Results: Awareness of ILCOR guidelines for use of AEDs in children was low in both states in 2003 (29% in Iowa vs. 9% in Montana, p<0.001). After release of the 2005 guidelines, awareness improved significantly in both states but was still significantly greater in Iowa (83% vs. 60%, p<0.002). In 2003, less than 20% of respondents in both states reported access to pediatric capable AEDs. Availability of pediatric pads and cables increased significantly in 2006 but remained tow in Montana (74% in Iowa vs. 37% in Montana, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: At the present time, publication of new or interim guidelines in the scientific literature alone is insufficient to ensure that new protocols are implemented. An effective and efficient method to disseminate new pediatric out-of-hospital protocols emergency care to become standard of care in a timely matter must be developed.

TI  - The year in review: advances in interventional cardiology in 2019
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review Major studies in interventional cardiology in 2019 have added substantial new evidence for pharmaco-invasive management of coronary artery disease. The review highlights the main findings of a selection of these trials and summarizes their impact on clinical practice. Recent findings Recent randomized studies examining the efficacy of revascularization or medical treatment in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), treatment of acute coronary syndromes, emerging interventional devices, adjunctive pharmacotherapy, and intravascular imaging and physiology guidance have substantially advanced the evidenced-based knowledge in interventional cardiology. Patients with SIHD and at least moderate myocardial ischemia have similar event-free survival after an initial conservative strategy of optimal medical therapy versus an upfront invasive strategy. Quality of life and angina-free status are significantly improved with revascularization. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting provide similar 5-year outcomes in patients with left main coronary artery disease and low or intermediate disease complexity. An initially conservative management is equally effective as an early invasive approach in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ongoing ischemia. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease benefit from staged complete revascularization after primary PCI. Post-PCI, patients with atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation can safely and effectively be treated with P2Y(12)inhibitor monotherapy without aspirin. Lastly, intravascular imaging guidance improves post-PCI outcomes, warranting increased use in clinical practice.

TI  - Neonatal Postresuscitation Care in Brazil: A National Overview
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objectives Postresuscitation care (PRC) encompasses structured and systematic interventions aimed at promptly stabilizing at-risk newborns in order to improve clinical outcomes. This study aimed to assess PRC practices as reported by pediatricians who serve as instructors in the Brazilian Neonatal Resuscitation Program (BNRP) of the Brazilian Pediatric Society. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive survey among BNRP instructors. Data were collected via a 55-item online questionnaire (Google Forms), covering respondents' professional background, primary work setting, and specific PRC practices. A convenience sample was used, and descriptive statistics summarized the findings. Results A total of 740 responses were obtained, representing 63% of BNRP instructors. Of these, 79% were neonatologists, 88% with over 10 years of professional experience. Most worked in public (61%) and teaching hospitals (76%). Only 41% had received targeted PRC training; of these, 56% had exclusively theoretical instruction. Regarding the scope of PRC, 37% believed interventions were indicated solely for newborns requiring intubation, chest compression, or medications in the delivery room. Overall, 49% of respondents reported having written PRC protocols at their institutions, though their content and implementation varied considerably. Conclusion PRC practices in Brazil are neither homogeneous nor systematically implemented across most neonatology services involving BNRP instructors. These findings highlight the pressing need for enhanced dissemination of standardized PRC protocols and comprehensive training for pediatricians engaged in neonatal care.

TI  - Shock to the Heart: Psychosocial Implications and Applications of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewAlthough rare, sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young is a tragic event, having a dramatic impact upon all involved. The psychosocial burden associated with SCD can leave friends, families, and entire communities bereft. With only limited evidence to describe the volatile emotional reactions associated with a young SCD, there is an urgent need for care providers to better understand the psychological complexities and impacts faced by both at-risk individuals and those directly affected by these tragic events.Recent FindingsCurrent knowledge of the psychosocial implications associated with SCD in the young has recently generated interest in the cardiovascular community, with the goal of addressing prevention strategies (screening), family bereavement, and the psychological impact of at-risk or surviving individuals. With the emergence of novel strategies aimed at reducing the public health impact of SCD in the young, further discussion regarding the psychosocial impact of SCD, encompassing prevention, survivorship, and the downstream communal effects of a young death is required. Support systems and intervention could assist in the management of the associated psychosocial burden, yet there is a lack of clinical guidelines to direct this form of care.SummaryThere is an important need for multidisciplinary collaboration across subspecialties to provide support to grieving individuals and manage patient well-being throughout the screening process for SCD. This collaborative approach requires the integration of cardiovascular and psychological expertise where relevant.

TI  - Disturbances of hypoxanthine metabolism in the liver of resuscitated rats
T2  - BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Catabolism of purine mononucleotides to hypoxanthine and xanthine in the liver is enhanced in rats resuscitated after a 6.5-min asphyxia. Reduced incorporation of C-14-hypoxanthine into these nucleotides 30 min, 1, and 3 days after resuscitation attests to its disturbed reutilization. This probably promotes activation of the xanthine oxidase reaction, leading to purine deficit and hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species.

TI  - Correlation of base deficit and age shock index with in-hospital mortality in geriatric major trauma patients: a 1-year retrospective study at a single level I trauma center in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND INJURY
AB  - Purpose: Base deficit (BD) and age shock index have been utilized as an indicator of resuscitation adequacy and a predictor of poor outcomes in trauma cases, respectively. However, evidence regarding their correlation with in-hospital mortality among geriatric major trauma patients remains scarce in the literature. Methods: This analytical observational study employed a retrospective cohort design involving 82 geriatric major trauma patients treated at our institution between November 2023 and November 2024. Data were collected from patients' medical records at admission (age, trauma mechanism, vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], Injury Severity Score, hemoglobin, BD, and comorbidities) and at discharge (survival or death). Results: The geriatric major trauma patients who experienced in-hospital mortality were predominantly male, with an average age of 69.6 years. Traffic accidents constituted the most common trauma mechanism. Most patients presented with a GCS score between 13 and 15, and hypertension was the most frequently recorded comorbidity. BD demonstrated a significant correlation with in-hospital mortality (P<0.05). Severe BD was associated with the highest odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 40.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.90-560.86). Although age shock index did not directly correlate with mortality, it played a confounding role. Additionally, a GCS score of <9 was significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality (P<0.05). Conclusions: The findings of this study can inform initial clinical management strategies for geriatric major trauma patients at trauma centers. Prompt resuscitation and treatment should be prioritized for patients presenting with moderate or severe BD to reduce preventable mortality in this population.

TI  - The impact of modern neonatal resuscitation (NRPG) on the neonatal mortality in a Hospital in Zhuhai, China
T2  - RELEVANCE AND EXCELLENCE IN PERINATAL CARE
CP  - 9th Congress of the Federation-of-the-Asia-and-Oceania-Perinatal-Societies on Relevance and Excellence in Perinatal Care
AB  - Birth asphyxia is the leading cause Oi neonatal death in China, Traditional resuscitation (TR) for newborns has not been able to play an effective role in lowering neonatal mortality because its more harm and less profit and also time-wasting, Therefore, internationally current modern resuscitation, i.e., NRPG, was considered to replace TR in delivery room practice first in our hospital also in Zhuhai City, A comparisone between NRPG and previous TR would be made to find which would be better and worth being promulgated in reducing neonatal mortality in our country.
   In two years from August of 1993 to August of 1995, a total oi 4751 delivered newborns received NRPG exclusively instead of TR, including 366 cases of asphyxia with 66 severe ones in them. The procedures of NRPG were strictly conducted especially ih those asphyxiated babies with thoroughly airway suctioning followed by bag-and-mask ventilation (214 cases) or endotracheal ventilation (152). A previous sample of 1722 live-births without NRPG but TR (1992) were compared as a controlled. group statistically. TR consisted mainly of some medications first and strong physical stimulation.
   As a result, the difference was quire significant in perinatal neonatal mortality between NRPG and TR groups, 3.4 parts per thousand and 9.9 parts per thousand, respectively (X(2)=10.54, P<0.01). In other words, the neonatal mortality was reduced nearly 3 times after NRPG was applied. Also, neurological following up of 21 cases of severe asphyxia at 2 months - 1 year of age showed all normal but for only one with cerebral palsy. In conclusion, it was important to disseminate the knowledge and technique of NRPG and promulgate the message that NRPG was an effective measure in :he reduction of neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity in China.

TI  - Paediatric out-of-hospital clinical deterioration: a mixed-methods scoping review protocol
T2  - BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN
AB  - Introduction In pre-hospital settings, identifying a deteriorating child can be challenging, especially considering that the proportion of paediatric patients with acute illnesses is lower compared with adults. This challenge is exacerbated in pre-hospital settings, where information might be scarce. Physiological alterations indicating changes in a patient's condition can be detected hours preceding a cardiac arrest. Therefore, maintaining continuous monitoring of the patient's clinical condition is crucial to detecting any physiological changes promptly, facilitating early identification of critical illness. This scoping review aims to assess the extent, range and nature of published research related to recognising paediatric out-of-hospital clinical deterioration by pre-hospital staff.Methods and analysis This scoping review is registered with the Open Science Framework. The review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. A systematic search of relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL and Scopus) will be conducted. In this scoping review, all types of study designs including quantitative and qualitative studies will be considered. The inclusion is limited to English-language studies published between January 1990 and March 2024. Two independent reviewers (AG and SS) will conduct a thorough screening of titles and abstracts against the pre-defined inclusion criteria for the review. For the selected citations, the full texts will undergo detailed assessment by the two reviewers, ensuring alignment with the inclusion criteria. A quality assessment of the included studies will be done using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The findings will be presented using diagrams or tables, supplemented by narrative summaries following the JBI guidelines.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. The findings will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentation at conferences and/or seminars.

TI  - Hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation-mediated tissue water distribution is normalized by adjunctive peritoneal resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
CP  - 119th Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjunctive direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) from hemorrhagic shock (HS) improves intestinal blood flow and abrogates postresuscitation edema. HS causes water shifts as a result of sodium redistribution and changes in transcapillary Starling forces. Conventional resuscitation (CR) with crystalloid aggravates water sequestration. We examined the compartment pattern of organ tissue water after FIS and CR, and modulation of tissue edema by adjunctive DPR.
   STUDY DESIGN: Rats were hemorrhaged (40% mean arterial pressure for 60 minutes) and assigned to four groups (n = 7): sham, 110 HS; HS no resuscitation; HS+CR (shed blood plus 2 volumes Ringer's lactate); and HS+CR+DPR (20 mL clinical intraperitoneal (IP) dialysis fluid). Isotopic markers determined equilibrium distribution volumes [V-D] in gut, liver, lung, and muscle by quantitative autoradiography (2-hour postresuscitation). Total tissue water (TTW) was determined by wet-dry weights. Extracellular water was measured from 14 C-mannitol V-D and intravascular volume (IVV) from I-131-labeled IgG V-D-Cellular and interstitial water volumes were calculated.
   RESULTS: HS alone decreased IVV in all tissues and TTW in gut, lung, and muscle, but not liver, compared with shams. IVV remained decreased with all resuscitations despite restoration of central hemodynamics. CR caused interstitial edema in gut, liver, and muscle, and cellular edema in lung. DPR reduced (liver, muscle) or prevented (gut, lung) these volume shifts.
   CONCLUSIONS: HS decreases IVV. HS-induced water shifts are organ-specific and prominent in gut, lung, and muscle. CR restores central hemodynamics, does not restore IVV, and alters organ-specific TTW distribution. Adjunctive DPR with IP dialysis fluid normalizes TTW and water compartment distribution and prevents edema. Combined effect of DPR and intravascular fluid replacement appears to prevent global tissue edema and improve outcomes from HS.

TI  - High CRP/PNI levels predict an unfavorable prognosis in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome: A propensity score matching study
T2  - IMMUNITY INFLAMMATION AND DISEASE
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to identify a novel inflammatory index and construct a nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality due to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).MethodsThis cohort included 610 patients with SFTS hospitalized in Wuhan Union Hospital between March 2017 and November 2022. The ratio of C-reactive protein (CRP) to the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was calculated and used to reflect patients' inflammatory status. Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to balance confounding factors between the low- and high-CRP/PNI groups. SFTS individuals from Jinyinhu Hospital were used as the validation cohort.ResultsPatients with SFTS and high CRP/PNI were significantly correlated with a higher percentage of severe and critical SFTS types and higher in-hospital mortality rates than those with low CRP/PNI. CRP/PNI was the potent risk indicator for in-hospital mortality in individuals with SFTS. The CRP/PNI nomogram showed a good predictive value for in-hospital mortality in patients with SFTS. After PSM, the predictive performance of CRP/PNI for 28-day mortality was excellent. Finally, the CRP/PNI could still assess patients with SFTS at different risks based on SFTS data from another medical center.ConclusionThe CPR/PNI ratio exhibited a strong positive correlation with the SFTS disease type and could predict in-hospital mortality in the early stages of SFTS. The CPR/PNI ratio could substantially help clinicians facilitate the early identification of patients with high-risk SFTS and the timely initiation of intensive therapy.
   Our study highlights the usefulness of the C-reactive protein (CRP) to prognostic nutritional index (PNI) ratio in predicting the in-hospital mortality of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients based on a cohort of 610 SFTS cases from Wuhan Union Hospital. Subsequent survival analysis demonstrates that CRP/PNI could well differentiate SFTS individuals with high risk from those with low risk. receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis unveils that CRP/PNI possesses nice predictive power for predicting the in-hospital mortality of SFTS. Briefly, CRP/PNI is a reliable biomarker that can serve as a promising predictor for subjects with SFTS. image

TI  - Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PEDIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundEvidence supporting the benefits of delayed cord clamping is increasing; however, there is no clear recommendation on cord management during newborn resuscitation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of resuscitation initiated with an intact umbilical cord, hypothesizing it is a safe stabilization procedure that improves neonatal outcomes.MethodsSystematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science from inception to March 1, 2024. Eligible articles compared neonatal outcomes in newborns receiving initial stabilization steps before and after cord clamping.ResultsTwelve studies met our inclusion criteria, with six RCTs included in the quantitative analysis. No statistically significant differences were found in delivery room parameters, in-hospital mortality, or neonatal outcomes between the examined groups. However, intact cord resuscitation group showed higher SpO2 at 5 min after birth compared to cord clamping prior to resuscitation group (MD 6.67%, 95% CI [-1.16%, 14.50%]). There were no significant differences in early complications of prematurity (NEC >= stage 2: RR 2.05, 95% CI [0.34, 12.30], IVH: RR 1.25, 95% CI [0.77, 2.00]).ConclusionIntact cord management during resuscitation appears to be a safe intervention; its effect on early complications of prematurity remains unclear. Further high-quality RCTs with larger patient numbers are urgently needed.ImpactInitiating resuscitation with an intact umbilical cord appears to be a safe intervention for newborns.No statistically significant differences were found in delivery room parameters, in-hospital mortality, and neonatal outcomes between the examined groups.The utilization of specialized resuscitation trolleys appears to be promising to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants.Further high-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes are urgently needed to refine recommendations.

TI  - Number of Circulating CD73-Expressing Lymphocytes Correlates With Survival After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background-Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA) have highly variable neurological, circulatory, and systemic ischemia-reperfusion injuries. After the initial hypoxic-ischemic insult, a cascade of immune and inflammatory responses develops and is often fatal. The role of the immune response in pathophysiological characteristics and recovery is not well understood. We studied immune cell activity and its association with outcomes in a cohort of CA survivors.
   Methods and Results-After informed consent, we collected blood samples at intervals over a week after resuscitation from CA. We examined the expression of CD39 and CD73 (alias 5'-nucleotidase), production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, generation of reactive oxygen species, and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells, in comparison to cells obtained from control subjects before coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The number of circulating total and CD73-expressing lymphocytes correlated with survival after CA. Incubation of immune cells, obtained from post-CA subjects, with AMP, a substrate for CD73, resulted in inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-a production and generation of reactive oxygen species. This effect was blocked by adenosine 5'-(alpha, beta-methylene) diphosphate, a specific inhibitor of CD73 and ZM 241385, an A2 adenosine receptor antagonist. We also found that AMP-dependent activation of CD73 induces production of vascular endothelial growth factor.
   Conclusions-CD73-expressing lymphocytes mediate cellular protection from inflammation after CA through inhibition of proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells and promotion of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. The contribution of CD73 lymphocytes in the regulation of acute inflammation and tissue injury after CA warrants further study.

TI  - OUTCOME OF RESUSCITATION FROM BRADYARRHYTHMIC OR ASYSTOLIC PREHOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Previous studies of outcome as a function of the initial electrophysiologic mechanisms recorded at the scene of prehospital cardiac arrest have demonstrated that bradyarrhythmias and asystole have the worst prognosis. Observations in bradyarrhythmic and asystolic arrests occurring from 1980-1982 are compared with those from 1975-1978. From 1980-1982, 61 (27%) of 225 cardiac arrest events meeting entry criteria for the study were bradyarrhythmic or asystolic. Only 2 (8%) of 24 patients with  asystole and 1 (20%) of 5 patients with sinus bradycardia survived prehospital intervention. Only 1 of these 29 patients was discharged from the hospital alive. Of 32 patients who presented with idioventricular rhythm at initial contact 15 (47%) survived prehospital intervention and were hospitalized, and 8 (25%) of these 32 were ultimately discharged alive. When compared with the 1975-1978 patients with bradyarrhythmia and asystole, both prehospital survival (8 vs. 30%, P < 0.001) and survival after hospitalization (0 vs. 15%, P < 0.05) significantly improved, but the improvement occurred predominantly in the subgroup with idioventricular rhythm. Survivors within this subgroup tended to have a prompt response to prehospital pharmacologic interventions that were not available to the 1975-1978 group. The response was manifested by return to a sinus mechanism or increase in the rate of idioventricular rhythm. Outcome has improved for a specific subgroup of victims of prehospital  cardiac arrest with bradyarrhythmia or asystole; the improved outcome may relate to field interventions by rescue personnel at the scene of arrest but the mortality rate is still high.

TI  - Quantitative EEG reactivity induced by electrical stimulation predicts good outcome in comatose patients after cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - BackgroundEEG reactivity is a predictor for neurological outcome in comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA); however, its application is limited by variability in stimulus types and visual assessment. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the quantitative analysis of EEG reactivity induced by standardized electrical stimulation and for early prognostication in this population.MethodsThis prospective observational study recruited post-CA comatose patients in Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) between January 2016 and June 2023. EEG reactivity to electrical or traditional pain stimulation was randomly performed via visual and quantitative analysis. Neurological outcome within 6 months was dichotomized as good (Cerebral Performance Categories, CPC 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5).ResultsFifty-eight post-CA comatose patients were admitted, and 52 patients were included in the final analysis, of which 19 (36.5%) had good outcomes. EEG reactivity induced with the electrical stimulation had superior performance to the traditional pain stimulation for good outcome prediction (quantitative analysis: AUC 0.932 vs. 0.849, p = 0.048). When using the electrical stimulation, the AUC of EEG reactivity to predict good outcome by visual analysis was 0.838, increasing to 0.932 by quantitative analysis (p = 0.039). Comparing to the traditional pain stimulation by visual analysis, the AUC of EEG reactivity for good prognostication by the electrical stimulation with quantitative analysis was significantly improved (0.932 vs. 0.770, p = 0.004).ConclusionsEEG reactivity induced by the standardized electrical stimulation in combination with quantitative analysis is a promising formula for post-CA comatose patients, with increased predictive accuracy.

TI  - The experiences of cardiac arrest survivors and their key supporters following cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-ethnography
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To review qualitative studies on the experience of sudden cardiac arrest survival from the perspective of both survivors and their key support Methods: A seven-step meta-ethnography and synthesis of qualitative evidence was undertaken, informed by the Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guidelines (eMERGe). Four major databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO; January 1995-January 2022, updated July 2023) for qualitative studies exploring survivors' and/or key supporters' experiences of cardiac arrest survival. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) were applied to evaluate the overall confidence in research findings. Constructs were identified from each paper, informing theme and sub-theme development. Results: From 15,917 unique titles/abstracts and 196 full-text articles, 32 met the inclusion criteria. Three themes captured the survivors' experiences: 1) Making sense of my cardiac arrest; 2) Learning to trust my body and mind; and 3) Re-evaluating my life. A further three themes reflected key supporters' experiences: 1) Emotional turmoil; 2) Becoming a carer: same person but different me; and 3) Engaging with a new and unknown world. However, limited data and some methodological weaknesses in included studies reduced confidence in several themes. The findings were conceived within the overarching concept of 'negotiating a new normal'. Conclusions: The enduring psychosocial and physical sequelae of cardiac arrest survival substantially impacts the lives of survivors and their key supporters, requiring negotiation of their 'new normality'. The need for sense-making, physical and psychological recovery, and the new roles for key supporters should be strong considerations in the development of future interventions.

TI  - Cardiac anxiety after sudden cardiac arrest: Severity, predictors and clinical implications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Survival from cardiac arrest is a medical success but simultaneously produces psychological challenges related to perception of safety and threat. The current study evaluated symptoms of cardiac-specific anxiety in sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) survivors and examined predictors of cardiac anxiety secondary to cardiac arrest.
   Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 188 SCA survivors from the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association patient registry completed an online questionnaire that included a measure of cardiac anxiety (CAQ) and sociodemographic, cardiac history, and psychosocial adjustment data. CAQ scores were compared to published means from implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) samples and a hierarchical regression was performed.
   Results: Clinically relevant cardiac anxiety and cardioprotective behaviors were frequently endorsed and 18% of survivors reported persistent worry about their heart even when presented with normal test results. Compared to all other samples, SCA survivors reported significantly higher levels of heart-focused attention (d = 0.3-1.1) and greater cardiac fear and avoidance behaviors than LQTS patients. SCA patients endorsed less severe fear and avoidance symptoms than the HCM sample. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that younger age (p = 0.02), heart murmur (p = 0.02), history of ICD shock >= 1 (p = 0.01), and generalized anxiety (p = 0.008) significantly predicted cardiac anxiety. The overall model explained 29.2% of the total variance.
   Conclusions: SCA survivors endorse high levels of cardiac-specific fear, avoidance and preoccupation with cardiac symptoms. Successful management of SCA patients requires attention to anxiety about cardiac functioning and security. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Cognitive impairment may occur in 42-50% of cardiac arrest survivors. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) has recently been shown to have neurotherapeutic effects in patients suffering from chronic cognitive impairments (CCI) consequent to stroke and mild traumatic brain injury.
   The objective of this study was to assess the neurotherapeutic effect of HBO2 in patients suffering from CCI due to cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with CCI caused by cardiac arrest, treated with 60 daily sessions of HBO2. Evaluation included objective computerized cognitive tests (NeuroTrax), Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of life questionnaires. The results of these tests were compared with changes in brain activity as assessed by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging.
   Results: The study included 11 cases of CCI patients. Patients were treated with HBO2, 0.5-7.5 years (mean 2.6 +/- 0.6 years) after the cardiac arrest. HBO2 was found to induce modest, but statistically significant improvement in memory, attention and executive function (mean scores) of 12%, 20% and 24% respectively. The clinical improvements were found to be well correlated with increased brain activity in relevant brain areas as assessed by computerized analysis of the SPECT imaging.
   Conclusions: Although further research is needed, the results demonstrate the beneficial effects of HBO2 on CCI in patients after cardiac arrest, even months to years after the acute event.

TI  - Inter-shift variation in unscheduled intensive care unit transfers at a children's hospital
T2  - PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
AB  - BackgroundThe early detection of clinical deterioration and the prompt escalation of care is important but may be limited in the general ward, especially at night. Identifying variations between work shifts in the number of unscheduled in-hospital intensive care unit (ICU) transfers and emergency transfers involving life-threatening conditions may help implement targeted interventions to reduce delayed transfers and improve patient safety and outcomes.
   MethodsAll unscheduled ICU transfers in a tertiary children's hospital, from January 2013 to December 2016, were reviewed retrospectively. The transfers were categorized into safe transfers and adverse safety events (ASE). The 4 year cumulative numbers for each transfer category in each work shift (day, evening, and night) were assessed for comparison. An ASE was defined as transfer after cardiopulmonary resuscitation or tracheal intubation in the ward, or an unrecognized situation awareness failure event transfer, which was defined as previously reported.
   ResultsOf 244 unscheduled in-hospital ICU transfers, 167 were safe transfers and 77 were ASE. The number of unscheduled transfers and of ASE was highest during the day shift (n = 133 and 40, respectively) and lowest during the night shift (n = 25 and 12, respectively). In contrast, the proportion of ASE in the unscheduled transfers was higher during the night shift (48%) compared with the day and evening shifts (30% and 31%, respectively).
   ConclusionsThe occurrence of unscheduled ICU transfers was disproportionately low during the night shift, whereas the majority of ASE happened during the day shift. Future studies focusing on unravelling the reasons for such variations are warranted.

TI  - Regional Distribution of Brain Injury After Cardiac Arrest Clinical and Electrographic Correlates
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and Objectives
   Disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and epileptic seizures are associated with poor outcome after cardiac arrest. Our objective was to identify the distribution of diffusion MRI-measured anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest and to define the regional correlates of disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and seizures.
   Methods
   We analyzed patients from a single-center database of unresponsive patients who underwent diffusion MRI after cardiac arrest (n = 204). We classified each patient according to recovery of consciousness (command following) before discharge, the most continuous EEG background (burst suppression vs continuous), and the presence or absence of seizures. Anoxic brain injury was measured with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) signal. We identified ADC abnormalities relative to controls without cardiac arrest (n = 48) and used voxel lesion symptom mapping to identify regional associations with disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and seizures. We then used a bootstrapped lasso regression procedure to identify robust, multivariate regional associations with each outcome variable. Last, using area under receiver operating characteristic curves, we then compared the classification ability of the strongest regional associations to that of brain-wide summary measures.
   Results
   Compared to controls, patients with cardiac arrest demonstrated ADC signal reduction that was most significant in the occipital lobes. Disorders of consciousness were associated with reduced ADC most prominently in the occipital lobes but also in deep structures. Regional injury more accurately classified patients with disorders of consciousness than whole-brain injury. Background suppression mapped to a similar set of brain regions, but regional injury could no better classify patients than whole-brain measures. Seizures were less common in patients with more severe anoxic injury, particularly in those with injury to the lateral temporal white matter.
   Discussion
   Anoxic brain injury was most prevalent in posterior cerebral regions, and this regional pattern of injury was a better predictor of disorders of consciousness than whole-brain injury measures. EEG background suppression lacked a specific regional association, but patients with injury to the temporal lobe were less likely to have seizures. Regional patterns of anoxic brain injury are relevant to the clinical and electrographic sequelae of cardiac arrest and may hold importance for prognosis.
   Classification of Evidence
   This study provides Class IV evidence that disorders of consciousness after cardiac arrest are associated with widely lower ADC values on diffusion MRI and are most strongly associated with reductions in occipital ADC.

TI  - Endothelial -targeted CD39 is protective in a mouse model of global forebrain ischaemia
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION
AB  - Global ischemic brain injury occurs after cardiac arrest or prolonged hypotensive episodes following surgery or trauma. It causes significant neurological deficits even after successful re-establishment of blood flow. It is the primary cause of death in 68% of inpatient and 23% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, but there are currently no treatments. Endothelial activation and dysfunction impairing small vessel blood flow is the cause of brain damage. Purinergic signaling is an endogenous molecular pathway, where CD39 and CD73 catabolize extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) to adenosine. After ischemia, eATP is released, triggering thrombosis and inflammation. In contrast, adenosine is anti-thrombotic, protects against oxidative stress, and suppresses the immune response. Our group developed a bifunctional compound - anti-VCAM-CD39 that targets the dysregulated endothelium and promotes adenosine generation at the infarct site, localising the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CD39. We investigated whether anti-VCAM-CD39 could improve outcome in a murine model of global ischaemia caused by dual carotid artery ligation (DCAL). Test drugs anti-VCAM-CD39 and controls were given 3 h after 30 min ischaemia. Assessments at 24 h included neurological function, infarct volume, perfusion, and albumin extravasation to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. We showed that there was an overall improvement in neurological deficit in anti-VCAM-CD39-treated mice after DCAL. MRI revealed that these mice had significantly smaller infarcts and reduced apoptotic activity on the side of permanent occlusion, compared to saline treated mice. There was reduced albumin extravasation in treated mice after DCAL, suggesting anti-VCAM-CD39 conferred neuroprotection in the brain through preservation of BBB permeability. In vitro findings confirmed that anti-VCAM-CD39-mediated adenosine production protected against hypoxia-induced endothelial cell death. anti-VCAM-CD39 is a novel therapeutic that can promote neuroprotection, reduce tissue damage and inflammation after hypoxic brain injury in mice. These findings suggest that anti-VCAM-CD39 could be a new avenue of cardiac arrest therapy and could potentially be used in other cerebrovascular diseases where endothelial dysfunction is a constant underlying pathology.

TI  - Utility of a novel watch-based pulse detection system to detect pulselessness in human subjects
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND The Wriskwatch is a novel, watch-based pulse detection device that detects the loss of a radial pulse via advanced pulse detection technology and immediately contacts emergency medical systems.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this first-in-man, prospective, single-blinded, phase 1 study was to evaluate the ability of this device to detect motionlessness and pulselessness in human subjects as a simulation of sudden cardiac death.
   METHODS The study cohort consisted of 34 patients: 24 hospitalized patients and 10 presenting for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) testing. We simulated loss of pulse in our hospitalized patients via blood pressure cuff inflation to occlude the brachial arterial pulse at random times in 20 subjects with no inflations in 4 while the patients were instructed to keep perfectly still. Of the 10 patients undergoing ventricular fibrillation (VF) induction during ICD testing, the exact times of VF induction were recorded. A blinded reviewer determined if and when motion and pulse were lost in all patients using only data from the device.
   RESULTS Of the 34 patients, 2 had an unusable signal, 1 had device ejection during ICD testing, and 2 had too much motion artifact and were excluded (5/34 patients, or 14.7% of the total cohort). Of the 29 remaining subjects, 4 had no loss of pulse of which the device correctly identified 3. In the remaining 25 patients, the device correctly identified the time of pulselessness in 23 of 25 (16/17 hospitalized patients and 7/8 ICD patients). Overall, the Wriskwatch was worn for a total of 561.2 minutes. Pulselessness was present for 5.8 minutes. The sensitivity of the watch to detect pulse status (based on 15-second intervals) was 99.9%, and the specificity was 90.3%.
   CONCLUSION The Wriskwatch is a novel device that shows promise as a tool to hasten activation of emergency medical systems and facilitate early defibrillation in patients with cardiac arrest.

TI  - Social Determinants of Health May Predict End of Life Portable Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment Form Completion and Treatment Selections
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: End of life (EOL) care planning is important for aging adults given the growing prevalence of chronic medical conditions in the US. The Portable Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) program promotes communication between clinicians and patients with advanced illness about EOL treatment preferences. Despite growing resources for EOL care, utilization remains unequal based on social determinants of health (SDOH), including race, language, urbanization, and education. We evaluated the relationship between POLST form selections and completion rates and SDOH. Methods: Oregon POLST Registry and American Community Survey data from 2013 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. POLST form completion rates and selections, and various SDOH, including age, income, insurance status, urbanization, etc. were recorded. Data were merged based on ZIP codes and analyzed using chi(2) or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Logistic regression was performed. Results: 127,588 POLST forms from 319 ZIP codes were included. POLST form completion rates were highest among urban ZIP codes, and urban registrants more often selected CPR and full treatment. ZIP codes with higher incomes tended to select CPR. ZIP codes with higher rates of private insurance completed POLST forms, and selected CPR and full treatment more frequently. ZIP codes with higher rates of Bachelor's degrees (or higher) completed POLST forms and selected full treatment more frequently. Conclusions: Various SDOH-specifically, urbanization, insurance status, income level and educational level achieved-may influence POLST form completion rates and selections. The expanding socioeconomic diversity and growth of urban communities, highlight the need for broader access to EOL planning and POLST.

TI  - Prognosis value of partial arterial oxygen pressure in patients with septic shock subjected to pre-hospital invasive ventilation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Mechanical ventilation can help improve the prognosis of septic shock. While adequate delivery of oxygen to the tissue is crucial, hyperoxemia may be deleterious. Invasive out-of-hospital ventilation is often promptly performed in life-threatening emergencies. We propose to determine whether the arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) at the intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with mortality in patients with septic shock subjected to pre-hospital mechanical ventilation.
   Methods: We performed a monocentric retrospective observational study on 77 patients. PaO2 was measured at ICU admission. The primary outcome was mortality at day 28 (D28).
   Results: Forty-nine (64%) patients were included. The mean PaO2 at ICU admission was 153 +/- 77 and 202 +/- 82 mm Hg for alive and deceased patients respectively. Mortality concerned 18% of patients for PaO2 < 100, 25% for 100 < PaO2 < 150 and 57% for a PaO2 > 150mm Hg. PaO2 was significantly associated with mortality at D28 (p = 0.04). Using propensity score analysis including SOFA score, pre-hospital duration, lactate, and prehospital fluid volume expansion, association with mortality at D28 only remained for PaO2 > 150 mm Hg (p = 0.02, OR [CI95] = 1.59 [1.20-2.10]).
   Conclusions: In this study, we report a significant association between hyperoxemia at ICU admission and mortality in patients with septic shock subjected to pre-hospital invasive mechanical ventilation. The early adjustment of the PaO2 should be considered for these patients to avoid the toxic effects of hyperoxemia. However, blood gas analysis is hard to get in a pre-hospital setting. Consequently, alternative and feasible measures are needed, such as pulse oximetry, to improve the management of pre-hospital invasive ventilation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Organ donation as an outcome of traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest: A cost evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival after traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest (TCPA) is rare and requires significant resource expenditure. Organ donation as an outcome of TCPA resuscitation has not yet been included in a cost analysis. The aims of this study were to identify variables associated with survival and organ donation after TCPA, and to estimate the cost of achieving these outcomes. We hypothesized that the inclusion of organ donation as a potential outcome would make TCPA resuscitation more cost-effective.
   METHODS: Adult patients who required resuscitation for TCPA at a level I trauma center were retrospectively reviewed over 36 months. Data were obtained frommedical records, hospital accounting records, and the local organ procurement agency. Outcomes included survival to discharge, neurologic function, and organ donor eligibility. An individual-level state-transition cost-effectiveness model was used to evaluate the cost of TCPA resuscitation with and without organ donation included as an outcome. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to determine additional cost per life saved when organ donation is included.
   RESULTS: Over the study period, 8,932 subjects were evaluated. Traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest occurred in 237 patients (3%). The mortality rate was 97%. Variables associated with survival included emergency department disposition to the operating room(p < 0.01) and reactive pupils (p < 0.001). Of seven survivors, fourwere discharged neurologically intact. Of the patientswith TCPA, 5% were eligible for organ donation with a procurement rate of 2%. Organ donor eligibility was associated with arrest after arrival to the emergency department (p < 0.01) and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (p = 0.01). The cost of TCPA resuscitation per survivor was $1.8 million; cost per survivor or life saved by donation was $538,000. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $76,816 per additional life saved including donation as an outcome.
   CONCLUSION: The decision to pursue resuscitation should continue to be based on the presence of signs of life, especially pupil reactivity and duration of arrest. If the primary objective is survival, organ procurement will be maximized without conflict of interest. Early fresh frozen plasma transfusion may increase successful organ donation. The financial burden of TCPA resuscitation can be mitigated by expanding end points to include organ donation. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Healthcare Use during the Last Six Months of Life in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
AB  - Simple Summary
   In the last decades, new treatment options for advanced (breast) cancer have resulted in increased use of health care resources near the end of life. We assessed health care use near the end of life of patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). In this study, we have shown that ICU admission, and CPR occurred rarely during the last six months of life of ABC patients. However, hospital admissions occurred often, especially in patients who received new chemotherapy within 30 days of end of life. Those patients were also more likely to die in the hospital. However, death was most often due to disease progression. To improve quality of life near the end of life of advanced breast cancer patients, it is vital to develop tools to help clinicians identify those patients who will benefit from chemotherapy at the end of life.
   New treatment options in cancer have resulted in increased use of health care resources near the end of life. We assessed health care use near the end of life of patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). From the Southeast Netherlands Breast cancer (SONABRE) registry, we selected all deceased patients diagnosed with ABC in Maastricht University Medical Center between January 2007 and October 2017. Frequency of health care use in the last six months of life was described and predictors for health care use were assessed. Of 203 patients, 76% were admitted during the last six months, 6% to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 2% underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Death in hospital occurred in 25%. Nine percent of patients received a new line of chemotherapy <= 30 days before death, which was associated with age < 65 years and < 1 year survival since diagnosis of metastases. In these patients, the hospital admission rate was 95%, of which 79% died in the hospital, mostly due to progressive disease (80%). In conclusion, the frequency of ICU-admission, CPR or a new line of chemotherapy <= 30 days before death was low. Most patients receiving a new line of chemotherapy <= 30 days before death, died in the hospital.

TI  - Comparison of perinatal outcomes of women with gestational diabetes mellitus according to type of treatment for glycemic control
T2  - JORNAL DE PEDIATRIA
AB  - Objective: To compare the perinatal outcomes of women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), between pregnant treated only with lifestyle changes and pregnant treated with insulin and lifestyle changes.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study with follow-up of 64 women with GDM during the prenatal care and postpartum period until hospital discharge, divided into a control group (43) and an insulin group (21), with collection of sociodemographic, clinical, glycemic control and perinatal outcome data. Fetal macrosomia (>= 4 Kg), or large-for-gestational-age newborns were considered the primary outcome of the research.
   Results: Pre-pregnancy BMI (31.2 +/- 3.9 versus 28.8 +/- 5.5), diastolic blood pressure (75 +/- 8.7 versus 69 +/- 6.9) and postprandial blood glucose (136.6 versus 115.4) were higher in the insulin group, respectively. The control group had an average birth weight of 3058 g and an incidence of preterm birth of 11.6 %, while the insulin group had an average birth weight of 3203 g, with an incidence of preterm birth of 4.8 %. The majority of newborns had an adequate weight for their gestational age. Even all participants met glycemic goals, in the insulin group the Apgar score at the 5th minute and exclusive breastfeeding was lower, had 100 % of resuscitation cases, and a longer inpatient period.
   Conclusion: These data reinforce that even during prenatal care with lifestyle changes, newborns of women with GDM treated with insulin had worse outcomes, including clinical complications and less exclusive breastfeeding. It is important in prenatal care to identify neonates with risk for prevention and health promotion measures. (c) 2024 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

TI  - Protocols for massive blood transfusion: when and why, and potential complications
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Purpose An update paper on massive bleeding after major trauma. A review of protocols to address massive bleeding, and its possible complications, including coagulation abnormalities, complications related to blood storage, immunosuppression and infection, lung injury associated with transfusion, and hypothermia is carried out.
   Methods Literature review and discussion with authors' experience.
   Results Massive bleeding is an acute life-threatening complication of major trauma, and consequently its prompt diagnosis and treatment is of overwhelming importance. Treatment requires rapid surgical management together with the massive infusion of colloid and blood.
   Conclusions Since massive transfusion provokes further problems in patients who are already severely traumatized and anaemic, once this course of action has been decided upon, a profound knowledge of its potential complications, careful monitoring and proper follow-up are all essential. To diagnose this bleeding, most authors favour, as the main first choice tool, a full-body CT scan (head to pelvis), in non-critical severe trauma cases. In addition, focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST, an acronym that highlights the necessity of rapid performance) is a very important diagnostic test for abdominal and thoracic bleeding. Furthermore, urgent surgical intervention should be undertaken for patients with significant free intraabdominal fluid and haemodynamic instability. Although the clinical situation and the blood haemoglobin concentration are the key factors considered in this rapid decision-making context, laboratory markers should not be based on a single haematocrit value, as its sensitivity to significant bleeding may be very low. Serum lactate and base deficit are very sensitive markers for detecting and monitoring the extent of bleeding and shock, in conjunction with repeated combined measurements of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and platelets.

TI  - Emergent Comprehensive Imaging of the Major Trauma Patient: A New Paradigm for Improved Clinical Decision-Making
T2  - CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF RADIOLOGISTS JOURNAL-JOURNAL DE L ASSOCIATION CANADIENNE DES RADIOLOGISTES
AB  - Modern advances in the medical imaging layered onto sophisticated trauma resuscitation strategies in highly organized regionalized trauma systems have created a paradigm shift in the management of severely injured patients. Although immediate exploratory surgery to identify and control life-threatening injuries still has its place, accelerated image acquisition and interpretation procedures now make it rare for trauma surgeons in major centers to venture into damage control surgery unaided by computed tomography (CT) or other imaging, particularly in cases of blunt trauma. Indeed, because of the high incidence of clinically occult injuries associated with major mechanism trauma, and even lower energy trauma in frail or elderly patients, CT imaging has become as invaluable as physical examination, if not more so, in critical decision-making in support of optimal outcomes. In particular, whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) completed promptly after initial assessment of a major trauma provides a quick, comprehensive survey of injuries that enables better surgical planning, obviates the need for multiple subsequent studies, and permits specialized reconstructions when needed. For those at risk for problematic occult injury after modest trauma, WBCT facilitates safer discharge planning and simplified follow-up. Through standardized guidelines, streamlined protocols, synoptic reporting, accessible web-based platforms, and active collaboration with clinicians, radiologists dedicated to trauma and emergency imaging enable clearer understanding of complex injuries in high-risk patients which leads to superior clinical decision-making. Whereas dated dogma has long warned that the CT scanner is the last place to take a challenging trauma patient, modern practice suggests that, more often than not, early comprehensive imaging can be done safely and efficiently and is in the patient's best interest. This article outlines how the role of diagnostic imaging for major trauma has evolved considerably in recent years.

TI  - Effects of different ascorbic acid doses on the mortality of critically ill patients: a meta-analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - BackgroundLow levels of ascorbic acid (AA) have been detected in critically ill patients in which AA supplementation leads to promising outcomes. However, the ability of AA to reduce mortality in critically ill patients remains controversial. In this study, we have performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of AA dose on the mortality of critically ill adults.MethodsElectronic databases were searched for trials in which AA had been intravenously administered to critically ill patients regardless of the dose or the co-administration of antioxidant agents. The predefined primary outcome included all-cause mortality at final follow-up.ResultsThe included trials enrolled a total of 1210 patients. Intravenous (IV) AA doses of 3-10g/d reduced the mortality of critically ill patients (OR 0.25; 95% CI (0.14-0.46); p<0.001; I-2=0.0%), while low (<3g/d) and high AA doses (10g/d) had no effect (OR 1.44; 95% CI (0.79-2.61); p=0.234; I-2=0.0% versus OR 1.12; 95% CI (0.62-2.03); p=0.700; I-2=0.0%). AA was associated with a decreased duration of vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation, but did not influence fluid requirement or urine output during the first 24h of admission. The number of patients suffering from acute kidney injury and the length of intensive care unit or hospital stays were also unaffected by the AA.ConclusionIntravenous AA reduces the duration of vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation; 3-10g AA results in lower overall mortality rates. Given the limitations of the primary literature, further studies are required to fully clarify the effectiveness of AA during the management of critically ill patients.

TI  - Pooling of contrast material on computed tomography mandates aggressive management of blunt hepatic injury
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonoperative management of blunt hepatic injury is currently a widely accepted treatment modality. Computed tomography (CT) is an important imaging study both for diagnosis and follow-up of these patients. There is, however, no reliable predictor of failure of nonoperative treatment other than the ultimate development of hemodynamic instability. Previous reports mostly were based on the data obtained from low-speed dynamic incremental scanners. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of a high-speed helical scanner in predicting the outcome of patients managed nonoperatively.
   METHODS: During a 30-month period, 194 patients with blunt hepatic injury were treated, 150 of them weve hemodynamically stable after initial resuscitation and underwent abdominal CT examination. All CT scans were performed with the High Speed Advantage Scanner. The CT scans and medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Nonoperative management was successfully applied to all patients with grade? I and II, 93% of grade III, 87% of grade IV, and 67% of grade V liver injuries. Twelve patients required liver-related celiotomy. Pooling of contrast material was detected on the CT scans of 8 patients. Six (75%) of these patients developed hemodynamic instability and required liver-related celiotomy later. Pooling of contrast material can be detected in 50% of the patients receiving liver-related celiotomy.
   CONCLUSION: The presence of pooling of contrast material within the hepatic parenchyma indicates free extravasation of blood as a result of active bleeding. In patients with blunt hepatic injury, if this sign is detected, nonoperative treatment should be terminated and angiography or celiotomy undertaken promptly. With the increasing use of high-speed spiral CT scanner and improvement in scanning technique, pooling of contrast material may become a sensitive sign far active bleeding and may be used as a guide for the selection of treatment modality.

TI  - Drug resistant tuberculosis: Implications for transmission, diagnosis, and disease management
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Drug resistant tuberculosis contributes significantly to the global burden of antimicrobial resistance, often consuming a large proportion of the healthcare budget and associated resources in many endemic countries. The rapid emergence of resistance to newer tuberculosis therapies signals the need to ensure appropriate antibiotic stewardship, together with a concerted drive to develop new regimens that are active against currently circulating drug resistant strains. Herein, we highlight that the current burden of drug resistant tuberculosis is driven by a combination of ongoing transmission and the intra-patient evolution of resistance through several mechanisms. Global control of tuberculosis will require interventions that effectively address these and related aspects. Interrupting tuberculosis transmission is dependent on the availability of novel rapid diagnostics which provide accurate results, as near-patient as is possible, together with appropriate linkage to care. Contact tracing, longitudinal follow-up for symptoms and active mapping of social contacts are essential elements to curb further community-wide spread of drug resistant strains. Appropriate prophylaxis for contacts of drug resistant index cases is imperative to limit disease progression and subsequent transmission. Preventing the evolution of drug resistant strains will require the development of shorter regimens that rapidly eliminate all populations of mycobacteria, whilst concurrently limiting bacterial metabolic processes that drive drug tolerance, mutagenesis and the ultimate emergence of resistance. Drug discovery programs that specifically target bacterial genetic determinants associated with these processes will be paramount to tuberculosis eradication. In addition, the development of appropriate clinical endpoints that quantify drug tolerant organisms in sputum, such as differentially culturable/detectable tubercle bacteria is necessary to accurately assess the potential of new therapies to effectively shorten treatment duration. When combined, this holistic approach to addressing the critical problems associated with drug resistance will support delivery of quality care to patients suffering from tuberculosis and bolster efforts to eradicate this disease.

TI  - Strengthening nursing knowledge and skills in perioperative cleft care: a focused training approach in Nigeria's surgical healthcare plan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background Safe perioperative nursing care is crucial to improving outcomes of surgical care. This is a report on the pilot implementation of a nursing training programme aimed at strengthening safe perioperative nursing care in Nigeria, aligning with the nation's strategic framework for surgical, obstetric, anaesthesia, and nursing plan. The aim of this report is to highlight the need to incorporate perioperative nursing training into efforts to scale up access to surgical care in low resource settings.Methods The Nursing Care Saves Lives (NCSL) training programme which was designed for training in perioperative nursing of cleft lip and palate patients, was adapted for perioperative nursing training. A 5-day intensive training was deployed, involving lectures, hands-on activities, simulations, and group problem-solving exercises. Pre- and post-training surveys were administered, and participant feedback and 3-months follow-up assessments obtained. The data has been analysed using descriptive statistics.Results Twenty-six participants who were nurses involved in perioperative care, from both public and private hospitals, completed the training. Pre-training evaluation scores ranged from 23 to 72% (median 68%), increasing significantly to 61-98% (median 76%) post-training (p = 0.0001). Participants rated all training contents as useful, with high satisfaction in neonatal resuscitation and basic life support skills. Infection prevention and control, helping babies breathe, and effective communication were identified as key learnings. Recommendations for future training included facilitation skills, nutrition, and research. Although 10 (40%) participants organised step down trainings, limited funding and training materials were key barriers to step down.Conclusion The NCSL training programme has the potential for promoting and strengthening safe perioperative nursing care. Strategic efforts are needed to scale up and expand access to this training within the wider perioperative nursing community, to enhance patient safety and surgical outcomes in the setting.

TI  - Identifying high-risk hospitalised chronic kidney disease patient using electronic health records for serious illness conversation
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to identify risk factors that are associated with increased mortality that could prompt a serious illness conversation (SIC) among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: The electronic health records of adult CKD patients admitted between August 2018 and February 2020 were retrospectively reviewed to identify CKD patients with >1 hospitalisation and length of hospital stay >4 days. Outcome measures were mortality and the duration of hospitalisation. We also assessed the utility of the Cohen's model to predict 6-month mortality among CKD patients. Results: A total of 442 patients (mean age 68.6 years) with median follow-up of 15.3 months were identified. The mean (standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] was 6.8 +/- 2.0 with 48.4% on chronic dialysis. The overall mortality rate until August 2020 was 36.7%. Mortality was associated with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.77), CCI> 7 (1.58, 1.08-2.30), lower serum albumin (1.09, 1.06-1.11), readmission within 30-day (1.96, 1.43-2.68) and CKD non-dialysis (1.52, 1.04-2.17). Subgroup analysis of the patients within first 6-month from index admission revealed longer hospitalisation stay for those who died (CKD-non dialysis: 5.5; CKD-dialysis: 8.0 versus 4 days for those survived, P<0.001). The Cohen's model demonstrated reasonable predictive ability to discriminate 6-month mortality (area under the curve 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87). Only 24 (5.4%) CKD patients completed advanced care planning. Conclusion: CCI, serum albumin and recent hospital readmission could identify CKD patients at higher risk of mortality who could benefit from a serious illness conversation.

TI  - Cardiovascular Complications and Their Association With Mortality in Patients With Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread availability of plasmapheresis, the mortality in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura remains high. Cardiovascular complications have been reported as an important cause of morbidity in these patients. The burden and prognostic implications of these complications have not been well studied. We analyzed the rates of cardiovascular complications in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, temporal trends, and studied its impact on in-hospital mortality.
   METHODS: We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from January 2005 to September 2015 to identify adult patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. This group was further refined by excluding patients who did not receive therapeutic plasmapheresis, and other conditions that can mimic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We identified the age- and sex-stratified rates of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac conduction system disorders, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and stroke. We also compared in-hospital mortality with and without cardiovascular complications.
   RESULTS: Among 15,054 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura hospitalizations (mean age 46.4 years, 69% in the 18- to 54-age group, 66.2% women, and 42.9% white), a cardiovascular complication was observed in 3802 (25.3%) hospitalizations. The following cardiovascular complications were identified: stroke (10.4%), heart failure (8.3%), acute coronary syndrome (6.4%), atrial tachyarrhythmia (5.9%), ventricular tachyarrhythmia (2.0%), cardiogenic shock (0.5%), takotsubo cardiomyopathy (0.1%), atrioventricular block (0.2%), myocarditis or pericarditis (0.3), and cardiac arrest (1.9%). Rates of several cardiovascular complications were significantly higher in patients 55 years or older compared to a younger age group, whereas males had higher rates of acute coronary syndrome and tachyarrhythmias compared to females. Overall, the cardiovascular complication rate was stable during the study period. The presence of a major cardiovascular complication was associated with a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (19.7%) as compared with no major cardiovascular complication (4.1%) (adjusted odds ratio 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.41-3.09, P < 0.001). Results were generally consistent in age and sex subgroups.
   CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular complications were frequently observed at a rate of 1 in 4 in patients hospitalized for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and were associated with substantially higher in-hospital mortality. These findings underscore the need to promptly identify and treat these complications to improve outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multicenter Canadian study of prehospital trauma care
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
AB  - Objective. To evaluate whether the type of on-site care a trauma patient receives affects outcome.
   Summary Background Data. The controversy regarding the prehospital care of trauma patients between Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic Life Support (BLS) is ongoing. Due to this unresolved controversy, as well as historical, cultural, and political factors, there are significant variations with respect to the type of prehospital care available for trauma patients.
   Methods. This prospective cohort study compared three types of prehospital trauma care systems: Montreal, where physicians provide ALS (MD-ALS); Toronto, where paramedics provide ALS (PMD-ALS); and Quebec City, where emergency medical technicians provide BLS only (EMT-BLS). The study took advantage of this variation to evaluate the association between the type of on-site care and mortality in patients with major life-threatening injuries. All patients were treated at highly specialized tertiary (level I) trauma hospitals. The main outcome measure was death as a result of injury. Follow-up was to hospital discharge.
   Results. The overall mortality rates by type of on-site personnel were physicians 35%, paramedics 24%, and EMTs 18%. For patients with major but survivable trauma, the overall mortality rates were physicians 32%, paramedics 28%, and EMTs 26%. The overall mortality rate of patients receiving only BLS at the scene was 18% compared to 29% for patients receiving ALS. For the subgroup of patients with major but survivable injuries, the mortality rates were 30% for ALS and 26% for BLS. The adjusted increased risk for mortality in patients receiving AILS at the scene was 21 %.
   Conclusions. In urban centers with highly specialized level I trauma centers, there is no benefit in having on-site ALS for the prehospital management of trauma patients.

TI  - Association of Advance Directives Completion With the Utilization of Life-Sustaining Treatments During the End-of-Life Care in Older Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Context. Evidence is mixed regarding the impact of advance directives (ADs) on the utilization of end-of-life treatments.
   Objectives. This study evaluated the effect of AD on the utilization of end-of-life treatments during the last month of life in older patients.
   Methods. Taipei City Hospital initiated an advance care planning program to promote AD for admitted patients in 2015. This prospective study recruited deceased older patients who completed advance care planning communication between 2015 and 2016. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of AD completion with utilization of life-sustaining treatments.
   Results. Of 1307 deceased older patients, overall mean age was 84.1 years and 78.7% of the subjects had AD completion. During the study follow-up period, 31 older patients received life-sustaining treatments during the last month of life, including 17 patients (1.7%) with AD completion and 14 patients (5.0%) without AD completion. After adjusting for the sociodemographic factors and co-morbidities, older patients with AD completion were less likely to receive life-sustaining treatments during the last month of life (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.67). Considering type of life-sustaining treatments, AD completion was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06-0.70) as well as intubation and mechanical ventilation support (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.70) during the last month of life in older patients.
   Conclusion. AD completion was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving life-sustaining treatments during the last month of life in older patients. These findings support the continued use of AD in older population. (C) 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Association of Rapid Response Teams With Hospital Mortality in Medicare Patients
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: Although rapid response teams have been widely promoted as a strategy to reduce unexpected hospital deaths, most studies of rapid response teams have not adjusted for secular trends in mortality before their implementation. We examined whether implementation of a rapid response team was associated with a reduction in hospital mortality after accounting for preimplementation mortality trends. Methods: Among 56 hospitals in Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation linked to Medicare, we calculated the annual rates of case mix-adjusted mortality for each hospital during 2000 to 2014. We constructed a hierarchical log-binomial regression model of mortality over time (calendar-year), incorporating terms to capture the effect of rapid response teams, to determine whether implementation of rapid response teams was associated with reduction in hospital mortality that was larger than expected based on preimplementation trends, while adjusting for hospital case mix index. Results: The median annual number of Medicare admissions was 5214 (range, 408-18 398). The median duration of preimplementation and postimplementation period was 7.6 years (approximate to 2.5 million admissions) and 7.2 years (approximate to 2.6 million admissions), respectively. Hospital mortality was decreasing by 2.7% annually during the preimplementation period. Implementation of rapid response teams was not associated with a change in mortality during the initial year (relative risk for model intercept, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]; P=0.30) or in the mortality trend (relative risk for model slope, 1.01 per year [95% CI, 0.99-1.02]; P=0.30). Among individual hospitals, implementation of a rapid response team was associated with a lower-than-expected mortality at only 4 (7.1%) and higher-than-expected mortality at 2 (3.7%) hospitals. Conclusions: Among a large and diverse sample of US hospitals, we did not find implementation of rapid response teams to be associated with reduction in hospital mortality. Studies are needed to understand best practices for rapid response team implementation, to ensure that hospital investment in these teams improves patient outcomes.

T2  - PEDIATRICS AND NEONATOLOGY
AB  - Background Pulmonary air leak may cause serious complications and mortality in neonates, especially preterm infants. Its incidence and perinatal risk factors in preterm infants might differ from those in term infants. We investigated the incidence, perinatal risk factors and morbidities associated with pulmonary air leak in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants in Taiwan. Methods Data from 2011 to 2015 from the nationwide multihospital registry of the Taiwan Premature Infant Follow-up Network were analyzed. Preterm infants with pulmonary air leak, including pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, were enrolled. Data on perinatal characteristics, the course of resuscitation in the delivery room, the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and the clinical outcomes of pulmonary air leak were collected and compared between VLBW preterm infants with and without pulmonary air leak. Results We included 5906 VLBW preterm infants with a mean gestational age of 28.6 +/- 3 weeks and mean birth weight of 1078 +/- 284 g. Of them, 379 neonates (6.4%) had pulmonary air leak, with 5.4% and 1% having isolated pneumothorax and isolated pneumomediastinum, respectively. Independent risk factors for pulmonary air leak in VLBW preterm infants were male sex, a 5-min Apgar score <7, and RDS treated with surfactant. VLBW preterm infants who had higher gestational age or received nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) had a lower risk of pulmonary air leak. However, pulmonary air leak was associated with higher rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, and mortality. Conclusions NCPAP appeared to protect against pulmonary air leak in VLBW preterm infants. Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors for pulmonary air leak in such infants and promptly initiate meticulous ventilation strategies as needed.

TI  - Management of Seat Belt-type Blunt Abdominal Aortic Trauma and Associated Injuries in Pediatric Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY
CP  - 43rd Annual Meeting of the Midwestern-Vascular-Surgical-Society (MVSS)
AB  - Background: "Seat belt-type"pediatric abdominal aortic trauma is uncommon but potentially lethal. During high speed motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), seat or lap belt restraints may concentrate forces in a band-like pattern across the abdomen, resulting in the triad of hollow viscus perforation, spine fracture, and aortoiliac injury. We report 4 cases of pediatric seat belt-type aortic trauma and review management strategies for the aortic disruption and the associated constellation of injuries.
   Methods: -approved, retrospective review of all pediatric patients requiring surgical intervention for seat belt-type constellation of abdominal aortic/iliac and associated injuries over a 5 year period. Blunt thoracic aortic injuries were excluded.
   Results: We identified 4 patients, ranging from 2 to 17 years of age, who required surgical correction of seat belt-type aortoiliac trauma and associated injuries: 3 abdominal aortas and 1 left common iliac artery. The majority (3/4 patients) were hemodynamically unstable at emergency room presentation, and all underwent computed tomography angiography of the chest/abdomen/pelvis during initial resuscitation. Injuries of the suprarenal and proximal infrarenal aorta were accompanied by unilateral renal artery avulsion requiring nephrectomy. Presumed or proven spinal instability mandated supine positioning and midline laparotomy, with medial visceral rotation utilized for proximal injuries. Aortoiliac injuries requiring repair were accompanied by significant distal intraluminal prolapse of dissected intima, with varying degrees of obstruction. Conduit selection was dictated by the presence of enteric contamination and the rapid availability of an autologous conduit. The sole neurologic deficit was irreparable at presentation.
   Conclusions: Seat belt aortoiliac injuries in pediatric patients require prompt multidisciplinary evaluation. Evidence of contained aortoiliac transection, major branch vessel avulsion, and bowel perforation mandates immediate exploration, which generally precedes spinal interventions. Lesser degrees of aortoiliac injuries have been managed with surveillance, but longterm follow-up is needed to fully validate this approach.

TI  - Identifying potential three key targets gene for septic shock in children using bioinformatics and machine learning methods
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Background Septic shock in children is an infectious disease caused by low immunity, and its mortality is very high. Early prediction of the risk of death in children with septic shock is helpful for clinicians to judge the severity of the disease, take active treatment measures, and improve the adverse outcomes of patients. However, the mechanism of death from sepsis in children remains unclear. This study aims to use bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms to identify key genes and pathways associated with fatal sepsis in children, and provide theoretical basis for rational drug use in follow-up TCM treatment.Methods Gene expression profiles were obtained from the GEO database (GSE4607) for 15 blank patients and 14 children with sepsis death. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched by GO and KEGG pathways. Construct and visualize protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify candidate genes responsible for fatal sepsis in children. Three kinds of machine learning models were established, and the candidate genes were screened by intersection to obtain the core genes with diagnostic value. ROC curve was drawn for core genes to clarify the diagnostic value of genetic markers.Results Analysis of differences in the preprocessed dataset identified 83 genes, including 78 up-regulated genes and 5 down-regulated genes. 17 candidate genes were screened by protein interaction network analysis. Three machine learning algorithms LASSO, random forest (RF), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) were used to finally screen out three core genes: CD163, MCEMP1 and RETN. CD163, MCEMP1 and RETN may jointly regulate complement and coagulation cascades, toll like receptor signaling pathway, graft versus host disease, type I diabetes mellitus.Conclusion In this study, three core genes (CD163, MCEMP1 and RETN) that lead to sepsis death in children were screened out, providing a new understanding of the lethal mechanism of sepsis in children and a promising new therapeutic approach.

TI  - A video-supported nurse-led advance care planning on end-of-life decision-making among frail older patients: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim To examine the effect of a video-supported nurse-led advance care planning to frail geriatric patients on end-of-life decision-making outcomes in patients and their carers. Design This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with parallel arms. Methods The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating hospital on 1 August 2018. Frail elders and their carer if any are enrolled during hospitalization, and undergo randomization after discharged. The intervention group receives a 2-week video-supported nurse-led advance care planning programme (N = 149) while the control group receives a 2-week health education program at home (N = 149). Follow-up surveys via telephone at 1 and 6 months measure outcomes regarding end-of-life decision-making from both the patients and the carers. Conclusion Advance care planning discussion is to understand patient's values, preferences and treatment for care on their anticipation of future deterioration. Treatment options for end-of-life care may not be well-received especially elders because in the discussion process, technical medical terms are presented in an abstract, hypothetical way that are hard to understand. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of a nurse-led advance care planning supplementing with a video showing end-of-life treatment options to promote end-of-life care decision-making among frail geriatric patients. Impact The results will help identify effective elements of advance care planning and inform the development of an evidence?based structured advance care planning intervention in response to the need for quality end-of-life care.

TI  - Characteristics, in-hospital management, and complications of acute myocardial infarction in northern and Central Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Contemporary data on the epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Vietnam are extremely limited.
   Methods: We established population-based registries of residents from 2 provinces in a northern urban (Hai Phong), and a central rural (Thanh Hoa), province of Vietnam hospitalized with a validated first AMI in 2018. We described patient characteristics, in-hospital management and clinical complications, and estimated incidence rates of AMI in these two registries.
   Results: A total of 785 patients (mean age = 71.2 years, 64.7% men) were admitted to the two hospitals with a validated first AMI. Approximately 64% of the AMI cases were ST-segment-elevation AMI. Patients from Thanh Hoa compared with Hai Phong were more likely to delay seeking acute hospital care. The incidence rates (per 100,000 population) of initial AMI in Thanh Hoa and Hai Phong were 16 and 30, respectively. Most patients were treated with aspirin (Thanh Hoa: 96%; Hai Phong: 90%) and statins (both provinces: 91%) during their hospitalization. A greater proportion of patients in Hai Phong (69%) underwent percutaneous revascularization than those in Thanh Hoa (58%). The most common in-hospital complications were heart failure (both provinces:12%), cardiogenic shock (Thanh Hoa: 10%; Hai phong: 7%); and cardiac arrest (both provinces: 9%). The in-hospital case-fatality rates for patients from Thanh Hoa and Hai Phong were 6.8% and 3.8%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The incidence and hospital case-fatality rates of AMI were low in two Vietnamese provinces. Extent of pre-hospital delay and in-hospital use of evidence-based therapies were suboptimal, being more prominent in the rural province.

TI  - Self-efficacy in pediatric resuscitation: Implications for education and performance
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Objective. This article examines the relevance of self-efficacy-a cognitive process indicating people's confidence in their ability to effect a given behavior-to training and performance of pediatric resuscitation. The case is made that self-efficacy is likely to influence the development of and real-time access to cognitive, affective, psychomotor, and social aspects of resuscitation proficiency.
   Methods. Comprehensive literature reviews were conducted on relevant topic areas, including self-efficacy theory and empirical investigations of self-efficacy in clinical practice. Three case studies are used to illustrate the influence of self-efficacy on resuscitation practice.
   Results. The limited empirical evidence on the role of self-efficacy in clinical practice is consistent with self-efficacy theory: clinicians are less likely to initiate and sustain behaviors for which they lack confidence. This performance-based confidence can be distinguished from both knowledge and skills necessary to perform the behavior.
   Conclusions. Even clinicians who are knowledgeable and skilled in resuscitation techniques may fail to apply them successfully unless they have an adequately strong belief in their capability. General guidelines for promoting self-efficacy are presented, and specific recommendations are made for enhancing resuscitation self-efficacy during resuscitation training and postresuscitation procedures.

TI  - Analysis of outcomes and prognostic factor in acute type A aortic dissection complicated with preoperative shock: A single-center study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background<br /> Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a critical cardiovascular emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention for preserving life, particularly in patients with critical preoperative status. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical features, early and late outcomes, and prognostic factors in patients undergoing aortic repair surgery for ATAAD complicated with preoperative shock. Methods<br /> Between April 2007 and July 2020, 694 consecutive patients underwent emergency ATAAD repair at our institution, including 162 (23.3%) presenting with preoperative shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), who were classified into the survivor (n = 125) and non-survivor (n = 37) groups according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. The clinical demographics, surgical information, and postoperative complications were compared. Five-year survival and freedom from reoperation rates of survivors were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Results<br /> The in-hospital surgical mortality rate in patients with ATAAD and shock was 22.8%. The non-survivor group showed higher rates of preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, and was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, higher rates of total arch replacement and intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implementation. The non-survivor group had higher blood transfusion volumes and rates of malperfusion-related complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and total arch replacement were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. For patients who survived to discharge, the 5-year cumulative survival and freedom from aortic reoperation rates were 75.6% (95% confidence interval, 67.6%-83.6%) and 82.6% (95% confidence interval, 74.2%-91.1%), respectively. Conclusions<br /> Preoperative shock in ATAAD is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients who undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation and complex aortic repair procedures with extended cardiopulmonary bypass. However, late outcomes are acceptable for patients who were stabilized through surgical treatment and survived to discharge.

TI  - Diverse perspectives on death, disability, and quality of life: an exploratory study of racial differences in periviable decision-making
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective To qualitatively explore perceptions of pain/suffering, disability, and coping by race among pregnant women facing the threat of a periviable delivery (22 0/7-24 6/7 weeks). Study design Interviews were conducted in-hospital prior to delivery. Transcripts were coded verbatim and responses were stratified by race (white vs non-white). Conventional content analysis was conducted using NVivo 12. Results We recruited 30 women (50% white, 50% non-white). Most women expressed love and acceptance of their babies and described pain as a "means to an end." Non-white women focused almost exclusively on immediate survival and perseverance, while white women expressed concerns about quality of life beyond the NICU. The majority of non-white women were unable to recall any discussions with their doctors about their baby's comfort, pain, or suffering. Conclusions These findings may suggest that culturally tailored approaches to counseling and decision-support may be beneficial for patients from marginalized or minoritized groups.

TI  - Make vital signs great again - A call for action
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Vital signs are the simplest, cheapest and probably the most important information gathered on patients in hospital. In this narrative review we present a large amount of evidence that vital signs are currently little valued, not regularly or accurately recorded, and frequently not acted on appropriately. It is probable that few hospitals would keep their accreditation with regulatory bodies if they collected and acted on their laboratory results in the same way that they collect and act on vital signs. Professional societies and regulatory bodies need to address this issue: if vital signs were more accurately and frequently measured, and acted on promptly and appropriately hospital care would be safer, better and cheaper.

TI  - Family presence during invasive procedures and resuscitations in the emergency department: A critical review and suggestions for future research
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: We examine the literature relating to family presence in the emergency department, with a specific emphasis on parental experiences and presence during invasive procedures and family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation.
   Methods: An electronic search and examination of resulting references was conducted using the words, "family centered care," "parent participation," "parent presence," "family presence," and "emergency department," "accident and emergency department," "procedure," "invasive procedure," and "resuscitation." Articles related to out-of-hospital emergency medical services were excluded. Also, articles were included only if the manuscript was based on an empirical study and if the manuscript was published in a peer-reviewed journal.
   Results: Twenty articles, primarily composed of survey research, were included in this review. Research suggests that families want to be given the option and, when given the option, often choose to remain during invasive procedures and resuscitations. Those who remain generally report favorable experiences and feel it is beneficial to the patient and themselves. Providers, however, have mixed opinions regarding family presence. Nurses may have a more favorable view toward family presence during invasive procedures than physicians. Among physicians, it appears that greater age and experience may be associated with more favorable opinions of family presence. Randomized controlled trials are mixed regarding whether family presence actually helps the patient.
   Conclusion: Despite what appear to be promising data regarding the benefits of family presence, this area of research is in the initial phases of development with many limitations that are discussed. Recommendations for future research are presented.

TI  - ICD: a qualitative study of patient experience the first year after implantation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Background. The experiences of how patients live with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator are still poorly understood. Only a few qualitative studies have investigated this phenomenon. This paper was undertaken as part of a larger project to evaluate quality of life and psychological well-being in those survivors of cardiac arrest who have received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
   Aims and objectives. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore how implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients perceive their lives during the first year after implantation of the device.
   Methods. A sample of 21 patients who received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was interviewed during three consecutive periods: one, six and 12 months postdischarge from the hospital. The semi-structured interviews were based on insights gained from a literature review. The transcripts were subjected to content analysis.
   Results. Analysis of the data revealed seven major categories: physical deterioration, cognitive changes, perceived social support, dependency, contact with the doctor, confrontation with mortality and uncertainty surrounding having a shock. Anxiety, uncertainty, disappointment, frustration, unexpected barriers, acceptance of and dependency on the implantable cardioverter defibrillator played a major role in the lives of implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients. Well-being improved throughout the year. During the first months after discharge from the hospital the focus was on regaining physical health. During the early postimplantation period both the implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipient and family members had adapted to the situation. Reflection on the impact and consequences of the cardiac arrest was reported more often in the late postimplantation period.
   Conclusions. Content analysis is a resourceful approach giving answers to questions that have hardly been addressed within the domain of cardiology. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients face a complex first year, especially the first 6 months. Cognitive deterioration and confrontation with mortality are problems that need to be researched further.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Caregivers are able to explain to future patients what they can expect in the first year after implantation. Caregivers may become more receptive to physical, psychological and social limitations and to emotional and social problems that occur in implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients, enabling them to act upon them.

TI  - Temporary Mechanical Circulatory Support in Cardiogenic Shock due to ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Analysis of the National Readmissions Database
T2  - ANGIOLOGY
AB  - Despite advances in temporary mechanical circulatory support (TMCS), in-hospital mortality and morbidity related to cardiogenic shock due to ST elevation myocardial infarction (CS-STEMI) are highly prevalent. We identified admissions with CS-STEMI between 2016 and 2019 from the National Readmission Database (NRD). Among 80 997 patients with CS-STEMI, we identified 42,139 without TMCS, while the remaining received various types of TMCS (Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO] alone: n = 753; Intra-aortic balloon pump [IABP] alone: n = 27 556; Impella alone: n = 9055; ECMO with IABP or Impella: n = 1494). 30-day readmission rates did not differ among groups, whereas 90-day readmissions were higher among those with combined ECMO and IABP or Impella support (P = .027). In-hospital mortality and complications including hemodialysis, transfusion, and stroke were the highest in the Impella and combined ECMO and IABP/Impella groups. Heart failure was the most common cause of readmission. Multivariable logistic regression revealed female gender, diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney, and peripheral artery disease as risk factors for 90-day readmissions. Our study unveiled several important factors associated with readmission and mortality related to TMCS in CS-STEMI. Approaches to identify and prevent readmissions by addressing these factors may lead to lower morbidity, healthcare cost related to readmission, and improved quality of life.

TI  - Rapid non-invasive external cooling to induce mild therapeutic hypothermia in adult human-sized swine
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: Mild therapeutic hypothermia is a promising new therapy for patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Early and fast induction of hypothermia seems to be crucial for best results. The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility and safety of a new surface cooling method using cold metal plates.
   Subjects and methods: Twelve adult human-sized swine (79 +/- 9 kg) were cooled from 38 to 33 degrees C brain temperature. The skin surface was covered with -20 degrees C metal plates (M), as compared to ice packs, alcohol rubs, and fans used in a control group (C). Each method was tested during spontaneous circulation and, after re-warming, during cardiac arrest. Temperatures were recorded continuously. Data are given as mean standard deviation or as median (interquartile range), if not normally distributed. Comparisons between the treatment groups were performed with the independent samples t-test, or the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test.
   Results: During spontaneous circulation, cooling rates were 9.3 +/- 1.4 degrees C/h (M), and 6.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C/h (C) (p=0.003); no skin lesions were observed. During cardiac arrest, cooling rates were 4.1 degrees C/h (1.8-4.8) (M), and 3.7 degrees C/h (3.1-5.3) (C) (p=0.9); no skin lesions were observed. Conclusion: Cooling with cold metal plates was an effective method for rapid induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia in adult human-sized swine during spontaneous circulation, without any signs of skin damage. This new surface-cooling device, independent of energy supply during use, should be further investigated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cognitive sequelae of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: A review
T2  - NEUROREHABILITATION
AB  - Despite improvements in the pre-hospital and critical care management of persons with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HI-BI) and the conditions with which it is associated, acute and chronic cognitive impairments remain problems for many survivors of such injuries. Disorders of consciousness, attention, speed of processing, and memory impairments, and executive dysfunction are among the most prominent and common disturbances of cognition after HI-BI. Acute interventions, including therapeutic hypothermia, may improve global outcomes after HI-BI, but their specific effects on post-hypoxic cognitive impairments remain uncertain. Additionally, treatments for cognitive impairments after HI-BI are underdeveloped and are generally arrived at by analogy to the treatment of such problems arising from other neurological conditions, especially traumatic brain injury. In the service of offering a practical approach to the evaluation and care of persons with cognitive impairments after HI-BI, the most common types of post-hypoxic cognitive impairments are reviewed. Cognitive outcomes after HI-BI are discussed and suggestions for the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic neurorehabilitation of these problems are offered.

TI  - Depression and anxiety as predictors of 2-year cardiac events in patients with stable coronary artery disease
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Context: Anxiety and depression are associated with mechanisms that promote atherosclerosis. Most recent studies of emotional disturbances in coronary artery disease (CAD) have focused on depression only.
   Objective: To assess the 2-year cardiac prognostic importance of the DSM-IV-based diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and self-report measures of anxiety and depression and their co-occurrence.
   Design, Setting, and Patients: Two-year follow-up of 804 patients with stable CAD (649 men) assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (masked to self-reports) 2 months after acute coronary syndromes.
   Main Outcome Measures: Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or nonelective revascularization) in the 2 years after baseline.
   Results: Of the 804 patients, 57 (7.1%) met the criteria for MDD and 43 (5.3%) for GAD (11 [1.4%] had comorbidity); 220 (27.4%) had elevated BDI-II scores (>= 14), and 333 (41.4%) had elevated HADS-A scores (>= 8), with 21.1% overlap. MDD (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-5.01), GAD (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.08-4.05), elevated BDI-II (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.21-2.54), elevated HADS-A score (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18-2.37), and continuous standardized scores on the BDI-II (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62) and the HADS-A (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.63) all predicted MACEs. After covariate control, only the P value associated with the continuous BDI-II score increased to above.10. Most of the risk associated with elevated symptoms was in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, patients with comorbid MDD and GAD or elevated anxiety and depression symptoms were not at greater MACE risk than those with only 1 factor.
   Conclusion: Anxiety and depression predict greater MACE risk in patients with stable CAD, supporting future research into common genetic, environmental, and pathophysiologic pathways and treatments.

TI  - Acute Liver Failure During Early Pregnancy-Case Report and Review of Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background/Objectives: This article presents the case of a 31-year-old primigravida who experienced acute liver failure in the 23rd week of pregnancy, along with a review of the literature on this rare condition during pregnancy. The purpose of this publication is to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with acute liver failure in pregnant women. Methods: The patient presented with jaundice, pruritus, and dark-colored urine. Laboratory tests revealed a significant increase in aminotransferase, bilirubin, and bile acid levels, suggesting liver problems; however, due to the patient's rapidly deteriorating condition and test results, autoimmune hepatitis was considered. Viral infections and other causes of liver damage were excluded. No clear diagnosis was established. The patient was administered ursodeoxycholic acid and due to her worsening condition, a cesarean section was performed at 23 weeks of gestation. After delivery, the patient's condition improved, although she did experience cardiac arrest during hospitalization. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of acute liver failure in the course of an overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary cholangitis or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. No abnormalities were noted during a follow-up visit 6 weeks after delivery. Despite a detailed case analysis, a final diagnosis was not established, which complicates planning for future pregnancies. Discussion: Several liver conditions can occur during pregnancy, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, primary biliary cholangitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Diagnosing these conditions can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms and metabolic and immunological adaptations during pregnancy that can affect the course of liver diseases. Rapid intervention is crucial to protect the health of both the mother and the fetus. Conclusions: In summary, this article aims to increase awareness of the complexities surrounding acute liver failure during pregnancy, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and importance of prompt medical intervention for the well-being of both the mother and the child. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the complexities surrounding acute liver failure during pregnancy, aiming to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and management of this condition.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Timely arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) is pivotal for effective prehospital care, and efforts by EMS leaders and policymakers to reduce response times, especially in cardiac arrests responsible for 70%-80% of coronary heart disease-related deaths, underscore the global urgency. With approximately 55 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests per 100 000 people annually, survival rates hinge on timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emphasising its initiation within a 4-6 min window. Trauma, causing 6 million deaths and nearly 40 million injuries a year, further underscores the need for prompt prehospital care. Acknowledging these challenges, health systems have incorporated community first responder (CFR) models, where trained community members provide initial aid, aiming to bridge the crucial gap until professional help arrives. This scoping review intends to explore the experiences of various countries with CFR models, including their conceptual and theoretical frameworks, recognising CFR as a critical solution for reducing response times in prehospital emergency care. Methods and analysis Arksey and O'Malley's approach will be followed in this scoping review. Our protocol was drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols extension for Scoping Reviews. The study objective is to comprehensively understand and map current knowledge about CFR model characteristics and identify effective components and indicators. The review will encompass available articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science without restrictions on date of publication. Additional searches will explore grey literature on Google Scholar and reliable websites in the field of EMS. Articles published in languages other than English and those inaccessible in full text will not be considered for inclusion. Ethics and dissemination Since the study data are accessible from publicly accessible secondary sources, no ethical approval is necessary. Peer-reviewed publications will be used to report the study findings.

TI  - A case report of a brain herniation secondary to cryptococcal meningitis with elevated intracranial pressure in a patient with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
T2  - IDCASES
AB  - Background: Cryptococcal meningitis is a major opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV. The worldwide annual incidence is estimated to be approximately one million cases per year, with the most significant burden in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis continues to have a high mortality rate despite widespread availability and use of HAART. Case: 36-year-old male with a past medical history of AIDS and a CD4 count of 35 cells/mm3 presented with altered mental status initially thought to be related to using crystalline methamphetamine as reported by EMS. However, a lumbar puncture performed in the emergency department showed elevated CSF opening pressure of 29 cmH2O and positive CSF and serum cryptococcal antigen. The patient was admitted and commenced treatment according to the current IDSA guideline but continued to have waxing and waning mental status. On the fourth day of admission, he complained of headache, had a witnessed seizure, and was taken emergently for a CT scan of the brain, which was negative for any acute intracranial process, but suffered a cardiac arrest before it could be done. He was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. CT brain follow-up showed anoxic encephalopathy, development of marked cerebral edema, and complete effacement of the basilar cisterns, suggestive of downward transtentorial herniation; he continued to deteriorate and expired on the seventh day of admission.Objectives:1. Describe a case of brain death secondary to increased intracranial pressure due to cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with HIV/AIDS.2. Explain the mechanisms of elevation in intracranial pressure in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.3. Discuss the options for managing elevated intracranial pressure in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.4. Create awareness in the medical community about the importance of prompt and efficient management of increased intracranial pressure in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of aggressive management of elevated intracranial pressure in cryptococcal meningitis. It reiterates the need for more data regarding the optimal timing and frequency of therapeutic lumbar puncture and the use of temporary lumbar drainage catheters and ventriculostomy to manage this potentially fatal complication.

TI  - Oximetry-guided reoxygenation improves neurological outcome after experimental cardiac arrest
T2  - STROKE
AB  - Background and Purpose - Current guidelines suggest that cardiac arrest (CA) survivors should be ventilated with 100% O-2 after resuscitation. Breathing 100% O-2 may worsen neurological outcome after experimental CA. This study tested the hypothesis that graded reoxygenation, with oximetry guidance, can safely reduce FiO(2) after resuscitation, avoiding hypoxia while promoting neurological recovery.
   Methods - Mature dogs underwent 10 minutes of CA and restoration of spontaneous circulation with 100% O-2. Animals were randomized to 1-hour additional ventilation on 100% FiO(2) or to rapid lowering of arterial O-2 saturation to < 96% but < 94% with pulse oximeter guidance. Animals were awakened at hour 23, and the neurological deficit score (0 = normal; 100 = brain-dead) was measured. Reanesthetized animals were perfusion-fixed and the brains removed for histopathology.
   Results - The neurological deficit score was significantly better in oximetry (O) dogs. O dogs appeared aware of their surroundings, whereas most hyperoxic (H) animals were stuporous (neurological deficit score = 43.0 +/- 5.9 [O] versus 61.0 +/- 4.2 [H]; n = 8, P < 0.05). Stereological analysis revealed fewer injured CA1 neurons in O animals (cresyl violet: 35.5 +/- 4.3% [O] versus 60.5 +/- 3.3% [H]; P < 0.05). There were also fewer fluoro-Jade B-stained degenerating CA1 neurons in O animals (3320 +/- 267 [O] versus 6633 +/- 356 [H] per 0.1 mm(3); P < 0.001).
   Conclusions - A clinically applicable protocol designed to reduce postresuscitative hyperoxia after CA results in significant neuroprotection. Clinical trials of controlled normoxia after CA/restoration of spontaneous circulation should strongly be considered.

TI  - PLASMA RESUSCITATION IMPROVED SURVIVAL IN A CECAL LIGATION AND PUNCTURE RAT MODEL OF SEPSIS
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Background: The paradigm shift from crystalloid to plasma resuscitation of traumatic hemorrhagic shock has improved patient outcomes due in part to plasma-mediated reversal of catecholamine and inflammation-induced endothelial injury, decreasing vascular permeability and attenuating organ injury. Since sepsis induces a similar endothelial injury as seen in hemorrhage, we hypothesized that plasma resuscitation would increase 48-h survival in a rat sepsis model. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (375-425 g) were subjected to 35% cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (t = 0 h). Twenty-two hours post-CLP and prior to resuscitation (t = 22 h), animals were randomized to resuscitation with normal saline (NS, 10 cc/kg/h) or pooled rat fresh frozen plasma (FFP, 3.33 cc/kg/h). Resuscitation under general anesthesia proceeded for the next 6 h (t = 22 h to t = 28 h); lactate was checked every 2 h, and fluid volumes were titrated based on lactate clearance. Blood samples were obtained before (t = 22 h) and after resuscitation (t = 28 h), and at death or study conclusion. Lung specimens were obtained for calculation of wet-to-dry weight ratio. Fisher exact test was used to analyze the primary outcome of 48-h survival. ANOVA with repeated measureswas used to analyze the effect of FFP versus NS resuscitation on blood gas, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, catecholamines, and syndecan-1 (marker for endothelial injury). A two-tailed alpha level of < 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. Results: Thirty-three animals were studied: 14 FFP, 14 NS, and 5 sham. Post-CLP but preresuscitation (t = 22 h) variables between FFP and NS animals were similar and significantly deranged compared with sham animals. FFP significantly increased 48-h survival compared to NS (n = 8 [57%] vs n = 2 [14%]), attenuated the post-resuscitation (t = 28 h) levels of epinephrine (mean 2.2 vs 7.0 ng/mL), norepinephrine, (3.8 vs 8.9 ng/mL), IL-6 (3.8 vs 18.7 ng/mL), and syndecan-1 (21.8 vs 31.0 ng/mL) (all P < 0.05), improved the post-resuscitation PO2 to FiO(2) ratio (353 vs 151), and reduced the pulmonary wet-to-dry weight ratio (5.28 vs 5.94) (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared to crystalloid, plasma resuscitation increased 48-h survival in a rat sepsis model, improved pulmonary function and decreased pulmonary edema, and attenuated markers for inflammation, endothelial injury, and catecholamines.

TI  - COMPOSITE OUTCOMES OF CHRONICALLY CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS 4 MONTHS AFTER HOSPITAL DISCHARGE
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Data on likely postdischarge outcomes are important for decision making about chronically critically ill patients. It seems reasonable to categorize outcomes into "better" or overall desirable states and "worse" or generally undesirable states. Survival, being at home, and being cognitively intact are commonly identified as important to quality of life and thus may be combined to describe composite outcome states. Objective To categorize postdischarge outcome states of chronically critically ill patients and identify predictors of better and worse states.
   Methods Reanalysis of data from a trial of a disease management program for chronically critically ill patients. Two composite outcomes were created: (1) the "better" outcome: no cognitive impairment at 2 months after discharge and alive and at home at 4 months (ie, met all 3 criteria), and (2) the "worse" outcome: cognitive impairment 2 months after discharge, or death after discharge, or not living at home 4 months after discharge (ie, met at least 1 of these criteria).
   Results Of 218 patients not requiring ventilatory support at 111 (50.9%) had a better outcome. Of 159 patients were cognitively intact at discharge, 111 (69.8%) had a outcome. Of the 39 patients who required ventilatory at discharge, only 1 (3%) achieved the better outcome. 98 patients who were cognitively impaired at discharge, 29 (30%) had the better outcome.
   Conclusion Need for mechanical ventilatory support and persistent cognitive impairment at discharge were associated with worse outcomes 4 months after discharge. (American Journal of Critical Care. 2009; 18: 456-465)

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Profile of Brain Diffusion- Weighted MRI After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - STROKE
AB  - Background and Purpose-Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is a promising technique to help predict functional outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. We aimed to evaluate prospectively the temporal-spatial profile of brain apparent diffusion coefficient changes in comatose survivors during the first 8 days after cardiac arrest.
   Methods-Apparent diffusion coefficient values were measured by 2 independent and blinded investigators in predefined brain regions in 18 good- and 15 poor-outcome patients with 38 brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and were compared with those of 14 normal controls. The same brain regions were also assessed qualitatively by 2 other independent and blinded investigators.
   Results-In poor-outcome patients, cortical structures, in particular the occipital and temporal lobes, and the putamen exhibited the most profound apparent diffusion coefficient reductions, which were noted as early as 1.5 days and reached a nadir between 3 and 5 days after the arrest. Conversely, when compared with normal controls, good-outcome patients exhibited increased diffusivity, in particular in the hippocampus, temporal and occipital lobes, and corona radiata. By qualitative magnetic resonance imaging readings, 1 or more cortical gray matter structures were judged to be moderately to severely abnormal in all poor-outcome patients except for the 3 patients imaged within 24 hours after the arrest.
   Conclusions-Brain diffusion-weighted imaging changes in comatose, postcardiac arrest survivors in the first week after the arrest are region and time dependent and differ between good- and poor-outcome patients. With increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging in this context, it is important to be aware of these relations. (Stroke. 2010;41:1665-1672.)

TI  - Translation from animal studies of novel pharmacological therapies to clinical trials in cardiac arrest: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: There is a lack of new promising therapies to improve the dismal outcomes from cardiac arrest. The objectives of this study were: (1) To identify novel pharmacological therapies investigated in experimental animal studies and (2) to identify pharmacological therapies translated from experimental animal studies to clinical trials.
   Methods: PubMed was searched to first identify relevant experimental cardiac arrest animal models published within the last 20 years. Based on this, a list of interventions was created and a second search was performed to identify clinical trials testing one of these interventions. Data extraction was performed using standardised data extraction forms.
   Results: We identified 415 animal studies testing 190 different pharmacological interventions. The most commonly tested interventions were classified as vasopressors, anaesthetics/gases, or interventions aimed at molecular targets. We found 43 clinical trials testing 26 different interventions identified in the animal studies. Of these, 13 trials reported positive findings and 30 trials reported neutral findings with regards to the primary endpoint. No study showed harm of the intervention. Some interventions tested in human clinical trials, had previously been tested in animal studies without a positive effect on outcomes. A large number of animal studies was performed after publication of a clinical trial.
   Conclusion: Numerous different pharmacological interventions have been tested in experimental animal models. Despite this only a limited number of these interventions have advanced to clinical trials, however several of the clinical trials tested interventions that were first tested in experimental animal models.

TI  - Ion shift index as a promising prognostic indicator in adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Several studies reported that disturbances in cellular ion homeostasis occur following ischaemia, the magnitude of which was proportional to illness severity. The changes in serum electrolyte levels following ischaemia were minor compared with the changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular fluid. To amplify the serum electrolyte changes, we devised a new index (ion shift index), which could be calculated using commonly measured serum electrolyte levels, and explored its prognostic value in adult cardiac arrest patients.
   Methods: This retrospective observational study included adult cardiac arrest survivors treated at a tertiary university hospital between January 2014 and December 2017. Using the first available serum electrolyte levels, the ion shift index was calculated as follows: ion shift index = (potassium + phosphate + magnesium) / calcium. The primary outcome was poor outcome at hospital discharge (cerebral performance categories 3-5).
   Results:The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ion shift index for predicting poor outcome was 0.878 (95 degrees o confidence interval [CI], 0.849-0.907). The AUC of ion shift index was greater than those of individual electrolytes (all p 0.001). In multivariate analysis, higher ion shift index levels were independently associated with poor outcome (odds ratio, 2.916; 95 degrees 6 CI, 1.798-4.730; p 0.001). The AUC of multivariate model including ion shift index was greater than that of multivariate model after excluding ion shift index (p= 0.007).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the ion shift index can be helpful in the early prognostication of adult cardiac arrest patients.

TI  - Guideline-based and restricted fluid resuscitation strategy in sepsis patients with heart failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To examine whether a fluid resuscitation strategy based on guidelines (at least 30 mL/kg IV crystalloids) vs. a restrictive approach with <30 mL/kg within three hours affects in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis and a history of heart failure (HF).
   Data sources: On 03/07/2023, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus for peer-reviewed papers and abstracts using the PRISMA guidelines.
   Study selection: The language was limited to English. Studies published since 2016 included if they had sepsis patients with a history of HF, or a subgroup of patientswith HF, and in-hospitalmortality data on these patients that did or did notmeet the 30 mL/kg by 3 h (30 x 3) goal. Duplicate studies, studies that focused on a broader period than 3 h from the diagnosis of sepsis or without mortality breakdown for HF patients or with unrelated title/abstract, or without an IRB approval were excluded. Data extraction: In-hospitalmortality datawas taken from the final studies for HF patientswith sepsiswho did or did not meet the 30 x 3 goal.
   Data synthesis: The meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.4 program with ORs as the effect measure. The ProMeta program version 3.0 was used to evaluate the publication bias. Egger's linear regression and Berg andMazumdar's rank correlationwas used to evaluate the publication bias. The resultwas visually represented by a funnel plot. To estimate the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity, the I2 statistic was calculated.
   Results: The search yielded 26,069 records, which were narrowed down to 4 studies. Compared to those who met the 30 x 3 goal, the <30 x 3 group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR= 1.81, 95% CI = 1.13-2.89, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Restrictive fluid resuscitation increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in HF patients with sepsis. More rigorous research is required to determine the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy for this population.

TI  - MEASURING QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION OR STROKE - A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF 4 QUESTIONNAIRES IN THE NETHERLANDS
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Objective - To test in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke the feasibility of four quality of life measurements - the Nottingham health profile (NHP), the heart patients psychological questionnaire (HPPQ), the sickness impact profile (SIP), and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD).
   Design - Subjects were tested and retested after an interval of 14 days: questionnaires were self assessed.
   Subjects - Participants were randomly selected from the Rotterdam stroke data bank (stroke patients; n = 16, mean (SD) age 66.0 (11.0) years and from the population based Rotterdam study (myocardial infarction; n = 20, mean (SD) age 72.7 (7.9) years, controls; n = 17, mean (SD) age 72.8 (7.3) years.
   Measurements and main results - Mean (SD) administration times for the NHP, HPPQ, SIP, and HAD were 7.9 (3.5), 10.5 (4.3), 21.0 (9.8), and 5.5 (2.8) minutes respectively. On average, the test-retest reliability was good, with Spearman correlations ranging from 0.31 to 0.95. In spite of the limited size of the study, all instruments were able to show differences between the study groups. For instance, median SIP total scores for myocardial infarction and stroke patients were 12.4 (interquartile range 7.0-19.1) and 11.4 (5.9-15.4) respectively, compared with 7.7 (3.7-11.3) in the control group (p values of 0.04 and 0.14 respectively).
   Conclusions - This study suggests that use of the four instruments tested may be feasible and reliable for assessing aspects of quality of life in patients with a history of a myocardial infarction or stroke.

TI  - Clinical Effectiveness of Pre-hospital and In-hospital Optimized Emergency Care Procedures for Patients With Acute Craniocerebral Trauma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
AB  - Acute craniocerebral injury is a common traumatic disease in clinical practice, characterized by rapid changes in condition and a high rate of death and disability. Early and effective emergency care throughout the pre-hospital and in-hospital period is the key to reducing the rate of death and disability and promoting the recovery of patients. In this study, we conducted an observational study of 130 patients with acute craniocerebral injury admitted between May 2020 and May 2021. Patients were randomly divided into a regular group and an optimization group of 65 patients each, with patients in the regular group receiving the conventional emergency care model and patients in the optimization group receiving the pre-hospital and in-hospital optimal emergency care process for intervention. In this study, we observed and compared the time taken to arrive at the scene, assess the condition, attend to the patient and provide emergency care, the success rate of emergency care within 48 h, the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) after admission and 1 day before discharge, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) after resuscitation and 1 day before discharge, and the complications of infection, brain herniation, central hyperthermia, and electrolyte disturbances in both groups. We collected and statistically analyzed the recorded data. The results showed that the time taken to arrive at the consultation site, assess the condition, receive the consultation, provide first aid was significantly lower in the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the success rate of treatment was significantly higher in the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05). In both groups, IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 decreased on the day before discharge compared with the day of rescue, with the levels of each index lower in the optimization group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the NIHSS scores decreased and the SF-36 scores increased on the day before discharge compared with the successful rescue in both groups, with the NIHSS scores in the optimization group lower than in the regular group and the SF-36 scores higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall complication rate in the optimization group was significantly lower than that in the regular group (P < 0.05). This shows that optimizing pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency care procedures can significantly shorten the time to emergency care for patients with acute craniocerebral injury, increase the success rate, reduce inflammation, improve neurological function and quality of life, reduce the occurrence of complications, and improve patient prognosis.

TI  - Effects of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health events on work and earnings: a population-based retrospective cohort study
T2  - CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of acute health events can experience lasting reductions in functional status and quality of life, as well as reduced ability to work and earn income. We aimed to assess the effect of acute myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest and stroke on work and earning among working-age people.
   METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we used the Canadian Hospitalization and Taxation Database, which contains linked hospital and income tax data, from 2005 to 2013 to perform difference-in-difference analyses. We matched patients admitted to hospital for acute MI, cardiac arrest or stroke with controls who were not admitted to hospital for these indications. Participants were aged 40-61 years, worked in the 2 years before the event and were alive 3 years after the event. Patients were matched to controls for 11 variables. The primary outcome was working status 3 years postevent. We also assessed earnings change attributable to the event. We matched 19 129 particpants who were admitted to hospital with acute MI, 1043 with cardiac arrest and 4395 with stroke to 1 820 644, 307 375 and 888 481 controls, respectively.
   RESULTS: Fewer of the patients who were admitted to hospital were working 3 years postevent than controls for acute MI (by 5.0 percentage points [pp], 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-5.5), cardiac arrest (by 12.9 pp, 95% CI 10.4-15.3) and stroke (by 19.8 pp, 95% CI 18.5-23.5). Mean (95% CI) earnings declines attributable to the events were $3834 (95% CI 3346-4323) for acute MI, $11 143 (95% CI 8962-13 324) for cardiac arrest, and $13 278 (95% CI 12 301-14 255) for stroke. The effects on income were greater for patients who had lower baseline earnings, comorbid disease, longer hospital length of stay or needed mechanical ventilation. Sex, marital status or self-employment status did not affect income declines.
   INTERPRETATION: Acute MI, cardiac arrest and stroke all resulted in substantial loss in employment and earnings that persisted for at least 3 years after the events. These outcomes have consequences for patients, families, employers and governments. Identification of subgroups at high risk for these losses may assist in targeting interventions, policies and legislation to promote return to work.

TI  - Point prevalence of patients fulfilling MET criteria in ten MET equipped hospitals. The methodology of the RESCUE study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: The RESCUE study examined the prevalence of patients at risk of a medical emergency in acute care settings by assessing the prevalence of cases where patients fulfil the hospital-specific criteria for MET activation. This article will detail the study methodology including the ethics applications and approvals process, organisational preparation, research staff training, tools for data collection, as well as barriers encountered during the conduct of the study.
   Design and Setting: A point prevalence design conducted at 10 hospitals, comprising of private and public, secondary and tertiary referral, ICU equipped, metropolitan and regional settings. Patients: All inpatients were eligible except intensive care and psychiatric patients.
   Measurement and main results: On a single day consenting inpatients in each hospital had a single set of vital signs obtained, their observation chart reviewed and followed up for MET activations, unplanned ICU admissions, cardiac arrests and 30 and 60 day mortality. Of 2199 eligible patients, 1688 (76.76%) were assessed, 175 (7.95%) refused consent and 336 (15.28%) were unavailable. Access to patients was refused in some wards despite ethics approval. Data collection required 2 student nurses approximately 14 min per patient assessment.
   Conclusion: In conducting a large multi-site point prevalence study, critical organisational processes were shown to influence the access to patients. This study demonstrated the impact of variation in Human Research Ethics Committee interpretations of protocols on consenting processes and the importance of communication and leadership at ward level to promote access to patients.

TI  - Prediction of in-hospital mortality after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using an artificial neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) carries a high mortality rate, even with prompt transfer to a medical center. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that improves predictive ability through pattern recognition while continually adapting to new input data. The goal of this study was to effectively use ANN modeling to provide vascular surgeons a discriminant adjunct to assess the likelihood of in-hospital mortality on a pending rAAA admission using easily obtainable patient information from the field.
   Methods: Of 332 total patients from a single institution from 1998 to 2013 who had attempted rAAA repair, 125 were reviewed for preoperative factors associated with in-hospital mortality; 108 patients received an open operation, and 17 patients received endovascular repair. Five variables were found significant on multivariate analysis (P < .05), and four of these five (preoperative shock, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and age) were modeled by multiple logistic regression and an ANN. These predictive models were compared against the Glasgow Aneurysm Score. All models were assessed by generation of receiver operating characteristic curves and actual vs predicted outcomes plots, with area under the curve and Pearson r(2) value as the primary measures of discriminant ability.
   Results: Of the 125 patients, 53 (42%) did not survive to discharge. Five preoperative factors were significant (P < .05) independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis: advanced age, renal disease, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and shock, although renal disease was excluded from the models. The sequential accumulation of zero to four of these risk factors progressively increased overall mortality rate, from 11% to 16% to 44% to 76% to 89% (age >= 70 years considered a risk factor). Algorithms derived from multiple logistic regression, ANN, and Glasgow Aneurysm Score models generated area under the curve values of 0.85 +/- 0.04, 0.88 +/- 0.04 (training set), and 0.77 +/- 0.06 and Pearson r(2) values of .36, .52 and .17, respectively. The ANN model represented the most discriminant of the three.
   Conclusions: An ANN-based predictive model may represent a simple, useful, and highly discriminant adjunct to the vascular surgeon in accurately identifying those patients who may carry a high mortality risk from attempted repair of rAAA, using only easily definable preoperative variables. Although still requiring external validation, our model is available for demonstration at https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=NN97NM7DTK.

TI  - Buffered salt solution versus 0.9% sodium chloride as fluid therapy for patients presenting with moderate to severe diabetic ketoacidosis: Study protocol for a Phase-3 cluster-crossover, blinded, randomised, controlled trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The optimal choice of fluid therapy for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is uncertain, though preliminary data suggest that buffered crystalloid solutions (Plasma-Lyte (R) 148) may offer some advantages over 0.9% saline. Objective: To describe the study protocol for the 'Balanced Electrolyte Solution versus Saline Trial for Diabetic Ketoacidosis' (BEST-DKA) trial. Design, setting and participants: BEST-DKA is a Phase 3 cluster-crossover, blinded, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial comparing the effects of saline or buffered crystalloid solution in patients with moderate to severe DKA treated in the emergency department and/or intensive care unit at twenty hospitals in Australia. Each hospital will be randomised to use either saline or buffered crystalloid solution for a period of 12 months before crossing over to the alternate fluid for the next 12 months. The blinded study fluid will be used for all resuscitation and maintenance purposes for included patients. Main outcome measures: This cluster-randomised, crossover randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been designed with the aim of enrolling a minimum of 400 patients, which will provide >91.4% power to detect a 2-day increase in the primary outcome, days alive and out of hospital to day 28, chosen with consumer representation. Secondary outcomes include quality of life and fatigue scores at day 28, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, acute kidney injury, and time to resolution of DKA. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. A prespecified statistical analysis plan will be developed prior to interim analysis. Results and conclusion: The BEST-DKA trial commenced enrolment in March 2024 and should generate results that will determine whether treatment with Plasma-Lyte (R) 148, compared with saline, results in increased days alive, and out of hospital to day 28 for patients with moderate or severe DKA.

TI  - Off-pump versus On-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Frail Patients: Study Protocol for the FRAGILE Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Introduction:Advances in modern medicine have led to people living longer and healthier lives. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery. When it comes to CABG surgery, randomized controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients. Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique in patients with limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress. In this study, the authors introduce the new national, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial "FRAGILE", to be developed in the main cardiac surgery centers of Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in frail patients.
   Methods:FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individually randomized (1:1) controlled trial which will enroll 630 patients with blinded outcome assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years), which aims to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after off-pump versus on-pump CABG in prefrail and frail patients. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation, low cardiac output syndrome/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary reintervention. Secondary outcomes will be major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, operative time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamic shock, new onset of atrial fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperation for bleeding, pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of stay in hospital, number of units of blood transfused, graft patency, rate of complete revascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery, quality of life after cardiac surgery and costs.
   Discussion:FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior to conventional on-pump CABG in the surgical treatment of pre-frail and frail patients.

TI  - Early sepsis care with the National Early Warning Score 2-guided Sepsis Hour-1 Bundle in the emergency department: hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation pilot stepped wedge randomised controlled trial (NEWS-1 TRIPS) protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Early sepsis treatment in the emergency department (ED) is crucial to improve patient survival. Despite international promulgation, the uptake of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Hour-1 Bundle (lactate measurement, blood culture, broad-spectrum antibiotics, 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension/lactate >= 4 mmol/L and vasopressors for hypotension during/after fluid resuscitation within 1 hour of sepsis recognition) is low across healthcare settings. Delays in sepsis recognition and a lack of high-quality evidence hinder its implementation. We propose a novel sepsis care model (National Early Warning Score, NEWS-1 care), in which the SSC Hour-1 Bundle is triggered objectively by a high NEWS-2 (>= 5). This study aims to determine the feasibility of a full-scale type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial on the NEWS-1 care in multiple EDs. Methods and analysis We will conduct a pilot type 1 hybrid trial and prospectively recruit 200 patients from 4 public EDs in Hong Kong cluster randomised in a stepped wedge design over 10 months. All study sites will start with an initial period of standard care and switch in random order at 2-month intervals to the NEWS-1 care unidirectionally. The implementation evaluation will employ mixed methods guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework, which includes qualitative and quantitative data from focus group interviews, staff survey and clinical record reviews. We will analyse the 14 feasibility outcomes as progression criteria to a full-scale trial, including trial acceptability to patients and staff, patient and staff recruitment rates, accuracy of sepsis screening, protocol adherence, accessibility to follow-up data, safety and preliminary clinical impacts of the NEWS1 care, using descriptive statistics. Ethics and dissemination The institutional review boards of all study sites approved this study. This study will establish the feasibility of a full-scale hybrid trial. We will disseminate the findings through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and educational activities.

TI  - Iranian Critical Care Nurses' Experiences With Slow Codes in the Absence of Formal 'Do-Not-Resuscitate' Orders: A Qualitative Study
T2  - NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac death remains a critical global health issue, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation serving as a vital life-saving intervention. However, ethical dilemmas emerge when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely to benefit the patient, particularly in settings lacking formal Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. This situation often leads to ambiguous practices such as 'slow codes', raising complex challenges for critical care nurses involved in end-of-life decision-making. Aim: This study aims to explore the experiences of Iranian critical care nurses with slow code practices in the absence of formal Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. Study Design: This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled nurses from diverse intensive care units (medical, pulmonary, poisoning, surgical and cardiac) across three teaching hospitals. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework. Results: Sixteen participants took part in the study. They had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD = 5.9) and professional experience ranging from 6 to 23 years (M = 13 years), with 2-15 years in intensive care (M = 8.5 years). Most were female (75%), married (75%) and held a bachelor's degree (68.8%). Six key themes emerged influencing slow code practices: fear of litigation and criticism, stretching and buying time, post-resuscitation care and quality of life, opportunities for gaining resuscitation expertise, emotional struggles and moral disengagement. These findings highlight the complex ethical and practical dilemmas nurses face, where legal ambiguities and resource constraints significantly affect end-of-life care decisions. Conclusions: Nurses often initiate slow codes due to fear of litigation and the desire to support families, while confronting moral dilemmas and concerns about patient outcomes. These findings highlight the urgent need for formal legal frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders and enhanced nurse training to effectively address the ethical complexities of end-of-life care. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Resuscitation decisions must align with updated clinical guidelines, underscoring the need for formal national and local frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders in Iran. Legislation that reduces nurses' fear of litigation is essential to promote confident, ethically grounded decision-making. Furthermore, enhancing healthcare professionals' communication skills is critical to improving patients' and families' understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - Why Do Patients Agree to a "Do Not Resuscitate" or "Full Code" Order? Perspectives of Medical Inpatients
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients who die in hospital have a "Do Not Resuscitate" (DNR) order in place at the time of their death, yet we know very little about why some patients request or agree to a DNR order, why others don't, and how they view discussions of resuscitation status.
   METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews of English-speaking medical inpatients who had clearly requested a DNR or full code (FC) order after a discussion with their admitting team, and analyzed the transcripts using a modified grounded-theory approach.
   RESULTS: We achieved conceptual saturation after conducting 44 interviews (27 DNR, 17 FC) over a 4-month period. Patients in the DNR group were much older than those in the FC group, but they had broadly similar admission diagnoses and comorbidities. DNR patients reported much greater familiarity with the subject and described a more positive experience than FC patients with their resuscitation discussions. Participants typically requested FC or DNR orders based on personal, relational or philosophical considerations, but these considerations manifested differently depending on the participant's preference for resuscitation. Most FC patients stated that would not want a prolonged period of life support, and they would not want resuscitation in the event of a poor quality of life. FC and DNR patients understood resuscitation and DNR orders differently. DNR patients described resuscitation in graphic, concrete terms that emphasized suffering and futility, and DNR orders in terms of comfort or natural processes. FC patients understood resuscitation in an abstract sense as something that restores life, while DNR orders were associated with substandard care or even euthanasia.
   CONCLUSION: Our study identified important differences and commonalities between the perspectives of DNR and FC patients. We hope that this information can be used to help physicians better understand the needs of their patients when discussing resuscitation.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators for the treatment of arrhythmias and cardiac resynchronisation therapy for the treatment of heart failure: systematic review and economic evaluation
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: This assessment updates and expands on two previous technology assessments that evaluated implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for arrhythmias and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) for heart failure (HF).
   Objectives: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ICDs in addition to optimal pharmacological therapy (OPT) for people at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) as a result of ventricular arrhythmias despite receiving OPT; to assess CRT with or without a defibrillator (CRT-D or CRT-P) in addition to OPT for people with HF as a result of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and cardiac dyssynchrony despite receiving OPT; and to assess CRT-D in addition to OPT for people with both conditions.
   Data sources: Electronic resources including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 2012. Additional studies were sought from reference lists, clinical experts and manufacturers' submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
   Review methods: Inclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers independently. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were synthesised through narrative review and meta-analyses. For the three populations above, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing (1) ICD with standard therapy, (2) CRT-P or CRT-D with each other or with OPT and (3) CRT-D with OPT, CRT-P or ICD were eligible. Outcomes included mortality, adverse events and quality of life. A previously developed Markov model was adapted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of OPT, ICDs, CRT-P and CRT-D in the three populations by simulating disease progression calculated at 4-weekly cycles over a lifetime horizon.
   Results: A total of 4556 references were identified, of which 26 RCTs were included in the review: 13 compared ICD with medical therapy, four compared CRT-P/ CRT-D with OPT and nine compared CRT-D with ICD. ICDs reduced all-cause mortality in people at increased risk of SCD, defined in trials as those with previous ventricular arrhythmias/cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction (MI) > 3 weeks previously, non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (depending on data included) or ischaemic/non-ischaemic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction <= 35%. There was no benefit in people scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft. A reduction in SCD but not all-cause mortality was found in people with recent MI. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from 14,231 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) to 29,756 per QALY for the scenarios modelled. CRT-P and CRT-D reduced mortality and HF hospitalisations, and improved other outcomes, in people with HF as a result of LVSD and cardiac dyssynchrony when compared with OPT. The rate of SCD was lower with CRT-D than with CRT-P but other outcomes were similar. CRT-P and CRT-D compared with OPT produced ICERs of 27,584 per QALY and 27,899 per QALY respectively. The ICER for CRT-D compared with CRT-P was 28,420 per QALY. In people with both conditions, CRT-D reduced the risk of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisation, and improved other outcomes, compared with ICDs. Complications were more common with CRT-D. Initial management with OPT alone was most cost-effective (ICER 2824 per QALY compared with ICD) when health-related quality of life was kept constant over time. Costs and QALYs for CRT-D and CRT-P were similar. The ICER for CRT-D compared with ICD was 27,195 per QALY and that for CRT-D compared with OPT was 35,193 per QALY.
   Limitations: Limitations of the model include the structural assumptions made about disease progression and treatment provision, the extrapolation of trial survival estimates over time and the assumptions made around parameter values when evidence was not available for specific patient groups.
   Conclusions: In people at risk of SCD as a result of ventricular arrhythmias and in those with HF as a result of LVSD and cardiac dyssynchrony, the interventions modelled produced ICERs of < 30,000 per QALY gained. In people with both conditions, the ICER for CRT-D compared with ICD, but not CRT-D compared with OPT, was < 30,000 per QALY, and the costs and QALYs for CRT-D and CRT-P were similar. A RCT comparing CRT-D and CRT-P in people with HF as a result of LVSD and cardiac dyssynchrony is required, for both those with and those without an ICD indication. A RCT is also needed into the benefits of ICD in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy in the absence of dyssynchrony.

A1  - Austrian Severe TBI Study Investig
TI  - Severe traumatic brain injury in Austria VI: Effects of guideline-based management
T2  - WIENER KLINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this paper is to report relations between health outcomes and implementation of individual recommendations of the guidelines.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data sets from 405 patients included by 5 Austrian hospitals were available. The analysis focused on the compliance of treatment modalities to TBI guidelines recommendations. Compliance was evaluated based on scores developed specifically for this purpose. To evaluate the relations between the TBI guidelines compliance and outcomes the estimation of odds ratios was computed using multiple as well as logistic regression with age, ISS and initial GCS used to control confounding.
   RESULTS: The option on prehospital resuscitation was followed in 84%, the guideline on early resuscitation was followed in 79%. The guideline on intracranial pressure treatment threshold was the most closely followed one (89%). The option on cerebral perfusion pressure was followed in less than 30% of patients. Only the scores on resuscitation of blood pressure and oxygenation and on cerebral perfusion pressure were positively and statistically significantly related to ICU survival. Positive relations were also found for adherence to the recommendations on the type of monitoring, hyperventilation (guideline), prophylactic use of anti-seizure drugs, and the total of scores. The other recommendations were negatively related to ICU survival, but computed odds ratios were statistically not significant. Analysis of relations between compliance scores and length of ICU and hospitals stay in survivors showed that adherence to the recommendations on type of monitoring was related to a reduction of length of stay in ICU and hospital, adherence to the hyperventilation guideline was related to shortened ICU, but increased hospital stay, and adherence to the guideline on mannitol was related to reduced days in hospital, but not to days in ICU. Implementing the standard on corticosteroid use was related to a reduction of days both in hospital and ICU. Using the standard on prophylactic use of anti-seizure drugs was related to a reduction in ICU days. If all the recommendations were closely followed an increase of days in ICU would be observed, while the length of stay in hospital would be reduced.
   CONCLUSIONS: The relatively strong relation between initial resuscitation in the hospital and ICU survival provides a firm basis for future efforts of emergency teams. The positive influence of some of the recommendations on reduction of ICU or hospital days may provide economic incentives to promote guidelines implementation.

TI  - Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) orders: A systematic review the barriers and facilitators of decision-making and implementation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Most people who die in hospital do so with a DNACPR order in place, these orders are the focus of considerable debate.
   Aim: To identify factors, facilitators and barriers involved in DNACPR decision-making and implementation.
   Methods: All study designs and interventions were eligible for inclusion. Studies were appraised guided by CASP tools. A qualitative analysis was undertaken.
   Data sources: Included electronic databases: Medline, Embase, ASSIA, Cochrane library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the King's Fund Library and scanning reference lists of included studies.
   Results: Four key themes were identified:
   Considering the decision - by senior physicians, nursing staff, patients and relatives. Key triggers included older age, co-morbidities, adverse prognostic factors, quality of life and the likelihood of success of CPR.
   Discussing the decision - levels, and combinations, of physician and nursing skills, patient understanding and family involvement produced various outcomes.
   Implementing the decision -the lack of clear documentation resulted in a breakdown in communications within health teams. Staff knowledge and support of guidelines and local policies varied.
   Consequences of a DNACPR decision - inadequate understanding by staff resulted in suboptimal care, and incorrect withdrawal of treatment.
   Conclusion: Significant variability was identified in DNACPR decision-making and implementation. The evidence base is weak but the absence of evidence does not indicate an absence of good practice. Issues are complex, and dependent on a number of factors. Misunderstandings and poor discussions can be overcome such as with an overall care plan to facilitate discussions and reduce negative impact of DNACPR orders on aspects of patient care.

TI  - Targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage (TTM-ICH): methodology of a prospective randomized clinical trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
AB  - Rationale Intracerebral hemorrhage causes 15% of strokes annually in the United States, and there is currently no effective therapy. Aims and hypothesis This is a clinical trial designed to study the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a protocol of targeted temperature management to moderate hypothermia in intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Methods The targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage trial is a prospective, single-center, interventional, randomized, parallel, two-arm (1:1) phase-II clinical trial with blinded end-point ascertainment. Intracerebral hemorrhage patients will be randomized within 18h of symptom onset to either 72h of targeted temperature management to moderate hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) followed by a controlled rewarming at of 0 center dot 05-0 center dot 1 degrees C per hour or 72h of targeted temperature management to normothermia (36-37 degrees C) using endovascular or surface cooling. Outcomes The primary outcome is the development of serious adverse events possibly and probably related to treatment. Secondary outcomes include in-hospital neurological deterioration between day 0-7, in-hospital mortality, functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin scale at discharge and 90 days, and effect of treatment allocation on cerebral edema and hematoma volume. Discussion Intracerebral hemorrhage remains the most severe form of stroke with limited options to improve survival. As the early resuscitation phase in the intensive care unit represents the greatest opportunity for impact on clinical outcome, it also appears to be the most promising window of opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating aggressive treatments. Conclusion More research of novel therapies to improve outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage is desperately needed. The results of the targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage clinical trial may provide additional information on the applicability of targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage.

TI  - Acute right ventricular myocardial injury and sudden cardiac arrest in a patient with persistent spontaneous coronary vasospasm
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Coronary vasospasm is a rare diagnosis resulting in sudden arrhythmic cardiac arrest. We report a case of a healthy, non-smoking elderly woman resuscitated from arrhythmic cardiac arrest. She had persistent spontaneous coronary vasospasm, leading to right ventricular myocardial injury and failure, and shock. She responded quickly to intravenous normal saline bolus infusion, but had irreversible neurological sequelae. Additionally, she had atrial fibrillation preceding ischemic ventricular fibrillation, a rare finding in coronary vasospasm-related cardiac arrest. We suggest immediate coronary angiography of patients in sudden arrhythmic cardiac arrest with acute right ventricular failure for a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of the coronary vasospasm. 2011;124(8):1275-1277

TI  - Changes in cardiac arrest patients' temperature management after the 2013 "TTM" trial: results from an international survey
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH between 32 and 34 degrees C) was recommended until recently in unconscious successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest (CA) patients, especially after initial shockable rhythm. A randomized controlled trial published in 2013 observed similar outcome between a 36 degrees C-targeted temperature management (TTM) and a 33 degrees C-TTM. The main aim of our study was to assess the impact of this publication on physicians regarding their TTM practical changes.
   Methods: A declarative survey was performed using the webmail database of the French Intensive Care Society including 3229 physicians (from May 2014 to January 2015).
   Results: Five hundred and eighteen respondents from 264 ICUs in 11 countries fulfilled the survey (16 %). A specific attention was generally paid by 94 % of respondents to TTM (hyperthermia avoidance, normothermia, or TH implementation) in CA patients, whereas 6 % did not. TH between 32 and 34 degrees C was declared as generally maintained during 12-24 h by 78 % of respondents or during 24-48 h by 19 %. Since the TTM trial publication, 56 % of respondents declared no modification of their TTM practice, whereas 37 % declared a practical target temperature change. The new temperature targets were 35-36 degrees C for 23 % of respondents, and 36 degrees C for 14 %. The duration of overall TTM (including TH and/or normothermia) was declared as applied between 12 and 24 h in 40 %, and between 24 and 48 h in 36 %. In univariate analysis, the physicians' TTM modification seemed related to hospital category (university versus non-university hospitals, P = 0.045), to TTM-specific attention paid in CA patients (P = 0.008), to TH durations (<12 versus 24-48 h, P = 0.01), and to new targets temperature (32-34 versus 35-36 degrees C, P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: The TTM trial publication has induced a modification of current practices in one-third of respondents, whereas the 32-34 degrees C target temperature remained unchanged for 56 %. Educational actions are needed to promote knowledge translations of trial results into clinical practice. New international guidelines may contribute to this effort.

TI  - The Plasma-Lyte 148 v Saline (PLUS) study protocol: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of the effect of intensive care fluid therapy on mortality
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) is the most commonly administered resuscitation fluid on a global basis but emerging evidence suggests that its high chloride content may have important adverse effects.
   Objective: To describe the study protocol for the Plasma-Lyte 148 v Saline study, which will test the hypothesis that in critically ill adult patients the use of Plasma-Lyte 148 (a buffered crystalloid solution) for fluid therapy results in different 90-day all-cause mortality when compared with saline.
   Design and setting: We will conduct this multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial in approximately 50 intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand. We will randomly assign 8800 patients to either Plasma-Lyte 148 or saline for all resuscitation fluid, maintenance fluid and compatible drug dilution therapy while in the ICU for up to 90 days after randomisation.
   Outcome measures: The primary outcome is 90-day all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes include mean and peak creatinine concentration, incidence of renal replacement therapy, incidence and duration of vasoactive drug treatment, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospitaliength of stay, and quality of life and health services use at 6 months.
   Results and conclusions: The PLUS study will provide high-quality data on the comparative safety and efficacy of Plasma-Lyte 148 compared with saline for resuscitation and compatible crystalloid fluid therapy in critically ill adult patients.

TI  - Religious Coping and Use of Intensive Life-Prolonging Care Near Death in Patients With Advanced Cancer
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Context Patients frequently rely on religious faith to cope with cancer, but little is known about the associations between religious coping and the use of intensive life-prolonging care at the end of life.
   Objective To determine the way religious coping relates to the use of intensive life-prolonging end-of-life care among patients with advanced cancer.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A US multisite, prospective, longitudinal cohort of 345 patients with advanced cancer, who were enrolled between January 1, 2003, and August 31, 2007. The Brief RCOPE assessed positive religious coping. Baseline interviews assessed psychosocial and religious/spiritual measures, advance care planning, and end-of-life treatment preferences. Patients were followed up until death, a median of 122 days after baseline assessment.
   Main Outcome Measures Intensive life-prolonging care, defined as receipt of mechanical ventilation or resuscitation in the last week of life. Analyses were adjusted for demographic factors significantly associated with positive religious coping and any end-of-life outcome at P < .05 (ie, age and race/ethnicity). The main outcome was further adjusted for potential psychosocial confounders (eg, other coping styles, terminal illness acknowledgment, spiritual support, preference for heroics, and advance care planning).
   Results A high level of positive religious coping at baseline was significantly associated with receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with patients with a low level (11.3% vs 3.6%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.81 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.03-7.69]; P = .04) and intensive life-prolonging care during the last week of life (13.6% vs 4.2%; AOR, 2.90 [ 95% CI, 1.14-7.35]; P = .03) after adjusting for age and race. In the model that further adjusted for other coping styles, terminal illness acknowledgment, support of spiritual needs, preference for heroics, and advance care planning (do-not-resuscitate order, living will, and health care proxy/durable power of attorney), positive religious coping remained a significant predictor of receiving intensive life-prolonging care near death (AOR, 2.90 [95% CI, 1.07-7.89]; P = .04).
   Conclusions Positive religious coping in patients with advanced cancer is associated with receipt of intensive life-prolonging medical care near death. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms for this association.

TI  - Vital signs and medical emergency response (MER) activation predict in-hospital mortality in general surgery patients: a study of 15 969 admissions
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Background: The applicability of the vital signs prompting medical emergency response (MER) activation has not previously been examined specifically in a large general surgical cohort. This study aimed to characterize the distribution, and predictive performance, of four vital signs selected based on Australian guidelines (oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and heart rate); with those of the MER activation criteria.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted including patients admitted under general surgical services of two hospitals in South Australia over 2 years. Likelihood ratios for patients meeting MER activation criteria, or a vital sign in the most extreme 1% for general surgery inpatients ( 99.5th percentile), were calculated to predict in-hospital mortality.Results: 15 969 inpatient admissions were included comprising 2 254 617 total vital sign observations. The 0.5th and 99.5th centile for heart rate was 48 and 133, systolic blood pressure 85 and 184, respiratory rate 10 and 31, and oxygen saturations 89% and 100%, respectively. MER activation criteria with the highest positive likelihood ratio for in-hospital mortality were heart rate = 39 (37.65, 95% CI 27.71-49.51), respiratory rate = 31 (15.79, 95% CI 12.82-19.07), and respiratory rate = 7 (10.53, 95% CI 6.79-14.84). These MER activation criteria likelihood ratios were similar to those derived when applying a threshold of the most extreme 1% of vital signs.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that vital signs within Australian guidelines, and escalation to MER activation, appropriately predict in-hospital mortality in a large cohort of patients admitted to general surgical services in South Australia.

TI  - In vitro comparison of cold-stored whole blood and reconstituted whole blood
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
AB  - Background and Objectives: Cold-stored whole blood (CSWB) is increasingly used in damage control resuscitation. Haemostatic function of CSWB seems superior to that of reconstituted whole blood, and it is sufficiently preserved for 14-21 days. To provide evidence for a yet insufficiently studied aspect of prehospital CSWB use, we compared in vitro haemostatic properties of CSWB and currently used in-hospital and prehospital blood component therapies.Materials and Methods: Blood was obtained from 24 O RhD positive male donors. Three products were prepared: CSWB, in-hospital component therapy (red blood cells [RBCs], OctaplasLG and platelets 1:1:1) and prehospital component therapy (RBCs and lyophilized plasma 1:1). Samples were drawn on days 1 and 14 of CSWB or RBC cold storage. On day 14, platelet concentrates at their expiry (5 days) were used for 1:1:1 mixing. Conventional clotting assays, rotational thromboelastometry, thrombin formation and platelet function were assessed.Results: Haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen and coagulation factor levels remained closest to physiological in CSWB. Factor VIII activity decreased markedly by day 14 in CSWB. The decline in platelet function was prominent in CSWB. However, CSWB on day 14 yielded physiological EXTEM MCF, suggesting haemostatically sufficient platelet function. Despite haemodilution and lower coagulation factor levels, in-hospital component therapy was haemostatically adequate. Prehospital component therapy formed the weakest clots. Thrombin formation potential remained comparable and stable in all groups.Conclusion: Current prehospital component therapy fails to offer the clotting potential that CSWB does. CSWB and current in-hospital 1:1:1 component therapy show similar haemostatic potential until 14 days of storage.

TI  - Sex differences in patients with cardiogenic shock requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: Our study assesses differences between male and female patients placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiogenic shock.
   Method: We retrospectively analyzed 574 adult patients placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiogenic shock at our institution between January 2007 and December 2018. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Propensity score matching was used to compare outcomes. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes include limb ischemia, limb ischemia interventions, distal perfusion cannula placement, stroke, bleeding, and continuous venovenous hemofiltration initiation.
   Results: There were 394 male patients (69%) and 180 female patients (31%). After adjusting for baseline differences, propensity score matching compared 171 male patients with 171 female patients. No difference was seen between men and women in in-hospital mortality (60.2% vs 56.7%; P = .59), limb ischemia (474% vs 45.6%; P = .83), limb ischemia surgery (15.2% vs 12.9%; P = .64), bleeding (49.7% vs 49.1%; P = 1), continuous venovenous hemofiltration initiation (39.2% vs 32.7%; P = .26), and stroke (8.2% vs 9.4%; P = .85). Multivariable logistic regression showed that female patients who died were more likely to have had chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-6.53; P = .032) than surviving women. Male patients who died were more likely to have had coronary artery disease (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.34-3.78; P = .002) and higher lactate levels (OR,1.14; 95% CI, 1.08-1.21; P < .001) than surviving men. Women with cardiac transplant primary graft dysfunction were more likely to survive (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.27; P = .001), whereas men with cardiac transplant primary graft dysfunction were less likely to survive (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.71; P = .007), than patients with other shock etiologies.
   Conclusions: After adjusting for baseline difference, there was no difference in outcomes between male and female patients despite differing risk profiles for in-hospital mortality.

T2  - BMC MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

TI  - Popliteal Artery Repair in Massively Transfused Military Trauma Casualties: A Pursuit to Save Life and Limb
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Popliteal artery war wounds can bleed severely and historically have high rates of amputation associated with ligation (72%) and repair (32%). More than before, casualties are now surviving the initial medical evacuation and presenting with severely injured limbs that prompt immediate limb salvage decisions in the midst of life-saving maneuvers. A modern analysis of current results may show important changes because previous limb salvage strategies were limited by the resuscitation and surgical techniques of their eras. Because exact comparisons between wars are difficult, the objective of this study was to calculate a worst-case (a pulseless, fractured limb with massive hemorrhage from popliteal artery injury) amputation-free survival rate for the most severely wounded soldiers undergoing immediate reconstruction to save both life and limb.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective study of trauma casualties admitted to the combat support hospital at Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq, between 2003 and 2007. US military casualties requiring a massive transfusion (>= 10 blood units transfused within 24 hours of injury) were identified. We extracted data on the subset of casualties with a penetrating supra or infrageniculate popliteal arterial vascular injury. Demographics, injury mechanism, Injury Severity Score, tourniquet use, physiologic parameters, damage control adjuncts, surgical repair techniques, operative time, and outcomes (all-cause 30-day mortality, amputation rates, limb salvage failure, and graft patency) were investigated.
   Results: Forty-six massively transfused male casualties, median age 24 years (range, 19-54 years; mean Injury Severity Score, 19 +/- 8.0), underwent immediate orthopedic stabilization and vascular reconstruction. There was one early death. The median operative time for the vascular repairs was 217 minutes (range, 94-630 minutes) and included all damage control procedures. Combined arterial and venous injuries occurred in 17 (37%). Ligation was performed for no arterial and 9 venous injuries. Amputations (transtibial or transfemoral) were considered limb salvage failures (14 of 48, 29.2%) and were grouped as immediate (<= 48 hours, 5), early (>48 hours and <= 30 days, 6), or late (>30 days, 3). Limb losses were from graft thrombosis, infection, or chronic pain. Combined arterial and venous injuries occurred in 17 (37%). Ligation was performed for no arterial and nine venous injuries. For a median follow-up (excluding death) of 48 months (range, 23-75 months), the amputation-free survival rate was 67%.
   Conclusions: This study, a worst-case study, showed comparable results to historical controls regarding limb salvage rates (71% for Iraq vs. 56-69% for the Vietnam War). Thirty-day survival (98%), 4-year amputation-free survival (67%), and complication-free rates (35%) fill knowledge gaps. Guidelines for managing popliteal artery injuries show promising results because current resuscitation practices and surgical care yielded similar amputation rates to prior conflicts despite more severe injuries. Significant transfusion requirements and injury severity may not indicate a life-over-limb strategy for popliteal arterial repairs. Future studies of limb salvage failures may help improve casualty care by reducing the complications that directly impact amputation-free survival.

TI  - Neuroprognostication: a conceptual framework
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
AB  - In this Perspectives article, David Fischer and colleagues present a stepwise conceptual framework for neuroprognostication after severe brain injury, with the aim of providing structure and guidance to supplement clinical judgement and direct future investigation.
   Neuroprognostication, or the prediction of recovery from disorders of consciousness caused by severe brain injury, is as critical as it is complex. With profound implications for mortality and quality of life, neuroprognostication draws upon an intricate set of biomedical, probabilistic, psychosocial and ethical factors. However, the clinical approach to neuroprognostication is often unsystematic, and consequently, variable among clinicians and prone to error. Here, we offer a stepwise conceptual framework for reasoning through neuroprognostic determinations - including an evaluation of neurological function, estimation of a recovery trajectory, definition of goals of care and consideration of patient values - culminating in a clinically actionable formula for weighing the risks and benefits of life-sustaining treatment. Although the complexity of neuroprognostication might never be fully reducible to arithmetic, this systematic approach provides structure and guidance to supplement clinical judgement and direct future investigation.

TI  - Nightmare of Lumbar Diskectomy
T2  - SPINE
AB  - Study Design. Case report.
   Objective. To present a rare case of a patient who during posterior lumbar spinal decompression and diskectomy underwent a laceration of the aorta. The patient survived with prompt treatment.
   Summary of Background Data. Intraoperative injuries of the prevertebral and pelvic vessels are infrequent but serious complications of posterior lumbar disc surgery. Injury may cause laceration of the vessel with acute life-threatening retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which is usually massive. The aortic bifurcation is closely approximated to the anterior surface of the L4-L5 disc.
   Methods. A 70-year-old gentleman with prolapsed intervertebral disc between fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae and left-sided radiculopathy of L5 root was operated with L4-L5 laminectomy and L4-L5 diskectomy. During diskectomy, it was noticed by the surgeon that there was one episode of giving way of the pituitary rongeur anteriorly. However, no major bleeding was encountered from the disc space immediately after the event; vital signs were stable hemodynamically and we completed the diskectomy. Five minutes later, we noted the dural sac to have a collapsing pulsation. Prevertebral vessel injury was suspected. Patient became pulseless.
   Results. We turned the patient supine for cardiopulmonary resuscitation without extubation. Vascular surgeons proceeded with laparotomy. Huge retroperitoneal hematoma and a 1.5 x 1.5 cm laceration at the bifurcation of aorta were noted anterior to the L4-L5 intervertebral disc. The vascular surgeon repaired the aorta by primary repair. The patient was extubated on day 5 and was allowed to ambulate. He was discharged subsequently with a normal neurological and vascular examination. No pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation was detected on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography at 2 years follow-up.
   Conclusion. Iatrogenic vascular injury during posterior lumbar disc surgery, although rare, should be suspected if signs of circulatory instability or abnormal pulsation of the dural sac are noted, especially if any lapse in the ordinary technique has been observed. In preoperative imaging, note the position of the aorta and prevertebral veins and the depth and integrity of the anterior wall of the disc.

TI  - Dynamic progression of Wernicke encephalopathy in a gastric cancer patient: Multimodal MRI insights with arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE), a neurological emergency caused by thiamin deficiency, is traditionally diagnosed based on the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. However, this classic presentation occurs in fewer than 10% of cases, complicating early recognition. Untreated cases risk irreversible brain damage or progression to Korsakoff syndrome. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids diagnosis, early-stage structural abnormalities may be subtle or absent. Arterial spin labeling (ASL), a noninvasive perfusion imaging technique, offers potential for detecting microcirculatory changes preceding cytotoxic edema. This case explores ASL's diagnostic utility in WE through a high-risk patient with atypical progression. Patient concerns: A 50-year-old female with gastric adenocarcinoma developed persistent vomiting following chemotherapy. By hospital day 9, she rapidly deteriorated into a comatose state (Glasgow Coma Scale: E1V1M3), prompting neurological evaluation. No classic WE triad features were initially documented. Diagnoses: Brain MRI revealed bilateral thalamic, periventricular, and periaqueductal gray matter hyperintensities on T2-FLAIR/DWI. ASL perfusion imaging demonstrated elevated cerebral blood flow (CBF) in these regions, extending to frontal and parietal lobes. Follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed lesion progression involving cortical and medullary areas, with ASL hyperperfusion exceeding diffusion-restricted zones. Serum thiamin levels (<1 ng/mL) confirmed deficiency, establishing WE diagnosis. Interventions : Initial supportive care: Vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, methylprednisolone (40 mg/day), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor critical intervention delay: Thiamine replacement deferred until day 11 due to pending laboratory confirmation family-directed care: Against medical advice, transferred to local hospital prior to initiating high-dose IV thiamin. Outcomes: Radiological progression: Lesion expansion from deep gray matter to cortical/medullary regions within 48 hours Therapeutic uncertainty: Final neurological recovery status unreported due to care discontinuity. Lessons: ASL may identify perfusion alterations prior to DWI-detectable cytotoxic edema, suggesting a role in WE's early diagnostic algorithm. Rapid lesion progression in high-risk patients necessitates urgent thiamin repletion even without classic symptoms. Neuroimaging findings in WE may exhibit dynamic spatial-temporal evolution, requiring multimodal imaging interpretation. Serum thiamin levels remain critical for diagnostic confirmation in radiologically ambiguous cases.

TI  - Case Report: Therapeutic Strategy With Delayed Debridement for Culture-Negative Invasive Group A Streptococcal Infections Diagnosed by Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) caused by group A streptococcus is a rare condition that rapidly developed to multiple organ failure even death. Therefore, prompt diagnosis, initiate appropriate antibiotics and other supportive treatments are critical. Here we reported a case of STSS caused by group A streptococcus infection. A healthy 39-year-old man presented a sudden pain in the left lower extremity, followed by a high fever (40.0 degrees C) with dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Twenty-four hours before the visit, the patient showed anuria. The patient was then admitted to the intensive care unit. Blood examination revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers and creatinine. He suffered from septic shock, dysfunction of coagulation, acute kidney dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute liver function injury. The diagnosis was obtained through clinical manifestation and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) drawn from the pustule and deep soft tissue (lower limb) samples while all bacterial cultures came back negative. The pustule mNGS report detected a total of 132 unique group A streptococcus sequence reads, representing 96.3% of microbial reads while the soft tissue mNGS report identified a total of 142474 unique group A streptococcus sequence reads, representing 100% of microbial reads. The patient was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, antibiotics comprising piperacillin/tazobactam and clindamycin, respiratory support, following the delayed surgical debridement. Intravenous immunoglobulin was also used for 5 days. On the 14th day after admission, he was transferred to the general ward for follow-up treatment. Our case highlighted, for the first time, the key role of mNGS in the early diagnosis of culture-negative invasive group A streptococcal infection. The case also suggested that clindamycin combined with beta-lactam antibiotics and adjunction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with delayed debridement performed well in the management of unstable STSS patients.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF A REGULATION RESTRICTING MEDICAL HOUSE STAFF WORKING HOURS ON THE QUALITY OF PATIENT-CARE
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objective.-To examine the impact on patient care of a New York State regulation that restricted house staff working hours.
   Design.-Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting.-General medical service of an urban teaching hospital.
   Patients.-A total of 263 (94%) of 281 patients discharged from the study service during October 1988 and 263 (93%) of 283 patients discharged from the same service during October 1989.
   Interventions.-On July 1, 1989, New York State enacted a new regulation, Code 405, which limited residents' working hours and specified levels of supervision and ancillary support.
   Main Outcome Measures.-In-hospital mortality, transfers to intensive care units, cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts, discharge disposition, length of stay, medical complications, and house staff delays in ordering tests and procedures.
   Results.-Although the cohorts were comparable in severity of illness measures, more patients in 1989 suffered at least one medical complication (91 [35%] vs 59 [22%]; P=.002) and experienced at least one diagnostic test delay because of house staff (44 [17%] vs 4 [2%]; P<.001). These significant differences persisted after controlling for potential confounders in multivariate analyses. However, we found no significant differences in more serious outcomes: in-hospital mortality, transfer to intensive care unit, discharge disposition, or length of stay.
   Conclusions.-These results suggest that restricted house staff working hours were associated with delayed test ordering by house staff and increased in-hospital complications. While these potentially deleterious effects on the quality of care did not result in statistically significant differences in more serious outcomes, further study at other hospitals is warranted to determine staffing strategies that optimize quality of care for patients, as well as medical education and quality of life for house officers.

TI  - Initial resuscitation and management of pediatric septic shock
T2  - MINERVA PEDIATRICA
AB  - The pediatric sepsis syndrome remains a common cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization costs worldwide. The initial resuscitation and management of pediatric sepsis is focused on 1) rapid recognition of abnormal tissue perfusion and restoration of adequate cardiovascular function; 2) eradication of the inciting invasive infection, including prompt administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial medications; and 3) supportive care of organ system dysfunction. Efforts to improve early and aggressive initial resuscitation and ongoing management strategies have improved outcomes in pediatric severe sepsis and septic shock, though many questions still remain as to the optimal therapeutic strategies for many patients. In this article, we will briefly review the definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and pathophysiology of sepsis and provide an extensive overview of both current and novel therapeutic strategies used to resuscitate and manage pediatric patients with severe sepsis and septic shock

TI  - Ethical issues associated with in-hospital emergency from the Medical Emergency Team's perspective: a national survey
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical Emergency Teams (METs) are frequently involved in ethical issues associated to in-hospital emergencies, like decisions about end-of-life care and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. MET involvement offers both advantages and disadvantages, especially when an immediate decision must be made. We performed a survey among Italian intensivists/anesthesiologists evaluating MET's perspective on the most relevant ethical aspects faced in daily practice.
   METHODS: A questionnaire was developed on behalf of the Italian scientific society of anesthesia and intensive care (SIAARTI) and administered to its members. Decision making criteria applied by respondents when dealing with ethical aspects, the estimated incidence of conflicts due to ethical issues and the impact on the respondents' emotional and moral distress were explored.
   RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 327 intensivists/anesthesiologists. Patient life-expectancy, wishes, and the quality of life were the factors most considered for decisions. Conflicts with ward physicians were reported by most respondents; disagreement on appropriateness of ICU admission and family unpreparedness to the imminent patient death were the most frequent reasons. Half of respondents considered that in case of conflicts the final decision should be made by the MET. Conflicts were generally recognized as causing increased and moral distress within the MET members. Few respondents reported that dedicated protocols or training were locally available.
   CONCLUSION: Italian intensivists/anesthesiologists reported that ethical issues associated with in-hospital emergencies are occurring commonly and are having a significant negative impact on MET well-being. Conflicts with ward physicians happen frequently. They also conveyed that hospitals don't offer ethics training and have no protocols in place to address ethical issues.

TI  - Incidence and correlates of near-death experiences in a cardiac care unit
T2  - GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Near-death experiences, unusual experiences during a close brush with death, may precipitate pervasive attitudinal and behavior changes. The incidence and psychological correlates of such experiences, and their association with proximity to death, are unclear. We conducted a 30-month survey to identify near-death experiences in a tertiary care center cardiac inpatient service. In a consecutive sample of 1595 patients admitted to the cardiac inpatient service (mean age 63 years, 61% male), of whom 7% were admitted with cardiac arrest, patients who described near-death experiences were matched with comparison patients on diagnosis, gender, and age. Near-death experiences were reported by 10% of patients with cardiac arrest and 1% of other cardiac patients (P<.001). Near-death experiencers were younger than other patients (P=.001). were more likely to have lost consciousness (P<.001) and to report prior purportedly paranormal experiences (P=.009), and had greater approach-oriented death acceptance (P=.01). Near-death experiencers and comparison patients did not differ in sociodemographic variables, social support, quality of life, acceptance of their illness, cognitive function, capacity for physical activities, degree of cardiac dysfunction, objective proximity to death, or coronary prognosis.

TI  - Abnormal cardiac innervation in patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
CP  - Cardiostim 2002 Conference
AB  - Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) is diagnosed in up to nearly 10% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The arrhythmogenic substrate is unknown. This study examined the role of cardiac innervation as a possible contributor to this arrhythmia. Eight patients with idiopathic VF were compared with eight normal subjects (controls) by [(123)] I metaiodobenzylguanidine SPECT (MIBG), measuring peak uptake, late uptake, and clearance of the nuclear tracer. The left ventricle was divided in 13 segments in the bull's-eye target plot. Peak and late MIBG uptake was increased in the anterolateral segments (2,3,7,8) compared to the inferoposterior and septal segments, in controls and in patients. No difference was observed between controls and patients in the inferoposterior and septal segments. In contrast, a significantly higher MIBG uptake was observed in patients compared to controls in the anterolateral segments (94 4% vs 81 +/- 11%, P < 0.03 for peak uptake; 94 +/- 5% vs 79 +/- 12%, P < 0.01 forlate uptake). No difference was observed in MIBG clearance in any segment in either study group. Cardiac sympathetic innervation is highly heterogeneous, though predominant in anterolateral segments in normal subjects. Patients with idiopathic VF exhibit the same distribution, though have a significantly greater density of sympathetic terminals in the anterolateral segments than controls, which may promote ventricular arrhythmias.

TI  - Predictors of mortality and short-term physical and cognitive dependence in critically ill persons 75 years and older: a prospective cohort study
T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of 3-month mortality in critically ill older persons under medical care and to assess the clinical impact of an ICU stay on physical and cognitive dependence and subjective health status in survivors.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study including all older persons 75 years and older consecutively admitted into ICU during a one-year period, except those admitted after cardiac arrest, All patients were followed for 3 months or until death. Comorbidities were assessed using the Charlson index and physical dependence was evaluated using the Katz index of Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Cognitive dependence was determined by a score based on the individual components of the Lawton index of Daily Living and subjective health status was evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) score.
   Results: One hundred patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 79.3 +/- 3.4 years. The median Charlson index was 6 [IQR, 4 to 7] and the mean ADL and cognitive scores were 5.4 +/- 1.1 and 1.2 +/- 1.4, respectively, corresponding to a population with a high level of comorbidities but low physical and cognitive dependence. Mortality was 61/100 (61%) at 3 months. In multivariate analysis only comorbidities assessed by the Charlson index [Adjusted Odds Ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; p < 0.003] and the number of organ failures assessed by the SOFA score [Adjusted Odds Ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2; p < 0.02] were independently associated with 3-month mortality. All 22 patients needing renal support after Day 3 died. Compared with pre-admission, physical (p = 0.04), and cognitive (p = 0.62) dependence in survivors had changed very little at 3 months. In addition, the mean NHP score was 213.1 +/- 132.8 at 3 months, suggesting an acceptable perception of their quality of life.
   Conclusions: In a selected population of non surgical patients 75 years and older, admission into the ICU is associated with a 3-month survival rate of 38% with little impact on physical and cognitive dependence and subjective health status. Nevertheless, a high comorbidity level (ie, Charlson index), multi-organ failure, and the need for extra-renal support at the early phase of intensive care could be considered as predictors of death.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and prevention of sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Context Recently, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been promoted for prevention of sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, the effectiveness and appropriate selection of patients for this therapy is incompletely resolved.
   Objective To study the relationship between clinical risk profile and incidence and efficacy of ICD intervention in HCM.
   Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter registry study of ICDs implanted between 1986 and 2003 in 506 unrelated patients with HCM. Patients were judged to be at high risk for sudden death; had received ICDs; underwent evaluation at 42 referral and nonreferral institutions in the United States, Europe, and Australia; and had a mean follow-up of 3.7 (SD, 2.8) years. Measured risk factors for sudden death included family history of sudden death, massive left ventricular hypertrophy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, and unexplained prior syncope.
   Main Outcome Measure Appropriate ICD intervention terminating ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
   Results The 506 patients were predominately young ( mean age, 42 [ SD, 17] years) at implantation, and most ( 439 [87%]) had no or only mildly limiting symptoms. ICD interventions appropriately terminated ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 103 patients (20%). Intervention rates were 10.6% per year for secondary prevention after cardiac arrest (5-year cumulative probability, 39% [ SD, 5%]), and 3.6% per year for primary prevention (5-year probability, 17% [ SD, 2%]). Time to first appropriate discharge was up to 10 years, with a 27% ( SD, 7%) probability 5 years or more after implantation. For primary prevention, 18 of the 51 patients with appropriate ICD interventions (35%) had undergone implantation for only a single risk factor; likelihood of appropriate discharge was similar in patients with 1, 2, or 3 or more risk markers (3.83, 2.65, and 4.82 per 100 person-years, respectively; P=.77). The single sudden death due to an arrhythmia ( in the absence of advanced heart failure) resulted from ICD malfunction. ICD complications included inappropriate shocks in 136 patients ( 27%).
   Conclusions In a high-risk HCM cohort, ICD interventions for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias were frequent and highly effective in restoring normal rhythm. An important proportion of ICD discharges occurred in primary prevention patients who had undergone implantation for a single risk factor. Therefore, a single marker of high risk for sudden death may be sufficient to justify consideration for prophylactic defibrillator implantation in selected patients with HCM.

TI  - Thresholded area over the curve of spectrometric tissue oxygen saturation as an indicator of volume resuscitability in porcine hemorrhagic shock
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 20th Annual Meeting of the Eastern-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - Background: A rapid, reliable, and noninvasive functional measure of responsiveness to resuscitation in posttraumatic hemorrhagic shock could prove useful in guiding therapy, especially under circumstances such as the battlefield and civilian mass casualties. Tissue oxygen saturation (Sto(2)) is a promising candidate for this application. We therefore explored the value of peripheral muscle Sto(2) in predicting systemic responsiveness to colloid volume resuscitation in a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock.
   Methods: Fourteen isofluraneanesthetized piglets were subjected to a standardized hemorrhage protocol that maintained mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 30 and 40 mm Hg. Asanguineous resuscitation with a volume of Hextend equal to the total volume bled was initiated when compensation was exhausted (MAP < 30 mm Hg). We recorded continuous MAP and Sto(2) values, and calculated the contiguous area over the Sto, curve yet below a given threshold of Sto(2) (TAOC) as a function of this threshold before the selected timepoint for timepoints up to 30 minutes before resuscitation.
   Results: Hemorrhage resulted in significant fluctuations of MAP and high interindividual variability of disease dynamics and outcome: 4 nonsurvivors and 10 survivors at 2 hours postresuscitation. Sto, measurements reflected hemodynamic conditions in most animals, with a pronounced drop preceding final decompensation in 7 of 14 animals. TAOC discriminated three of four nonresuscitable (nonsurvivor) animals from the survivors, with group differences reaching significance even for the earliest examined timepoint (30 minutes before resuscitation), depending on the choice of TAOC threshold.
   Conclusions: Sto(2) may serve as a marker of decompensation, whereas TAOC, a physiologically motivated correlate of perfusion debt and cumulative hypoperfusion injury, may be a useful early indicator of responsiveness to volume resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock.

TI  - Hypertonic saline for fluid resuscitation after cardiac surgery (HERACLES): study protocol for a preliminary randomised controlled clinical trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundIntraoperative and postoperative management of cardiac surgery patients is complex, involving the application of differential vasopressors and volume therapy. It has been shown that a positive fluid balance has a major impact on postoperative outcome. Today, the advantages and disadvantages of buffered crystalloid solutes are a topic of controversy, with no consensus being reached so far. The use of hypertonic saline (HS) has shown promising results with respect to lower total fluid balance and postoperative weight gain in critically ill patients in preliminary studies. However, collection of more data on HS in critically ill patients seems warranted. This preliminary study aims to investigate whether fluid resuscitation using HS in patients following cardiac surgery results in less total fluid volume being administered.MethodsIn a prospective double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial, we aim to recruit 96 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery for ischaemic and/or valvular heart disease. After postoperative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), patients will be randomly assigned to receive 5ml/kg ideal body weight HS (7.3% NaCl) or normal saline (NS, 0.9% NaCl) infused within 60min. Blood and urine samples will be collected preoperatively and postoperatively up to day 6 to assess changes in renal, cardiac, inflammatory, acid-base, and electrolyte parameters. Additionally, we will perform renal ultrasonography studies to assess renal blood flow before, during, and after infusion, and we will measure total body water using preoperative and postoperative body composition analysis (bioimpedance). Patients will be followed up for 90days.DiscussionThe key objective of this study is to assess the cumulative amount of fluid administered in the intervention (HS) group versus control (NS) group during the ICU stay. In this preliminary, prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial we will test the hypothesis that use of HS results in less total fluids infused and less postoperative weight gain when compared to the standard of intensive care in cardiac surgery patients.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03280745.

TI  - Progressive gastric intramucosal acidosis follows resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - The time course of gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) during the early phase of resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock has not been adequately characterized. We examined pHi using gastric tonometry catheters in an anesthetized dog model of hemorrhagic shock, Shock was induced in 10 animals to maintain mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at 40-45 mmHg for 30 min, followed by transfusion of shed blood plus additional saline as needed to maintain MAP at pre-shock values. Five animals served as controls. Baseline pHi values were nearly identical in both groups. Resuscitation promptly restored MAP. Following a precipitous drop of pHi during shock, there was only partial recovery 60 min post-shock, followed by progressive worsening of intramucosal acidosis (7.02 +/- .10 vs, 6.82 +/- .24 at 60 and 210 min post-shock, respectively; p < .002). MAP, heart rate, and pHi did not change significantly during the experiment in the control group. These results indicate that prompt and adequate MAP response to resuscitation failed to prevent significant decreases of pHi in the first few hours post-resuscitation. This finding may be related to persistent splanchnic hypoperfusion or reperfusion injury.

TI  - Ethics and Health Policy of Dialyzing a Patient in a Persistent Vegetative State
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
AB  - Each year, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in approximately 300,000 Americans. Of these patients, less than 10% survive. Survivors often live with neurologic impairments that neurologists classify as anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (AIE). Neurologic impairments under AIE can vary widely, each with unique outcomes. According to the American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter paper, the definition of poor outcome in AIE includes death, persistent vegetative state (PVS), or severe disability requiring full nursing care 6 months after event. In a recent survey, participants deemed an outcome of PVS as "worse than dead." Lay persons' assessments of quality of life for those in a PVS provide assistance for surrogate decision-makers who are confronted with the clinical decision-making for a loved one in a PVS, whereas clinical practice guidelines help health care providers to make decisions with patients and/or families. In 2000, the Renal Physicians Association and the American Society of Nephrology published a clinical practice guideline, "Shared Decision-Making in the Appropriate Initiation of and Withdrawal from Dialysis." In 2010, after advances in research, a second edition of the guideline was published. The updated guideline confirmed the recommendation to withhold or withdraw ongoing dialysis in "patients with irreversible, profound neurological impairments such that they lack signs of thought, sensation, purposeful behavior and awareness of self and environment," such as found in patients with PVS. Here, the authors discuss the applicability of this guideline to patients in a PVS. In addition, they build on the guideline's conception of shared decision-making and discuss how continued dialysis violates ethical and legal principles of care in patients in a PVS.

TI  - The impact of preterm birth &lt;37 weeks on parents and families: a cross-sectional study in the 2 years after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit
T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: Little is known about the quality of life of parents and families of preterm infants after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Our aims were (1) to describe the impact of preterm birth on parents and families and (2) and to identify potentially modifiable determinants of parent and family impact.
   Methods: We surveyed 196 parents of preterm infants < 24 months corrected age in 3 specialty clinics (82% response rate). Primary outcomes were: (1) the Impact on Family Scale total score; and (2) the Infant Toddler Quality of Life parent emotion and (3) time limitations scores. Potentially modifiable factors were use of community-based services, financial burdens, and health-related social problems. We estimated associations of potentially modifiable factors with outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographic and infant characteristics using linear regression.
   Results: Median (inter-quartile range) infant gestational age was 28 (26-31) weeks. Higher Impact on Family scores (indicating worse effects on family functioning) were associated with taking >= 3 unpaid hours/week off from work, increased debt, financial worry, unsafe home environment and social isolation. Lower parent emotion scores (indicating greater impact on the parent) were also associated with social isolation and unpaid time off from work. Lower parent time limitations scores were associated with social isolation, unpaid time off from work, financial worry, and an unsafe home environment. In contrast, higher parent time limitations scores (indicating less impact) were associated with enrollment in early intervention and Medicaid.
   Conclusions: Interventions to reduce social isolation, lessen financial burden, improve home safety, and increase enrollment in early intervention and Medicaid all have the potential to lessen the impact of preterm birth on parents and families.

TI  - Guizhi Fuling Wan, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ameliorates Insulin Sensitivity in PCOS Model Rats With Insulin Resistance via Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease with reproductive dysfunction and metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age. Gastrointestinal microbiome contributes to PCOS through mediating insulin resistance. Guizhi Fuling Wan, Chinese herbal medicine, can treat PCOS with insulin resistance (PCOS-IR), but the underlying mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study was to characterize the exact mechanism of Guizhi Fuling Wan action and whether it is related to the regulation of intestinal flora structure. We induced PCOS-IR rat model by means of letrozole sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-na) solution combined with high-fat emulsion administration and randomly divided it into blank control group (K), model control group (M), low dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (D), middle dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (Z), high dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (G) and positive drug (Metformin) control group (Y). After 36 days of modeling and treatment, serum and stool samples from all rats were collected for a follow-up analysis. The data display that, compared with K group, elevated testosterone and HOMA-IR, turbulent estrous cycles and polycystic ovaries in M group, indicating the PCOS-IR rat model is successfully established. Increased fasting insulin is associated with higher inflammation(plasma TNF-alpha, IL-6, and HS-CPR concentration were determined) in M group, and the altered intestinal flora (compared with the K group, in M group the relative abundance ofAlloprevotellawas decreased significantly, while the relative abundance ofLachnospiraceae UCG-008, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Lactobacillus, Ruminiclostridium 9, andRuminococcaceae UCG-003was increased significantly) induced the secretion of inflammatory markers. On the other hand, Guizhi Fuling Wan can alleviate inflammation, improve insulin resistence: Lower inflammation decreased fasting insulin can be seen in G group compared with M group, this effect is related to the regulating effect of Guizhi Fuling Wan on intestinal flora (in G group, the relative abundance ofAlloprevotella, Ruminococcaceae UCG-003, andLachnospiraceae UCG-008was increased significantly, compared with M group). This research demonstrates Guizhi Fuling Wan improve insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome with the underlying mechanism of regulating intestinal flora to control inflammation. It would be useful to promote the therapeutic effect of Guizhi Fuling Wan on PCOS-IR.

TI  - Understanding Your Baby: protocol for a controlled parallel group study of a universal home-based educational program for first time parents
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background: Infant mental health represents a significant public health issue. The transition to parenthood provides optimal opportunities for supporting parenting competence. Especially parental mentalization, i.e. the caregiver's ability to notice and interpret the child's behavior in terms of mental states, is important in infancy where the caregiver-infant communication is based solely on the infant's behavioral cues.
   Methods: This study evaluates the efficacy of the intervention Understanding Your Baby (UYB) compared to Care As Usual (CAU) in 10 Danish municipalities. UYB aims at promoting parental competence in new parents by supporting them in noticing their infants' behavioral cues and interpreting them in terms of mental states. Participants will be approximately 1,130 singletons and their parents. Inclusion criteria are first-time parents, minimum 18 years old, living in one of the 10 municipalities, and registered in the Danish Civil Registration Register (CPR). Around 230 health visitors deliver the UYB as part of their routine observation of infant social withdrawal in the Danish home visiting program. During an interaction between the health visitor and the infant, the health visitor articulates specific infant behaviors and helps the caregivers interpret these behaviors to mental states. The study is a controlled parallel group study with data obtained at four time points in two phases: First in the control group receiving the publicly available postnatal care (CAU), secondly in the intervention group after UYB implementation into the existing postnatal services. The primary outcome is maternal competence. Secondary measures include paternal competence, parental stress, parental mentalizing, and infant socioemotional development. Analysis will employ survey data and data from the health visitors' register.
   Discussion: Results will provide evidence regarding the efficacy of UYB in promoting parenting competences. If proved effective, the study will represent a notable advance to initiating the UYB intervention as part of a better infant mental health strategy in Denmark. Conversely, if UYB is inferior to CAU, this is also important knowledge in regard to promoting parenting competence and infant mental health in a general population.

TI  - Expanded application of wearable cardioverter defibrillators beyond current guidelines: proposal for a European register explained through single clinical scenarios
T2  - OPEN HEART
AB  - The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is becoming a more and more widely used instrument for the prevention of sudden cardiac death of patients either with a secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator indication or with a transient high risk of sudden cardiac death. Although clinical practice has demonstrated a benefit of protecting patients for a period as long as 3-6 months with such devices, the current European guidelines concerning ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are still extremely restrictive in the patient selection in part because of the costs derived from such a prevention device, in part because of the lack of robust randomised trials. To illustrate expanded use cases for the WCD, four real-life clinical cases are presented where patients received the device slightly outside the established guidelines. These cases demonstrate the broader utility of WCDs in situations involving acute myocarditis, thyrotoxicosis, pre-excited atrial fibrillation and awaiting staging/prognosis of a lung tumour. The findings prompt expansion of the existing guidelines for WCD use to efficiently protect more patients whose risk of arrhythmic cardiac death is transient or uncertain. This could be achieved by establishing a European register of the patients who receive a WCD for further analysis.

TI  - Neuronal damage in rat brain and spinal cord after cardiac arrest and massive hemorrhagic shock
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Severe global ischemia often results in severe damage to the central nervous system of survivors. Hind-limb paralysis is a common deficit caused by global ischemia. Until recently, most studies of global ischemia of the central nervous system have examined either the brain or spinal cord, but not both. Spinal cord damage specifically after global ischemia has not been studied in detail. Because the exact nature of the neuronal damage to the spinal cord and the differences in neuronal damage between the brain and spinal cord after global ischemia are poorly understood, we developed a new global ischemia model in the rat and specifically studied spinal cord damage after global ischemia. Further, we compared the different forms of neuronal damage between the brain and spinal cord after global ischemia.
   Design: Randomized, controlled study using three different global ischemia models in the rat.
   Setting. University research laboratory.
   Subjects: Male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g).
   Interventions. Animals were divided into three experimental groups, group A (n = 6, survived for 7 days), 12 mins, of hemorrhagic shock; group B (n = 6, survived for 7 days), 5 mins of cardiac arrest; or group C (n = 6, each for 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days), 7 mins of hemorrhagic shock and 5 mins of cardiac arrest. Motor deficit of the hind limbs was studied 6 hrs to 7 days after resuscitation. Also, nonoperated animals (n = 6) were used as the control. Histologic analysis (hematoxylin and eosin, Fluoro-Jade B, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP end-labeling [TUNEL], Kluver-Barrera) and ultrastructural analysis using electron microscopy were performed on samples from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and lumbar spinal cord. Demyelination of the white matter of the lumbar spinal cord was analyzed semiquantitatively using Scion Image software.
   Main Results., No paraplegic animals were observed in either group A or B. All group C animals showed severe hind-limb paralysis. Severe neuronal damage was found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in all groups, and the state of delayed neuronal cell death was similar among the three groups. Neuronal damage in the lumbar spinal cord was detected only in group C animals, mainly in the dorsal horn and intermediate gray matter. Demyelination was prominent in the ventral and ventrolateral white matter in group C. A significant difference was observed between control and group C rats with Scion Image software. Ultrastructural analysis revealed extensive necrotic cell death in the intermediate gray matter in the lumbar spinal cord in group C rats.
   Conclusion: The combination in the global ischemia model (i.e., hemorrhagic shock followed by cardiac arrest) caused severe neuronal damage in the central nervous system. Thereby, hind-limb paralysis after global ischemia might result from spinal cord damage. These results suggest that therapeutic strategies for preventing spinal cord injury are necessary when treating patents with severe global ischemia.

TI  - Microvolt T wave alternans - a new method for assessment of ventricular repolarization abnormalities
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KARDIOLOGIE
AB  - Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death is hampered by the inability to accurately identify high risk patients. Various noninvasive methods such as determination of left ventricular function or heart rate variability as well as invasive electrophysiologic testing are currently used for risk stratification. Noninvasive measurement of microvolt. T wave alternans (TWA) is a promising new method to assess repolarization abnormalities; in experimental studies, TWA was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Since the occurrence of TWA is heart rate-dependent, it is measured either during atrial pacing or during exercise stress testing. The first clinical validation of the method was performed in patients undergoing invasive EP testing to assess prediction of inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A first prospective validation of the noninvasive method was performed in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest fitted with an ICD. Further studies have shown a good concordance between invasive and noninvasive TWA determination. The occurrence of TWA in this population was of predictive Value with respect to arrhythmia recurrence. Recently published data confirm the value of TWA assessment with respect to identification of patients with congestive heart failure at high risk of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The use of this method in post myocardial infarction risk stratification is currently under prospective evaluation.

TI  - PORTABLE ULTRASOUND FOR REMOTE ENVIRONMENTS, PART II: CURRENT INDICATIONS
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: With recent advances in ultrasound technology, it is now possible to deploy lightweight portable imaging devices in the field. Techniques and studies initially developed for hospital use have been extrapolated out of the hospital setting in a wide variety of environments in an effort to increase diagnostic accuracy in austere or prehospital environments. Objectives: This review summarizes current ultrasound applications used in out-of-hospital arenas and highlights existing evidence for such use. The diversity of applications and environments is organized by indication to better inform equipment selection as well as future directions for research and development. Discussion: Trauma evaluation, casualty triage, and assessment for pneumothorax, acute mountain sickness, and other applications have been studied by field medical teams. A wide range of outcomes have been reported, from alterations in patient care to determinations of accuracy compared to clinical judgment or other diagnostic modalities. Conclusions: The use of lightweight portable ultrasound shows great promise in augmenting clinical assessment for field medical operations. Although some studies of diagnostic accuracy exist in this setting, further research focused on clinically relevant outcomes data is needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Changes in the selected reproductive health indicators among married women of reproductive age in low performing areas of Bangladesh: findings from an evaluation study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Three-year duration Demand-Based Reproductive Commodity Project (DBRHCP) was launched in three low performing areas: rural Nabiganj (population 323,357), Raipur (population 260,983) and urban slum in Dhaka (population 141,912). Objectives: Assessing changes in knowledge among married women of reproductive age on selected reproductive health issues and to explore their service utilization patterns over the project period in selected low performing areas of Bangladesh.
   Methods: The study adopted a pre-posts design. In the project areas, the entire chain of service provision were modified through the interventions under the DBRHCP, including training of the providers, enhanced behavioral change communication activities, follow-up and counseling, record keeping, reporting and monitoring, as well as improvement in logistics and supplies. Peer promoters were established as linkages between clients and service providers. All households were enlisted. Baseline and end line surveys were done using representative simple random sampling method, capturing changes over one year intervention period. Descriptive analysis was done using SPSS package, version 10. Proportional tests using Stata, version 8 were done to assess changes from baseline to end line.
   Results: The overall contraceptive prevalence was markedly different in the three study areas but significantly increased in both Dhaka urban slums and Nabiganj. In the rural areas, a higher proportion of the women in endline compared to baseline obtained contraceptive methods from the public sectors. Irrespective of study sites, significantly higher proportion of women received ANC (Antenatal Care) and PNC (Post natal care) in endline compared to baseline. In all study sites higher proportions of women were aware of maternal complications at endline. Services were obtained from qualified persons for reported symptoms of sexually transmitted infections by a higher proportion of women at endline compared to baseline. There were improvements in other RH indicators, such as use of skilled birth attendants and overall utilization of health care facilities by women.
   Conclusions: The improvements in several important RH indicators in the intervention areas suggest that the interventions affected selected outcomes reported in the study. The study findings also suggest that investment in the reproductive health sector, particularly in existing government programs, improves RH outcomes.

TI  - Radiographic assessment of lung edema (RALE) score is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock and refractory cardiac arrest after percutaneous implantation of extracorporeal life support
T2  - INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - VA-ECMO is a promising therapeutic option in refractory cardiogenic shock (RCS) and refractory cardiac arrest (RCA). However, increase in left ventricular afterload enhances further reduction of LV contractility and pulmonary edema. The aim of this study was to evaluate pulmonary edema based on the RALE score and the prognostic value of the score on ECLS weaning and mortality. In this retrospective study, data from 40 patients (16 RCAs and 24 RCSs) were analyzed. Demographic, clinical data and the RALE score for evaluating pulmonary edema were assessed. Descriptive statistics, intraclass correlation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed. Weaning from ECLS was successful in 30 (75%) patients, 16 patients (40%) were discharged alive. Overall, the survivors were younger, presenting with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (30 +/- 2% vs.23 +/- 9%;p < 0.01) and a lower initial serum lactate concentration 7.7 +/- 4.5 mmol/l vs. 11.5 +/- 4.9 mmol/l; p = 0.017). Survivors had lower RALE scores than non-survivors (16.3 +/- 9.4 vs. 26.4 +/- 10.4; p = 0.0034). The interobserver variability of the RALE score was good (0.832). The AUC predicting mortality and weaning from ECLS presented comparable results to the established parameters (SAVE, serum lactate). Implementation of the RALE score could support prediction of outcome parameters during VA-ECMO therapy.

TI  - The Electrographic Effects of Ketamine on Patients With Refractory Status Epilepticus After Cardiac Arrest: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose:To investigate the effects of ketamine on patients with refractory status epilepticus after cardiac arrest.Methods:In this retrospective cohort, selected EEG segments from patients after cardiac arrest were classified into different EEG patterns (based on background continuity and burden of epileptiform discharges) and spectral profiles (based on the presence of frequency components). For patients who received ketamine, EEG data were compared before, during, and after ketamine infusion; for the no-ketamine group, EEG data were compared at three separated time points during recording. Ketamine usage was determined by clinical providers. Electrographic improvement in epileptiform activity was scored, and the odds ratio was calculated using the Fisher exact test. Functional outcome measures at time of discharge were also examined.Results:Of a total of 38 patients with postcardiac arrest refractory status epilepticus, 13 received ketamine and 25 did not. All patients were on >= 2 antiseizure medications including at least one sedative infusion (midazolam). For the ketamine group, eight patients had electrographic improvement, compared with only two patients in the no-ketamine group, with an odds ratio of 7.19 (95% confidence interval 1.16-44.65, P value of 0.0341) for ketamine versus no ketamine. Most of the patients who received ketamine had myoclonic status epilepticus, and overall neurologic outcomes were poor with no patients having a favorable outcome.Conclusions:For postarrest refractory status epilepticus, ketamine use was associated with electrographic improvement, but with the available data, it is unclear whether ketamine use or EEG improvement can be linked to better functional recovery.

TI  - Compound risk: History of traumatic stress predicts posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and severity in sudden cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) survivors can develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of PTSD in a large sample of SCA survivors. Prior history of psychological trauma and the effects of repeated trauma exposure on subsequent PTSD and symptom severity after SCA were also explored.
   Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 188 SCA survivors from the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association patient registry completed an online questionnaire that included measures of PTSD, trauma history, sociodemographics, general health, and cardiac history.
   Results: Sixty-three (36.2%) SCA survivors in this sample scored above the clinical cutoff for PTSD. Female gender, worse general health, and younger age predicted PTSD symptoms after SCA. Additionally, 50.2% of SCA survivors (n = 95) reported a history of trauma exposure and 25.4% (n = 48) of the total sample endorsed a traumatic stress response to a historic trauma. Results indicated that a traumatic stress response to a historic trauma was a stronger predictor of PTSD after SCA (odds ratio = 4.77) than all other variables in the model.
   Conclusions: PTSD symptoms are present in over one-third of SCA survivors. While demographic or health history variables predicted PTSD after SCA, a history of traumatic stress response to a previous trauma emerged as the strongest predictor of these symptoms. Routine assessment and interdisciplinary management are discussed as potential ways to expedite survivors' recovery and return to daily living.

TI  - Characteristics of Iraqi Patients Treated During Operation Inherent Resolve by a Forward Surgical Team
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
CP  - Military Health Sciences System Research Symposium (MHSRS)
AB  - Introduction The combat experience during the re-entry stages of Operation Inherent Resolve was distinct from other recent operations, but there is no published literature regarding these initial entry operations experiences among forward surgical teams (FSTs) deployed to Role 2 facilities A descriptive analysis of patients treated by FSTs may provide valuable information for Role 2 surgical teams preparing to deploy in support of initial entry operations. The purpose of this analysis was to describe injury mechanism, wounding patterns and interventions performed by a small FST in the re-entry phase in Iraq.
   Materials and Methods From July 17, 2015 to January 31, 2016, a split surgical team with two surgeons and an ER physician documented care for all patients treated by their FST located in Iraq. Given their austere environment, FSTs have limited holding capacity, blood supply, and ability to triage and perform advanced procedures. Patients, who arrived to the Role 2 in asystole, were ineligible for the study. The patient population was Iraqi Security Forces as well as Iraqi civilians. No follow-up data were obtained. Using descriptive statistics, we described the basic demographics, health status, blood utilization, injury severity, and injury pattern of the patient population.
   Results The final study population included 300 Iraqi casualties. The majority of patients (96%) were discharged alive. Many patients were 16 years or older (96%), male (96%), Iraqi soldiers (86%), and injured during battle (96%). Over one-third of patients (35%) had a form of metabolic acidosis, 7% were hypothermic, and 18% were in shock at admission. The median amount of blood products used was 6 (interquartile ranges (IQR) = 2-12) units, while the median red blood cells:fresh frozen plasma ratio was 1.2:1. Six or more units of blood were given to 67 (22%) patients. The top three diagnoses were laceration (n = 197, 21%), penetrating injury (n = 185, 19%), and fracture (n = 174, 18%). A high number of injuries occurred in the extremities/pelvis and buttocks (n = 360, 38%) and in the abdomen and pelvic contents (n = 145, 15%). Over a quarter of patients (26%) had critical injuries (i.e., military injury severity score 25).
   Conclusions Given the Role 2 configuration, these results demonstrate FSTs must be capable of managing critically ill patients with markedly limited resources. This management will include general operations in both adult and pediatric patients, resuscitation with a limited blood supply, and patient assessment with minimal to no diagnostic tools. This analysis can inform resident training, pre-deployment training, as well as sustainment training for surgeons after residency.

TI  - IMPROVED CLINICAL SUPERVISION AND USE OF WORKPLACE-BASED ASSESSMENTS TO OPTIMISE THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONER TRAINEES DURING NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ROTATIONS
T2  - ICERI2014: 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
CP  - 7th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - The Royal College of General Practitioner (RCGP) has required General Practitioner (GP) trainees in the United Kingdom (UK) to complete a three-year mandatory training programme since 2008. Following the government's promotion of 'Better Care, Better Lives' strategy for children with complex needs in 2008, the RCGP further published the 'RCGP Child Health Strategy 2010-2015', recommending all GPs to gather adequate clinical experience to ensure their competencies in assessing a sick child. In order to achieve these competences, GP trainees are trained in Paediatric speciality in a hospital setting as part of their integrated curriculum. This includes working in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
   During their NICU placement, trainees are expected to acquire the full responsibility of a paediatric trainee, including writing neonatal ward round summaries, attending resuscitation of newborn deliveries, identifying sick neonates, performing neonatal cannulation and managing ventilated preterm neonates. This has presented various training challenges. For example, GP trainees may be rushed through their learning objectives as a result of their short duration of placement on NICU. The frequent changeover of inexperienced trainees can also be more disruptive to the continuity of patient care and raises the question of patient safety being compromised. Other issues such as training opportunities may be commonly reserved for paediatric trainees when GP trainees are on-call at the same time. The shift system of working due to the European Working Time Directive has further limited their training opportunities.
   As Acute Paediatrics and Neonatology is a highly specialised field, the pressure and workload of the intensive care environment may be particularly challenging for GP trainees. Indeed, apart from becoming accustomed to a new working environment with established organisational culture and policies, trainees are also expected to learn new practical knowledge and skills. Stress and anxiety can affect attention, effectiveness and decision-making skills (Smith, 1990; Askenasy et al., 1996; Lehner et al., 1997).
   Is it possible to provide effective GP training in a NICU setting whilst delivering safe and high quality patient care? The ultimate goal of medical staff training and education is to ensure and safeguard patient safety in long term. However, its potential contribution to risks or health-associated injury should not be taken lightly (Battles, 2006). These risks can be decreased to minimum through close clinical supervision and utilisation of an assessment feedback tool.
   This leads to our next question of how a robust system can be built in order to achieve high standard of workplace based learning experience whilst delivering excellent patient care through clinical supervision and effective use of workplace-based assessment (WBA).
   As current workplace-based training has shaped towards 'situated learning', most social-cultural theorists have proposed various contextual factors (e.g. social and organisational culture and policies) and learner's capability and adaptability as causes influencing learners' performance at work. General attributes that may ensure successful learning include motivation, calm response in acute situations, efficient prioritisation and management skills, and ability to work in a team. WBAs can be powerful tools both to monitor and encourage development of these skills. However, given the multipurpose use of WBAs and lack of effective feedback and clinical supervision, WBAs largely fail at present to effectively aid learning.
   Fundamental changes have to be made to achieve effective utilisation of WBAs through close clinical supervision and guidance. This includes encouraging supervised learning by completing WBA tools, which should be designed to assess specific skills at workplace including team working, handover accuracy, leadership skills and clinical management.
   Further studies are required to optimise the utilisation of WBAs for paediatric training in the UK.

TI  - Epidemiologic Characteristics and Management of Sepsis Among Previously Healthy Patients
T2  - CHEST CRITICAL CARE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most deaths resulting from sepsis occur among patients with advanced age, multiple morbidities, or frailty. It is unclear how many sepsis-related deaths truly are preventable. Previously healthy patients may provide insight into preventable sepsis mortality. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes associated with previously healthy patients with sepsis? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized for community-onset sepsis at 66 Michigan hospitals (November 2020-January 2024). We developed major and minor criteria to classify patients as previously healthy vs having significant comorbidities. We compared baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes of previously healthy patients vs patients with comorbid sepsis. Physicians reviewed charts of previously healthy patients with in-hospital death to evaluate baseline health status and rate preventability of death. RESULTS: Of 29,688 patients hospitalized for sepsis, 2,963 patients (10.0%) were classified as previously healthy. Previously healthy patients had median age of 53 years, a median of 2 minor comorbidities, and lower in-hospital mortality (5.8% vs 12.7%; P < .01) vs comorbid patients. Delivery of guideline-recommended early sepsis management ranged from 56.8% to 80.9% across individual care practices. Several care practices were less common among previously healthy patients, including lactate measurement (67.5% vs 73.8%; P < .01) and timely antibiotic administration (58.0% vs 66.3%; P < .01), whereas some were more common, including $ 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation (72.4% vs 55.3%; P < .01). Among 48 charts of previously healthy decedents reviewed, 77.1% of patients were deemed to have life expectancy > 5 years without sepsis. Most deaths were judged to be unpreventable because of severity of illness on presentation. INTERPRETATION: We found that 1 in 10 patients with community-onset sepsis was healthy previously. Although gaps in in-hospital management were identified, deaths among previously healthy patients generally were deemed unpreventable with better in-hospital management because of patients seeking treatment too late in the course of sepsis. This study highlights system-level opportunities for better recognition and triage of sepsis before hospitalization.

The use of didactic materials specifically developed by the research team is effective in helping schoolchildren acquire emergency call skills. A sequential learning approach allows the training to be tailored to the cognitive development and learning capacity of different age groups. What is the implication of the main finding? This methodology enables schoolchildren to recognise emergency situations and initiate an EMS call, although some challenges remain in activating the hands-free function. These findings support the development of evidence-based recommendations for basic life support training in school settings.Abstract Background/Objectives: More than half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur at home and are witnessed by family members, who must promptly call the Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The aim of this study was to assess the learning outcomes of an interactive school-based training activity focused specifically on the EMS call. Methods: A single-group, post-test-only simulation study was conducted in five Spanish schools. Participating schoolchildren received basic life support (BLS) training from their Physical Education teachers, integrated into the regular school schedule and following the Kids Save Lives recommendations. An innovative didactic resource (the "BLS Endless Book") was used to support active learning. Children's performance was evaluated in a simulated scenario using a standardized checklist. Results: A total of 1341 children aged 6 to 14 years participated. In the simulated scenario, more than 90% of participants were able to recognize the emergency and correctly identified and dialed the national emergency number. However, less than 50% were able to activate the hands-free function (with younger children experiencing more difficulty). During the call, 99.0% stated their full name, and 82.0% provided their complete address. Conclusions: A short, focused BLS training led at school by physical education teachers and based on an interactive, easy-to-use, didactic tool is effective in educating 6-14-year-old schoolchildren to correctly perform an immediate EMS call in case of cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, schoolchildren may require reinforcement training focused on hands-free operation and on providing the correct address.

TI  - Methods and clinical applications of targeted temperature management
T2  - NEUROLOGY ASIA
AB  - Hypoxic/ischemic brain damage is well-known catastrophic injury. The specific treatment, so-called neuroprotective therapy, aims to prevent or diminish this havoc damage. However, approved neuroprotective therapy in clinical practice is limited. Targeted temperature management (TTM) shows the most promising neuroprotective therapy. Moreover, TTM is also useful for intracranial pressure (ICP) control. Many methods of TTM have been reported. TTM can apply to several clinical conditions associated with hypoxic/ischemic brain injury or elevated intracranial pressure.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in post-traumatic cardiopulmonary failure A 10-year single institutional experience
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Patients with multiple traumas associated with cardiopulmonary failure have a high mortality rate; however, such patients can be temporarily stabilized using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), providing a bridge to rescue therapy. Using a retrospective study design, we aimed to clarify the prognostic factors of post-traumatic ECMO support.
   From March 2006 to July 2016, 43 adult patients (mean age, 37.3+/-15.2 years; 7 females [16.3%]) underwent ECMO because of post-traumatic cardiopulmonary failure. Pre-ECMO demographics, peri-ECMO events, and post-ECMO recoveries were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors.
   The most common traumatic insult was traffic collision (n=30, 69.8%), and involved injury areas included the chest (n=33, 76.7%), head (n=14, 32.6%), abdomen (n=21, 48.8%), and fractures (n=21, 48.8%). Fifteen patients (34.9%) underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 22 (51.2%) received rescue interventions before ECMO deployment. The mean time interval between trauma and ECMO was 90.6+/-130.1 hours, and the mode of support was venovenous in 26 patients (60.5%). A total of 26 patients (60.5%) were weaned off of ECMO and 22 (51.6%) survived to discharge, with an overall mean support time of 162.9+/-182.7 hours. A multivariate regression analysis identified 2 significant predictors for in-hospital mortality: an injury severity score (ISS) >30 (odds ratio [OR], 9.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-18.47; P=0.042), and the requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT) during ECMO (OR, 8.64; 95% CI, 1.73-26.09; P=0.020). These two factors were also significant for the 1-year survival (ISS >30: 12.5%; ISS <= 30, 48.1%, P=0.001) (RRT required, 15.0%; RRT not required, 52.2%, P=0.006).
   Using ECMO in selected traumatized patients with cardiopulmonary failure can be a salvage therapy. Prompt intervention before shock-impaired systemic organ perfusion and acute renal failure, especially in high ISS patients, is crucial for both hospital and one-year survival.

TI  - Cardiac Surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Low-Weight or Preterm Neonates: A Retrospective Study Analyzing Early Outcome
T2  - CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
AB  - Background: Most outcome studies in congenital cardiac surgery for "low weight" neonates include patients undergoing surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The primary objective of our study was to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality in neonates weighing less than 3 Kg and undergoing surgery with CPB. In addition, we compared the effect of early surgery with CPB (before 37W-gestational age (GA)) for congenital heart disease to delayed surgery until a corrected GA of 37 weeks in an attempt to promote weight gain. Methods: Retrospective single-center study including all patients operated between 1997 and 2017. Uni-and multivariable analysis were used to analyze outcome. Results: 143 patients were included. The median weight was 2.7 Kg and 49 (34.3%) weighted <2.5 Kg. 80% of the patients were Risk stratification STAT categories >= 3. 114 patients (80%) were operated without delay (usual timing, median age 9 days), whereas 29 patients (20%) entered a delayed strat-egy (median age 30 days). In-hospital mortality was 21.7%. By multivariate analysis, dysmaturity, preoperative positive ventilation, post-operative ECMO requirement or resuscitation, and any residual lesion were predictors of in-hospital death. In-hospital mortality in the usual timing group and the delayed group were 21.1% and 24.1%, respectively (p = 0.71). In-hospital mortality for neonates operated prior to 37W-GA (n = 10) was 27.3%. Conclusions: Predictors of in-hospital mortality in neonates less 3 Kg requiring CPB surgery did not differ from those unveiled in other contemporary studies. Our data demonstrates that a strategy of delaying surgery in selected patients resulted in similar clinical outcome.

TI  - Two years after cardiac arrest; cognitive status, ADL function and living situation
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - Purpose: To describe cognitive function, activities of daily living (ADL), housing and return to work after cardiac arrest (CA) and examine the prognostic value of early assessments. Method: Two years after CA 22 persons were assessed with the Barrow Neurological Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS) and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data on early assessments of neurological status (The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS), mental status (the Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) and ADL ability (FIM) were retrieved. Results: Sixty-four per cent were living in their own home, 36% lived in sheltered accommodation and 29% of those of working age had returned to work. Cognitive dysfunction was noted in 95% according to neuropsychological screen. Four persons living in own homes were in need of assistance in social-cognitive ADL. All those in sheltered accommodation needed help in ADL; one was independent in motor functions. This need for assistance was reflected at initial assessments by a higher degree of neurological deficits, cognitive dysfunctions and dependency in ADL activities. Conclusion: The majority had persistent cognitive dysfunctions. Persons in sheltered accommodation were dependent for ADL. Early evaluation is important for understanding and planning for future need for assistance and care, having realistic goals.

TI  - Somatic and sociodemographic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with coronary artery disease - a secondary analysis of the SPIRR-CAD study
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - BackgroundDepressive symptoms are common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and are associated with an unfavourable outcome. Establishing prognostic patient profiles prior to the beginning of mental health care may facilitate higher efficacy of targeted interventions. The aim of the current study was to identify sociodemographic and somatic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with CAD.MethodsBased on the dataset of the multicentre SPIRR-CAD randomised controlled trial (n=570 patients with CAD and8 points on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), 141 potential sociodemographic and somatic predictors of the change in the HADS-D depression score from baseline to 18-month-follow-up were derived in two different ways. We screened for univariable association with response, using either analysis of (co)variance or logistic regression, respectively, both adjusted for baseline HADS-D value and treatment group. To guard against overfitting, multivariable association was evaluated by a linear or binomial (generalised) linear model with lasso regularisation, a machine learning approach. Outcome measures were the change in continuous HADS-D depression scores, as well as three established binary criteria. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated to assess possible influences of comorbidities on our results and was also entered in our machine learning approach.ResultsHigher age (p=0.002), unknown previous myocardial infarction (p=0.013), and a higher heart rate variability during numeracy tests (p=.020) were univariably associated with a favourable depression outcome, whereas hyperuricemia (p0.003), higher triglycerides (p=0.014), NYHA class III (p0.028), state after resuscitation (p0.042), intake of thyroid hormones (p=0.007), antidiabetic drugs (p=0.015), analgesic drugs (p=0.027), beta blockers (p=0.035), uric acid drugs (p0.039), and anticholinergic drugs (p=0.045) were associated with an adverse effect on the HADS-D depression score. In all analyses, no significant differences between study arms could be found and physical comorbidities also had no significant influence on our results.ConclusionOur findings may contribute to identification of somatic and sociodemographic predictors of depression outcome in patients with CAD. The unexpected effects of specific medication require further clarification and further research is needed to establish a causal association between depression outcome and our predictors.Trial registrationwww.clinicaltrials.govNCT00705965 (registered 27th of June, 2008).www.isrctn.comISRCTN76240576 (registered 27th of March, 2008).

TI  - A retrospective real-world single-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with selected limited-stage small-cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
AB  - Background: With the advancement of surgical techniques and the introduction of neoadjuvant therapies, the risk of recurrence or distant metastases has been significantly decreased for non-small-cell lung cancer (non-SCLC) after surgery. In recent years, the application of these advanced techniques and therapies in SCLC has also shown promise. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with surgery in selected limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). Methods: In this retrospective, single-arm clinical trial, we conducted a thorough review of electronic medical records from the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between December 2015 and December 2022. Patients with a pathological diagnosis of SCLC who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery were enrolled. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, specifics of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, survival outcomes, and safety profiles of included patients were systematically collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 47 patients [7 (14.89%) females and 40 (85.11%) males; median age 61.00 years, interquartile range (IQR), 55.50-67.50 years] were enrolled. The disease control rate was 100%, with an objective response rate of 70.21% and a downstaging rate of 65.9%. The percentage of patients with a complete pathological response (CPR) and major pathological response (MPR) was 10.64% (5/47) and 12.77% (6/47, excluding CPR), respectively. In subgroups stratified by baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, the MPR rate showed no significant differences, yet a trend toward higher MPR was observed among smoking patients. At the data cutoff (October 2, 2024), the median follow-up period was 35.367 months [IQR, 26.367 months-not reached (NR)]. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 16.27 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 12.20-30.53] and the median overall survival (OS) was NR, with 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates of 79.96% (95% CI: 68.36-93.52%), 71.39% (95% CI: 57.12-89.22%), and 64.90% (95% CI: 48.52-86.82%), respectively. The stratified analysis revealed that patients achieving an MPR and those undergoing postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy exhibited longer EFS and OS. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3-4 were observed in 21.28% of patients, with the most frequent occurrences being a decrease in neutrophil count (12.77%), followed by a decrease in platelet count (8.51%), and a decrease in white blood cell count (4.26%). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with surgery could be a potential treatment strategy for LS-SCLC, with a high proportion of patients achieving an MPR, and manageable safety profile, that did not compromise surgical resection. Further prospective clinical trials are warranted to delineate the benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and optimize LS-SCLC treatment.

TI  - Application of therapeutic hypothermia in the intensive care unit - Opportunities and pitfalls of a promising treatment modality - Part 2: Practical aspects and side effects
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Induced hypothermia can be used to protect the brain from post-ischemic and traumatic neurological injury. Potential clinical applications and the available evidence are discussed in a separate paper. This review focuses on the practical aspects of cooling and physiological changes induced by hypothermia, as well as the potential side effects that may develop. These side effects can be serious and, if not properly dealt with, may negate some or all of hypothermia's potential benefits. However, many of these side effects can be prevented or modified by high-quality intensive care treatment, which should include careful monitoring of fluid balance, tight control of metabolic aspects such as glucose and electrolyte levels, prevention of infectious complications and various other interventions. The speed and duration of cooling and rate of re-warming are key factors in determining whether hypothermia will be effective; however, the risk of side effects also increases with longer duration. Realizing hypothermia's full therapeutic potential will therefore require meticulous attention to the prevention and/or early treatment of side effects, as well as a basic knowledge and understanding of the underlying physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. These and other, related issues are dealt with in this review.

TI  - Case Report: Adjunctive hemoadsorption therapy in a patient with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and hyperinflammation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a transient, stress-related cardiac dysfunction that mimics acute coronary syndrome and is typically seen in postmenopausal women. While emotional and physical stressors are common triggers, inflammatory or infectious stimuli have also been proposed, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In the context of critical illness, systemic inflammation may exacerbate cardiac dysfunction and contribute to multiorgan failure. Hemoadsorption has emerged as a promising adjunctive therapy option aimed at mitigating hyperinflammation by removing circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, and has shown potential benefit in various inflammatory conditions.Case description A 77-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and a permanent pacemaker presented with acute dyspnea and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest. Post-resuscitation, she was found to have anterolateral ST elevations, apicomedial akinesis, and severely reduced LVEF (22%), consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, she developed worsening fever, marked hemodynamic instability, hyperlactatemia (14 mmol/L), atrial fibrillation, raising suspicion for a systemic hyperinflammatory response. Hemoadsorption therapy with CytoSorb was initiated in a stand-alone configuration, alongside corticosteroids and targeted temperature management. The patient showed marked improvement in hemodynamics, organ function, and urine output within 48 h, without the need for renal replacement therapy. She was later extubated and discharged home.Conclusion This case highlights a rare presentation of suspected inflammation-triggered Takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated by rapid clinical deterioration. The use of CytoSorb hemoadsorption was associated with stabilization of vital parameters and recovery of organ function. Although causality cannot be confirmed, this case supports the early consideration of hemoadsorption as a feasible and potentially beneficial adjunct in select critically ill patients with suspected hyperinflammation. Further research is needed to clarify its role in TCM and related syndromes.

TI  - Increasing survival rate from commotio cordis
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND Commotio cordis events due to precordial blows triggering ventricular fibrillation are a cause of sudden death (SD) during sports and also daily activities. Despite the absence of structural cardiac abnormalities, these events have been considered predominantly fatal with low survival rates.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether expected mortality rates for commotio cordis have changed over time, associated with greater public visibility.
   METHODS US Commotio Cordis Registry was accessed to tabulate frequency of reported SD or resuscitated cardiac arrest over 4 decades.
   RESULTS At their commotio cordis event, 216 study patients were 0.2-51 years old (mean age 15 +/- 9 years); 95% were mares. Death occurred in 156 individuals (72%), while the other 60 (28%) survived. Proportion of survivors increased steadily with concomitant decrease in fatal events. For the initial years (1970-1993), 6 of 59 cases survived (10%), while during 1994-2012, 54 of 157 (34%) survived (P = .001). The most recent 6 years, survival from commotio cordis was 31 of 53 (58%), with survivor and nonsurvivor curves ultimately crossing. Higher survival rates were associated with more prompt resuscitation (40% <3 minutes vs 5% >3 minutes; P < .001) and participation in competitive sports (39%; P < .001), but with lower rates in African Americans (1 of 24; 4%) than in whites (54 of 166; 33%; P = .004). Independent predictors of mortality were Mack race (P = .045) and participation in noncompetitive sports (P = .002), with an on-site automated external defibrillator use protective against SD (P = .01).
   CONCLUSIONS Survival from commotio cordis has increased, likely owing to more rapid response times and access to defibrillation, as well as greater public awareness of this condition.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of automated external defibrillators on airlines
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Context Installation of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) on passenger aircraft has been shown to improve survival of cardiac arrest in that setting, but the cost-effectiveness of such measures has not been proven.
   Objective To examine the costs and effectiveness of several different options for AED deployment in the US commercial air transportation system.
   Design, Setting, and Subjects Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis of a strategy of full deployment on all aircraft as well as several strategies of partial deployment only on larger aircraft, compared with a baseline strategy of no AEDs on aircraft (but training flight attendants in basic life support) for a hypothetical cohort of persons experiencing cardiac arrest aboard US commercial aircraft. Estimates for costs and outcomes were obtained from the medical literature, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Transport Association of America, a population-based cohort of Medicare patients, AED manufacturers, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Main Outcome Measures Quality-adjusted survival after cardiac arrest; costs of AED deployment on aircraft and of medical care for cardiac arrest survivors.
   Results Adding AEDs on passenger aircraft with more than 200 passengers would cost $35300 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Additional AEDs on aircraft with capacities between 100 and 200 persons would cost an additional $40800 per added QALY compared with deployment on large-capacity aircraft only, and full deployment on all passenger aircraft would cost an additional $94700 per QALY gained compared with limited deployment on aircraft with capacity greater than 100. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the quality of life, annual mortality rate, and the effectiveness of AEDs in improving survival were the most influential factors in the model. In 85% of Monte Carlo simulations, AED placement on large-capacity aircraft produced cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $50000 per QALY.
   Conclusion The cost-effectiveness of placing AEDs on commercial aircraft compares favorably with the cost-effectiveness of widely accepted medical interventions and health policy regulations, but is critically dependent on the passenger capacity of the aircraft. Placing AEDs on most US commercial aircraft would meet conventional standards of cost-effectiveness.

TI  - PLASMA RESUSCITATION PROMOTES COAGULATION HOMEOSTASIS FOLLOWING SHOCK-INDUCED HYPERCOAGULABILITY
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Background:Increased thrombin generation in injured patients possibly contributes to early consumption of coagulation factors, exacerbating hemorrhage. Identifying optimal resuscitation products for restoring plasma homeostasis following injury is important for improving management of these patients.Objectives:To determine the effects of crystalloid versus plasma resuscitation on thrombin generation in a rat model of trauma and hemorrhagic shock (HS).Patients/Methods:Rats were subjected to trauma and HS followed by resuscitation with Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) or fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Blood was collected at baseline, decompensation, and 3-h post-resuscitation. Thrombin generation was measured by calibrated automated thrombogram and antithrombin III (AT) by ELISA. In a prospective observational study, admission blood samples were collected on highest-level activation trauma patients and diluted with LR or FFP for thrombin generation analysis.Results:Resuscitation with LR resulted in persistent hypercoagulability; however, FFP resuscitation reversed this hypercoagulability to baseline thrombin generation or below. Plasma AT levels decreased following HS and remained low in rats receiving LR, but were corrected in rats receiving FFP. Similarly, in trauma patient plasma LR increased thrombin generation while FFP reduced it. However, results with AT-deficient plasma dilution were similar to LR. In patients with admission hypocoagulability, FFP slightly increased thrombin generation.Conclusions:HS in rats is associated with increased thrombin generation and resuscitation with FFP, not LR, reverses hypercoagulability. Dilution of trauma patient plasma with LR or FFP yielded similar results; however, the modulatory effects of FFP were attenuated when AT was absent. Importantly, FFP reduced thrombin generation in hypercoagulable patient plasma, but slightly increased thrombin generation in hypocoagulable patient plasma. Thus, FFP restores hemostatic balance following trauma and HS which is, in part, by delivering AT.

TI  - Absolute blood levels and kinetics of neurofilament light (NFL) chains for neurological prognosis in comatose patients after cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Introduction Despite current guidelines, the prognosis of comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA) remains indeterminate in approximately 50% of patients. Neurofilament light (NFL) chain, a biomarker of neuronal injury, appears to be a promising tool with better prognostic value compared to neuron-specific enolase (NSE). However, further studies are required. The objective was to evaluate the prognostic value of absolute blood levels and kinetics of NFL measured at 24, 48 and 72 h after CA to predict outcome. Methods A prospective study conducted at a tertiary CA center conducted between April 2023 and November 2024, including 67 comatose patients after CA with at least one blood NFL measurement. The primary outcome was neurological outcome according to the "best" modified Rankin scale (mRS) within 3 months, with a mRS 0-3 defining a good outcome. Results Participants were 64 years old (IQR [53-75]), and 67% were male. 60% of them had out-of-hospital CA and 42% had an initial shockable rhythm. NFL levels were significantly higher in patients with unfavorable outcome compared to those with favorable outcome at each time point (24 h: 256.0 [96.2-441.9] versus 37.9 [17.4-104.5] pg/mL, p < 0.001; 48 h: 1297.7 [137.6-3605.0] versus 36.4 [19.3-174.0] pg/mL, p < 0.001; 72 h: 1591.9 [350.6-4913.5] versus 49.3 [23.2-146.4] pg/mL, p < 0.001). NFL levels at 24 and 48 h showed moderate prognostic accuracy (AUC 0.80 and 0.88, respectively), while NFL at 72 h demonstrated high accuracy (AUC 0.90). For predicting poor outcome, NFL level at 24 h > 250 pg/mL had a specificity of 0.90 [0.75-0.90] and a sensitivity of 0.51 [0.35-0.67]. At 48 h, NFL > 383 pg/mL had a specificity of 0.94 [0.81-1.00] and a sensitivity of 0.66 [0.50-0.81]. At 72 h, NFL > 510 pg/mL presented a specificity of 1.00 [1.00-1.00] and a sensitivity of 0.74 [0.52-0.91]. To predict a good outcome, NFL levels < 82 pg/mL at 24 h, < 307 pg/mL at 48 h and < 459 pg/mL at 72 h after CA were the best compromise between specificity and sensitivity. NFL kinetic was not associated with neurological outcomes (AUC 0.50), whereas NSE kinetic measured between 24 and 72 h showed high prognostic accuracy (AUC 0.92). Conclusion In comatose patients after CA, NFL levels at 24, 48 and 72 h could predict both unfavorable and favorable outcomes. Conversely, only the kinetic of NSE levels between 24 and 72 h after CA was associated with neurological outcome.

TI  - Anaphylactic Shock After Intramuscular Diclofenac Sodium: A Case Report
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Diclofenac sodium is a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is widely used for acute and chronic pain management. Side effects, such as fixed drug eruption, asthmatic attack, and vasospastic angina, are commonly seen after the use of diclofenac sodium. However, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock secondary to injection of diclofenac sodium are rare. Our main aim in reporting this adverse event is to alert healthcare professionals to this potentially life-threatening adverse effect of diclofenac sodium and prompt use of adrenaline for treatment.

TI  - Insight into the use of tympanic temperature during target temperature management in emergency and critical care: a scoping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background Target temperature management (TTM) is suggested to reduce brain damage in the presence of global or local ischemia. Prompt TTM application may help to improve outcomes, but it is often hindered by technical problems, mainly related to the portability of cooling devices and temperature monitoring systems. Tympanic temperature (T-Ty) measurement may represent a practical, non-invasive approach for core temperature monitoring in emergency settings, but its accuracy under different TTM protocols is poorly characterized. The present scoping review aimed to collect the available evidence about T-Ty monitoring in TTM to describe the technique diffusion in various TTM contexts and its accuracy in comparison with other body sites under different cooling protocols and clinical conditions. Methods The scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched to identify studies conducted in the last 20 years, where T-Ty was measured in TTM context with specific focus on pre-hospital or in-hospital emergency settings. Results The systematic search identified 35 studies, 12 performing T-Ty measurements during TTM in healthy subjects, 17 in patients with acute cardiovascular events, and 6 in patients with acute neurological diseases. The studies showed that T-Ty was able to track temperature changes induced by either local or whole-body cooling approaches in both pre-hospital and in-hospital settings. Direct comparisons to other core temperature measurements from other body sites were available in 22 studies, which showed a faster and larger change of T-Ty upon TTM compared to other core temperature measurements. Direct brain temperature measurements were available only in 3 studies and showed a good correlation between T-Ty and brain temperature, although T-Ty displayed a tendency to overestimate cooling effects compared to brain temperature. Conclusions T-Ty was capable to track temperature changes under a variety of TTM protocols and clinical conditions in both pre-hospital and in-hospital settings. Due to the heterogeneity and paucity of comparative temperature data, future studies are needed to fully elucidate the advantages of T-Ty in emergency settings and its capability to track brain temperature.

TI  - Neurological Prognostication After Cardiac Arrest in the Era of Target Temperature Management
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this study is to provide an updated review on neurological prognostication in comatose patients after cardiac arrest in light of current targeted temperature management (TTM) strategies.Recent FindingsWith improved pre-hospital and hospital care, death due to cardiac arrest is decreasing. Yet, most survivors have poor neurological outcomes. While TTM has demonstrated to improve neurological outcomes, it may cloud our prognostic accuracy. A multimodal approach is currently used to diminish prognostic uncertainty.SummaryThe neurological examination remains the mainstay for prognosis after cardiac arrest. The combination electroencephalogram, somatosensory evoked potentials, and neuron-specific enolase improve prognostic accuracy, mostly in patients who underwent TTM. Quantitative analysis of pupillary reaction and EEG background variability, neuroimaging (CT perfusion and DWI-MRI), and middle/long-latency evoked potentials are promising methods that may further improve the precision of outcome prognostication.

TI  - Factors associated with perinatal and neonatal deaths in Sao Tome & Principe: a prospective cohort study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background Neonatal mortality reduction is a global goal, but its factors are seldom studied in most resource-constrained settings. This is the first study conducted to identify the factors affecting perinatal and neonatal deaths in Sao Tome & Principe (STP), the smallest Central Africa country. Methods Institution-based prospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Dr. Ayres Menezes. Maternal-neonate dyads enrolled were followed up after the 28th day of life (n = 194) for identification of neonatal death-outcome (n = 22) and alive-outcome groups (n = 172). Data were collected from pregnancy cards, hospital records and face-to-face interviews. After the 28th day of birth, a phone call was made to evaluate the newborn's health status. Crude odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were obtained. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The mean gestational age of the death-outcome and alive-outcome groups was 36 (SD = 4.8) and 39 (SD = 1.4) weeks, respectively. Death-outcome group (n = 22) included sixteen stillbirths, four early and two late neonatal deaths. High-risk pregnancy score [cOR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.18-7.22], meconium-stained fluid [cOR 4.38, 95% CI: 1.74-10.98], prolonged rupture of membranes [cOR 4.84, 95% CI: 1.47-15.93], transfer from another unit [cOR 6.08, 95% CI:1.95-18.90], and instrumental vaginal delivery [cOR 8.90, 95% CI: 1.68-47.21], were factors significantly associated with deaths. The odds of experiencing death were higher for newborns with infectious risk, IUGR, resuscitation maneuvers, fetal distress at birth, birth asphyxia, and unit care admission. Female newborn [cOR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14-1.00] and birth weight of more than 2,500 g [cOR 0.017, 95% CI: 0.002-0.162] were found to be protective factors. Conclusion Factors such as having a high-risk pregnancy score, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, prolonged rupture of membranes, being transferred from another unit, and an instrumental-assisted vaginal delivery increased 4- to 9-fold the risk of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Thus, avoiding delays in prompt intrapartum care is a key strategy to implement in Sao Tome & Principe.

TI  - Barriers to and facilitators of rehabilitation according to socio-economic status, after acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19: A qualitative study in the RECOVIDS cohort
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic may have compounded social disparities in access to healthcare, with possible deleterious consequences on the functional prognosis of patients after a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the previous RECOVIDS study, we reported that despite comparable pulmonary sequelae and similar access to rehabilitation, socio-economically "vulnerable" patients had lower quality of life at 6 months after an ICU stay. We aimed to describe the barriers to, and facilitators of participation in rehabilitation, among patients from the RECOVIDS study, regardless of their socio-economic situation.Methods Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with adult patients admitted to ICU for PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, and who had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or had received high flow nasal oxygen. In addition, patients had to have been living at home for the month prior to the interview and had to be proficient in French. Eligible patients were randomly selected, aiming to select the same number of socially deprived and non-socially-deprived patients. Interviews were transcribed for thematic analysis.Results In total, 31 interviews were performed from 10/2021 to 01/2022; 16 with socially deprived, and 15 with non-deprived participants. Average age was 65.2 (+/- 11.6) years. Four themes emerged from the analysis of the interviews, namely: (1) the impact of the patient's professional and socio-economic situation; (2) the feeling that age and socio-economic situation influence access to rehabilitation; (3) a perception that the healthcare system was saturated, and that inequalities exist in access to rehabilitation resources; (4) perception of previous own health and expectations of post-resuscitation health status.Conclusion A precarious socio-economic situation has a substantial impact on access to rehabilitation after ICU admission for ARDS caused by COVID-19. It represents a barrier to rehabilitation through the combined action of various social determinants that deserve to be detected early, in order to take appropriate action to ensure that the most socially vulnerable individuals can benefit from access to rehabilitation.

TI  - THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY IN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Thrombolytic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of acute myocardial infarction by reducing mortality and preserving left ventricular function. It is relatively safe and cost-effective. However, it is currently underused in most countries. Patients in whom thrombolysis is indicated include those with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram or bundle branch block pattern who present within 12 hours of myocardial infarction; the indications should be widened to include the elderly, patients who have undergone nontraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and women during menstruation. The risk-benefit ratio should be assessed for the individual patient. Prehospital thrombolytic treatment has been shown to be feasible with the support of well-trained staff and resuscitation equipment, and may be cost-effective in communities with time delays before hospitalization greater than 1 hour. The most important strategy is to shorten the ''door to needle'' time in hospital. The importance of full infarct-related artery flow (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 3 flow) for preservation of ventricular function and survival has been documented in the second Thrombolysis Trial of Eminase in Acute Myocardial infarction (TEAM 2) and the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) studies. Aspirin and heparin are beneficial adjunctive regimens to thrombolytic therapy but optimal epicardial reperfusion is achieved in only about half of patients. Improved thrombolytic, adjunctive antiplatelet, and antithrombotic regimens are required to achieve early full reperfusion, which is crucial to improve survival and quality of life.

TI  - Shame and Secrecy of Do Not Resuscitate Orders: An Historical Review and Suggestions for the Future
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BIOETHIQUE
AB  - This paper clarifies some of the longstanding difficulties in negotiating Do Not Resuscitate Orders by reframing the source of the dilemmas as not residing with either the patient or the physician but with their relationship. The recommendations are low cost and low-tech ways of making major improvements to the care and quality of life of the most ill patients in hospital. With impending physician-assisted death legislation there is an urgency to find more efficient and beneficial ways for clinicians and patients to address resuscitation issues at the bedside. Paradigmatic shifts in the nature of the patient-physician relationship will need to be encouraged by the larger community. These encouraged shifts address the concepts of passive/inferior patient - active/superior physician, patient ownership of and access to all their health care information, and treating the patient as a major participant in the delivery of health care. These recommended changes will not in themselves make any patient, physician or other healthcare provider more humane and open in the patient's final days. The goal, instead, is to have changes to the context of the discussion provide an encouraging environment for more open communication and a balanced relationship among participants with the patient being the most important.

TI  - IMPLANTABLE TRANSVENOUS CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background. Implantable transvenous cardioverter-defibrillators offer a significant opportunity to decrease procedural morbidity and medical costs in the care of patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who otherwise would have required a sternotomy or thoracotomy for device insertion. The purpose of this study was to examine prospectively the safety, efficacy, and limitations associated with the use of a transvenously implanted, tiered-therapy cardioverter-defibrillator with antitachycardia pacing function in a consecutive population of 84 ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) survivors.
   Methods and Results. The index arrhythmia prompting transvenous cardioverter-defibrillator implantation was VF in 41 patients, VT in 27, and both VF and VT in 16. In each patient, transvenous defibrillation via a coronary sinus, a right ventricular, a superior vena caval, and/or a subcutaneous chest patch lead system was attempted. The pulsing methods used included two-electrode single-pathway pulsing or three-electrode dual-pathway simultaneous or sequential pulsing. A transvenous cardioverter-defibrillator was inserted if the defibrillation threshold (DFT) was less-than-or-equal-to 20 J. Successful implantation of a transvenous cardioverter-defibrillator was possible in 80 of 84 (95%) patients. The mean implant DFT was 10.9+/-4.8 J. After cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, all patients were extubated in the operating room and sent to a standard telemetry ward for monitoring. No patient suffered a postoperative pulmonary complication or perioperative flurry of cardiac arrhythmias. Postoperative complications included lead dislodgments in sight, transient long thoracic nerve injury in one, asymptomatic left subclavian vein occlusion in two, asymptomatic small pericardial effusion in one, subcutaneous patch pocket hematomas in four, pulse generator pocket infection in one, and lead fracture in one. As experience was gained with the procedure, it was routine to discharge patients 3 days after surgery. The mean hospital stay was 6.0+/-2.4 days. Upon discharge, all patients returned to their prehospital activities including those with complications except for the patient with a pocket infection, who required intravenous antibiotic therapy. Patient survival using an intention-to-treat analysis was 98% over an 11+/-7-month follow-up period. During this time period, 31 of the 80 patients (39%) with transvenous lead systems were successfully treated by their device for sustained VT or VF. Antitachycardia pacing was used in 424 episodes of monomorphic VT and was successful in 371 (88%). All episodes of VF were aborted by the device. Antiarrhythmic drugs were used after device implantation in only eight of 80 patients (10%).
   Conclusions. Transvenous cardioverter-defibrillator implantation is practical in most candidates. Implant DFTs are usually low, surgical morbidity and postoperative complications are modest, therapy of VT and VF is efficient, and survival is excellent.

TI  - Implementation and Data Capable of Hypothermia after Cardiovascular Arrest
T2  - DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB  - Zusammenfassung Die Umsetzung der Empfehlungen zum Einsatz der milden therapeutischen Hypothermie nach Herzkreislaufstillstand in die klinische Routine ist ein langwieriger Prozess. Zwei Jahre nach den ersten Empfehlungen der Fachgesellschaften haben nur 24% der deutschen Klinken diese Therapieoption angewandt. Die steigende Anzahl an Studien zum Thema aber gerade auch die Aufnahme der Hypothermie in die Leitlinien fuhrte zu einem Anstieg der die Hypothermie einsetzenden Kliniken auf 69% im Jahre 2009 und letztlich nach der wiederholten Leitlinienempfehlung und eine Dekade nach Veroffentlichung der Meilensteinstudien auf 86% . Im internationalen Vergleich nimmt Deutschland keine Sonderstellung ein, weltweit ist die Verzogerung bei der Umsetzung dieser Leitlinienempfehlung zu beobachten, wenngleich manche Lander sich durch eine raschere Umsetzung auszeichnen. Die Anwender der Hypothermie halten sich hinsichtlich der Durchfuhrung weitestgehend an die Empfehlungen der Fachgesellschaften und richten sich auch hinsichtlich der Zieltemperatur und der Kuhldauer an die Vorgaben. Diese Beobachtungen unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Leitlinien zur Implementierung neuer Therapieoptionen. Nachdem nun eine neuere Studie zwar ein aktives Temperaturmanagement weiterhin propagiert, jedoch den Nutzen einer sehr niedrigen Zieltemperatur in Frage stellt, bleibt abzuwarten, inwieweit sich dies in den Kliniken verbreitet. Die deutsche Gesellschaft fur internistische Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin rat derzeit von einer weitreichenden Umstellung der Zieltemperatur von 33 degrees C auf 36 degrees C ab und es ist noch offen, wie sich die Autoren der Leitlinien 2015 zu diesem Thema au ss ern.
   Abstract Implementation of mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest into clinical practice is a continuing process. Although ILCOR recommendation was given in 2003, only 24% of the German hospitals reported the use of hypothermia in this setting in 2005. Growing evidence and most importantly the implementation of hypothermia into the guidelines led to a significant increase of acceptance of this therapeutic option leading to a user rate of 69% in 2009. Encouraged by the new guidelines from 2010 86% of German hospitals finally reported to use hypothermia after cardiac arrest routinely in 2012, a decade after publication of the mile stone studies. The phenomenon of a delayed implementation of hypothermia into clinical practice can be seen throughout the world as many surveys from different countries at different time points have shown. When hypothermia is used, hospitals go with the guidelines quite strictly with respect to indication, duration of treatment and target temperature. This strengthens the importance of guidelines in the process to implement new therapeutic options. However, although a recent study still promotes a strict target temperature management it questions the need for a markedly reduced target temperature of 33 degrees C. It remains to be elucidated how this study will affect the daily routine in the hospitals and most interestingly how this study will change the coming guidelines in 2015.

TI  - Hypoxia and Outcome Prediction in Early-Stage Coma (Project HOPE): an observational prospective cohort study
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: The number of resuscitated cardiac arrest patients suffering from anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is considerable. However, outcome prediction parameters such as somatosensory evoked potentials need revision because they are based on data predating the implementation of mild therapeutical hypothermia and because data from our own laboratory suggest that they may fail to predict prognosis accurately. The present research project "Hypoxia and Outcome Prediction in Early-Stage Coma" is an ongoing observational prospective cohort study that aims to improve outcome prediction in anoxic coma by limiting the effects of falsely pessimistic predictions at the intensive care unit.
   Methods: Our outcome analysis is based on functional and behavioural definitions. This implies the analysis of the positive predictive value of prognostic markers yielding either positive or negative results. We also analyse the effect of covariates adjusted for age and sex such as sociodemographic variables, prognostic variables and treatment factors on functional and behavioural outcomes, with mixed effects regression models (i.e. fixed and random effects). We expect to enrol 172 patients based on the result of previous research. The null hypothesis is that there is a probability of <10 % that a positive outcome will be observed despite the presence of any of the predictors of a poor/negative outcome. We test the null hypothesis against a one-sided alternative using a Simon's two-stage design to determine whether it is warranted to recruit the full number of patients suggested by a power analysis. The second stage has a design with a Type I error rate of 0.05 and 80 % power if the true response rate is 25 %.
   Discussion: We aim to make a significant contribution to the revision and improvement of current outcome prediction methods in anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy patients. As a result, neurocritical care specialists worldwide will have considerably more accurate methods for prognosticating the outcome of anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest. This will facilitate the provision of treatment tailored to individual patients and the attainment of an optimal quality of life. It will also inform the decision to withdraw treatment with a level of accuracy never seen before in the field.

TI  - Low Versus High Blood Pressure Targets in Critically Ill and Surgical Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypotension is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill and perioperative patients. However, these assumptions are supported by observational studies. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aims to compare the impact of lower versus higher blood pressure targets on mortality. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Scholar from inception to February 10, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials comparing lower versus higher blood pressure targets in the management of critically ill and perioperative settings. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up available. This review was registered in the Prospective International Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42023452928. DATA SYNTHESIS: f 2940 studies identified by the search string, 28 (12 in critically ill and 16 in perioperative settings) were included totaling 15,672 patients. Patients in the low blood pressure target group had lower mortality (23 studies included: 1019/7679 [13.3%] vs. 1103/7649 [14.4%]; relative risk 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99; p = 0.03; I-2 = 0%). This corresponded to a 97.4% probability of any increase in mortality with a Bayesian approach. These findings were mainly driven by studies performed in the ICU setting and with treatment lasting more than 24 hours; however, the magnitude and direction of the results were similar in the majority of sensitivity analyses including the analysis restricted to low risk of bias studies. We also observed a lower rate of atrial fibrillation and fewer patients requiring transfusion in low-pressure target groups. No differences were found in the other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pooled randomized trial evidence, a lower compared with a higher blood pressure target results in a reduction of mortality, atrial fibrillation, and transfusion requirements. Lower blood pressure targets may be beneficial but there is ongoing uncertainty. However, the present meta-analysis does not confirm previous findings and recommendations. These results might inform future guidelines and promote the study of the concept of protective hemodynamics.

TI  - Unusual presentation of hemoperitoneum secondary to ruptured uterine leiomyoma: a case report
T2  - GYNECOLOGY AND PELVIC MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign tumours affecting women of reproductive age. Complications of leiomyomas include torsion, red degeneration, carcinomatous change and rarely-perforation and/or hemorrhage. This case report highlights the atypical presentation of spontaneous haemorrhage from a uterine fibroid that clinicians should consider as a differential diagnosis for haemoperitoneum. It adds to the existing literature in discussing the investigations and management of this rare fibroid complication.
   Case Description: We report a case of an atypical presentation of spontaneous hemorrhage from a uterine fibroid with no precipitating factors in a stable patient who did not require blood transfusion. A 28-year-old nulliparous woman presented with 2-day history of abdominal pain and an outpatient pelvic ultrasound (US) suggesting hemoperitoneum. She was hemodynamically stable. Her abdomen was soft, generally tender across the lower abdomen with some voluntary guarding. Her initial haemoglobin (Hb) was 114 g/L. Serial Hb showed a drop to 86 g/L after 12 hours. She had an urgent US which demonstrated a large vascular complex pelvic mass of uncertain etiology with a large amount of hemoperitoneum (>430 mL). A computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abdomen/pelvis showed extensive hemoperitoneum, and a large 86x94 mm exophytic homogenously enhancing mass lesion arising from the posterior uterus with no source of active bleeding seen. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. A large pedunculated fibroid arising from right anterior cornua was found with similar to 1 L hemoperitoneum. An active bleeding point was identified arising from this fibroid. As it was difficult to control bleeding and in view of findings laparotomy was performed. The fibroid pedicle was secured with LigaSure, and the fibroid detached. The patient remained well and was discharged the next day with Hb 89 g/L with no blood transfusion required. At her 6-week post operative follow-up the incision was healed and she was well.
   Conclusions: Hemorrhage secondary to a uterine fibroid is a rare complication of uterine fibroids that clinicians must consider. Initial rapid imaging can be used to narrow down the diagnosis. Prompt resuscitation, definitive surgical management in a multi-disciplinary team approach will aid in management and improve outcomes.

TI  - Short-term efficacy of a telephone intervention by expert nurses after an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The ICD is a common therapy for treatment of ventriculor arrhythmias and prevention of sudden cardiac death. After ICD therapy, 50% of survivors ore known to have significantly elevated anxiety, depression, anger, and fear in getting back to normal physical activities. Despite these problems, few interventions to improve adjustment have been rigorously evaluated within a clinical trial format. This article reports the short-term efficacy of a structured weekly educational telephone intervention (8 weeks) delivered by expert cardiovascular nurses to recipients of an ICD. To test these effects, a two-group (n = 84/group) randomized clinical trial design was used with measures at baseline (hospital discharge), 1 month, and 3 months after ICD therapy. The study sample were first time ICD recipients for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest. Primary outcomes included (1) physical functioning (Patient Concerns Assessment [PCA], Short-Form Health Survey [SF-12], ICD shocks), (2) psychological adjustment (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D), (3) knowledge (Sudden Cardiac Arrest [SCA] knowledge assessment), and (4) health care use (emergency room visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). The intervention group, as compared to the control group, significantly reduced mean PCA symptoms at 1 month (11.3-8.8 vs 9.7-9.3, respectively, P < 0.02), and reduced state anxiety (36.1-31.9 vs 33.1-33.0, respectively, P < 0.08), and enhanced knowledge (21.8-22.4 vs 21.4-21.7, respectively, P < 0.02) at 3 months. The intervention did not significantly impact short-term health care use. A structured telephone intervention delivered during the first 8 weeks after ICD therapy by expert cardiovascular nurses decreased ICD related physical symptoms and anxiety, and increased SCA knowledge over 3 months.

TI  - Transcatheter based electromechanical mapping guided intramyocardial transplantation and in vivo tracking of human stem cell based three dimensional microtissues in the porcine heart
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
AB  - Stem cells have been repeatedly suggested for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the low retention rate of single cell suspensions limits the efficacy of current therapy concepts so far. Taking advantage of three dimensional (3D) cellular self-assembly prior to transplantation may be beneficial to overcome these limitations. In this pilot study we investigate the principal feasibility of intramyocardial delivery of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D microtissues (3D-MTs) in a porcine model. 3D-MTs were generated from iron-oxide (MPIO) labeled human adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) using a modified hanging-drop method. Nine pigs (33 +/- 2 kg) comprising seven healthy ones and two with chronic MI in the left ventricle (LV) anterior wall were included. The pigs underwent intramyocardial transplantation of 16 x 10(3) 3D-MTs (1250 cells/MT; accounting for 2 x 10(7) single ATMSCs) into the anterior wall of the healthy pigs (n = 7)/the MI border zone of the infarcted (n = 2) of the LV using a 3D NOGA electromechanical mapping guided, transcatheter based approach. Clinical follow-up (FU) was performed for up to five weeks and in-vivo cell-tracking was performed using serial magnet resonance imaging (MRI). Thereafter, the hearts were harvested and assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Intramyocardial transplantation of human ATMSC based 3D-MTs was successful in eight animals (88.8%) while one pig (without MI) died during the electromechanical mapping due to sudden cardiac-arrest. During RI, no arrhythmogenic, embolic or neurological events occurred in the treated pigs. Serial MRI confirmed the intramyocardial presence of the 3D-MTs by detection of the intracellular iron-oxide MPIOs during FU. Intramyocardial retention of 3D-MTs was confirmed by PCR analysis and was further verified on histology and immunohistochemical analysis. The 3D-MTs appeared to be viable, integrated and showed an intact micro architecture. We demonstrate the principal feasibility and safety of intramyocardial transplantation of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D-MTs. Multimodal cell-tracking strategies comprising advanced imaging and in-vitro tools allow for in-vivo monitoring and post-mortem analysis of transplanted 3D-MTs. The concept of 3D cellular self-assembly represents a promising application format as a next generation technology for cell-based myocardial regeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Prospective, Observational, Multicenter, Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) Study Comparative Effectiveness of a Time-Varying Treatment With Competing Risks
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
AB  - Objective: To relate in-hospital mortality to early transfusion of plasma and/or platelets and to time-varying plasma: red blood cell (RBC) and platelet: RBC ratios.
   Design: Prospective cohort study documenting the timing of transfusions during active resuscitation and patient outcomes. Data were analyzed using time-dependent proportional hazards models.
   Setting: Ten US level I trauma centers.
   Patients: Adult trauma patients surviving for 30 minutes after admission who received a transfusion of at least 1 unit of RBCs within 6 hours of admission (n = 1245, the original study group) and at least 3 total units (of RBCs, plasma, or platelets) within 24 hours (n = 905, the analysis group).
   Main Outcome Measure: In-hospital mortality.
   Results: Plasma: RBC and platelet: RBC ratios were not constant during the first 24 hours (P < .001 for both). In a multivariable time-dependent Cox model, increased ratios of plasma: RBCs (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.16-0.58) and platelets: RBCs (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98) were independently associated with decreased 6-hour mortality, when hemorrhagic death predominated. In the first 6 hours, patients with ratios less than 1: 2 were 3 to 4 times more likely to die than patients with ratios of 1: 1 or higher. After 24 hours, plasma and platelet ratios were unassociated with mortality, when competing risks from non-hemorrhagic causes prevailed.
   Conclusions: Higher plasma and platelet ratios early in resuscitation were associated with decreased mortality in patients who received transfusions of at least 3 units of blood products during the first 24 hours after admission. Among survivors at 24 hours, the subsequent risk of death by day 30 was not associated with plasma or platelet ratios. JAMA Surg. 2013; 148(2): 127-136.

TI  - THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CARDIORESPIRATORY ARREST AND PRINCIPLES OF POSTRESUSCITATION INTENSIVE-CARE
T2  - BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL
AB  - Oxygen supply to the tissues is dependent on both cardiac output (which is determined by blood volume and myocardial function) and the oxygen tension of arterial blood (which reflects respiratory status). Abnormalities of these parameters may occur individually or together to progress ultimately to combined cardiorespiratory collapse. Life support measures are then required to restore the oxygen supply to vital organs, such as the brain, heart, kidneys and liver while attempts to restore normal cardiorespiratory status are made. Survival following cardiorespiratory arrest is enhanced if resuscitation is promptly instituted by skilled resuscitators, and a clear understanding of the mechanisms of cardiorespiratory collapse are essential to the efficient management of these patients.

TI  - Evaluating a train-the-trainer approach for implementing obstetric life support in diverse healthcare contexts throughout Arizona: a mixed methods protocol
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundMost medical responders are not adequately trained to recognize and treat maternal medical emergencies, including maternal cardiac arrest, and national credentialing standards do not exist. Obstetric Life Support (OBLS) is a validated simulation-based curriculum designed to equip prehospital and hospital-based healthcare workers (HCWs) with the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent, recognize, and manage maternal medical emergencies. Widespread implementation of OBLS could enhance patient safety and reduce disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality. However, research is needed to develop strategies that ensure sustained and equitable access for HCWs across diverse healthcare settings. This paper presents a protocol for evaluating a train-the-trainer approach to implement OBLS in hospitals, freestanding birthing centers, and prehospital contexts across Arizona.MethodsThis multisite, mixed-methods study is being conducted in collaboration with the Arizona Perinatal Trust, a regional perinatal health system that encompasses 38 in-hospital birthing centers and Level I-IV hospitals across Arizona, and the Arizona Emergency Medical Systems LLC, which coordinates 85 emergency medical services agencies statewide. A Steering Committee comprising local, regional, and national stakeholders provides guidance and oversight for all study activities. To promote rapid learning, two consecutive OBLS implementation and evaluation cycles will be conducted, with the second cycle incorporating feedback and lessons learned from the first. HCWs from 16 implementation sites (8 per cycle) serving areas with high maternal vulnerability indexes will be trained as OBLS instructors. These instructors will train at least 160 HCWs (80 per cycle) within their respective or nearby institutions. Outcomes to be assessed include reach (proportion and representation of institutions offering OBLS, instructors trained, and HCWs participating), effectiveness (impact of OBLS on knowledge and clinical competencies, presence of code carts containing OBLS cognitive aids and resuscitative cesarean delivery kits in hospitals, and the use of an OB Arrest Alert in prehospital settings), adoption (allocation of resources for OBLS), implementation (number of courses completed, fidelity of the training delivery), and maintenance (extent to which training becomes integrated into routine practice and policy).DiscussionFindings from this statewide study will be used to promote the scale-up and sustainability of OBLS, ultimately enhancing maternal healthcare quality and equity.

TI  - Subjective factors of depressive symptoms, ambulation, pain, and fatigue are associated with physical activity participation in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to examine the associations between participation in physical activities and objective and subjective factors modifiable by rehabilitation in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.
   Methods: Participants in a clinical feasibility study (N=19) completed several subjective (patient-reported) and objective outcome measures on one occasion only. The associations between an individual's level of participation in physical activities (Participation Objective Participation Subjective) and their levels of cognition (Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment), body movement (Keitel Functional Test), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), ambulation and pain (Health Utilities Index Mark 3), and fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were explored. Pearson's correlation coefficientr was calculated for all associations, except for body movement (Spearman's correlation coefficient r(s)).
   Results: As hypothesized, we found weak-to-moderate, positive associations between participation in physical activities and objective factors of cognition (r= 0.370) and body movement (r(s) =0.414) and a subjective factor of ambulation ability (r=0.501). We found moderate, negative associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors of depressive symptoms (r=-0.590), pain (r=-0.495), physical fatigue impact (r=-0.629), cognitive fatigue impact (r=-0.591), and psychosocial fatigue impact (r=-0.557).
   Conclusion: The moderate, negative and positive associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors suggest that subjective complaints of depressive symptoms, ambulation ability, pain, and fatigue impact may be important factors when seeking to improve participation in physical activities. In particular, addressing physical and cognitive endurance as well as perceptions of fatigue may hold the key to increasing physical activity in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.

TI  - Post-hypoxic myoclonus; what we know and gaps in knowledge
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
AB  - Post-hypoxic myoclonus (PHM) is a rare neurological complication having two different variants depending on acute or chronic onset after cardiopulmonary resuscitation following cardiac arrest: myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE) and Lance-Adams syndrome (LAS) respectively. Clinical and simultaneous electro-encephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) tracing can distinguish between the two. Anecdotal treatment with benzodiazepines and anaesthetics (in the case of MSE) have been tried. Although limited evidence is available, valproic acid, clonazepam and levetiracetam, either in combination with other drugs or alone, have shown to control epilepsy associated with LAS effectively. Deep brain stimulation is a novel and promising advance in LAS treatment.

TI  - Early assessment in perinatal hypoxia.: Prognostic markers
T2  - REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA
AB  - Introduction. Perinatal asphyxia and its neurological signs are the most important cause of brain damage and neurological sequelae in full term newborn babies. Neuroprotection treatments currently being investigated promise to reduce such sequelae, but these treatments are not without risk and the patients involved should be selected Objective. To analyze a scale composed of variables recorded from the start of delivery until the fourth hour of life, comparing the neurological evolution of the patients. By means of this scale we aim to establish a criterion for the selection of neonates with acute perinatal asphyxia, who would benefit from neuroprotector treatment. Patients and methods. A retrospective study was made of 50 patients with the diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia. Our scale was formed of the following variables: intrauterine meconiorrhexis, pathological cardiotocographic recordings, resuscitation at birth, Apgar score at five minutes, pH of the umbilical artery blood neurological examination, multisystemic involvement, seizures, persistent metabolic acidosis and need for mechanical ventilation during the first hours of life. The patients were followed up for at least one year by means of periodical studies (neurological examination and evaluation of psychomotor development according to the Brunnet Lezinne test). For statistical analysis we used the chi squared test, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test and the area beneath the ROC curve. Results and conclusions. The scale presented constitutes a rapid easy method which is statistically significant for the selection of perinatal asphyxia of high neurological risk which would benefit from neuroprotector treatment after the event.

TI  - Association between ticagrelor plasma concentration and bleeding events in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Aims The risk of ticagrelor-related bleeding events remains a major clinical concern, especially in East Asian populations. Previous studies have reported higher ticagrelor exposure in Asian patients than in Caucasians. This prompted us to investigate the correlation between ticagrelor concentrations and bleeding events. Methods Patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome and receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and ticagrelor) were enrolled and followed up for 12 months. Trough plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and a major active metabolite were assayed, and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ticagrelor pharmacokinetics and safety were also identified. Results A total of 631 patients were included and 133 patients had bleeding academic research consortium type 1 or 2 bleeding event. The median ticagrelor concentration (interquartile range) was significantly higher in patients with bleeding events than that in patients without bleeding events (322.6 ng/mL [196.2-458.0 ng/mL] vs. 222.1 ng/mL [140.4-341.9 ng/mL], P < .001). According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the cut-off value for ticagrelor levels predicting bleeding events was 363.3 ng/mL (area under the curve = 0.65; P < .001, 95% Cl: 0.595-0.700). Pharmacogenomics results showed that P2Y12 (rs6787801, P = .024) and P2Y12 (rs6785930, P = .048) were statistically associated with ticagrelor levels and bleeding events, respectively. Conclusion Ticagrelor plasma concentrations were associated with bleeding events in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome.

TI  - Performance of invasive medical procedures by paramedics A study regarding the education of paramedic-personnel
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Background The German board of emergency medical services (EMS) medical directors, the Bundesverband der arztlichen Leiter Rettungsdienst, recommended a catalogue of invasive procedures, which defines for every procedure an indicated number of performances in order to learn these. We conducted a study to evaluate how often paramedic students performed these procedures during their training. Methods 71 students were asked how often they had performed 17 procedures during their training. We compared the results with the recommended number of procedures that the German board of EMS medical directors promoted. Results are displayed as mean (standard deviation). Statistical analysis was performed with SOFA (Paton-Simpson and Associates Ltd, USA). Results Face-mask ventilation was performed in-hospital 124.9 (73.9), prehospital 6.2 (13.4) and in paramedic school 115.2 (89.1) times. An extraglottic airway was performed in-hospital 58.6 (49.7), prehospital 2.7 (4.0) and in paramedic school 93.5 (66.3) times. Intubation (direct laryngoscopy) was performed in-hospital 31.3 (32.8), prehospital 0.3 (1.3) and in paramedic school 14.9 (15.1) times. Non-invasive ventilation was performed in-hospital 4.9 (8.7), prehospital 1.8 (2.6) and in paramedic school 3.2 (4.5) times. Intravenous cannulation was performed in-hospital 165.8 (116.0) and prehospital 145.2 (162.8) times. An intraosseous access was performed in-hospital 0.1 (0.3), prehospital 0.4 (0.7) and in paramedic school 5.8 (6.4) times. Needle thoracostomy was performed in-hospital 0.1 (0.3), prehospital 0.01 (0.1) and in paramedic school 8.9 (8.9) times. Defibrillation was performed in-hospital 1.7 (3.4), prehospital 9.1 (11.9) and in paramedic school 172.0 (129.2) times. Cardioversion was performed in-hospital 1.5 (3.5), prehospital 0.2 (0.6) and in paramedic school 14.4 (58.9) times. External pacemaker therapy was performed in-hospital 0.4 (1.4), prehospital 0.3 (0.7) and in paramedic school 7.8 (7.6) times. Conclusion In comparison with the recommended number of procedures that the German board of EMS medical directors promoted, a certain degree of expertise can be assumed for face-mask ventilation, securing the airway with extraglottic devices, intravenous cannulation, and defibrillation. Intubation, non-invasive ventilation, needle-decompression, establishing intraosseous access, cardioversion as well as pacemaker therapy were performed less often than recommended. However for some procedures there is clearly need for improvement in training.

TI  - Community consultation for Exception from Informed consent (EFIC) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Describe community consultation and surrogate consent rates for two Exception From Informed Consent (EFIC) trials for out-of-hospital car-diac arrest (OOHCA) -before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: The PEARL study (2016-2018) randomized OOHCA patients without ST-elevation to early cardiac catheterization or not. Community consultation included flyers, radio announcements, newspaper advertisements, mailings, and in-person surveys at basketball games and ED waiting rooms. The PROTECT trial (2021-present) randomizes OOHCA survivors to prophylactic ceftriaxone or placebo; the community consultation plan during the pandemic included city council presentations, social media posts, outpatient flyers, but no in-person encounters. Demographics for PRO-TECT community consultation were compared to PEARL and INTCAR registry data, with p-value < 0.05 considered significant.Results: PEARL surveyed 1,362 adults, including 64 % >= 60 years old, 96 % high school graduates or beyond; research acceptance rate was 92 % for the community and 76 % for personal level. PROTECT initially obtained 221 surveys from electronic media - including fewer males (28 % vs 72 % ,p < 0.001) and those > 60 years old (14 % vs 53 %;p < 0.001) compared to INTCAR. These differences prompted a revised community consultation plan, targeting 79 adult in-patients with cardiac disease which better matched PEARL and INTCAR data: the majority were >= 60 years old (66 %) and male (54 %). Both PEARL and PROTECT enrolled more patients using surrogate consent vs EFIC (57 %, 61 %), including 71 % as remote electronic consents during PROTECT.Conclusions: Community consultation for EFIC studies changed with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in different demographic patterns. We describe effective adaptations to community consultation and surrogate consent during the pandemic.

TI  - Frequency and Predictors of Acute Hospitalization Before Death in Patients With Glioblastoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Context. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating and incurable neuro-oncologic disease, and issues related to the end of life are almost invariably a matter of "when,'' not a matter of "if.'' Optimizing symptom management and quality of life in later stages of disease is of the utmost priority.
   Objectives. To examine the frequency of and factors associated with late acute hospital admission before death in patients with GBM.
   Methods. Case-control study comparing patients with GBM admitted to the hospital within one month of death to those without late hospital admission.
   Results. Of 385 GBM patients followed to death at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 164 (42.6%) were admitted within a month of death, most frequently (140, or 85%) to manage neurologic decline. Of these, 56 (34%) had intensive care unit care during this admission and 22 (13%), 18 (11%), and 2 (1%) received mechanical ventilation, enteral feeding tubes, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, respectively. In multivariable analysis, in-hospital chaplaincy consultation, and participation in a therapeutic clinical trial, both at any time in the GBM disease course, were significantly associated with late hospital admission.
   Conclusions. Late hospitalization is frequent in GBM and often involves intensive care unit care in the management of clinical events that are part of the GBM dying process. Patients with a tendency to use religious support and those enrolled in clinical trials may be at greater risk for late hospitalization. Dedicated prospective study is needed to determine predictors of late hospitalization and to examine the impact of late acute medical care on quality of life in GBM.

TI  - Post-intensive care unit depression among critical care survivors: A nationwide population-based study
T2  - JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE
AB  - Aim To investigate the incidence of post-intensive care unit (ICU) depression and its risk factors among critical care survivors. Methods The study data were extracted from the database of the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. We retrospectively analyzed data from 161,977 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU for more than 24 hr from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 and survived for more than 1 year after discharge. Risk factors for newly diagnosed depression (Code F32) were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results The incidence of post-ICU depression was 18.5%. The major risk factors were enteral nutrition (odds ratio [OR] = 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.19-2.36), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.54-1.64), and hemi/paraplegia (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.41-1.56). It was observed that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.50-0.61) and myocardial infarction (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.71-0.79) lowered depression. Conclusions The incidence of post-ICU depression was high and influenced by ICU treatment and physical impairments. Healthcare providers must pay attention to the psychological changes in survivors with major risk factors in the recovery process.

TI  - Comparison of In-Hospital Mortality and Neurosurgical Intervention Between Intracranial Gunshot Wounds Arising From Long Guns and Handguns: A Propensity Score Matched Study
T2  - NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with intracranial gunshot wounds (IC-GSWs) often present with severe neurological injuries requiring prompt neurological evaluation. Neurosurgical intervention is reserved for those with reasonable chances of survival. Handguns and long guns, such as shotguns and rifles, have differing mechanisms of injury which may influence surgical candidacy and outcomes. This study aims to compare rates and types of neurosurgical intervention and inpatient outcomes in patients with IC-GSWs handguns and long guns. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was retrospectively queried for patients with IC-GSWs from 2017 to 2019. Patients with long gun IC-GSWs were propensity score matched with those with handgun IC-GSWs based on patient demographics, comorbidities, insurance status, injury extent and severity, and hospital trauma level. Group differences were compared using Student's t-tests and Pearson's chi(2) tests, and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, patients in the long gun group were more likely to undergo neurosurgical intervention (21% vs 17%, P = .02). Following propensity score matching, the long gun group had lower rates of in-hospital mortality (35% vs 43%, P < .01), lower rates of cardiac arrest (5% vs 8%, P = .02), and lower rates of reoperation (0% vs 2%, P = .02) than the handgun group. In multivariable regression, independent predictors of survival included long gun IC-GSWs (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, CI 0.52-0.83), neurosurgical foreign body removal (OR 0.44, CI 0.33-0.58), intracranial debridement (OR 0.47, 0.33-0.67), and craniectomy (OR 0.46, CI 0.34-0.63). CONCLUSION: Patients with IC-GSWs present to the hospital with severe neurological injury. Neurosurgical intervention was independently associated with decreased mortality. After matching, patients with long gun IC-GSWs experienced lower in-hospital mortality rates compared with those from handguns. This study suggests that patients suffering from long gun IC-GSW may respond particularly well to neurosurgical intervention and firearm type should be considered when determining neurosurgical candidacy.

TI  - EEG Pattern With Spectral Analysis Can Prognosticate Good and Poor Neurologic Outcomes After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.
   Purpose:To investigate the prognostic value of a simple stratification system of electroencephalographical (EEG) patterns and spectral types for patients after cardiac arrest.Methods:In this prospectively enrolled cohort, using manually selected EEG segments, patients after cardiac arrest were stratified into five independent EEG patterns (based on background continuity and burden of highly epileptiform discharges) and four independent power spectral types (based on the presence of frequency components). The primary outcome is cerebral performance category (CPC) at discharge. Results from multimodal prognostication testing were included for comparison.Results:Of a total of 72 patients, 6 had CPC 1-2 by discharge, all of whom had mostly continuous EEG background without highly epileptiform activity at day 3. However, for the same EEG background pattern at day 3, 19 patients were discharged at CPC 3 and 15 patients at CPC 4-5. After adding spectral analysis, overall sensitivity for predicting good outcomes (CPC 1-2) was 83.3% (95% confidence interval 35.9% to 99.6%) and specificity was 97.0% (89.5% to 99.6%). In this cohort, standard prognostication testing all yielded 100% specificity but low sensitivity, with imaging being the most sensitive at 54.1% (36.9% to 70.5%).Conclusions:Adding spectral analysis to qualitative EEG analysis may further improve the diagnostic accuracy of EEG and may aid developing novel measures linked to good outcomes in postcardiac arrest coma.

TI  - Efficacy and cost-feasibility of the Timely Chest Compression Training (T-CCT): a contextualized cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for personal support workers participating during in-hospital cardiac arrests
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives The Timely Chest Compression Training (T-CCT) was created to promote more frequent training in chest compressions for personal support workers. This study aims to assess the efficacy of the T-CCT on the chest compression performance and to examine costs related to this intervention.
   Methods A prospective single group, before-after study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital. The T-CCT is adapted for support workers and lasts 20 min during working hours. Guided by peer trainers, live feedback devices and mannikins, the T-CCT targets chest compression training. Using an algorithm, chest compression performance scores were gathered before and after the intervention.
   Results Of 875 employed support workers, 573 were trained in 5 days. Prior to the intervention, the median performance score was 72%. Participants significantly improved after the intervention (p < 0.001) and the median of the differences was 32% (95% CI 28.5-36.0). Support workers in critical care units and those with an active basic life support (BLS) certification performed better at baseline and were less inclined to have large changes in performance scores after the intervention. When compared to basic life support training, the T-CCT is over three times less expensive.
   Conclusions The T-CCT was an effective and low-cost initiative that allowed to train a large group of support workers in a short amount of time. Since they are actively involved in resuscitation efforts in Quebec (Canada), it may promote the delivery of high-quality compressions during in-hospital cardiac arrests. Our inquiry can incite and guide other organizations in the implementation of similar interventions.

TI  - Predictors of 30-day mortality and outcome in cases of myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock treated by extracorporeal life support
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The twin aims of this study were to identify the independent predictors of 30-day mortality and to analyse the outcomes of patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and necessitating extracorporeal life support (ECLS).
   METHODS: The investigation was a single-centre, retrospective study of 77 patients who required ECLS for AMI with CS. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent variables associated with 30-day mortality.
   RESULTS: Between February 2006 and November 2009, 745 patients in our establishment received ECLS. In the single-centre cohort, we retrospectively reviewed 77 patients who had required ECLS support for AMI with CS. The delay between AMI and CS ECLS was 15 +/- 4 h. PCI was performed in 58 patients (75.3%) and isolated emergency CABG in 12 (15.6%). The remaining 7 patients (9.1%) did not undergo revascularization. ECLS duration averaged 9.8 +/- 7.1 days. Nineteen patients were successfully weaned from ECLS (24%). Fifty-eight patients did not undergo or did not tolerate the weaning trial (76%). Forty patients died during ECLS support, 13 were implanted with a mono-ventricular (n = 9) or biventricular assist device (n = 4) and 5 were bridged to heart transplantation. Complications consisted primarily in pneumonia (51.3%) and acute renal failure requiring haemofiltration (46.1%). Pulmonary oedema occurred in 24 patients (31.6%) and major bleeding in 16 (21.33%). 30-day and in-hospital survival rates were, respectively, 38.9 and 33.8%. Multivariable analysis identified preimplantation lactate serum level, preimplantation creatinine serum level and previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation as independent predictors of 30-day mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prompt ECLS support is an effective strategy and provides a reasonable chance of survival in patients with AMI associated with profound CS. As shown in our results pertaining to predictive risk factors for 30-day mortality, reducing the duration of end-organ ischaemia is the keystone to management of this patient population. A major remaining challenge will consist in preventing pulmonary oedema following peripheral ECLS.

TI  - Gradually increased oxygen administration promoted survival after hemorrhagic shock
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Gradually increased oxygen administration (GIOA) seems promising in hemorrhagic shock. However, the effects of GIOA on survival remain unclear, and details of GIOA are to be identified. After the induction of hemorrhagic shock, the rats were randomized into five groups (n = 9): normoxic group (Normo), hyperoxic group (Hypero), normoxic to hyperoxic group (GIOA1), longtime hypoxemic to hyperoxic group (GIOA2), and short-time hypoxemic to hyperoxic group (GIOA3). Survival was recorded for 96 h, plasma alanine transaminase, oxidative stress, hemodynamics, and blood gas were measured. The mean survival time of the GIOA3 was significantly longer than that of the Normo, Hypero, and GIOA2. Plasma alanine transaminase levels were significantly lower in the Normo, GIOA1, and GIOA3 compared to the Hypero and GIOA2 at 2 h post-resuscitation (PR). Plasma 3-nitrotyrosine levels at 2 h PR were significantly lower in the GIOA2 and GIOA3 compared to the Normo and Hypero. Central venous oxygen saturation at 2 h PR in the GIOA3 was significantly higher than the Normo; however, no significant difference was observed between GIOA1 and Normo. Besides, at 2 h PR, mean arterial pressure in the GIOA3 was significantly higher than the GIOA2; however, no significant difference was observed between GIOA1 and GIOA2. (1) GIOA could significantly prolong survival time compared to normoxemic resuscitation and hyperoxic resuscitation; (2) early moments of GIOA are critical to the benefits; and (3) hypoxemia at onset of resuscitation may be imperative, more works are needed to determine the optimal initial oxygen concentration of GIOA.

TI  - Rehabilitation of patients with implantable cardioverter/defibrillator: a literature review
T2  - ACTA CARDIOLOGICA
AB  - The implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) has established superiority in reducing mortality for survivors of cardiac arrest or patients at high risk for sudden death. However, patients with ICD suffer from many problems that affect their daily living activity. They also refrain to do exercise, for fear of precipitating life-threatening arrhythmia or receiving an ICD shock. This review outlines the problems that those patients usually face and describes the possible exercise programs as well as the rehabilitative approach for managing their daily living activities.

TI  - Medical emergency teams: is there MERIT?
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
AB  - Structured abstract Background: Many deaths, cardiac arrests, and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions arc preceded by failure to recognize deteriorating vital signs(1,2) or trigger intervention.(1,4) Furthermore, survival following cardiovascular collapse is low, whereas early response likely improves survival.(5,6) As such, in-hospital medical emergency teams (MET) were proposed. Physiologic triggers (see below) lead to their activation.
   Objective: The first multi-site prospective MET trial.
   Design: Cluster randomized-control trial of 23 Australian hospitals.
   Methods: Inclusion criteria were public hospitals with > 20,000 annual admissions, an ICU and emergency department, and no pre-existing MET. Exclusion criteria were patients under14 yr, or not formally admitted. MET activation criteria were: 1) airway: if threatened; 2) breathing: respiratory arrests, respiratory rate < 5 or > 36 breaths.min(-1); 3) circulation: cardiac arrests, pulse rate < 40 or > 140, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg; 4) neurology: decrease of > 2 Glasgow coma scale points, repeated or extended seizures; 5) other: patients not meeting above criteria but ward staff seriously worried. Cardiac arrests were defined by absence of a palpable pulse; unplanned ICU admission as unscheduled transfer from the ward to the ICU; and unexpected deaths were those without a pre-existing not-for-resuscitation (NFR) order.
   Intervention: Hospitals were randomized to no change in current functioning (maintenance of an arrest team) or initiation of MET. This followed four months of instruction for clinical staff in MET hospitals, before a six-month study period. Standardized MET instruction focused on reinforcing MET calling-criteria, the importance of identifying at-risk patients and the need to promptly initiate the MET.
   Primary endpoint: Composite outcome of the incidence (events divided by eligible patients admitted to hospital) for 1) cardiac arrests without a NFR; 2) unplanned ICU admission; and 3) unexpected deaths on general wards.
   Results: MET initiation was associated with significantly more calls to resuscitation (cardiac arrest or medical emergency) teams (3.1 vs 8.7 per 1,000 admissions P = 0.0001). Only 30% of unplanned ICU admissions were preceded by MET activation, but this was significantly more than 9% for control hospitals (P = 0.009). There was no significant difference in primary Outcome (5.86 control vs 5.31 MET per 1,000 admissions, P = 0.640). There also were no differences in the secondary outcomes: cardiac arrest (1.64 vs 1.31 per 1,000 admissions P = 0.736); unplanned ICU admission (4.68 vs 4.19 per 1,000 admissions P = 0.599) or unexpected death (1.18 vs 1.06 per 100 admissions P = 0.752). There was a decrease in the rate of cardiac arrests (P = 0.03) and unexpected deaths (P = 0.01) over six months for both the MET and control hospitals.
   Conclusions: The MET system greatly increased the frequency of emergency team calling but did not decrease cardiac arrests, unplanned ICU admissions or unexpected death.

TI  - Treatment with dipyridamole improves cardiac function and prevent injury in a rat model of hemorrhage
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of death despite the improvement in emergency services. One reason is that the resuscitation policies are designed to reestablish tissue perfusion, but not to prevent the inflammatory response to shock that cause myocardial dysfunction and injury. Dipyridamole is a platelet inhibitor that promotes anti-inflammatory effects. The present study investigated the therapeutic value of treatment with dipyridamole before resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock on myocardial injury and protection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 3 experimental groups (n=6 per group): 1) hemorrhage, 2) hemorrhage treated with dipyridamole, and 3) sham hemorrhage. Rats were hemorrhaged over 60 min to reach a mean arterial blood pressure of 40 mm Hg. After 60 min hemorrhagic shock, rats were treated or not by injection of 1 mL of (20 mu g/L) dipyridamole intra-arterially. Resuscitation was made in vivo by reinfusion of the shed blood to restore norm tension for 30 min. Arterial blood samples were collected for measurements of TNF-alpha. Left ventricular generated pressure and + dP/dtmax was significantly higher in dipyridamole treated rats compared to the untreated group. Myocardial biopsy samples were taken for light and electron microscopy. Dipyridamole decreased the number of inflammatory cells and mitochondrial swollen. Dipyridamole also decreased the plasma levels of TNF-alpha. Our results demonstrate that treatment with dipyridamole before in vivo resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock protect the myocardium against post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by decreasing the inflammatory response to shock.

TI  - Furosemide and albumin for diuresis of edema (FADE): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: Fluid retention is a common complication of critical illness. It typically results from large-volume fluid infusions during acute resuscitation and is worsened by hypoalbuminemia. Recognized as edema, fluid retention is important for its association with delayed weaning and increased mortality. The standard treatment is the administration of diuretics, with or without albumin. We hypothesize that intravenous 25% albumin plus furosemide, by comparison with furosemide alone, improves diuresis, oxygenation, and hemodynamic stability in the deresuscitation of critically ill, hypoalbuminemic patients. We propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a trial to investigate this hypothesis.
   Methods/Design: FADE is a single-center, parallel, pilot randomized controlled trial. We aim to allocate 50 hemodynamically stable, hypoalbuminemic adult patients receiving diuresis to treatment with either 100 ml of either 25% albumin or normal saline placebo twice daily, for a total of six doses. Diuretics are to be prescribed by the caregiving team at least twice daily, and administered within 2 hours following study treatment. Patients, intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators will be blinded to treatment allocation. Feasibility outcome measures include the proportion of patients receiving albumin within 2 hours of diuretic, the proportion of patients receiving the full six doses of study treatment, the proportion of patients who receive open label 25% albumin, and the rate of recruitment. Physiologic, laboratory, and clinical data are collected until discharge from the ICU or until 30 days.
   Discussion: This is the first randomized trial to assess the use of hyperoncotic albumin in addition to diuretics in a general ICU population. Should this pilot study demonstrate feasibility, the primary outcome measure of the larger clinical trial will be the number of ventilator-free days, with secondary clinical outcome measures of duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, episodes of hemodynamic instability and mortality. The addition of 25% albumin to standard diuretic therapy is a promising treatment in the post-resuscitation care of the critically ill patient.

TI  - Outcomes of neonates requiring prolonged stay in the intensive care unit after surgical repair of congenital heart disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: After neonatal cardiac surgery, a number of patients need a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Those patients require tremendous resources and strain the capacity of cardiac units. To date, little knowledge of early and late survival for this challenging population exists.
   Methods: From 2002 to 2012, 108 neonates required a postoperative ICU stay > 30 days. Multivariable regression analyses examined factors associated with hospital death and late survival. Comparison of late outcomes in hospital survivors was made between those who had prolonged ICU stay (n = 82) and contemporaneous neonates who did not (n = 1329).
   Results: Hospital mortality occurred in 26 of 108 patients (24%). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with mortality were use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 3.4 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-9.1], P = .014) and renal failure that required dialysis (odds ratio, 3.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.0-10.0], P = .056). Overall survival at 1 and 8 years was 57% and 51%. Comparison of late outcomes for hospital survivors showed that neonates who required prolonged postoperative stay in the ICU had significantly worse 8-year survival (69% vs 92%; P<. 001) and that the effect of prolonged stay in the ICU on diminished survival was more pronounced in neonates with 2 ventricles (68% vs 95%, hazard ratio, 8.0 [95% confidence interval, 4.2-15.1], P<. 001) than in those with single ventricle (66% vs 81%; hazard ratio, 2.0 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.5], P = .021). Overall, 77% of single-ventricle hospital survivors who required prolonged stay in the ICU progressed to Glenn, with 82% of them reaching or qualifying for subsequent Fontan.
   Conclusions: Prolonged postoperative stay in the ICU is associated with high hospital and significant postdischarge mortality, mainly during the first year. In neonates with single ventricle, prolonged stay in the ICU was associated with high hospital and interstage mortality and usual progression subsequent to Glenn shunt. In contrast, prolonged stay in the ICU in neonates with 2 ventricles was associated with high hospital mortality and considerable decrease in late survival, suggesting a more pronounced deviation from expected survival in those patients.

TI  - Timing of brain computed tomography for predicting neurological prognosis in comatose cardiac arrest survivors: a retrospective observational study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the association between relevant brain computed tomography (CT) parameters at different time and neurological prognosis in adult comatose survivors after cardiac arrest (CA).
   METHODS: A total of 94 CA patients who underwent early and late CT scans (within 24 h and 24 h to 7 d respectively after CA) between January 2018 and April 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. According to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at hospital discharge, the patients were divided into either a good outcome (CPC 1-2) group or a poor-outcome group (CPC 3-5). The grey-to- white matter ratio (GWR) and the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid volume (pCSFV) were measured. In predicting poor outcomes, the prognostic performance of relevant CT parameters was evaluated, and the comparison analysis (expressed as the ratio of parameters in late CT to those in the early CT) of different CT time was conducted.
   RESULTS: Totally 26 patients were in the good-outcome group, while 68 patients were in the poor-outcome group. The putamen density, GWR, and pCSFV in late CT were significantly lower in the poor-outcome group (P<0.05). The ratios of GWR and pCSFV in the poor-outcome group were significantly decreased according to comparison analysis of different CT time (P< 0.05), while there was no significant difference in the ratio of putamen density. GWR-basal ganglia <1.18 in late CT showed the best predictive value. The ratio of pCSFV <0.98 predicted unfavorable neurological outcomes with a sensitivity of 65.9% and a specificity of 93.8% (P=0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Brain CT performed >24 h after CA may be a good choice as a neuroimaging approach to evaluating prognosis. To predict neurological prognosis, comparison analysis of different CT time can be used as another promising tool in comatose CA survivors.

TI  - Biochemical markers and somatosensory evoked potentials in patients after cardiac arrest: The role of neurological outcome scores
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Biochemical markers, e.g. NSE or S100B, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) are considered promising candidates for neurological prognostic predictors in patients after cardiac arrest (CA). The Utstein Templates recommend the use of the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (GP-CPC) to divide patients according to their neurological outcome. However, several studies investigating biochemical markers and SSEP are based on the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). We noticed that many studies failed to exclude patients who died without certified brain damage from patients classified as poor outcome, instead including all patients who died into this category. Therefore, we summarized the published NSE cut-off values and the derived sensitivity and specificity to predict poor outcome of those studies which only included patients with certified brain death in GOS-1 or GP-CPC-5 (group A) vs. those studies which did not differentiate between death from any cause or death due to primary brain damage (group B). On average, mean NSE cut-off values and sensitivity were higher (56 +/- 35 ng/ml, 56 +/- 18%) in group A than in group B (41 +/- 17 ng/ml, 44 +/- 25%), respectively. The specificity remained equally high in both groups. In analogy, the average sensitivity of SSEP to predict poor outcome was higher in group A (76 +/- 11%) than in group B (50 +/- 15%), while the specificity was similar in both groups. Conclusively, inclusion of deaths without certified brain damage after CA in neurological outcome studies will lead to underestimation of the prognostic power of biochemical or electrophysiological markers for brain damage. A modified GOS and GP-CPC score might help to avoid this bias. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: Present and future indications
T2  - ARCHIVES DES MALADIES DU COEUR ET DES VAISSEAUX
CP  - International Symposium on the Treatment of Cardiac Arrhythmias - Recent Advances
AB  - Indications for of automatic cardioverter-defibrillators of automatic in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias have changed since the publications of first guidelines in 1991. Less invasive surgical approaches reduced the perioperative mortality, Tiered therapy devices improved the quality of life by reducing appropriate and inappropriate shocks. A low annual incidence of sudden death with implantable cardioverter defibrillators and frustrating results with antiarrhythmic drugs caused an extension of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications. Despite the absence of prospective studies implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have become a first line treatment for patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias which are not due to acute myocardial infarction, In cardiac arrest survivors implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy has become the gold standard due to the low annual incidence of sudden death seen in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients. The results of ongoing prospective studies comparing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to antiarrhythmic drugs have to be awaited and will influence tomorrow's indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients with documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias Additionally, studies evaluating prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations in patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias might expand indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.

TI  - Bench-to-bedside review: Brain dysfunction in critically ill patients - the intensive care unit and beyond
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Critical care physicians often find themselves prognosticating for their patients, attempting to predict patient survival as well as disability. In the case of neurologic injury, this can be especially difficult. A frequent cause of coma in the intensive care unit is resuscitation following cardiac arrest, for which mortality and severe neurologic disability remain high. Recent studies of the clinical examination, of serum markers such as neuron-specific enolase, and of somatosensory evoked potentials allow accurate and specific prediction of which comatose patients are likely to suffer a poor outcome. Using these tools, practitioners can confidently educate the family for the majority of patients who will die or remain comatose at 1 month. Delirium is a less dramatic form of neurologic injury but, when sought, is strikingly prevalent. In addition, delirium in the intensive care unit is associated with increased mortality and poorer functional recovery, prompting investigation into preventative and therapeutic strategies to counter delirium. Finally, neurologic damage may persist long after the patient's recovery from critical illness, as is the case for cognitive dysfunction detected months and years after critical illness. Psychiatric impairment including depression or post-traumatic stress disorder may also arise. Mechanisms contributing to each of these entities are reviewed.

TI  - Catecholamine-induced Takotsubo syndrome: a case series
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Catecholamine-induced Takotsubo Syndrome (cat-TS) is a type of secondary Takotsubo syndrome, characterized by rapid onset of symptoms, high rate of complications during the acute phase, good short-term prognosis, and frequent apical sparing at echocardiogram. We present two clinical cases of cat-TS treated in our department. Case summary Case one: 78-year-old man, admitted to Ear Nose and Throat Unit for surgical removal of oral squamous cellular carcinoma. During surgery, the occurrence of hypotensive episode was treated with catecholamines. After surgery, the occurrence of atrial fibrillation was followed by evidence of phasic increase of troponin levels and akinesia of midventricular segments. Angiography showed the absence of significant coronary stenoses, and during hospital stay, we observed rapid recovery of wall motion abnormalities. Case two: 64-year-old woman, admitted for hysteropexy surgery, during which cardiac arrest occurred, treated with epinephrine i.v.1 mg and DC shock. Two hours after resuscitation, the patient developed pulmonary oedema, troponin levels increased progressively, and the echocardiogram demonstrated hypokinesia in all midventricular segments with apical sparing. Afterwards, an urgent angiography highlighted normal coronary anatomy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed oedema corresponding to hypokinetic areas. On the seventh day, echocardiogram showed a complete remission of wall motion abnormalities. Discussion These cases warn the physicians about the importance of routinely screening myocardial impairment through clinical assessment, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, and serial cardiac troponin testing after catecholamine i.v. bolus administration. In case of alterations of these exams, performing a prompt echocardiogram allows early detection of cat-TS, to provide immediate suitable medical support and avoid complications.

TI  - A Systematic Literature Review of Artificial Intelligence in Prehospital Emergency Care
T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
AB  - Background: The emergency medical services (EMS) sector, as a complex system, presents substantial hurdles in providing excellent treatment while operating within limited resources, prompting greater adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for improving operational efficiency. While AI models have proved beneficial in healthcare operations, there is limited explainability and interpretability, as well as a lack of data used in their application and technological advancement. Methods: The scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews, using PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, with a procedure of double screening and extraction. The search included articles published from 2018 to the beginning of 2025. Studies were excluded if they did not explicitly identify an artificial intelligence (AI) component, lacked relevance to emergency department (ED) or prehospital contexts, failed to report measurable outcomes or evaluations, or did not exploit real-world data. We analyzed the data source used, clinical subclasses, AI domains, ML algorithms, their performance, as well as potential roles for large language models (LLMs) in future applications. Results: A comprehensive PRISMA-guided methodology was used to search academic databases, finding 1181 papers on prehospital emergency treatment from 2018 to 2025, with 65 articles identified after an extensive screening procedure. The results reveal a significant increase in AI publications. A notable technological advancement in the application of AI in EMS using different types of data was explored. Conclusions: These findings highlighted that AI and ML have emerged as revolutionary innovations with huge potential in the fields of healthcare and medicine. There are several promising AI interventions that can improve prehospital emergency care, particularly for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and triage prioritization scenarios. Implications for EMS Practice: Integrating AI methods into prehospital care can optimize the use of available resources, as well as triage and dispatch efficiency. LLMs may have the potential to improve understanding and assist in decision-making under pressure in emergency situations by combining various forms of recorded data. However, there is a need to emphasize continued research and strong collaboration between AI experts and EMS physicians to ensure the safe, ethical, and effective integration of AI into EMS practice.

TI  - Kallistatin deficiency exacerbates neuronal damage after cardiac arrest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The purpose of study was to evaluate that kallistatin deficiency causes excessive production of reactive oxygen species and exacerbates neuronal injury after cardiac arrest. For in vitro study, kallistatin knockdown human neuronal cells were given ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated. For clinical study, cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the ICU were divided into the good (CPC 1-2) and poor (CPC 3-5) 6-month neurological outcome groups. The serum level of kallistatin, Nox-1, H2O2 were measured. Nox-1 and H2O2 levels were increased in the kallistatin knockdown human neuronal cells with ischemia-reperfusion injury (p < 0.001) and caspase-3 was elevated and apoptosis was promoted (SERPINA4 siRNA: p < 0.01). Among a total of 62 cardiac arrest survivors (16 good, 46 poor), serum kallistatin were lower, and Nox-1 were higher in the poor neurological group at all time points after admission to the ICU (p = 0.013 at admission; p = 0.020 at 24 h; p = 0.011 at 72 h). At 72 h, H2O2 were higher in the poor neurological group (p = 0.038). Kallistatin deficiency exacerbates neuronal ischemia-reperfusion injury and low serum kallistatin levels were associated with poor neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - Living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator: patients' preferences and needs for information provision and care options
T2  - EUROPACE
AB  - Aims The clinical management and care of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has shifted from face-to-face in-clinic visits to remote monitoring. Reduced interactions between patients and healthcare professionals may impede patients' transition to adapting post-implant. We examined patients' needs and preferences for information provision and care options and overall satisfaction with treatment.
   Methods and results Patients implanted with a first-time ICD or defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy (n = 389) within the last 2 years at Odense University Hospital were asked to complete a purpose-designed and standardized set of questionnaires. The level of satisfaction with information provision was high; only 13.1% were dissatisfied. Psychological support for patients (39.9%), their relatives (43.1%), and deactivation of the ICD towards end of life (47.8%) were among the top five topics that patients reported to have received no information about. The top five care options that patients had missed were talking to the same healthcare professional (75.2%), receiving ongoing feedback via remote monitoring (61.1%), having a personal conversation with a staff member 2-3 weeks post-implant (59.6%), having an exercise tolerance test (52.5%), and staff asking how patients felt while hospitalized (50.4%). Patients with a secondary prevention indication and cardiac arrest survivors had specific needs, including a wish for a psychological consult post-discharge.
   Conclusion Despite a high satisfaction level with information provision, particular topics are not broached with patients (e.g. device activation) and patients have unmet needs that are not met in current clinical practice.

TI  - A review of early warning systems for prompt detection of patients at risk for clinical decline
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - Early Warning Scores (EWS) are a composite evaluation of a patient's basic physiology, changes of which are the first indicators of clinical decline and are used to prompt further patient assessment and when indicated intervention. These are sometimes referred to as "track and triggers systems" with tracking meant to denote periodic observation of physiology and trigger being a predetermined response criteria. This review article examines the most widely used EWS, with special attention paid to those used in military and trauma populations. The earliest EWS is the Modified Early Earning Score (MEWS). In MEWS, points are allocated to vital signs based on their degree of abnormality, and summed to yield an aggregate score. A score above a threshold would elicit a clinical response such as a rapid response team. Modified Early Earning Score was subsequently followed up with the United Kingdom's National Early Warning Score, the electronic cardiac arrest triage score, and the 10 Signs of Vitality score, among others. Severity of illness indicators have been in military and civilian trauma populations, such as the Revised Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and Trauma and Injury Severity. The sequential organ failure assessment score and its attenuated version quick sequential organ failure assessment were developed to aggressively identify patients near septic shock. Effective EWS have certain characteristics. First, they should accurately capture vital signs information. Second, almost all data should be derived electronically rather than manually. Third, the measurements should take into consideration multiple organ systems. Finally, information that goes into an EWS must be captured in a timely manner. Future trends include the use of machine learning to detect subtle changes in physiology and the inclusion of data from biomarkers. As EWS improve, they will be more broadly used in both military and civilian environments.

TI  - Nurses' Perceptions of Simulation-Based Interprofessional Training Program for Rapid Response and Code Blue Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING CARE QUALITY
AB  - Following completion of an interprofessional simulation program for rapid response and code blue events, we explored hospital unit nurses' perspectives of the training, through a mixed-methods analysis. The results of this study advocate for the use of simulation training in preparing nurses and promoting communication among team members, effective teamwork, and early recognition of clinically deteriorating patients. This study provides support for the implementation and continued use of simulation interprofessional programs in hospital settings.

TI  - Survival with an arterial pH of 6.57 following major trauma with exsanguinating haemorrhage associated with traumatic amputation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - We report the survival of a multiply injured patient with exanguinating haemorrhage and an arterial pH of 6.5. following a road vehicle crash. The previously healthy 38 years old male driver veered off the motorway and collided with a tree. The ambulance arrived at the scene 9 min after being called by an eyewitness and, following rapid extrication from the wreckage; the patient arrived in hospital 27 min later (with a GCS of 6). and was immediately intubated. The patient had suffered near-complete amputation of the left leg at upper femoral shaft level. along with multiple distal fractures and open wounds. He also sustained a head injury and closed displaced fractures of left radius and ulna. The patient received 21 of crystalloids in the pre-hospital phase, Once in hospital the haemorrhage was controlled with a pressure dressing and intra-venous fluids were kept to a minimum until he was taken promptly to theatre. His initial arterial blood sample revealed a pH of 6.57, pCo(2) of 9.18 kPa, apO(2) of 70.11 kPa and a base excess of -27.5 mmol l(-1). The co-oximeter Hb was 5.8 g dl(-1). Haemorrhage was controlled in theatre where he was transfused a total of 30 U of blood, 1 pack of platelets, 12 U of fresh frozen plasma, 3.5 1 of crystalloids and 1.5 1 of colloid. Sodium bicarbonate was administered three times. He subsequently remained ventilated in intensive care unit (ICU). Over the following week he survived sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and myoglobinuria (with transient renal failure) attributable to rhabdomyolysis secondary to muscle necrosis. He later underwent diversion colostomy and disarticulating amputation of the left femur after several debridements. After 6 weeks on ICU he made an excellent recovery will full return of his mental abilities, In this case, the serial arterial blood samples obtained were reliable. The lactic acidosis observed was the result of profound tissue hypo-perfusion and its rate of clearance seems to have greater prognostic value than its peak or initial value. Several factors may have contributed to the patient's survival: rapid retrieval from the scene, early intubation with excellent subsequent oxygenation (thus avoiding the dangerous combination of hypoxia and acidosis with synergistic influence on cardiac depression) and limited initial fluid resuscitation in the emergency department with prompt surgical intervention and vigorous restoration of organ perfusion after surgical haemostasis. Immediate operative haemostasis, coupled with restricted fluid administration beforehand and vigorous restoration of organ perfusion afterwards is now replacing the old resuscitation paradigm. Perhaps this shift in practice has helped this patient to survive. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Prognostic factors associated with adverse outcome among critically ill elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit
T2  - GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - IntroductionDespite concerns over the appropriateness and quality of care provided in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the end of life, the number of elderly patients who receive critical care is increasing. Despite this, many physicians have doubts as to whether elderly patients are good candidates for ICU care because of the apparently poor outcome during and after critical care in this population. The objective of the present study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of a geriatric population admitted to the ICU.
   Materials and methodsA single-center, prospective, observational study was carried out among geriatric patients, aged 75 years or older, admitted to ICU.
   ResultsA total of 71 patients were admitted to ICU during the study period. Their mean age was 83 years (range 75-98 years), with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score of 21.8 (range 8-39) on admission to ICU. A total of 48 patients (68%) required mechanical ventilation, and 39 (55%) received at least one vasoactive drug. The mean ICU length of stay was 4.6 days (range 1-18 days), and it was similar for ICU survivors and non-survivors (4.7 vs 4.5). A total of 14 patients (19.7%) were admitted after cardiac arrest, and eight (57.1%) of them died in ICU. A total of 28 patients (39.4%) died in the hospital, and 18 (25.4%) died in ICU.
   ConclusionAdvanced age, critical illness, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and needs for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressor therapy are independent risk factors associated with adverse outcome in elderly patients admitted to ICU. Alternatives for ICU admission should be considered in geriatric patients with severe critical illnesses. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2015; 15: 889-894.

TI  - Emicizumab prophylaxis in patients with acquired haemophilia A (GTH-AHA-EMI): an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study
T2  - LANCET HAEMATOLOGY
AB  - Background Acquired haemophilia A is caused by neutralising autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII, leading to severe bleeding. Standard treatment involves immunosuppressive therapy, which is associated with adverse events and mortality in the frail population of patients with acquired haemophilia A. This study investigated whether emicizumab, a factor VIIIa mimetic antibody, protects patients with acquired haemophilia A from bleeding and allows deferral of immunosuppression during the first 12 weeks after diagnosis. Methods We report final results of an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial. Adult patients with acquired haemophilia A from 16 haemophilia treatment centres in Germany and Austria were eligible if they had not previously received immunosuppression. Patients received emicizumab subcutaneously (6 and 3 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, 1 center dot 5 mg/kg weekly until week 12), but no immunosuppression. Follow-up was until week 24. The primary endpoint was the number of clinically relevant bleeds per patient-week until week 12. Emicizumab was considered effective if the mean bleeding rate was significantly below 0 center dot 15 bleeds per patient-week, the rate observed in a previous study of patients with acquired haemophilia A treated with bypassing agents and immunosuppression but no emicizumab. The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04188639 and is complete. Findings Of 49 patients screened from March 25, 2021, to June 10, 2022, 47 were enrolled (23 women, 24 men). Median age was 76 years (IQR 66-80), 46 (98%) of 47 patients were White, median factor VIII activity was 1 center dot 4 IU/dL (0 center dot 3-5 center dot 6), and median inhibitor concentration was 11 center dot 4 Bethesda units per mL (3 center dot 9-42 center dot 7). Mean breakthrough bleeding rate was 0 center dot 04 bleeds per patient-week (upper 97 center dot 5% CI 0 center dot 06). 33 (70%) of 47 patients had no bleeding events, seven patients (15%) had one bleed, six patients (13%) had two bleeds, and one patient (2%) had three bleeds. Adverse events of grade 3 or worse included COVID-19 (n=2), acute kidney injury (n=2), and stroke (n=1). Four of 47 patients died, including two deaths related to bleeding, one from COVID-19, and one from cardiac arrest (none were judged as related to emicizumab). Interpretation This study suggests that emicizumab prophylaxis prevents bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia A and that immunosuppressive therapy can be deferred while patients are receiving this treatment. The low number of thromboembolic events, severe infections, and fatalities observed in this study are promising.

TI  - Participatory design of probability-based decision support tools for in-hospital nurses
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB  - To describe nurses' preferences for the design of a probability-based clinical decision support (PB-CDS) tool for in-hospital clinical deterioration.
   A convenience sample of bedside nurses, charge nurses, and rapid response nurses (n = 20) from adult and pediatric hospitals completed participatory design sessions with researchers in a simulation laboratory to elicit preferred design considerations for a PB-CDS tool. Following theme-based content analysis, we shared findings with user interface designers and created a low-fidelity prototype.
   Three major themes and several considerations for design elements of a PB-CDS tool surfaced from end users. Themes focused on "painting a picture" of the patient condition over time, promoting empowerment, and aligning probability information with what a nurse already believes about the patient. The most notable design element consideration included visualizing a temporal trend of the predicted probability of the outcome along with user-selected overlapping depictions of vital signs, laboratory values, and outcome-related treatments and interventions. Participants expressed that the prototype adequately operationalized requests from the design sessions.
   Participatory design served as a valuable method in taking the first step toward developing PB-CDS tools for nurses. This information about preferred design elements of tools that support, rather than interrupt, nurses' cognitive workflows can benefit future studies in this field as well as nurses' practice.

TI  - Consensus Statement of the IAP - Neurodevelopmental Chapter On Neurodevelopmental Disorders Habilitation Process: Strategic Plan for Prevention, Early Detection and Early Intervention
T2  - INDIAN PEDIATRICS
AB  - JustificationNeurodevelopmental disorders, as per DSM-V, are described as a group of conditions with onset in the development period of childhood. There is a need to distinguish the process of habilitation and rehabilitation, especially in a developing country like India, and define the roles of all stakeholders to reduce the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders.ProcessSubject experts and members of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) Chapter of Neurodevelopmental Pediatrics, who reviewed the literature on the topic, developed key questions and prepared the first draft on guidelines. The guidelines were then discussed by the whole group through online meetings, and the contentious issues were discussed until a general consensus was arrived at. Following this, the final guidelines were drafted by the writing group and approved by all contributors.ObjectivesThese guidelines aim to provide practical clinical guidelines for pediatricians on the prevention, early diagnosis and management of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in the Indian settings. It also defines the roles of developmental pediatricians and development nurse counselor.StatementThere is a need for nationwide studies with representative sampling on epidemiology of babies with early NDD in the first 1000 days in India. Specific learning disability (SLD) has been documented as the most common NDD after 6 years in India, and special efforts should be made to establish the epidemiology of infants and toddlers at risk for SLD, where ever measures are available. Preconception counseling as part of focusing on first 1000 days; Promoting efforts to organize systematic training programs in Newborn Resuscitation Program (NRP); Lactation management; Developmental follow-up and Early stimulation for SNCU/NICU graduates; Risk stratification of NICU graduates, Newborn Screening; Counseling parents; Screening for developmental delay by trained professionals using simple validated Indian screening tools at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months; Holistic assessment of 10 NDDs at child developmental clinics (CDCs)/district early intervention centre (DEICs) by multidisciplinary team members; Confirmation of diagnosis by developmental pediatrician/developmental neurologist/child psychiatrist using clinical/diagnostic tools; Providing parent guided low intensity multimodal therapies before 3 years age as a center-based or home-based or community-based rehabilitation; Developmental pediatrician to seek guidance of pediatric neurologist, geneticist, child psychiatrist, physiatrist, and other specialists, when necessary; and Need to promote ongoing academic programs in clinical child development for capacity building of community based therapies, are the chief recommendations.

TI  - Developing an Electroencephalogram-based Model to Predict Awakening after Cardiac Arrest Using Partial Processing with the BIS Engine
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background:Accurate prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest is a challenging and high-stakes endeavor. The authors sought to determine whether internal electroencephalogram (EEG) subparameters extracted by the BIS monitor (Medtronic, USA), a device commonly used to estimate depth of anesthesia intraoperatively, could be repurposed to predict recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, a three-layer neural network was trained to predict recovery of consciousness to the point of command following versus not based on 48 h of continuous EEG recordings in 315 comatose patients admitted to a single U.S. academic medical center after cardiac arrest (derivation cohort, n = 181; validation cohort, n = 134). Continuous EEGs were partially processed into subparameters using virtualized emulation of the BIS Engine (i.e., the internal software of the BIS monitor) applied to signals from the frontotemporal leads of the standard 10-20 EEG montage. The model was trained on hourly averaged measurements of these internal subparameters. This model's performance was compared to the modified Westhall qualitative EEG scoring framework.Results:Maximum prognostic accuracy in the derivation cohort was achieved using a network trained on only four BIS subparameters (inverse burst suppression ratio, mean spectral power density, gamma power, and theta/delta power). In a held-out sample of 134 patients, the model outperformed current state-of-the-art qualitative EEG assessment techniques at predicting recovery of consciousness (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.86; accuracy, 0.87; sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.88; positive predictive value, 0.71; negative predictive value, 0.94). Gamma band power has not been previously reported as a correlate of recovery potential after cardiac arrest.Conclusions:In patients comatose after cardiac arrest, four EEG features calculated internally by the BIS Engine were repurposed by a compact neural network to achieve a prognostic accuracy superior to the current clinical qualitative accepted standard, with high sensitivity for recovery. These features hold promise for assessing patients after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Management of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in the endovascular era
T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objectives: Our institution treats about 30 patients per year with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). Between 2002 and 2007, our 30-day mortality averaged 58%. In July 2007, we implemented an algorithm to promote endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) when feasible. This report describes the outcome with this approach.
   Methods: Data on patients presenting with rAAA between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2007, were reviewed and used for comparison to prospectively collected data. Data on patients presenting between July 1, 2007, and April 30, 2009, were collected on all patients after implementation of a structured protocol. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test were performed to compare survival times for three groups (pre-protocol, post-protocol with open surgery, and post-protocol with EVAR).
   Results: During the study period, 187 patients with rAAA presented to our institution. Before implementation of the algorithm, 131 patients with rAAA presented and 128 were treated. The 30-day mortality rate was 57.8%. After implementation of the protocol, 56 patients with rAAA were managed. Twenty-seven patients (48%) underwent,successful EVAR, and 24 patients (43%) underwent open repair. Five patients (9%) underwent comfort care only. In the post-protocol period, 5 patients in the EVAR group (18.5%) and 13 patients in the open group (54.2%) died during the follow-up period for all overall 30-day mortality rate of 35.3% (P=.008 vs 57.8% pre-protocol). After implementation of a structured protocol for managing rAAA, there was a relative risk reduction in 30-day mortality of 35% compared to the time before implementation of the protocol (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4%-51%) corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 22.5% (95% CI, 6.8%-38.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.78; P=.007). After adjusting for key factors predicting mortality, the odds ratio is 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P=.001).
   Conclusion: Use of an algorithm favoring endovascular repair resulted in a highly significant reduction in rAAA mortality in our urban hospital. Thirty-day mortality for open repair was no different between pre- and post-protocol eras. With modern techniques of resuscitation and surgical management, a majority of patients presenting with rAAA can survive. (J Vase Surg 2010;51:9-18.)

TI  - Limiting Blood Loss in Orthopaedic Trauma: Strategies and Effects
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Trauma is a major cause of mortality globally, with post-traumatic hemorrhage being the leading cause of death amongst trauma patients. In this paper, the authors review the underlying pathophysiology of trauma-related hemorrhagic shock, specifically the factors which contribute to the development of the acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS). We then review the best available evidence for treatment strategies in the pre-hospital setting, as well as the in-hospital setting. Interventions that are strongly supported in the literature include utilization of a well-organized trauma system with direct transport to a designated trauma centre, the early use of tranexamic acid, and damage control orthopaedic surgical techniques and resuscitation protocols. Targeted resuscitation is an evolving field, with use of thromboelastography to guide resuscitation being a particularly promising area. Special trauma populations at particularly high risk are also reviewed, including the geriatric population, as well as unstable pelvic fractures, which are each at increased risk for poor outcomes, and deserve special attention. Major advances have been made in this important area, and ongoing research into the understanding and correction of ACoTS will continue to guide practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Whole blood hemostatic resuscitation in pediatric trauma: A nationwide propensity-matched analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - 7th Annual Meeting of the Pediatric-Trauma-Society (PTS) on Learning in Virtual Environment (LIVE)
AB  - BACKGROUND Whole blood (WB) has shown promise in pediatric trauma resuscitation following its prominent role in the resuscitation of adult trauma patients. Although WB in children has been shown to be feasible, its effectiveness has yet to be explored. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of WB transfusion as an adjunct to component therapy (CT) compared with CT only as early resuscitation for pediatric trauma patients. METHODS Children aged 1 to 17 years, who were transfused within 4 hours of presentation, were identified in the Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017 database. Patients were stratified into those receiving WB-CT versus CT alone. Propensity score matching in a 1:2 ratio was performed based on patient demographics, injury characteristics, hemorrhage control interventions, and trauma center level. The primary outcome measure was patient transfusion requirement. Secondary outcome measures were mortality, hospital length of stay, ventilation days, and major complications. RESULTS A total of 135 children receiving WB-CT were matched to 270 patients receiving CT only. Mean (SD) age was 12 (5) years, 66% were male, and the median Injury Severity Score was 32 (range, 20-43). A total of 51% of patients were in shock, 34% had penetrating injuries, and 41% required surgical intervention for hemorrhage control. Total blood products transfused were significantly decreased in children receiving WB, both at 4 hours (35 [22-73] vs. 48 [33-95] mL/kg; p = 0.013) and 24 hours (39 [24-97] vs. 53 [36-119] mL/kg; p < 0.001). Mortality rate at 24 hours (19.3% vs. 21.9%; p = 0.546) and in-hospital mortality (31.1% vs. 34.4%; p = 0.502) were not different. Similarly, no difference in hospital length of stay and rates of major complications was found. Patients in the WB group required significantly less ventilation days (2 [2-6] vs. 3 [2-8] days; p = 0.021). CONCLUSION Using WB as an adjunct to CT was associated with decreased transfusion requirements and ventilation days in pediatric trauma patients.

TI  - Physicians' impression on the elders' functionality influences decision making for emergency care
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background and aims: This study analyzes the elements that compose the emergency physicians' criterion for selecting elderly patients for intensive care treatment. This issue has not been studied in-depth.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 4 university teaching hospitals, covering 101 randomly selected elderly patients admitted to emergency department and their respective physicians.
   Physicians were asked to forecast their plans for treatment or therapeutic abstention, in the event that patients might require aggressive measures (cardiopulmonary resuscitation or admission to critical care units). Data were collected on physicians' reasons for taking such decisions and their patients' functional capacity and cognitive status (Katz index and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly).
   A logistic regression model was constructed taking physicians' decisions as the dependent variables and adjusting for patient factors and physician impressions.
   Results: The functional status reported by reliable informants and the mental status measured by validated instruments were not coincident with the physicians' perception (functional status kappa, 0.47; mental status kappa, 0.26). A multivariate analysis showed that the age and the functional and mental status of patients, as perceived by the physicians, were the variables that better explained the physicians' decisions.
   Conclusions: Physicians' impressions on the functional and mental status of their patients significantly influenced their selection of patients for high-intensity treatments despite the fact that some of these impressions were not correct. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Advanced Cardiogenic-shock Team versus standard care in cardiogenic SHOCK: a single centre service evaluation project
T2  - OPEN HEART
AB  - Background Cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) carries high mortality. Early revascularisation improves survival, but the effect of structured multidisciplinary care on outcomes remains underexplored.Methods and results ACT-SHOCK is a service evaluation at a UK tertiary cardiac centre. Between May 2023 and May 2024, 82 patients with AMI-related CS requiring emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were identified using protocolised physiological criteria and managed by an Advanced Cardiogenic-Shock Team (ACT). The ACT comprised interventional cardiologists, intensivists, anaesthetists, critical care staff and cardiac physiologists, coordinating PCI and ongoing care. Outcomes were compared with 83 historical controls from the year preceding ACT roll-out, who received standard care without ACT activation. Primary endpoints were 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes included predictors of 30-day mortality. Within the ACT cohort, elevated lactate, critical care admission, invasive ventilation, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) Shock Stage E at first medical contact predicted 1-year mortality. Adjusted analyses showed ACT management was associated with lower 1-year mortality compared with standard care (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.92; p=0.026). Although 30-day mortality was lower in the ACT group, this did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.29; p=0.26). Escalation from coronary care to critical care during the recovery phase occurred more promptly in the ACT group (9.7% vs 2.4%, p=0.09). At 24 hours, a smaller proportion of ACT patients remained in SCAI stages D/E compared with standard care (42% vs 48%; p=0.003).Methods and results ACT-SHOCK is a service evaluation at a UK tertiary cardiac centre.

TI  - Pulmonary Embolism in a Psychiatric Patient
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - "Ms. K," a 30-year-old uninsured Russian-speaking woman with bipolar disorder, was brought to the emergency department by family members for aggressive behavior and religious preoccupation. She had stopped taking her prescribed olanzapine and valproate a week earlier. Her medical record showed nine previous psychiatric hospitalizations and a history of hypothyroidism and obesity.
   Ms. K's vital signs in the emergency department were initially stable, with the exception of a pulse between 100 and 115. Results of a chemistry panel, liver function tests, and a blood count were normal. A toxicology screen and blood alcohol test were negative. The patient was deemed medically clear and referred to an acute inpatient psychiatric facility. Because no beds were available, she was restrained in her hospital bed with a Posey belt for 2 days before she was transferred, in accordance with emergency department policy. During her stay in the emergency department, she received no medications but became progressively more withdrawn and hypoactive.
   On admission to the psychiatric facility, Ms. K's pulse was 112, her blood pressure 106/78 mmHg, her temperature 37.4 degrees C, and her O-2 saturation 98%. She exhibited diminished spontaneous movements and goal-directed behavior and required extensive prompting and supervision to walk into the dayroom. On interview, she was unengaged, with poor eye contact and minimal spontaneous speech. She exhibited psychomotor slowing and spent long periods standing still in the central area of the dayroom, staring ahead.
   She was started on lorazepam, 2 mg t.i.d., for catatonia. She soon began to improve, ambulating to meals and to the dayroom with minimal prompting. On day 3 of her hospital admission, olanzapine and valproate were restarted. On day 7, she spent most of the day out of bed and requested to bathe. Staff went to check on her and found her collapsed in the shower. No spontaneous breaths or pulse were detected; CPR was performed, but she was pronounced dead. After an autopsy, the coroner reported "a large, nonmalignant mucinous tumor of the left ovary that occupied nearly a third of her abdominal cavity" and "obstructed pelvic veins and lower IVC [inferior vena cava] enough to cause deep vein thrombosis. Her fatal complication was acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism."
   Further history from the family revealed that before Ms. K's psychiatric decompensation, they had brought her to local emergency departments on three occasions recently because of increasing abdominal girth and discomfort. They initially suspected that she was pregnant, but repeated pregnancy tests were negative. Two of the hospitals performed ultrasound examinations and identified a likely benign ovarian mass. Both deemed it nonemergent and instructed the patient to follow up with outpatient gynecologic services, which her family was unable to coordinate.

TI  - Integrating Health Data-Driven Machine Learning Algorithms to Evaluate Risk Factors of Early Stage Hypertension at Different Levels of HDL and LDL Cholesterol
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Purpose: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major worldwide health burden. As the risk factors of CVD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are most mentioned. Early stage hypertension in the population with dyslipidemia is an important public health hazard. This study was the application of data-driven machine learning (ML), demonstrating complex relationships between risk factors and outcomes and promising predictive performance with vast amounts of medical data, aimed to investigate the association between dyslipidemia and the incidence of early stage hypertension in a large cohort with normal blood pressure at baseline. Methods: This study analyzed annual health screening data for 71,108 people from 2005 to 2017, including data for 27 risk-related indicators, sourced from the MJ Group, a major health screening center in Taiwan. We used five machine learning (ML) methods-stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (Lasso), ridge regression (Ridge), and gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost)-to develop a multi-stage ML algorithm-based prediction scheme and then evaluate important risk factors at the early stage of hypertension, especially for groups with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels within or out of the reference range. Results: Age, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting plasma glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with hypertension. The hemoglobin level was also a positive contributor to blood pressure elevation and it appeared among the top three important risk factors in all LDL-C/HDL-C groups; therefore, these variables may be important in affecting blood pressure in the early stage of hypertension. A residual contribution to blood pressure elevation was found in groups with increased LDL-C. This suggests that LDL-C levels are associated with CPR levels, and that the LDL-C level may be an important factor for predicting the development of hypertension. Conclusion: The five prediction models provided similar classifications of risk factors. The results of this study show that an increase in LDL-C is more important than the start of a drop in HDL-C in health screening of sub-healthy adults. The findings of this study should be of value to health awareness raising about hypertension and further discussion and follow-up research.

TI  - Understanding First-Aid Learning Intention Through Using Social Media: Perceptions from External Emergency Events and Individual Internal Changes
T2  - E-BUSINESS: DIGITAL EMPOWERMENT FOR AN INTELLIGENT FUTURE, PT I, WHICEB 2023
CP  - 22nd Wuhan International Conference on E-business (WHICEB)
AB  - Emergency events, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, are China's leading causes of mortality. However, witnesses of emergencies are seldom trained with first-aid measures before emergency events happens. Relative to traditional offline first-aid training methods, social media greatly enhanced audiences' interest in first-aid learning in a more entertaining, time-saving, and labor-saving way. Based on Construal Level Theory (CLT), this study aims to understand the impact of external emergencies (past emergencies experience) on individual internal change (psychological distances) and subsequently generate first-aid learning intention through using social media. As emergencies are severe but not widespread, this study only examines social and spatial dimensions of psychological distance (PD) to broaden the application scenarios of CLT. At the same time, we apply prosociality to measure the individual difference. This study conducts a survey in a first-aid popularization account on Sina Weibo. 348 participants, who had never learned first-aid knowledge and skills before, engaged. Results prove that both PDs and prosociality may be impacted by external emergency experiences, then promote related learning intention. This study also finds that prosociality moderates the relationship between spatial distance and related learning intention. This study roots in an emergency context and broadens the application of CLT in first-aid learning. At the same time, since first-aid training is usually hard to grasp and residents usually do not need complex skills to rescue people in emergency events, we applied social media as our learning context in this study to lower the threshold of first-aid education.

TI  - Time trends of myocardial infarction 28-day case-fatality in the 1990s: is there a contribution from different changes among socioeconomic classes?
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Background/objective: Almost two-thirds of the coronary death rate decrease in the northern Italian Brianza MONICA male population, between 1993-4 and 1997-8, are attributable to a reduction in 28-day myocardial infarction (MI) case-fatality. The present paper investigates the factors associated with MI case-fatality decrease and in particular the role of socio-occupational classes (SOCs).
   Methods: Standardised information on acute coronary care and intervention before and during the hospitalisation was collected for all coronary events (n=1817) registered in 1993-4 and in 1997-8 among 35-64-yearold male residents in Brianza. Deaths within 28 days after MI were carefully investigated. Five SOCs were defined adopting the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero method. Differences in 28-day MI case-fatality and in acute phase intervention and treatment over time and among SOCs in each period were assessed.
   Results: 28-day MI case-fatality reduction (27.2%) can be mainly attributed to a decreased proportion of MI events that were fatal before reaching the hospital. In the lower SOCs significant changes in MI case-fatality were detected between 1993-4 and 1997-8. Differences in acute phase intervention and treatment between the periods were observed. SOC differences both in prevalence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in the pre-hospital qualified intervention score were detected in the first period only.
   Conclusions: In the study population MI case-fatality reduction can be mainly attributed to a more effective and prompt management before hospitalisation and to an improvement in acute treatment during hospitalisation. This enhancement is made available to the whole population overtaking social differences.

TI  - Hypothermia: An easy-to-miss, dangerous disorder in winter weather
T2  - GERIATRICS
AB  - A variety of age-related physiologic factors and disease states predispose older patients to hypothermia. These include a decreased ability to produce heat, malnutrition, medications, infections, and social factors such as isolation and poverty. The subtle clinical signs and symptoms of mild hypothermia may mimic cognitive decline, cerebral vascular accident, hypothyroidism, or myxedema coma. The challenge for the physician is to clinically recognize hypothermia and provide prompt diagnosis and treatment. Medical management of the older patient with moderate to severe hypothermia requires in-hospital intensive care, as life-threatening conditions may arise during stabilization and resuscitation.

TI  - Predictive role of neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio in acute fulminant myocarditis patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - BackgroundVenoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation induces an inflammatory response upon initiation. The neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio is a promising biomarker for predicting mortality in patients with systemic inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the association between neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio and in-hospital mortality in pediatric patients with acute fulminant myocarditis undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and to develop a PEACE model for predicting mortality in these patients.MethodsThis retrospective study included pediatric patients diagnosed with acute fulminant myocarditis who underwent venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between July 2015 and August 2022. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the independent association between the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio and the risk of in-hospital mortality. In addition, we utilized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to select predictive factors, ultimately developing a nomogram to predict outcomes in pediatric patients receiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.ResultsA total of 125 patients eligible for analysis were included in this study, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 28.8%. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Restricted cubic splines revealed a positive association between the two (Pnonlinearity = 0.84). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and backward stepwise logistic regression identified age, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, lactate levels, and the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio as key predictive factors. Using these factors, a nomogram (PEACE model) was developed to predict in-hospital mortality in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-0.92], with the inclusion of the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio significantly enhancing the model's predictive accuracy.ConclusionsThe neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio may serve as a potential predictor for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in-hospital mortality in pediatric patients with acute fulminant myocarditis, suggesting that inflammatory responses are associated with patient prognosis. The PEACE model is superior in predicting the prognosis of pediatric patients supported by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and can help in clinical decision making.

TI  - Living and dying with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over patients' last 6 months of life.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort from the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT).
   SETTING: Hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD at five US teaching hospitals.
   PARTICIPANTS: COPD patients who died within 1 year (n = 416) among 1016 enrolled.
   METHODS: Interview and medical record data were organized into time windows beginning with death and ending 6 months earlier.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Days in hospital, prognosis, illness severity, function, symptoms, patients' preferences, and impacts on families.
   RESULTS: One-year survival was 59%, 39% had greater than or equal to 3 comerbidities, and 15 to 25% of the patients' last 6 months were in hospitals. Exacerbation etiologies included respiratory infection (47%) and cardiac problems (30%). Better quality of life predicted longer survival (ARR: 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87) as did heart failure etiology of exacerbation (ARR: 0.57; CI, 0.40, 0.82). Estimates of survival by physicians and by prognostic model were well calibrated, although patients with the worst prognoses survived longer than predicted. Patients' estimates of prognosis were poorly calibrated. One-quarter of patients had serious pain throughout, and two-thirds had serious dyspnea. Patients' illnesses had a major impact on more than 25% of families. Patients' preferences for Do-Not-Resuscitate orders increased from 40% at 3 to 6 months before death to 77% within 1 month of death; their decisions not to use mechanical ventilation increased from 12 to 31%, and their preferences for resuscitation decreased from 52 to 23%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced COPD often die within :1 year and have substantial comorbidities and symptoms. Adequate description anchors improved care.

TI  - Transient and partial mitochondrial inhibition for the treatment of postresuscitation injury: Getting it just right
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 8th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - Objective. Within minutes of reperfusing ischemic cardiomyocytes, oxidant stress dramatically increases and is associated with postresuscitation injury. Because mitochondria produce deleterious oxidants and useful metabolic substrates, utilization of electron transport chain inhibitors against reperfusion injury, though promising, must not overly compromise recovery of mitochondrial function. This study sought to further characterize the oxidant source at reperfusion and develop a strategy for therapeutic intervention by manipulation of dose, duration, and the degree of reversibility of mitochondrial inhibition.
   Design: Comparative laboratory investigation.
   Setting. Laboratory of a research university.
   Subjects. Embryonic chick cardiomyocytes.
   Interventions: Synchronously contracting chick cardiomyocytes were exposed to 1 hr of simulated ischemia and 3 hrs of reperfusion and were monitored for cell viability (propidium iodide) and oxidant generation (dichlorofluorescein). Inhibitors were administered either all course or for the first 15 mins of reperfusion.
   Measurements and Main Results. Application of diethyidithiocarbamic acid, 2-anthracene-carboxylic acid (rhein tech), and a.-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) demonstrated attenuation of the oxidant burst. In addition, diethyldithiocarbamic acid (1 mM), rhein tech (0.1 mu M), and alpha-NADH (20 mu M) significantly attenuated cell death from a control of 49.7% +/- 6.7% to 15.7% +/- 4.7% (n = 5, p <.01), 26.1% +/- 4.1% (n = 5, p <.01), and 13.8% +/- 1.3% (n = 5, p <.001), respectively. All doses of stigmatellin attenuated reactive oxygen species, but only a 2-20 nM dose during the first 15 mins of reperfusion abrogated cell death from 53.8% +/- 3.5% to 10.8% +/- 2.9% (n = 5, p <.001). Increased doses and durations of stigmatellin abolished reactive oxygen species but augmented injury. Although rotenone (5 mu M) attenuated reactive oxygen species, no dose or duration of exposure that ameliorated cell death was found.
   Conclusions: Early events of reperfusion are marked by rapid mitochondrial oxidant generation and postresuscitation injury. Electron transport chain blockade provides an effective method of attenuating reactive oxygen species. However, inhibitor administration should be both transient and reversible to necessitate cardioprotection and successful metabolic recovery.

TI  - Call for Action to Target Interhospital Variation in Cardiovascular Mortality, Readmissions, and Length-of-Stay
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
AB  - Background:Excessive interhospital variation threatens healthcare quality. Data on variation in patient outcomes across the whole cardiovascular spectrum are lacking. We aimed to examine interhospital variability for 28 cardiovascular All Patient Refined-Diagnosis-related Groups (APR-DRGs).Methods:We studied 103,299 cardiovascular admissions in 99 (98%) Belgian acute-care hospitals between 2012 and 2018. Using generalized linear mixed models, we estimated hospital-specific and APR-DRG-specific risk-standardized rates for in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmissions, and length-of-stay above the APR-DRG-specific 90th percentile. Interhospital variation was assessed based on estimated variance components and time trends between the 2012-2014 and 2016-2018 periods were examined.Results:There was strong evidence of interhospital variation, with statistically significant variation across the 3 outcomes for 5 APR-DRGs after accounting for patient and hospital factors: percutaneous cardiovascular procedures with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, angina pectoris, and arrhythmia. Medical diagnoses, with in particular hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, and cardiac arrest, showed strongest variability, with hypertension displaying the largest median odds ratio for mortality (2.51). Overall, hospitals performing at the upper-quartile level should achieve improvements to the median level, and an annual 633 deaths, 322 readmissions, and 1578 extended hospital stays could potentially be avoided.Conclusions:Analysis of interhospital variation highlights important outcome differences that are not explained by known patient or hospital characteristics. Targeting variation is therefore a promising strategy to improve cardiovascular care. Considering their treatment in multidisciplinary teams, policy makers, and managers should prioritize heart failure, hypertension, cardiac arrest, and angina pectoris improvements by targeting guideline implementation outside the cardiology department.

TI  - Advances in trauma care to save lives from traumatic injury: A narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - Recent advances on trauma management from the prehospital setting to in hospital care led to a better surviving severe trauma rate. Mortality from exsanguination remains the first preventable mortality. Damage-control resuscitation and surgery are evolving and thus some promising concepts are developing. Transfusion toolkit is brought on the prehospital scene while temporary bridge to hemostasis may be helpful. Panel transfusion products allow an individualized ratio assumed by fresh frozen or lyophilized plasma, fresh or cold-stored whole blood, fibrinogen, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates. Growing interest is raising in whole blood transfusion, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta use, hybrid emergency room, viscoelastic hemostatic assays to improve patient outcomes. Microcirculation, traumatic endotheliopathy, organ failures and secondary immunosuppression are point out since late deaths are increasing and may deserve specific treatment. As each trauma patient follows his own course over the following days after trauma, trauma management may be seen through successive, temporal, and individualized aims.

TI  - Oral high-dose sucrosomial iron vs intravenous iron in sideropenic anemia patients intolerant/refractory to iron sulfate: a multicentric randomized study
T2  - ANNALS OF HEMATOLOGY
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia is among the most frequent causes of disability. Intravenous iron is the quickest way to correct iron deficiency, bypassing the bottleneck of iron intestinal absorption, the only true mechanism of iron balance regulation in human body. Intravenous iron administration is suggested in patients who are refractory/intolerant to oral iron sulfate. However, the intravenous way of iron administration requires several precautions; as the in-hospital administration requires a resuscitation service, as imposed in Europe by the European Medicine Agency, it is very expensive and negatively affects patient's perceived quality of life. A new oral iron formulation, Sucrosomial iron, bypassing the normal way of absorption, seems to be cost-effective in correcting iron deficiency anemia at doses higher than those usually effective with other oral iron formulations. In this multicentric randomized study, we analyze the cost-effectiveness of intravenous sodium ferrigluconate vs oral Sucrosomial iron in patients with iron deficiency anemia refractory/intolerant to oral iron sulfate without other interfering factors on iron absorption.

TI  - Editor's Choice-Prospective registry of cardiac critical illness in a modern tertiary care Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Background: The changing landscape of care in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) has prompted efforts to redesign the structure and organization of advanced CICUs. Few studies have quantitatively characterized current demographics, diagnoses, and outcomes in the contemporary CICU. Methods: We evaluated patients in a prospective observational database, created to support quality improvement and clinical care redesign in an AHA Level 1 (advanced) CICU at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. All consecutive patients (N=2193) admitted from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 were included at the time of admission to the CICU. Results: The median age was 65 years (43% >70 years) and 44% of patients were women. Non-cardiovascular comorbidities were common, including chronic kidney disease (27%), pulmonary disease (22%), and active cancer (13%). Only 7% of CICU admissions were primarily for an acute coronary syndrome, which was the seventh most common individual diagnosis. The top three reasons for admission to the CICU were shock/hypotension (26%), cardiopulmonary arrest (11%), or primary arrhythmia without arrest (9%). Respiratory failure was a primary or major secondary reason for triage to the CICU in 17%. In-hospital mortality was 17.6%. Conclusions: In a tertiary, academic, advanced CICU, patients are elderly with a high burden of non-cardiovascular comorbid conditions. Care has shifted from ACS toward predominantly shock and cardiac arrest, as well as non-ischemic conditions, and the mortality of these conditions is high. These data may be useful to guide cardiac critical care redesign.

TI  - Neurologic Complications in Non-Neurological Intensive Care Units
T2  - NEUROLOGIST
AB  - Background: Neurologists are frequently called to evaluate patients in the intensive care units who are not waking up. This often poses a diagnostic and prognostic dilemma.
   Review Summary: The initial evaluation starts with abstracting the prehospital and in-hospital history, followed by bedside clinical and neurologic examination to establish a differential diagnosis. The subsequent work-up is based on clinical suspicion where reversible life-threatening causes should be immediately identified. After confirming the diagnosis and implementation of the appropriate medical management, a prompt family meeting and counseling is recommended. The role of neurologists in clinical diagnosis and prognostication of the coma patient, as well as diagnosing brain death is instrumental.
   Conclusions: In this review, we explore a practical systematic approach to patients with decreased level of consciousness. The most common causes of impaired alertness in different non-neurologic critical care units and commonly used prognostication tools are presented. Finally a brief introduction of hypothermia, a novel therapeutic approach is also discussed.

TI  - Home Health Care Utilization Trend, Predictors, and Association With Early Rehospitalization Following Endovascular Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
AB  - Background/purpose: Home healthcare (HHC) utilization is associated with higher rates of rehospitalization in patients with heart failure and transcatheter mitral valve repair. This study sought to assess the utilization, predictors, and the association of HHC with 30-clay readmission in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
   Methods/materials: We queried the Nationwide Readmission Database from January 2012 to December 2017 for TAVR discharges with and without HHC referral. Using multivariate analysis, we identified predictors of HHC utilization, and its association with outcomes.
   Results: Of 160,950 TAVR discharges, 21,724 (35.7%) had HHC referral. On multivariable analysis, female sex (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 129-1.40), non-elective admission (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.42-156), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13), prior stroke (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), anemia (OR, 1.16; 95% C1, 1.11-121), and in-hospital complications including card iogenic shock (OR, 137; 95% CI, 1.16-150), cardiac arrest (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.50), stroke (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.20-3.18), and new Permanent pacemaker (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.41-158) were identified as independent predictors of HHC referral. HHC utilization was associated with longer median length of stay (4 days vs. 2 days, P < 0.001), higher rate of 30-day all-cause (15.5% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.001) and heart failure (2.1% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) readmission rates compared to those without HHC.
   Conclusions: Our study identified a vulnerable group of TAVR patients that are at higher risk of 30-day readmission. Evidence-based interventions proven effective in reducing the burden of readmissions should be pursed in these patients to improve outcomes and quality of life. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Trends and predictors of in-hospital survival among asphyxiated neonates admitted at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, Northern Tanzania: Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - SAGE OPEN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: Globally about 9 million neonates are diagnosed with birth asphyxia yearly. In Tanzania 40.6% of all neonatal deaths are attributed to birth asphyxia. There is scarcity of evidence on predictors of in-hospital survival among asphyxiated neonates in Tanzania, therefore study aimed to determine trends and predictors of survival among neonates who sustained birth asphyxia at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, Northern Tanzania. Method and materials: This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study, conducted at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center among 7,783 admitted asphyxiated neonates from 2000 to 2022. The predictors of survival were determined by using the Weibull survival regression model and the statistically significant results were declared at a p-value of <.05. Data were managed and analyzed using Stata 18. Results: Overall finding from this study showed significant increase in the trends of survival from birth asphyxia from 2000 to 2022, from 68% to 80% respectively (p-value < .001). The median survival time was 4 days (95% CI:3.0-6.0). Overall survival rate was 195.32/1000 person-days-of observation (95% CI: 190.57, 200.18). Antenatal care (ANC) stages (AHR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.89), gestation age (AHR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.76-0.86), birth weight (AHR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.26), mode of delivery (AHR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.60-1.78), Aminophylline (AHR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.52-1.60), oxygen (AHR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.23-1.42), resuscitation (AHR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.24-1.42) and HIE(AHR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.79-1.91) were all independent significant predictors of survival. Conclusion: There is a need for health professionals to remain vigilant and promptly assess and stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation, initiate resuscitation, provide oxygen, administer medications such as aminophylline to neonates who are diagnosed with birth asphyxia.

TI  - Comprehensive Management of the Patient With Traumatic Cardiac Injury
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - Cardiac injuries are rare but potentially life-threatening, with a significant proportion of victims dying before arrival at the hospital. The in-hospital mortality among patients who arrive in-hospital alive also remains significantly high, despite major advancements in trauma care including the continuous updating of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program. Stab and gunshot wounds due to assault or self-inflicted injuries are the common causes of penetrating cardiac injuries, while motor vehicular accidents and fall from height are attributable causes of blunt cardiac injury. Rapid transport of victim to trauma care facility, prompt recognition of cardiac trauma by clinical evaluation and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, quick decision-making to perform emergency department thoracotomy, and/or shifting the patient expeditiously to the operating room for operative intervention with ongoing resuscitation are the key components for a successful outcome in cardiac injury victims with cardiac tamponade or exsanguinating hemorrhage. Blunt cardiac injury with arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, or cardiac failure may need continuous cardiac monitoring or anesthetic care for operative procedure of other associated injuries. This mandates a multidisciplinary approach working in concert with agreed local protocols and shared goals. An anesthesiologist has a pivotal role to play as a team leader or member in the trauma pathway of severely injured patients. They are not only involved in in-hospital care as a perioperative physician but also participate in the organizational aspects of prehospital trauma systems and training of prehospital care providers/paramedics. There is sparse literature available on the anesthetic management of cardiac injury (penetrating as well as blunt) patients. This narrative review discusses the comprehensive management of cardiac injury patients, focusing on the anesthetic concerns and is guided by our experience in managing cardiac injury cases at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. JPNATC is the only level 1 trauma center in north India, providing services to a population of approximately 30 million with around 9000 operations being performed annually.

TI  - Associations between Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Domains in Cardiac Arrest Survivors and Their Families One Month Post-Event
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) affects many critical care survivors and family members. Nevertheless, the relationship between PICS-relevant domains in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and psychological distress in their family members (henceforth, PICS-F) remains underexplored. Methods: We enrolled consecutive CA patients admitted between 16 August 2021 and 28 June 2023 to an academic medical center, along with their close family members, in prospective studies. Survivors' PICS domains were: physical dependence (Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, PSMS), cognitive impairments (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-M), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS) symptoms (PTSD Checklist-PCL 5), as well as PICS-F (PCL-5 Total Score). Hierarchical multivariate linear regressions examined associations between PICS-F and survivors' PICS domains. Results: Of 74 dyads (n = 148), survivors had a mean (SD) age of 56 +/- 16 years, with 61% being male and with a median hospital stay of 28 days. Family members (43% spouses) were slightly younger (52 +/- 14 years), predominantly female (72%), and of minority race/ethnicity (62%). A high prevalence of PICS assessed 28.5 days (interquartile range 10-63) post-CA was observed in survivors (78% physical dependence, 54% cognitive impairment, 30% PTSS) and in family members (30% PTSS). Survivor PTSS was significantly associated with family member distress (beta = 0.3, p = 0.02), independent of physical dependence (beta = 0.0, p = 0.9), cognitive impairment (beta = -0.1, p = 0.5), family member characteristics, and duration of hospitalization. Conclusions: Both CA survivors and their family members showed substantial evidence of likely PICS. Survivor PTSS is notably associated with family member distress, highlighting the need for dyadic interventions to enhance psychosocial outcomes.

TI  - The Burden of Pediatric Neurocritical Care in the United States
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disorders requiring pediatric neurocritical care (PNCC) affect thousands of children annually. We aimed to quantify the burden of PNCC through generation of national estimates of disease incidence, utilization of critical care interventions (CCI), and hospital outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of the Kids Inpatient Database over three years to evaluate pediatric traumatic brain injury, neuro-infection or inflammatory diseases, status epilepticus, stroke, hypoxic ischemic injury after cardiac arrest, and spinal cord injury. We evaluated use of CCI, death, length of stay, hospital charges, and poor functional outcome defined as receipt of tracheostomy or gastrostomy or discharge to a medical care facility.
   RESULTS: At least one CCI was recorded in 67,058 (23%) children with a primary neurological diagnosis, and considered a PNCC admission. Over half of PNCC admissions had at least one chronic condition, and 23% were treated in children's hospitals. Mechanical ventilation was the most common CCI, but utilization of CCIs varied significantly by diagnosis. Among PNCC admissions, 8110 (12%) children died during hospitalization and 14,067 (21%) children had poor functional outcomes. PNCC admissions cumulatively accounted for over 1.5 million hospital days and over $4 billion in hospital costs in the study years. Most PNCC admissions, across all diagnoses, had prolonged hospitalizations (more than one week) with an average cost of $39.9 thousand per admission.
   CONCLUSIONS: This large, nationally representative study shows PNCC diseases are a significant public health burden with substantial risk to children's health. More research is needed to improve outcomes in these vulnerable children. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Palliative care in the cardiovascular intensive care unit: A systematic review of current literature
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
AB  - Background: There has been an evolution in the disease severity and complexity of patients presenting to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). There are limited data evaluating the role of palliative care in contemporary CICU practice. Methods: PubMed Central, CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were evaluated for studies on palliative care in adults (>= 18 years) admitted with acute cardiovascular conditions - acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, advanced heart failure, post-cardiac surgery, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary embolism - admitted to the CICU, coronary care unit or cardiovascular intensive care unit from 1/1/2000 to 8/8/2022. The primary outcome of interest was the utilization of palliative care services. Secondary outcomes of included studies were also addressed. Meta- analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. Results: Of 5711 citations, 30 studies were included. All studies were published in the last seven years and 90 % originated in the United States. Twenty-seven studies (90 %) were retrospective analyses, with a majority from the National Inpatient Sample database. Heart failure was the most frequent diagnosis (47 %), and in-hospital mortality was reported in 67 % of studies. There was heterogeneity in the timing, frequency, and background of the care team that determined palliative care consultation. In two randomized trials, there appeared to be improvement in quality of life without an impact on mortality. Conclusions: Despite the growing recognition of the role of palliative care, there are limited data on palliative care consultation in the CICU.

TI  - Effects of Dementia on Adverse Outcomes in Geriatric Patients Undergoing Elective Total Hip Arthroplasty: Analysis of the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample
T2  - GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION
AB  - BackgroundTotal hip arthroplasty (THA) significantly improves the quality of life of patients with end-stage osteoarthritis. Dementia, which is prevalent in geriatric THA recipients, is correlated with several adverse outcomes. This study further investigated the impact of dementia on perioperative outcomes (complications, mortality, skilled nursing facilities [SNFs] transfer, total cost, and length of hospital stay [LOS]) in geriatric patients undergoing elective THA.MethodsThis study retrospectively analysed data from patients aged 65 years and older who underwent elective THA in the Nationwide inpatient sample (NIS) database from 2010 to 2019. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to reduce potential selection bias arising from differences in demographic and comorbidity factors. The Wilcoxon rank test (for continuous data) and Chi-square test (for categorical data) were used to assess demographic characteristics, comorbidities, LOS, total hospital costs, and in-hospital mortality; logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the influence of dementia on adverse outcomes.Results376 323 elective geriatric THA patient samples from the NIS database were included, with an overall dementia prevalence of 2.05%. Adverse outcomes following elective THA in patients with dementia included deep vein thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction, acute anaemia, cardiac arrest, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, pneumonia, respiratory failure, invasive mechanical ventilation, postoperative delirium, gastrointestinal bleeding, mechanical loosening, broken internal joint prosthesis, dislocation, other prosthesis-related complications, wound rupture/unhealed, transfusion, prolonged LOS, increased total cost, and discharge to SNFs.ConclusionIn elective geriatric THA patients, dementia is independently associated with significantly higher risks of perioperative complications and greater healthcare resource utilization, underscoring the need for enhanced perioperative monitoring and multidisciplinary care for this vulnerable group.

TI  - Resuscitation of neonates at 23 weeks' gestational age: a cost-effectiveness analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Resuscitation of infants at 23 weeks' gestation remains controversial; clinical practices vary. We sought to investigate the cost effectiveness of resuscitation of infants born 23 0/7-23 6/7 weeks' gestation.
   Design: Decision-analytic modeling comparing universal and selective resuscitation to non-resuscitation for 5176 live births at 23 weeks in a theoretic U.S. cohort. Estimates of death (77%) and disability (64-86%) were taken from the literature. Maternal and combined maternal-neonatal utilities were applied to discounted life expectancy to generate QALYs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, discounting costs and QALYs. Main outcomes included number of survivors, their outcome status and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the three strategies. A cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000/QALY was utilized.
   Results: Universal resuscitation would save 1059 infants: 138 severely disabled, 413 moderately impaired and 508 without significant sequelae. Selective resuscitation would save 717 infants: 93 severely disabled, 279 moderately impaired and 343 without significant sequelae. For mothers, non-resuscitation is less expensive ($19.9 million) and more effective (127 844 mQALYs) than universal resuscitation ($1.2 billion; 126 574 mQALYs) or selective resuscitation ($845 million; 125 966 mQALYs). For neonates, both universal and selective resuscitation were cost-effective, resulting in 22 256 and 15 134 nQALYS, respectively, versus 247 nQALYs for non-resuscitation. In sensitivity analyses, universal resuscitation was cost-effective from a maternal perspective only at utilities for neonatal death <0.42. When analyzed from a maternal-neonatal perspective, universal resuscitation was cost-effective when the probability of neonatal death was <0.95.
   Conclusions: Over wide ranges of probabilities for survival and disability, universal and selective resuscitation strategies were not cost-effective from a maternal perspective. Both strategies were cost-effective from a maternal-neonatal perspective. This study offers a metric for counseling and decision-making for extreme prematurity. Our results could support a more permissive response to parental requests for aggressive intervention at 23 weeks' gestation.

TI  - Prevalence of advance care planning practices among people with chronic diseases in hospital and community settings: a retrospective medical record audit
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background Advance Care Planning (ACP) enables healthcare professionals to embrace the important process where patients think about their values in life and goals for health care, and discuss their future health care preferences with family members for a time when they are not able to make health care decisions. Despite the promotion of ACP last two decades, and well-known benefits of ACP and a written Advance Care Directive (ACD), they are still underutilised in Australia and across the world. Previous studies have provided some insights, however, an uptake of ACP and prevalence of ACDs in community settings is rarely reported. Methods The aim of this study was to determine the uptake of ACP and prevalence of ACDs among people with chronic diseases in hospital and community settings. A retrospective medical record audit of eligible patients looking for evidence of ACP was conducted in 16 research sites in eight hospital and eight community care settings. Participants included those who were admitted to one of the research sites, and who were aged 18 years and over with at least one of nine nominated chronic diseases. The primary outcome measures included the number of patients with evidence of ACP through the following practices: completion of an ACD, appointment of an Enduring Guardian (EG), or completion of a resuscitation plan. Results The overall prevalence of ACD was 2.8% (n = 28) out of 1006 audited records, and only 10 (1%) of them were legally binding. The number of EGs appointed was 39 (3.9%) across the sites. A total of 151 (15.4%) resuscitation plans were found across the eight hospital sites. 95% (n = 144) of the resuscitation plans indicated 'Not-for-resuscitation'. Conclusions The uptake of ACP is very low. Current medical recording system reveals the challenges in ACP lie in the process of storage, access and execution of the ACDs. Given that having an ACD or Enduring Guardian in place is only useful if the treating physician knows how and where to access the information, it has implications for policy, information system, and healthcare professionals' education.

TI  - Case Discussions in Advanced Care Planning
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Advanced care planning (ACP) provides an opportunity for individuals to explore and document their values concerning medical care decisions prior to an acute event. This manuscript explores the value of ACP and compares and contrasts 2 ACP models currently in practice. Methods: This hypothetical case describes an elderly, frail patient with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who is also a high user of health care resources. A new palliative care-led outpatient ACP clinic model is described using this example. Results: Using the ACP clinic model in this case reveals how different a patient's end of life experience may be when proper, proactive planning measures are in place. With proper education and discussion around this patient and family's wishes pertaining to the end of his life, this man was able to change his plan of care from aggressive resuscitation treatment in hospital to a peaceful palliative experience at home. Conclusions: In this case description, the valuable role of ACP in preserving quality of life for patients, increasing satisfaction with care, and decreasing distress among family members during a medical event is demonstrated.

TI  - Outcomes after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the treatment of high-risk pulmonary embolism: a multicentre series of 52 cases
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Aims The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains ill defined in pulmonary embolism (PE). We investigated outcomes in patients with high-risk PE undergoing ECMO according to initial therapeutic strategy.
   Methods and results From 01 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, 180 patients from 13 Departments in nine centres with high-risk PE were retrospectively included. Among those undergoing ECMO, we compared characteristics and outcomes according to adjunctive treatment strategy (systemic thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or no reperfusion therapy). Primary outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. Secondary outcome was 90-day major bleeding. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were treated without ECMO; 52 (mean age 47.6 years) underwent ECMO. Overall 30-day mortality was 48.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 41-56] (87/180); 43% (95% CI 34-52) (55/128) in those treated without ECMO vs. 61.5% (95% CI 52-78) (32/52) in those with ECMO (P = 0.008). In patients undergoing ECMO, 30-day mortality was 76.5% (95% CI 57-97) (13/17) for ECMO+fibrinolysis, 29.4% (95% CI 51-89) (5/17) for ECMO+surgical embolectomy, and 77.7% (95% CI 59-97) (14/18) for ECMO alone (P = 0.004). Among patients with ECMO, 20 (38.5%, 95% CI 25-52) had a major bleeding event in-hospital; without significant difference across groups.
   Conclusion In patients with high-risk PE, those with ECMO have a more severe presentation and worse prognosis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with failed fibrinolysis and in those with no reperfusion seems to be associated with particularly unfavourable prognosis compared with ECMO performed in addition to surgical embolectomy. Our findings suggest that ECMO does not appear justified as a stand-alone treatment strategy in PE patients, but shows promise as a complement to surgical embolectomy.

TI  - Ziftomenib in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (KOMET-001): a multicentre, open-label, multi-cohort, phase 1 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background Ziftomenib (KO-539) is an oral selective menin inhibitor with known preclinical activity in menindependent acute myeloid leukaemia models. The primary objective of this study was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia based on safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary activity. Methods KOMET-001 is a multicentre, open-label, multi-cohort, phase 1/2 clinical trial of ziftomenib in adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. Results of the phase 1 study, conducted at 22 hospitals in France, Italy, Spain, and the USA, are presented here and comprise the dose-escalation (phase 1a) and dose-validation and expansion (phase 1b) phases. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less. For phase 1a, patients (all molecular subtypes) received ziftomenib (50-1000 mg) orally once daily in 28-day cycles. For phase 1b, patients with NPM1 mutations or with KMT2A rearrangements were randomly assigned (1:1) using third-party interactive response technology to two parallel dose cohorts (200 mg and 600 mg ziftomenib). Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose in phase 1a, and safety, remission rates, and pharmacokinetics supporting recommended phase 2 dose determination in phase 1b. Analyses were performed in all patients who received at least one dose of ziftomenib (modified intention-to-treat population). Phase 1a/1b is complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04067336, and the EU Clinical Trials register, EudraCT 2019-001545-41. Findings From Sept 12, 2019, to Aug 19, 2022, 83 patients received 50-1000 mg ziftomenib (39 [47%] were male and 44 [53%] were female). Median follow-up was 22<middle dot>3 months (IQR 15<middle dot>4-30<middle dot>2). Of 83 patients, the most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia (20 [24%]), febrile neutropenia (18 [22%]), pneumonia (16 [19%]), differentiation syndrome (12 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (11 [13%]), and sepsis (ten [12%]). Overall, 68 of 83 patients had serious adverse events, with two reported treatment-related deaths (one differentiation syndrome and one cardiac arrest). Differentiation syndrome rate and severity influenced the decision to halt enrolment of patients with KMT2A rearrangements. In Phase 1b, no responses were reported in patients treated at the 200 mg dose level. At the recommended phase 2 dose of 600 mg, nine (25%) of 36 patients with KMT2A rearrangement or NPM1 mutation had complete remission or complete remission with partial haematologic recovery. Seven (35%) of 20 patients with NPM1 mutation treated at the recommended phase 2 dose had a complete remission. Interpretation Ziftomenib showed promising clinical activity with manageable toxicity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. Phase 2 assessment of ziftomenib combination therapy in the upfront and relapsed or refractory setting is ongoing. Funding Kura Oncology. Copyright (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Lipopolysaccharide binding protein inhibitory peptide alters hepatic inflammatory response post-hemorrhagic shock
T2  - INNATE IMMUNITY
AB  - Translocation of microorganisms and endotoxin (LPS) across the gastrointestinal mucosa may exacerbate the inflammatory response and potentiate hepatic injury associated with hemorrhagic shock. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) augments LPS signaling through TLR4. In addition, evidence suggests that TLR4-mediated injury in liver ischemia/reperfusion occurs through the IRF-3/MyD88 independent pathway. We hypothesized that administration of LBP inhibiting peptide, LBPK95A, given at the time of resuscitation would reduce liver inflammation and injury in a murine model of hemorrhagic shock by limiting LPS-induced activation of the MyD88 independent pathway. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in male, C57BL/6 mice; a mean arterial blood pressure of 35 mmHg was maintained for 2.5 h. LBPK95A peptide or equal volume Lactated Ringer's solution was administered followed by fluid resuscitation. Mice were sacrificed at 2 and 6 h post-resuscitation. At 2 h, liver mRNA levels revealed a significant reduction in IFN-beta, a cytokine produced via the MyD88 independent pathway, with LBPK95A treatment. However, mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, a cytokine associated with the MyD88 dependent pathway, were unaffected by treatment. The LBP inhibitory peptide did selectively reduce activation of TLR4 signaling via the IRF-3/MyD88 independent pathway. These results suggest that LBP promotes cytokine production through the MyD88 independent pathway during hemorrhagic shock.

TI  - Shared decision-making, advance care planning for chronic kidney disease patients
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - Advance care planning (ACP) is a process by which clinicians together with patients and families reflect on and outline care goals to inform current and future care. ACP or shared decision-making is not only about key medical decisions, such as decision about continuing dialysis, or agreement for "not for resuscitation" order when in hospital. The importance of its role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is less known and not being well practiced in our country. When done well, it involves enhancement of final days, weeks, and months with positive decisions about family relationships, resolution of conflict, and living well until end of life, improved quality of life, decreased anxiety and depression among family members, reduced hospitalizations, increased uptake of hospice and palliative care services, and care that concurs with patient preferences. It lays out a set of relationships, values, and processes for approaching end-of-life decisions for the patient. It also includes attention to ethical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues relating to starting, continuing, withholding, and stopping dialysis. This workshop was done to sensitize ACP as a standard of care intervention in the management of CKD in our country.

TI  - Palliative Care for End-Stage Cirrhotic Patients in Intensive Care Units
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY
AB  - Background: The majority of patients suffering from end-stage liver disease (ESLD) experience a predictable decline in quality of life and physical function, as well as significant psychological distress. They are frequently hospitalized and are relatively less likely to be referred to palliative care. This study aims to elucidate whether patients with terminal disease receive appropriate management.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 236 patients with liver cirrhosis who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit between August 2013 and July 2015 in Taitung Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. The basic patients' information, laboratory results, prognosis, medical cost are collected. We further calculate the number of invasive medical procedure or life-sustaining therapy of end-stage patients before death.
   Results: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 35.2%. We subdivided patients into higher severity and lower severity groups. Several factors were not statistically different between the two categories, including sex, cirrhosis etiology, length of hospital stay, and hospital cost. In the higher severity group, 61.9% patients died during hospitalization. Among these patients, 68.9% DNR consent was given by a surrogate decision-maker within the 24 hours prior to death. Even among those with terminal disease status, many received life-support management in the pre-dying period.
   Conclusion: Many end-stage cirrhotic patients received inappropriate life-support intervention during hospitalization, even during the pre-dying period. Identification of markers that can reliably predict prognosis in patients with cirrhosis and early introduction of adequate palliative care prior to the terminal disease phase may help to improve physical and psychological outcomes.

TI  - Economic assessment of neonatal intensive care
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - Most of the studies on the costing of neonatal intensive care has concentrated on the costs associated with preterm infants which takes up more than half of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) costs. The focus has been on determining the cost-effectiveness of extreme preterm infants and those at threshold of viability. While the costs of care have an inverse relationship with gestational age (GA) and the lifetime medical costs of the extreme preterm can be as high as $450,000, the total NICU expenditure are skewed towards the care of moderate and late preterm infants who form the main bulk of patients. Neonatal intensive care, has been found to be very cost-effective at $1,000 per term infant per QALY and $9,100 for extreme preterm survivor per QALY. For low and LMIC, where NICU resources are limited, the costs of NICU care is lower largely due to a patient profile of more term and preterm of greater GAs and correspondingly less intensity of care. Public health measures, neonatal resuscitation training, empowerment of nurses to do resuscitation, increasing the accessibility to essential newborn care are recommended cheaper cost-effective measures to reduce neonatal mortality in countries with high neonatal mortality rate, whilst upgraded neonatal intensive care services are needed to further reduce neonatal mortality rate once below 15 per 1,000 livebirths. Economic evaluation of neonatal intensive care should also include post discharge costs which mainly fall on the health, social and educational sectors. Strategies to reduce neonatal intensive care costs could include more widespread implementation of cost-effective methods of improving neonatal outcome and reducing neonatal morbidities, including access to antenatal care, perinatal interventions to delay preterm delivery wherever feasible, improving maternal health status and practising cost saving and effective neonatal intensive care treatment.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary arrest induced by anaphylactoid reaction with contrast media
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Anaphylactoid reactions to iodinated contrast media can cause life-threatening events and even death. A 44-year-old woman presented with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) immediately following the administration of nonionic iodinated contrast media for an intravenous pyelography. Her cardiac rhythm during CPA was asystole, She was Successfully resuscitated by the radiologists supported by paged emergency physicians using the prompt intravenous administration of 1 mg of epinephrine. Neither laryngeal edema nor bronchial spasm was observed during the Course of treatment, and she was discharged on the 4th day without any complications. The patient did not have it history of allergy, but had experienced a myocardial infarction and aortitis. She had undergone 11 angiographies and had been taking a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Planned emergency medical backup is advisable to ensure resuscitation in the event of an anaphylactoid reaction to the use of contrast media in-hospital settings.

TI  - Pulmonary Embolism in a Young African American Male: A Diagnostic Challenge
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - This case report highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by pulmonary embolism (PE) in a young, otherwise healthy 33-year-old African American male with no apparent risk factors. The patient presented with penile pain, swelling, hematuria, flank pain, and rash, and was admitted for balanoposthitis and acute urinary retention. Despite prophylactic heparin, he suffered two cardiac arrests secondary to PE on the fifth day of hospitalization. Prompt thrombolytic therapy and heparin infusion were initiated, but his course was complicated by anuric acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis, shock liver, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Imaging revealed a substantial thrombus burden in the pulmonary arteries. Notably, a hypercoagulable workup was negative. The absence of typical risk factors, negative hypercoagulable workup, and occurrence of PE despite prophylaxis underscore the importance of vigilance in recognizing atypical presentations. This case emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion and comprehensive evaluation to diagnose PE in young patients without clear predisposing factors.

TI  - Ultrasound in Sepsis and Septic Shock-From Diagnosis to Treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis and septic shock are among the leading causes of in-hospital mortality worldwide, causing a considerable burden for healthcare. The early identification of sepsis as well as the individuation of the septic focus is pivotal, followed by the prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy, appropriate source control as well as adequate hemodynamic resuscitation. For years now, both emergency department (ED) doctors and intensivists have used ultrasound as an adjunctive tool for the correct diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Our aim was to better understand the state-of-the art role of ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature search about the topic and reported on the data from the most significant papers over the last 20 years. Results: We divided each article by topic and exposed the results accordingly, identifying four main aspects: sepsis diagnosis, source control and procedure, fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic optimization, and echocardiography in septic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: The use of ultrasound throughout the process of the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock provides the clinician with an adjunctive tool to better characterize patients and ensure early, aggressive, as well as individualized therapy, when needed. More data are needed to conclude that the use of ultrasound might improve survival in this subset of patients.

TI  - Determinants of decision-to-intervention time in the management and therapeutic outcome of emergency gynecological surgeries in south east Nigeria
T2  - THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Prompt and timely response in the management of gynecological surgical cases can significantly affect the therapeutic surgical outcome of patients in emergency situations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the decision-to-intervention time (DIT), its determinants, and the significance in the therapeutic outcome of emergency gynecological surgeries managed at a federal teaching hospital in south east Nigeria over an 18-month period.
   Methods: This was a prospective descriptive study of 105 emergency gynecological cases managed at a federal teaching hospital over an 18-month period. Patients were recruited at the point of admission and followed up until discharge for outcome. Data were abstracted with a data entry pro forma and then analyzed with the Epi Info (TM) statistical software version 7.0.
   Results: The incidence of gynecological surgical emergencies was 5.1% of the total gynecological cases managed during the study period. The mean DIT was 4.25 (range 1.45-5.50) hours with delay in intervention, mainly due to delays in securing blood/blood products and other materials for resuscitation (46.7%) and a lack of finance (15.2%). Six maternal deaths were recorded, giving a case fatality ratio of 5.7%, while the commonest maternal complications associated with the delays were hemorrhage (61.9%) and the need for blood transfusion (57.1%), respectively. The risk ratio of losing >= 1,000 mL of blood, anemia, hemorrhagic shock, and wound infection in those with DIT >= 120 minutes was statistically greater and significant at 95% confidence interval.
   Conclusion: Inadequacies in health care services and policies due to poor infrastructure, organizational framework, and financing were the major determinants of the prolonged DIT and therapeutic outcomes.

TI  - Sound reduction management in the neonatal intensive care unit for preterm or very low birth weight infants
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.
   Objectives
   Primary objective
   To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates.
   Secondary objectives
   1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity).
   2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age.
   3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance.
   4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2View (TM)), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014.
   Selection criteria
   Preterm infants (<32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or <1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit.
   Data collection and analysis
   We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.
   Main results
   One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of <48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been >48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n = 12).
   Authors' conclusions
   To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.

TI  - Report of the National Consensus Conference on Family Presence during Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Procedures
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Representatives from 18 national organizations were convened for a conference to develop recommendations regarding family presence (FP) during pediatric procedures and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Before the conference, invitees were given a questionnaire and provided with current literature regarding FP. A modified Delphi process was used to develop consensus, including use of multiple questionnaires and breakouts for discussion of specific issues. Participants were encouraged to develop consensus recommendations based on the literature and discussions. Changes in attitude were tracked with repeat questionnaires. Results of the conference were circulated to participants for review and revision. Consensus recommendations include (I) consider FP as an option for families during pediatric procedures and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, (2) offer FP as an option after assessing factors that could adversely affect the interaction, (3) if family is not offered the option for FP, document the reasons why, (4) always consider the safety of the health care team, (5) develop in-hospital transport and transfer policies and procedures for FP, such as family member definition, preparation of the family, handling disagreements, and providing support for the staff, (6) obtain legal review of policies, (7) include education in FP in all core curricula and orientation for health care providers, (8) promote research into best methods for education; effects of FP on patients, family, and staff; best practices for FP; and legal issues regarding FP, among others. These recommendations were approved in concept by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Ambulatory Pediatrics Association.

TI  - Failure to rescue-rapid response systems: A making healthcare safer rapid review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background Rapid response systems (RRSs) were developed to respond to early warnings of unexpected deterioration, but their effectiveness may be limited by factors impacting RRS activation (afferent limb) or response (efferent limb). Despite decades of RRS implementation, patients still experience unrecognized deterioration with associated worse outcomes.Methods This rapid review used modified search strategies to focus on the most valuable studies performed in the United States. Citations were screened by one reviewer with artificial intelligence as a second reviewer at the title/abstract review stage. The full text of eligible articles was then reviewed by a single team member to confirm eligibility. One reviewer completed the data abstraction, and a second reviewer checked the first reviewer's abstraction.Results Three categories of interventions were identified: implementation of a new RRS, and modifications to the afferent limb and/or efferent limb of an existing RRS. RRSs may have a large impact in reducing in-hospital mortality and an even greater impact in reducing cardiorespiratory arrest on hospital general wards in adults but the effect is unclear in children. Their impact on unanticipated intensive care unit admission is unclear. Modifications to the afferent and/or efferent limb were associated with a reduction in mortality and the incidence of cardiorespiratory arrest for adults.Conclusions RRS may have a large beneficial effect on hospital mortality and in-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, but the strength of the evidence is low due to methodological weaknesses of the studies. Innovations in afferent and efferent limb structures show promise for increased benefit.

TI  - Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
T2  - BMJ MEDICINE
AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7-8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management. Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 h of presentation for patients admitted to hospital, although optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high risk lesions and use of subsequent high dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal haemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Oesophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Recurrent bleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support in mitral papillary muscle rupture: Outcome of multicenter study
T2  - ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB  - Background: Post-acute myocardial infarction papillary muscle rupture (post-AMI PMR) may present variable clinical scenarios and degree of emergency due to result of cardiogenic shock. Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (V-A ECLS) has been proposed to improve extremely poor pre- or postoperative conditions. Information in this respect is scarce.Methods: From the CAUTION (meChanical complicAtion of acUte myocardial infarcTion: an InternatiOnal multiceNter cohort study) database (16 different Centers, data from 2001 to 2018), we extracted adult patients who were surgically treated for post-AMI PMR and underwent pre- or/and postoperative V-A ECLS support. The end-points of this study were in-hospital survival and ECLS complications.Results: From a total of 214 post-AMI PMR patients submitted to surgery, V-A ECLS was instituted in 23 (11%) patients. The median age was 61.7 years (range 46-81 years). Preoperatively, ECLS was commenced in 10 patients (43.5%), whereas intra/postoperative in the remaining 13. The most common V-A ECLS indication was post-cardiotomy shock, followed by preoperative cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. The median duration of V-A ECLS was 4 days. V-A ECLS complications occurred in more than half of the patients. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 39.2% (9/23), compared to 22% (42/219) for the non-ECLS group.Conclusions: In post-AMI PMR patients, V-A ECLS was used in almost 10% of the patients either to promote bridge to surgery or as postoperative support. Further investigations are required to better evaluate a potential for increased use and its effects of V-A ECLS in such a context based on the still high perioperative mortality.

TI  - Sound reduction management in the neonatal intensive care unit for preterm or very low birth weight infants
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.
   Objectives
   Primary objective
   To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates.
   Secondary objectives
   1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity).
   2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age.
   3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance.
   4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov ; controlled-trials.com ; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2View (TM)), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014.
   Selection criteria
   Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit.
   Data collection and analysis
   We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.
   Main results
   One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (M D) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12).

TI  - The role of the electroencephalogram and evoked potentials after cardiac arrest
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of reviewIn comatose cardiac arrest survivors, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most widely used test to assess the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) and guide antiseizure treatment. However, a wide variety of EEG patterns are described in literature. Moreover, the value of postarrest seizure treatment is uncertain. Absent N20 waves of short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) are a specific predictor of irreversible HIBI. However, the prognostic significance of the N20 amplitude is less known.Recent findingsThe increasing adoption of standardized EEG pattern classification identified suppression and burst-suppression as 'highly-malignant' EEG patterns, accurately predicting irreversible HIBI. Conversely, continuous normal-voltage EEG is a reliable predictor of recovery from postarrest coma. A recent trial on EEG-guided antiseizure treatment in HIBI was neutral but suggested potential benefits in specific subgroups. A prognostic approach based on the amplitude rather than on the presence/absence of the N20 SSEP wave recently showed greater sensitivity for poor outcome prediction and added potential for predicting recovery.Standardized EEG terminology and quantitative approach to SSEP are promising for improving the neuroprognostic accuracy of these tests. Further research is needed to identify the potential benefits of antiseizure treatment after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Norepinephrine Infusion in the Emergency Department in Septic Shock Patients: A Retrospective 2-Years Safety Report and Outcome Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Hemodynamic optimization during sepsis and septic shock is based on a prompt and large fluid resuscitation strategy associated with early administration of norepinephrine. In our hospital, norepinephrine is administered in the emergency department (ED), within a protocol-guided management context, to reduce norepinephrine infusion timing due to central line insertion. This choice, however, can be associated with side effects. Objectives: We conducted a retrospective analysis regarding the safety of norepinephrine in the ED. We also appraised the association between in-hospital mortality and predefined ED variables and patients' admission severity scores. Design, settings, and participants: This was a retrospective analysis of electronic sheets of the ED of a tertiary hospital in the North of Italy. Outcomes measure and analysis: Electronic documentation was assessed to identify local and systemic side effects. We considered two subgroups of patients according to the in-hospital clinical paths: (1) those admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU); and (2) those who received a ceiling of care decision. We collected and considered variables related to septic shock treatment in the ED and analyzed their association with in-hospital mortality. Main Results: We considered a two-year period, including 108,033 ED accesses, and ultimately analyzed data from 127 patients. Side effects related to the use of this drug were reported in five (3.9%) patients. Thirty patients (23.6%) were transferred to the ICU from the ED, of whom six (20.0%) died. Twenty-eight patients (22.0%) received a ceiling of care indication, of whom 21 (75.0%) died. Of the 69 (54.3%) finally discharged to either medical or surgical wards, 21 (30.4%) died. ICU admission was the only variable significantly associated to in-hospital mortality in the multivariable analysis [OR (95% CI) = 4.48 (1.52-13.22); p-value = 0.007]. Conclusions: Norepinephrine peripheral infusion in the ED was associated with a low incidence of adverse events requiring discontinuation (3.9%). It could be considered safe within <12 h when a specific line management protocol and pump infusion protocol are adopted. None of the variables related to septic shock management affected in-hospital mortality, except for the patient's ICU admission.

T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Early goal-directed hemodynamic stabilization can contribute to reduced mortality in septic shock. After the much-quoted study by Rivers published in 2001, three large, randomized trials (ProCESS, ARISE, ProMISe) published in 2014 and 2015 have now questioned the early goal-directed therapy in the emergency room that Rivers et al. had postulated. In the present review article, these three studies on the treatment of sepsis in the emergency room are presented. The implications for clinical practice that can be derived from these are discussed.

TI  - Direct Peritoneal Resuscitation Reduces Lung Injury and Caspase 8 Activity in Brain Death*
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
AB  - Background: Acute brain death (ABD) is associated with inflammation and lung injury. Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) improves blood flow to the vital organs after ABD. DPR reduces lung injury, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to five groups (n = 8/group): (1) Sham (no ABD); (2) Targeted intravenous fluid (TIVF) (ABD plus enough IVF to maintain a MAP of 80 mmHg) at 2 hours post-resuscitation (RES); (3) ABD + TIVF + DPR (TIVF and 30 cc intraperitoneal 2.5% Delflex) at 2 hours post-RES; (4) ABD + TIVF at 4 hours post-RES; and (5) ABD + TIVF + DPR at 4 hours post-RES. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured using Qiagen qRT PCR. Protein levels were assessed using quantitative ELISAs and the Luminex MagPix system. Results: Use of DPR caused 5.8-fold downregulation of mRNA expression for TNF-alpha and 2.7-fold decrease for the TNF receptor compared to TIVF alone. Caspase 8 mRNA was also downregulated. Protein levels for TNF-alpha, TNF receptor, caspase 8, NF kappa B, and NF kappa B inhibitor kinase, which promotes dissociation of NF kappa B inhibitor, were reduced by DPR. Cell death markers M30 and M65 were also decreased with DPR. Conclusions: Use of DPR caused changes in the expression of multiple mRNAs and proteins in the caspase 8 apoptotic pathway. These data represent a mechanism through which DPR exerts its beneficial effects within the lung tissue.

TI  - Limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation prevents excess mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and attenuates myocardial injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background: intracellular Na+ accumulation during ischemia and reperfusion leads to cytosolic Ca2+ overload through reverse-mode operation of the sarcolemmal Na+: Ca2+ exchanger. Cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation promotes mitochondrial Ca2+ (Ca2+ overload. leading to mitochondrial injury. We investigated whether limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) attenuates Ca-m(2+) overload and lessens myocardial dysfunction in a rat model of VF and closed-best resuscitation. Methods: hearts were harvested from 10 groups of 5 rats each representing baseline, 15 min of untreated VF, 15 min of VF with chest compression given for the last 5 min (VF/CC), and 60 min postresuscitation (PR). VF/CC and PR included four groups each randomized to receive before starting chest compression the new NHE-1 inhibitor AVE4454B (1.0 mg/kg), the Na+ channel blocker aidocaine (5.0 mg/kg), their combination, or vehicle control. The left ventricle was processed for intracellular Na+ and Ca2+, measurements. Results: limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry attenuated cytosolic Na+ increase during VF/CC and the PR phase and prevented Ca-m(2+) overload yielding levels that corresponded to 77% and 71% of control hearts at VF/CC and PR, without differences among specific Na+-limiting interventions. Limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry attenuated reductions in left ventricular compliance during VF and prompted higher mean aortic pressure (110 +/- 7 vs. 95 11 mmHg, P < 0.001) and higher cardiac work index (159 +/- 34 vs. 126 (-1) +/- 29 g center dot m center dot min(-1)center dot kg(-1), P < 0.05) with lesser increases in circulating,cardiac troponin I at 60 min PR. Conclusions: Na+-limiting interventions prevented excess Ca-m(2+) accumulation induced by ischemia and reperfusion and ameliorated myocardial injury and dysfunction.

TI  - Safety or speed? Assessing alternative vascular access for angiography after resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) in severe pelvic trauma patients
T2  - TRAUMA SURGERY & ACUTE CARE OPEN
AB  - Introduction Pelvic fractures often result in life-threatening bleeding and hemodynamic instability. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has emerged as a promising strategy for patients with severe pelvic fractures, facilitating subsequent hemostatic interventions. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is a well-established procedure for managing pelvic fractures accompanied by hemorrhage. Ideally, an angiographic access point distinct from the initial REBOA placement is sought to maintain REBOA deflation without complete removal, thereby preventing hemodynamic instability during the procedure. However, in cases of extreme and severe pelvic trauma, gaining access for REBOA is already challenging, not to mention the additional difficulty posed by subsequent angiographic access. This study aims to assess the challenges associated with gaining access in cases where successful TAE was ultimately performed, particularly in the context of severe pelvic trauma. We investigate the complexities surrounding access management and its implications for patient outcomes.

We collected demographic data, injury characteristics, details of the REBOA and TAE procedures, information on complications, and data on patient survival. The primary endpoints of our analysis included overall survival and the success of TAE (defined as post TAE mean arterial pressure (MAP) >= 65 mm Hg). Secondary endpoints encompassed the duration details of two interventions.

The primary endpoints of our analysis included overall survival and the success of TAE (defined as post TAE mean arterial pressure (MAP) >= 65 mm Hg). Secondary endpoints encompassed the duration details of two interventions. Results Between 2017 and 2023, a total of 17 patients were included in this study. Among this cohort, 12 (70.6%) were male, with a median age of 51 years. Overall survival was 23.5%. Patients were grouped into angiography after REBOA deflation (AAD) or angiography after REBOA removal (AAR). AAR group was younger (39.0 vs 63.0, p=0.030) and had higher Shock Index at triage (2.30 vs 1.10, p=0.015). More patient whose post TAE MAP >=65 mm Hg was found in the AAR group, although no significant difference on overall survival (25.0% vs 22.2%, p=1.000). Angiographic cannulation times, pre-angiographic MAP, and amount of pre-angiographic transfusion of packed red blood cell were similar across groups. Conclusion Our findings provide empirical insights into vascular access selection and suggest that AAR in the management of severe pelvic fractures can be beneficial, particularly when pre-angiographic resuscitation is sufficient. Larger studies are required to validate these observations and assess long-term outcomes. Level of evidence III.

TI  - Targeted Applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Drones) in Telemedicine
T2  - TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH
AB  - Introduction:Advances in technology have revolutionized the medical field and changed the way healthcare is delivered. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the next wave of technological advancements that have the potential to make a huge splash in clinical medicine. UAVs, originally developed for military use, are making their way into the public and private sector. Because they can be flown autonomously and can reach almost any geographical location, the significance of UAVs are becoming increasingly apparent in the medical field.Materials and Methods:We conducted a comprehensive review of the English language literature via the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using search terms unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, and drone. Preference was given to clinical trials and review articles that addressed the keywords and clinical medicine.Results:Potential applications of UAVs in medicine are broad. Based on articles identified, we grouped UAV application in medicine into three categories: (1) Prehospital Emergency Care; (2) Expediting Laboratory Diagnostic Testing; and (3) Surveillance. Currently, UAVs have been shown to deliver vaccines, automated external defibrillators, and hematological products. In addition, they are also being studied in the identification of mosquito habitats as well as drowning victims at beaches as a public health surveillance modality.Conclusions:These preliminary studies shine light on the possibility that UAVs may help to increase access to healthcare for patients who may be otherwise restricted from proper care due to cost, distance, or infrastructure. As with any emerging technology and due to the highly regulated healthcare environment, the safety and effectiveness of this technology need to be thoroughly discussed. Despite the many questions that need to be answered, the application of drones in medicine appears to be promising and can both increase the quality and accessibility of healthcare.

TI  - Current status of emergency medical service use in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in China: Findings from China Acute Myocardial Infarction (CAMI) Registry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The mortality rate of myocardial infarction in China has increased dramatically in the past three decades. Although emergency medical service (EMS) played a pivotal role for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the corresponding data in China are limited. Methods: An observational analysis was performed in 26,305 STEMI patients, who were documented in China acute myocardial infarction (CAMI) Registry and treated in 162 hospitals from January 1st, 2013 to January 31th, 2016. We compared the differences such as demographic factors, social factors, medical history, risk factors, socioeconomic distribution and treatment strategies between EMS transport group and self-transport group. Results: Only 4336 patients (16.5%) were transported by EMS. Patients with symptom onset outside, out-of hospital cardiac arrest and presented to province-level hospital were more likely to use EMS. Besides those factors, low systolic blood pressure, severe dyspnea or syncope, and high Killip class were also positively related to EMS activation. Notably, compared to self-transport, use of EMS was associated with a shorter prehospital delay (median, 180 vs. 245 min, P < 0.0001) but similar door-to-needle time (median, 45 min vs. 52 min, P = 0.1400) and door-to-balloon time (median, 105 min vs. 103 min, P = 0.1834). Conclusions: EMS care for STEMI is greatly underused in China. EMS transport is associated with shorter onset-to-door time and higher rate of reperfusion, but not substantial reduction in treatment delays or mortality rate. Targeted efforts are needed to promote EMS use when chest pain occurs and to set up a unique regionalized STEMI network focusing on integration of prehospital care procedures in China.

TI  - How Taiwan has responded to COVID-19 and how COVID-19 has affected Taiwan, 2020-2022
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - From January 2020 to December 2022, there was a total of 8,872,955 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. In addition, a total of 15,253 COVID-19 related deaths were re-ported. During these three years, the government and health authority did many efforts to response this pandemic. In the early pandemic, Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center was established in the early 2020 to organize associated resource, develop effective policy and implement strict intervention. In response to COVID-19 pandemic, many infection control policy and interventions, including universal mask wearing with increasing production of face mask, hand hygiene, border control, introduce of digital technology incorporating big data, quarantine of COVID-19 cases, travel and gathering restriction, were implemented. In the meanwhile, two COVID-19 vaccines, namely MVC-COV1901 and UB-612, have been developed under the support of government. Furthermore, MVC-COV1901 was taken into clinical practice after received emergency use approval. In addition, two traditional Chinese medicines, including NRICM101 and NRICM102 showed their promising effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and were recommended as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19. During the pandemic, the nonpharmacologic intervention help reduce many infectious diseases, especially for airborne/droplet-transmitted diseases. However, COVID-19 exhibited some adverse impacts on the healthcare systems, such as emergency medical service on out of hospital cardiac arrest, cancer screening, HIV screening and prevention services, and public health, namely the psychosocial status of healthcare workers. Although the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections may gradually subsided, we should keep monitoring its associated impact and appropriately response to this pandemic.

TI  - Supplemental Intraoperative Oxygen Does Not Promote Acute Kidney Injury or Cardiovascular Complications After Noncardiac Surgery: Subanalysis of an Alternating Intervention Trial
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative hyperoxia has been recommended by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of surgical site infections. Based on animal studies and physiological concerns, the kidneys and heart may be at risk from hyperoxia. We therefore conducted 2 unplanned subanalyses of a previous alternating cohort trial in which patients having colorectal surgery were assigned to either 30% or 80% inspired intraoperative oxygen. Specifically, we tested 2 coprimary hypotheses: (1) hyperoxia increases the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) within 7 postoperative days (PODs); and (2) hyperoxia worsens a composite of myocardial injury, in-hospital cardiac arrest, and 30-day mortality.
   METHODS: The underlying controlled trial included 5749 colorectal surgeries in 4481 patients, with the exposure alternating between 30% and 80% fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) during general anesthesia at 2-week intervals over a period of 39 months. AKI was defined as a 1.5-fold increase in creatinine from the preoperative level to the highest value measured during the initial 7 PODs. Myocardial injury was defined by fourth-generation troponin-T level >0.03 ng/mL. We assessed the effect of 80% vs 30% oxygen on the outcomes using generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic models that adjusted for the possible within-patient correlation across multiple potential operations for a patient on different visits.
   RESULTS: For the AKI outcome, 2522 surgeries were allocated to 80% oxygen and 2552 to 30% oxygen. Hyperoxia had no effect on the primary outcome of postoperative AKI, with an incidence of 7.7% in the 80% oxygen group and 7.7% in the 30% oxygen group (relative risk = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.2; P=.95). One thousand six hundred forty-seven surgeries (all with scheduled troponin monitoring) were analyzed for the composite cardiovascular outcome. Hyperoxia had no effect on the collapsed composite of myocardial injury, cardiac arrest, and 30-day mortality, nor on any of its components (estimated relative risk = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.44-1.16; P=.17).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that intraoperative hyperoxia causes AKI or cardiovascular complications in adults undergoing colorectal surgery. Consequently, we suggest that clinicians select intraoperative inspired oxygen fraction based on other considerations.

TI  - Race and Sex Disparities in Lower Extremity Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Database Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is successful in improving health-related quality of life. However, outcomes vary in the literature due to modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Modifiable factors consist of body mass index (BMI), nutrition, and tobacco use. Non-modifiable risk factors include age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Prior literature has focused on racial disparities in terms of the utilization of lower extremity arthroplasty. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of race and sex on the in-hospital complication rate, length of stay, and charges associated with primary TJA.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort utilized complex survey data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2016 and 2019. The use of the International Classification of Disease-10 Procedure Codes (ICD-10 PCS) for right hip, left hip, right knee, and left knee TJA yielded a preliminary total of 2,660,280 patients. The exclusion criteria were bilateral arthroplasty and concomitant unilateral hip and knee arthritis. Major complications were defined as acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, shock, and septicemia. Odds ratio (OR) and beta coefficients were adjusted for age, sex, primary payer, hospital region, hospital teaching status, and year. Total charges were adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index data reported by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Results: A total of 2,589,510 patients met our inclusion criteria; 87.6%, 5.9%, 4.8%, 1.4%, and 0.3% of people were 'White', 'Black', 'Hispanic', 'Asian, or Pacific Islander', and 'Native American', as defined by the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) Variable 'RACE'. Black individuals experienced a significantly greater major complication rate compared to White individuals (0.87% vs. 0.74%, OR 1.25, p-value = 0.0004). Black and Hispanic individuals experienced a significantly greater minor complication rate compared to White individuals (6.39% vs. 4.12%, odds ratio (OR) 1.61, p-value < 0.0001; 4.68% vs. 4.12%, OR 1.17, p-value < 0.0001). Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Native American individuals stayed, on average, 0.33, 0.19, 0.19, and 0.25 days longer than White individuals (2.78, 2.54, 2.55, 2.56 vs. 2.37 days, p<0.0001). None of these statistically significant differences exceeded the established minimal clinically important difference of two days. Black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander patients were charged $5,751, $18,656, and $12,119 more than White patients ($72,122, $85,027, $78,490, and $59,297 vs. $66,371, p <= 0.0165). Native American patients were charged $7,074 less than White patients ($59,297 vs. $66,371, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Black and Hispanic TJA patients may have higher complication rates than White TJA patients. The differences in length of stay between race groups may not affect outcomes. Hispanic patients received significantly more charges than White patients, and Native American patients received significantly fewer charges than White patients after controlling for non-modifiable risk factors. Addressing the charge disparities may reduce the total national cost burden associated with TJA. The present study highlights the need for further studies on healthcare outcomes related to race and sex.

TI  - Ibrutinib plus venetoclax in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (SYMPATICO): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background The combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax leverages complementary mechanisms of action and has shown promising clinical activity in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib-venetoclax compared with ibrutinib-placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. Methods SYMPATICO is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study performed at 84 hospitals in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients were adults (aged >= 18 years) with pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory MCL after one to five previous lines of therapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral ibrutinib 560 mg once daily concurrently with oral venetoclax (5-week ramp-up to 400 mg once daily) or placebo for 2 years, then single-agent ibrutinib 560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation and treatment assignment occurred via interactive response technology using a stratified permuted block scheme (block sizes of 2 and 4) with stratification by ECOG performance status, previous lines of therapy, and tumour lysis syndrome risk category. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03112174, and is closed to enrolment. Findings Between April 26, 2018, and Aug 28, 2019, 267 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned; 134 to the ibrutinib-venetoclax group and 133 to the ibrutinib-placebo group. 211 (79%) of 267 patients were male and 56 (21%) were female. With a median follow-up of 51<middle dot>2 months (IQR 48<middle dot>2-55<middle dot>3), median progression-free survival was 31<middle dot>9 months (95% CI 22<middle dot>8-47<middle dot>0) in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group and 22<middle dot>1 months (16<middle dot>5-29<middle dot>5) in the ibrutinib- placebo group (hazard ratio 0<middle dot>65 [95% CI 0<middle dot>47-0<middle dot>88]; p=0<middle dot>0052). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (42 [31%] of 134 patients in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group vs 14 [11%] of 132 patients in the ibrutinib- placebo group), thrombocytopenia (17 [13%] vs ten [8%]), and pneumonia (16 [12%] vs 14 [11%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 81 (60%) of 134 patients in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group and in 79 (60%) of 132 patients in the ibrutinib-placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (2%) of 134 patients in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group (n=1 COVID-19 infection, n=1 cardiac arrest, and n=1 respiratory failure) and in two (2%) of 132 patients in the ibrutinib-placebo group (n=1 cardiac failure and n=1 COVID-19-related pneumonia). Interpretation The combination of ibrutinib-venetoclax significantly improved progression-free survival compared with ibrutinib-placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. The safety profile was consistent with known safety profiles of the individual drugs. These findings suggest a positive benefit-risk profile for ibrutinib-venetoclax treatment.

TI  - Treatment of Seizures and Postanoxic Status Epilepticus
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Seizures are a common occurrence following cardiac arrest and may occur both during targeted temperature management and after rewarming. Postanoxic seizures may be nonconvulsive and very difficult to diagnose without electroencephalography (EEG) or associated with prominent myoclonus. Importantly, to date no randomized controlled trials are available to guide the management of seizures in patients with cardiac arrest. Seizure prophylaxis is not recommended, and when seizures are diagnosed they are typically treated the same as seizures in other patients with acute brain injury. Electroencephalographic abnormalities that are highly epileptiform, but do not fulfill classic seizure criteria, also known as the ictal interictal continuum, occur frequently and there is no consensus on how to treat these. Several EEG patterns have been associated with poor outcome in retrospective studies. Increasing evidence has emerged that patients may have a favorable outcome, even with status myoclonus and malignant EEG patterns, if aggressive management is pursued.

TI  - Clinical outcomes following shock team implementation for cardiogenic shock: a systematic review
T2  - EGYPTIAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - BackgroundCardiogenic shock is a critical cardiac condition characterized by low cardiac output leading to end-organ hypoperfusion and associated with high in-hospital mortality rates. It can manifest following acute myocardial infarction or acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Despite advancements, mortality rates remain elevated, prompting interest in multidisciplinary approaches to improve outcomes. This manuscript presents a review focused on the concept of a cardiogenic shock team and its potential impact on patient management and outcomes.MethodsA comprehensive search was performed on March 19, 2023, covering PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. We included primary studies (prospective and retrospective) only and evaluated their quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Scale. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023440354).ResultsSix relevant studies with 2066 cardiogenic shock patients were included, of which 1071 were managed by shock teams and 995 received standard care. Findings from the reviewed studies indicated the favorable outcomes associated with implementing cardiogenic shock teams. Patients managed by these teams exhibited higher 30-day and in-hospital survival rates compared to those without team intervention. The implementation of cardiogenic shock teams was linked to reduced in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality rates. Additionally, shock team involvement was associated with shorter door-to-balloon times.ConclusionThe findings suggest that cardiogenic shock teams play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes through earlier detection and timely interventions. Despite challenges in team implementation, their potential to reduce mortality and improve efficiency in patient care warrants further research and greater integration of multidisciplinary strategies into clinical practice.

TI  - Outcomes Before and After the Recall of a Heart Failure Pacemaker
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Question Do the medical device industry and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provide timely information about product defects so that patients and their physicians can make fully informed decisions regarding management? Findings In this case series, the outcomes of 90 patients before and after the recall of a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker in November 2015 were examined along with review of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and showed that the manufacturer and the FDA were aware of battery and wire connection defects for more than 1 year before patients began to develop serious adverse clinical events because of abrupt loss of pacing. The information included in the recall notification was incomplete, and the FDA underestimated the criticality of the pacemaker's defects. Meaning The medical device industry and the FDA should focus on early recognition of device defects and fully and promptly disclose vital information to patients and their caregivers.
   Importance Timely and complete disclosure of medical device defects is necessary to manage patient care safely and effectively. Objectives To determine if the manufacturer's recommendations following the recall of a medical device were timely and complete, the follow-up information and data provided to patients and physicians were adequate for managing patient care, and the actions taken by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the recall were appropriate. Design, Setting, and Participants This single-center retrospective case series included 90 of 448 patients who were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker at the Minneapolis Heart Institute from May 2003 through January 2011; this pacemaker was recalled in November 2015. In addition, returned product reports submitted by the manufacturer to the FDA via the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2008 through December 2018 were analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical outcomes were serious adverse clinical events that occurred before and after the November 2015 recall notifying physicians and patients that the device's battery could fail unexpectedly because of high internal impedance. Technical outcomes were signs and causes of failure. Results Five of 90 patients observed during 2015 experienced syncope when their pacemakers stopped pacing owing to battery or wire connection defects prior to the recall. Of the 90 patients, 37 (41%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age at implantation was 71.3 (66.1-78.2) years. Analysis of the MAUDE data revealed that battery failures prior to the recall were associated with serious adverse events that included 1 death, 1 cardiac arrest, 5 syncopal attacks, and 6 heart failure exacerbations; 3 additional prerecall syncopal events were caused by wire connection defects. The manufacturer and the FDA were aware of the battery and wire connection defects for 19 months before issuing the recall, yet the wire connection problem was not included in the advisory and physicians were not informed that interrogating the pacemaker could result in loss of pacing. The FDA classified the recall as class II rather than the more critical class I. Conclusions and Relevance This case series study of patients implanted with a defective pacemaker found that the pacemaker recall was delayed and that subsequent communications did not include all critical information needed for safe and effective patient care. These findings should prompt reforms in how the medical device industry and the FDA manage future medical device recalls.
   This case series assesses patient outcomes before and after recall of a defective pacemaker model to evaluate whether information provided to patients and caregivers was timely and complete.

TI  - Monitoring cardiorespiratory instability: Current approaches and implications for nursing practice
T2  - INTENSIVE AND CRITICAL CARE NURSING
AB  - Unrecognised in-hospital cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) risks adverse patient outcomes. Although step down unit (SDU) patients have continuous non-invasive physiologic monitoring of vital signs and a ratio of one nurse to four to six patients, detection of CRI is still suboptimal. Telemedicine provides additional surveillance but, due to high costs and unclear investment returns, is not routinely used in SDUs. Rapid response teams have been tested as possible approaches to support CRI patients outside the intensive care unit with mixed outcomes. Technology-enabled early warning scores, though rigorously studied, may not detect subtle instability. Efforts to utilise nursing intuition as a means to promote early identification of CRI have been explored, but the problem still persists. Monitoring systems hold promise, but nursing surveillance remains the key to reliable early detection and recognition. Research directed towards improving nursing surveillance and facilitating decision-making is needed to ensure safe patient outcomes and prevent CRI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ethics in the intensive care unit with emphasis on medical futility in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Neurophysiology-Society
AB  - Medical futility refers to situations or cases in which treatment offers no meaningful benefit to the patient. Brain death does not pose a management problem because patients are considered to be dead. Management of other cases requires sequential considerations. First, the prognosis must be established with certainty. Then, if it is determined that there is no possibility of the patient regaining conscious awareness, a level of care should be decided through discussions involving the physician and significant others. Usually there is a consensus that high-level intensive care is not justified to maintain such a low quality of life. When the patient's advance directives or the substitute decision maker's request differs from the physician's recommendations, there are methods of resolving the issues that respect ethical and legal principles.

TI  - In-hospital mortality from femoral shaft fracture depends on the initial delay to fracture fixation and Injury Severity Score: A retrospective cohort study from the NTDB 2002-2006
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal surgical timing for definitive treatment of femur fractures in severely injured patients remains controversial. This study was performed to examine in-hospital mortality for patients with femur fractures with regard to surgical timing, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and age.
   METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank version 7.0 was used to evaluate in-hospital mortality for patients presenting with unilateral femur fractures. Patients were stratified into four groups by surgical timing (ST) and four groups by ISS. chi(2) tests were used to evaluate baseline interrelationships. Binary regression was used to examine the association between time to surgery, ISS score, age, and mortality after adjusting for patient medical comorbidities, and personal demographics.
   RESULTS: A total of 7,540 patients met inclusion criteria, with a 1.4% overall in-hospital mortality rate. For patients with an isolated femur fracture, surgical delay beyond 48 hours was associated with nearly five times greater mortality risk compared with surgery within 12 hours (adjusted relative risk, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-14.1). Only severely injured patients (ISS, 26+) had higher associated mortality with no delay in surgical fixation (ST1 <12 hours) relative to ST2 of 13 hours to 24 hours with an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-16.7). The association between higher mortality rates and surgical delay beyond 48 hours was even stronger in the elderly patients.
   CONCLUSION: This study supports the work of previous authors who reported that early definitive fixation of femur fractures is not only beneficial, particularly in the elderly, but also consistent with more recent studies recommending at least 12-hour to 24-hour delay in fixation in severely injured patients to promote better resuscitation.

TI  - Early diagnosis of mortality using admission CT perfusion in severe traumatic brain injury patients (ACT-TBI): protocol for a prospective cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a catastrophic neurological condition with significant economic burden. Early in-hospital mortality (<48 hours) with severe TBI is estimated at 50%. Several clinical examinations exist to determine brain death; however, most are difficult to elicit in the acute setting in patients with severe TBI. Having a definitive assessment tool would help predict early in-hospital mortality in this population. CT perfusion (CTP) has shown promise diagnosing early in-hospital mortality in patients with severe TBI and other populations. The purpose of this study is to validate admission CTP features of brain death relative to the clinical examination outcome for characterizing early in-hospital mortality in patients with severe TBI.
   Methods and analysis The Early Diagnosis of Mortality using Admission CT Perfusion in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Patients study, is a prospective cohort study in patients with severe TBI funded by a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research. Adults aged 18 or older, with evidence of a severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 before initial resuscitation) and, on mechanical ventilation at the time of imaging are eligible. Patients will undergo CTP at the time of first imaging on their hospital admission. Admission CTP compares with the reference standard of an accepted bedside clinical assessment for brainstem function. Deferred consent will be used. The primary outcome is a binary outcome of mortality (dead) or survival (not dead) in the first 48 hours of admission. The planned sample size for achieving a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 95% with a CI of +/- 5% is 200 patients.
   Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board. The findings from our study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local rounds, national and international conferences. The public will be informed through forums at the end of the study.

TI  - The AMBER care bundle for hospital inpatients with uncertain recovery nearing the end of life: the ImproveCare feasibility cluster RCT
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: Patients admitted to hospital with a terminal illness and uncertain recovery often receive inconsistent care and do not have the opportunity to die in their preferred place of death. Previous end-of-life care packages, such as the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient, have sometimes been badly implemented. The AMBER (Assessment; Management; Best practice; Engagement; Recovery uncertain) care bundle was developed to remedy this. It has not been evaluated in a randomised trial, but a definitive trial would face many hurdles.
   Objective: To optimise the design of and determine the feasibility of a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial of the AMBER care bundle compared with best standard care.
   Design: A feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial including semistructured interviews with patients and relatives, focus groups with health-care professionals, non-participant observations of multidisciplinary team meetings, a standard care survey, heat maps and case note reviews. Retrospective data were collected from the family or close friends of deceased patients via a bereavement survey.
   Setting: Four general medical wards at district general hospitals in England.
   Participants: There were 65 participants (control, n = 36; intervention, n = 29). There were 24 interviews, four focus groups, 15 non-participant meeting observations, six case note reviews and three heat maps, and 15 of out 23 bereavement, standard care surveys were completed.
   Intervention: The AMBER care bundle is implemented by a nurse facilitator. It includes the development and documentation of a medical plan, consideration of outcomes, resuscitation and escalation status and daily plan revisiting. The AMBER care bundle encourages staff, patients and families to talk openly about their preferences and priorities should the worst happen.
   Main outcome measures: Two 'candidate' primary outcomes were selected to be evaluated for a future definitive trial: Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale patient/family anxiety and communication subscale and 'howRwe'. The secondary outcome measures were Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale symptoms, Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status scale, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, Client Service Receipt Inventory, recruitment rate, intervention fidelity and intervention acceptability.
   Results: Data were collected for 65 patients. This trial was not powered to measure clinical effectiveness, but variance and changes observed in the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale subscale indicated that this measure would probably detect differences within a definitive trial. It was feasible to collect data on health, social and informal care service use and on quality of life at two time points. The AMBER care bundle was broadly acceptable to all stakeholders and was delivered as planned. The emphasis on 'clinical uncertainty' prompted health-care professional awareness of often-overlooked patients. Reviewing patients' AMBER care bundle status was integrated into routine practice. Refinements included simplifying the inclusion criteria and improving health-care professional communication training. Improvements to trial procedures included extending the time devoted to recruitment and simplifying consent procedures. There was also a recommendation to reduce data collected from patients and relatives to minimise burden.
   Limitations: The recruitment rate was lower than anticipated. The inclusion criteria for the trial were difficult to interpret. Information sheets and consent procedures were too detailed and lengthy for the target population. Health-care professionals' enthusiasm and specialty were not considered while picking trial wards. Participant recruitment took place later during hospital admission and the majority of participants were lost to follow-up because they had been discharged. Those who participated may have different characteristics from those who did not.
   Conclusions: This feasibility trial has demonstrated that an evaluation of the AMBER care bundle among an acutely unwell patient population, although technically possible, is not practical or feasible. The intervention requires optimisation.

TI  - Gastrectomy for cancer beyond life expectancy. A comprehensive analysis of oncological gastric surgery in Germany between 2008 and 2018
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionMajor gastric surgery for distal esophageal and gastric cancer has a strong impact on the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Especially in elderly patients reaching their life expectancy, the responsible use and extent of gastrectomy are imperative to achieve a balance between harm and benefit. In the present study, the reimbursement database (German Diagnosis Related Groups (G-DRG) database) of the Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany was queried to evaluate the morbidity and mortality of patients aged above or below 75 years following gastrectomy. Material and methodsAll patients in Germany undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (ST), total gastrectomy (T), or gastrectomy combined with esophagectomy (TE) for gastric or distal esophageal cancer (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Version 10 (ICD-10) C15.2, C15.5, and C16.0-C16.9) between 2008 and 2018 were included. Intraoperative and postoperative complications as well as comorbidities, in-hospital mortality, and the extent of surgery were assessed by evaluating ICD-10 and operation and procedure key (Operationen- und Prozedurenschlussel) codes. ResultsA total of 67,389 patients underwent oncologic gastric resection in Germany between 2008 and 2018. In total, 21,794 patients received ST, 41,825 received T, and 3,466 received TE, respectively. In 304 cases, the combinations of these, in fact, mutually exclusive procedures were encoded. The proportion of patients aged 75 years or older was 51.4% (n = 11,207) for ST, 32.6% (n = 13,617) for T, and 28.1% (n = 973) for TE. The in-hospital mortality of elderly patients was significantly increased in all three groups. (p < 0.0001) General complications such as respiratory failure (p = 0.0054), acute renal failure (p < 0.0001), acute myocardial failure (p < 0.0001), and the need for resuscitation (ST/T: p < 0.0001/TE: p = 0.0218) were significantly increased after any kind of gastrectomy. Roux-en Y was the most commonly applied reconstruction technique in both young and elderly patients. Regarding lymphadenectomy, systematic D2 dissection was performed less frequently in older patients than in the younger collective in the case of ST and T as well as D3 dissection. Peritonectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy were uncommon in elderly patients alongside ST and T compared to younger patients (p < 0.0001). ConclusionThe clinical outcome of major oncological gastric surgery is highly dependent on a patient's age. The elderly show a tremendously increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality and morbidity.

TI  - Outcomes of emergency resuscitative thoracotomies in a trauma unit in Johannesburg, South Africa
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background. Emergency resuscitative thoracotomies (ERTs) are life-saving procedures for traumatic cardiac arrest or severe haemorrhage, but their outcomes remain variable and are influenced by several factors, including timing, mechanism of injury and the presence of initial signs of life. Studies on ERT outcomes predominantly originate from well-resourced settings, leaving a gap in understanding their effectiveness in resource-constrained environments. Objective. To conduct a prospective audit of ERTs performed at a level 1 trauma unit over a 1-year period (1 April 2023-31 March 2024), assessing initial presentation characteristics, indications for ERT and subsequent outcomes in terms of survival and complications. Methods. A prospective analysis of 19 consecutive patients who underwent ERT was performed. Data included demographics, mechanism of injury, initial physiological parameters, ERT indications, resuscitation times, blood product transfusions, complications and survival to discharge. Results. The study comprised predominantly male patients (94.74%) with a wide age range (19-68 years). Penetrating trauma was the most common mechanism of injury (94.44%). An association was observed between shorter interval between fluid resuscitation time and commencement of ERT time and survival. Elevated lactate levels and acidosis were more frequent in non-survivors. A high mortality rate was noted (only one patient survived). Conclusion. This study did not find statistically significant results, but recognising the importance of prompt and ongoing resuscitation in improving survival after ERT is consistent with existing literature. However, the small sample size significantly limits the ability to apply these findings to other cases. Larger studies are necessary to definitively establish the impact of factors such as resource limitations on ERT outcomes in under-resourced settings. The high mortality rate highlights the need for focused research into improving patient selection criteria, optimising ERT techniques and addressing resource constraints in developing countries.

TI  - RETRACTED: Effect Analysis of In-Hospital Transfer Care Based on STABLE Technology in Critically Ill Newborns (Retracted Article)
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose. Analysis of the effectiveness of in-hospital transfer care based on the STABLE (sugar and safe care, temperature, airway, blood pressure, lab work, emotional support) technique in critically ill neonates. Methods. Retrospective analysis of the case data of 180 critically ill neonates transferred to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) via the delivery room (operating room) in our hospital from April 2020 to December 2021. Of which, 88 newborns from April 2020 to February 2021 were resuscitated by conventional resuscitation and then transferred to the NICU by the nurses in the delivery room (operating room) through the green channel, and they were recorded as the control group; and 92 newborns from March to December 2021 were transferred to the NICU by the NICU transfer nurses who arrived at the delivery room (operating room) earlier and used the in-hospital transfer care based on STABLE technology, and they were recorded as the intervention group. The indicators to be assessed were the execution pass rate in the simulated assessment of the transfer emergency procedure for both groups of transporters, execution times of the various subprocesses during the transfer procedure for both groups of transporters, accidents in transit, and blood glucose, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration, blood gas indicators, and family satisfaction of children in both groups after transfer. Results. The total execution pass rate for transporters was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The execution times of the various subprocesses during the transfer procedure of transporters were shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of accidents in transit was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). After transfer, the blood glucose, blood pressure, body temperature, respiratory, and blood gas indicators of the children in the intervention group were all more stable than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The satisfaction of the families of the children in the intervention group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. The implementation of transfer care based on STABLE technology for newborns in urgent need of in-hospital transfer can effectively improve the comprehensive quality and emergency response ability of transfer nurses and shorten the in-hospital transfer time, and the incidence of adverse reactions during the transfer of children is less, the vital signs are stable, and the satisfaction of family members is high, which is of promotion value.

TI  - Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta for non-traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY
CP  - 85th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Southeastern-Surgical-Congress
AB  - Background Hemorrhagic shock is the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma and a significant cause of mortality in non-trauma patients. The increased use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) as a bridge to definitive control for massive hemorrhage has provided promising results in the trauma population. We describe an extension of this procedure to our hemodynamically unstable non-trauma patients. Methods This is a retrospective review of patients requiring REBOA for end stage non-traumatic abdominal hemorrhage from our tertiary care facility. After excluding patients with trauma, supradiaphragmatic bleed and thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysms, demographics, etiology of bleed, REBOA placement specifics, complications and outcomes were reviewed. Results From August 2013 to August 2016, 11 patients were identified requiring REBOA placement for hemodynamic instability from non-traumatic abdominal hemorrhage. Average patient age was 54.9 (SD 15.2). Sixty-four percent suffered cardiac arrest prior to REBOA, with mean shock index of 1.29. Average time from diagnosis of shock (MAP <= 65) or signs of bleeding to placement of REBOA was 177 min. The leading etiologies of hemorrhage were ruptured visceral aneurysm and massive upper gastrointestinal bleed. REBOA was placed by both acute care and vascular surgeons. The procedure was mainly completed in the operating room in 82% of the patients and at the bedside in 18%. One patient expired before operative repair. Definitive surgical control of the source of bleeding was obtained by open surgical approach (n = 6) and combined surgical and endovascular approach (n = 4). In-hospital survival was 64%. There were no local complications related to REBOA placement. Conclusion Similar to the trauma population, REBOA is an adjunctive technique for proximal control of bleeding as well as resuscitation in end stage non-traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage. We propose an algorithmic approach to REBOA use in this population and a larger prospective review is necessary to determine both the timing of REBOA placement and which non-traumatic patients may benefit from this technique.

TI  - Fluid Resuscitation Choice and its Effect on Plasma Chloride and Acute Kidney Injury in Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Randomized Study of Normal Saline vs. Balanced Crystalloids (Physiomax)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HOSPITAL INTERNAL MEDICINE PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially fatal gastrointestinal condition, often associated with organ failure and acute kidney injury (AKI). Early fluid resuscitation with Normal saline (NS) may lead to hyperchloremia and AKI, which prompted interest in using balanced crystalloids. However, the optimal choice of crystalloid fluid remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the effects of NS versus Physiomax on plasma chloride levels and AKI incidence during early resuscitation in patients with predicted severe AP (pSAP). Methods: A single-center, prospective, randomized study was conducted between November 2022 and December 2023 at PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. 112 patients with pSAP were enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive either NS or Physiomax for fluid resuscitation over the first 48 h. Primary outcome was plasma chloride concentration at 48 h. Secondary outcomes included AKI incidence, MAKE-30 events, ICU admissions, and mortality. Results: Baseline and clinical parameters were comparable between groups. At 48 h, plasma chloride levels were significantly higher in NS group (114.1 +/- 4.3 mmol/L) versus Physiomax group (108.1 +/- 3.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001). AKI occurred in 41 % of NS group while 21.4 % in Physiomax group (p = 0.03). MAKE-30 events were more common in NS group (17.9 % vs. 5.4 %; p = 0.008). ICU admission rates were also significantly higher with NS infusion (28.6 % vs. 10.7 %; p = 0.03). No significant differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or other complications were observed in between groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Physiomax significantly reduced plasma chloride levels and AKI incidence in patients with pSAP, suggesting a potential clinical benefit of balanced crystalloids in early AP resuscitation.

TI  - Delta Shock Index During Emergency Department Stay Is Associated With in Hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Delta shock index (SI; i.e., change in SI over time) has been shown to predict mortality and need for surgical intervention among trauma patients at the emergency department (ED). However, the usefulness of delta SI for prognosis assessment in non-traumatic critically ill patients at the ED remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between delta SI during ED management and in-hospital outcomes in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
   Method: This was a retrospective study conducted in two tertiary medical centers in Taiwan from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. All adult non-traumatic patients who visited the ED and who were subsequently admitted to the ICU were included. We calculated delta SI by subtracting SI at ICU admission from SI at ED triage, and we analyzed its association with in-hospital outcomes. SI was defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure (SBP). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (HLOS) and early mortality. Early mortality was defined as mortality within 48 h of ICU admission.
   Result: During the study period, 11,268 patients met the criteria and were included. Their mean age was 64.5 +/- 15.9 years old. Overall, 5,830 (51.6%) patients had positive delta SI. Factors associated with a positive delta SI were multiple comorbidities (51.2% vs. 46.3%, p < 0.001) and high Simplified Acute Physiology Score [39 (29-51) vs. 37 (28-47), p < 0.001). Patients with positive delta SI were more likely to have tachycardia, hypotension, and higher SI at ICU admission. In the regression analysis, high delta SI was associated with in-hospital mortality [aOR (95% CI): 1.21 (1.03-1.42)] and early mortality [aOR (95% CI): 1.26 (1.07-1.48)], but not for HLOS [difference (95% CI): 0.34 (-0.48 to 1.17)]. In the subgroup analysis, high delta SI had higher odds ratios for both mortality and early mortality in elderly [aOR (95% CI): 1.59 (1.11-2.29)] and septic patients [aOR (95% CI): 1.54 (1.13-2.11)]. It also showed a higher odds ratio for early mortality in patients with triage SBP <100 mmHg [aOR (95% CI): 2.14 (1.21-3.77)] and patients with triage SI >= 0.9 [aOR (95% CI): 1.62 (1.01-2.60)].
   Conclusion: High delta SI during ED stay is correlated with in-hospital mortality and early mortality in patients admitted to the ICU via ED. Prompt resuscitation should be performed, especially for those with old age, sepsis, triage SBP <100 mmHg, or triage SI >= 0.9.

TI  - Assessing Reverse Shock Index as a Survival Predictor for Trauma Patients in Emergency Settings: A Retrospective Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Identifying trauma patients with shock is crucial, as early intervention and prompt treatment improve patient prognosis and survival. To address this, the ratio of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Heart Rate (HR), known as the Reverse Shock Index (RSI), is measured. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of RSI calculation in assessing prognosis. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in which data were retrospectively collected on trauma patients treated in the Emergency Room (ER) at Dhiraj Hospital, Sumandeep Vidyapeeth Deemed to be University, Vadodara, Gujarat, India, from January 2021 to December 2022. Patients involved in road traffic accidents, fall from a height of >= 6 m, assault, and machinery injuries were included. Upon arrival, vital signs such as HR, SBP, Respiratory Rate (RR), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), associated injuries, and in -hospital mortality were documented. Any resuscitative procedures required, such as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), intubation, oxygen therapy, chest tube insertion, and blood transfusion, were also recorded. The RSI was calculated for all trauma patients and divided into two groups (RSI <1 and RSI >= 1). The t -test was performed with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Results: Out of 363 patients, data from 320 patients were included. Among them, 55 patients (17.2%) had RSI <1, and 265 patients (82.8%) had RSI >= 1. Patients with RSI <1 exhibited lower GCS scores, tachypnoea (RR >29), or bradypnoea (RR <10), along with higher mortality rates. These patients also required resuscitative interventions. Those with RSI <1 experienced more head injuries, thoracic trauma, and maxillofacial injuries (p<0.001). Conclusion: The RSI <1 in trauma patients demonstrated significantly higher predictive accuracy for adverse outcomes, serving as a primary tool for early intervention and aggressive care in the ER.

TI  - Prompt administration of antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes in febrile neutropenia in children with cancer
T2  - PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER
AB  - Background Time-to-antibiotic (TTA) administration is a widely used quality-of-care measure for children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN). We sought to determine whether TTA is associated with outcomes of FN. Procedure A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted of 1,628 FN admissions from 653 patients from 2001 to 2009. Outcome variables included (1) an adverse event (AE) composite of in-hospital mortality, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission within 24hours of presentation, and/or fluid resuscitation 40ml/kg within 24hours of presentation and (2) length of stay (LOS). TTA was measured as a continuous variable and in 60-minute intervals. Mixed regression models were constructed to evaluate associations of TTA with the outcome variables after adjusting for relevant covariates including cancer diagnosis, degree of myelosuppression, and presence of bacteremia. Results The composite AE outcome occurred in 11.1% of admissions including 0.7% in-hospital mortality, 4.7% PICU admission, and 10.1% fluid resuscitation. In univariate analysis, TTA was associated with the composite AE outcome (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64) but not LOS. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for relevant covariates, 60-minute TTA intervals were associated with the composite AE outcome (61-120minutes vs. 60minutes, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.26). Unexpectedly, admission from the emergency department (ED) was also independently associated with the composite AE outcome (ED vs. clinic, OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.95-5.09). Conclusions TTA and presentation to the ED are independently associated with poor outcomes of FN. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013;60:1299-1306. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - The impact of early thromboelastography directed therapy in trauma resuscitation
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Conventional coagulation tests do not provide an accurate representation of the complex nature of trauma induced coagulopathy. Thrombelastography provides a prompt global overview of all dynamic sequential aspects of trauma induced coagulopathy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of using thrombelastography on blood products utilization, crystalloids utilization, hospital, and intensive care using length of stay, and cost savings.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 134 patients (May of 2012 to February of 2015) meeting Class I trauma activation. Outcome data was compared between two groups: patients prior to thrombelastography implementation (n = 87) and patients with thrombelastography guided trauma resuscitation (n = 47). Blood product usage was compared for three time periods: first 4 h, the next 20 h, and first 24 h.
   Results: For the first 24 h of treatment, patients with thrombelastography guided trauma resuscitation had lower packed red blood cells (p = 0.0022) and fresh frozen plasma (p = 0.0474), but higher jumbo pack platelets (p = 0.0476) utilization when compared to the patients prior to thrombelastography implementation. There was no statistical significant difference in the utilization of crystalloids for any of the three time intervals. Patients with thrombelastography guided trauma resuscitation had a shorter hospital length of stay (p = 0.0011) and intensive care unit length of stay (p = 0.0059) than the patients prior to thrombelastography implementation. Cost savings in blood products transfusion were most pronounced in patients with penetrating injuries.
   Discussion: Using visco-elastic tests to guide blood transfusion was first used for liver transplant patients and then applied to cardiovascular surgery and trauma. Similar to other studies, this study showed using visco-elastic tests for trauma patietns corresponded to an overall reduction in the use of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma during the first 24 hours of resuscitation. In addition, this study showed using visco elastic tests corresponded to a significant reduction in both hospital and intensive care unit length of stay.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that Thrombelastography guided trauma resuscitation decreases the overall transfusion requirements of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. However, given the nature of under-recognized jumbo pack platelets dysfunction in the conventional laboratory parameters, jumbo pack platelets utilization is higher when following Thrombelastography directed resuscitation. The utilization of Thrombelastography corresponded to a reduction in hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay and cost of transfused blood products.

TI  - A 7-year review of deaths on the general paediatric wards at John Hunter Children's Hospital, 1991-97
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To study the palliative management of children dying on the wards of a tertiary referral centre. In particular to identify areas of difficulty and discuss ways in which these can be improved.
   Methodology: All children between the ages 1 and 19 years dying on the general paediatric wards of the John Hunter Children's Hospital (JHCH) (a tertiary referral centre in New South Wales Hunter Valley) between 1991 and 1998 were included in the study. The main outcome measures were the duration of 'terminal care only' treatment; time spent in hospital in the previous year; analgesia used, dose and route of administration; adjuvant medications; quality of life in the final 24 h.
   Results: Eighteen children (aged between 1 and 19 years) died on the general paediatric wards at JHCH between 1991 and 1998. The most common diagnosis was malignancy (five patients), with cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy and a degenerative neurological disorder each accounting for four patients, and one child had herpes simplex encephalitis. In all children the terminal nature of their condition was recognized and in all but three patients there was documentation of 'not for resuscitation' (NFR) orders following discussion with the child's parents. The mainstay of analgesia was an intravenous narcotic infusion with 11 (61%) children needing a morphine infusion. Fifteen patients (83%) required other medications including antiemetics, anticonvulsants and corticosteroids. Twelve (66%) children were semiconscious or unconscious on the day of death. Three children were uncomfortable and distressed, one alert and symptom free and in two cases the level of consciousness was not recorded. Three children continued to have seizures until their death.
   Conclusion: The majority of terminally ill children were managed well with intravenous narcotics and adjuvant medications. There may be scope for such children to be managed successfully at home with appropriate support for the general practitioner by paediatric and palliative care specialists. Some cases in which palliation is difficult do remain in hospital and additional measures need to be employed to ensure a symptom free death for these children.

TI  - QUALITY-OF-LIFE FOLLOWING SPINAL-CORD INJURY - KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES OF EMERGENCY CARE PROVIDERS
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objectives: To measure emergency care providers attitudes toward quality of life after spinal cord injury (SCI) and to determine if their perceptions influence the care they provide.
   Design: A closed-ended questionnaire.
   Setting and participants: Two hundred thirty-three emergency nurses, emergency medicine technicians, emergency medicine residents, and attending physicians at three level I trauma centers were surveyed. Their responses were compared with previously reported quality-of-life ratings of a group of 128 high-level SCI survivors.
   Measurements and results: One hundred fifty-three emergency care providers completed the survey (response rate, 63%). Forty-one percent believed that resuscitation efforts after severe SCI are too aggressive, and 28% believed that future quality of life should be a factor in determining the interventions that should be provided. If they sustained severe SCIs themselves, 22% of providers would want nothing done to ensure their survival, and 23% would want pain relief only. Only 18% imagined they would be glad to be alive with a severe SCl, compared with 92% of a true SCI comparison group. Seventeen percent of providers anticipated an average or better quality of life compared with 86% of the actual SCI comparison group.
   Conclusion: The quality of life, self-esteem, and outcomes that emergency health care providers imagine after SCI are considerably more negative than those reported by SCI survivors. Because providers' knowledge and attitudes may affect the care they provide and may influence patients and families struggling with critical treatment decisions, emergency care providers must be aware of outcomes,well-being, and life satisfaction following severe SCI.

TI  - Principles of Fluid Management
T2  - CRITICAL CARE CLINICS
AB  - Fluid therapy is the most common intervention received by acutely ill hospitalized patients; however, important questions on its optimal use remain. Its prescription should be patient and context specific, with clear indications and contradictions, and have the type, dose, and rate specified. Any fluid therapy, if provided inappropriately, can contribute unnecessary harm to patients. The quantitative toxicity of fluid therapy contributes to worse outcomes; this should prompt greater bedside attention to fluid prescription, fluid balance, development of avoidable complications attributable to fluid overload, and for the timely deresuscitation of patients whose clinical status and physiology allow active fluid mobilization.

TI  - Improved Hemodynamic Recovery and 72-Hour Survival Following Low-Volume Resuscitation with a PEGylated Carboxyhemoglobin in a Rat Model of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction
   Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death from potentially survivable civilian and military trauma. As projected conflicts move from settings of tactical and logistical supremacy to hyper-dynamic tactical zones against peer and near-peer adversaries, protracted medical evacuation times are expected. Treatment at the point-of-injury is critical. Although crystalloids like Lactated Ringer's (LR) are ubiquitous, whole blood (WB) is the preferred resuscitation fluid following hemorrhage; however, logistical constraints limit the availability of WB in prehospital settings. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) offer both hemodynamic support and oxygen-carrying capacity while avoiding logistical constraints of WB. We hypothesized that low-volume resuscitation of severe hemorrhagic shock with an HBOC (PEGylated carboxyhemoglobin, [PC]) would improve hemodynamic recovery and 72-hour survival; comparable to WB and superior to LR.
   Materials and Methods
   Atotal of 21 anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent severe hemorrhagic shock followed by randomly assigned low-volume resuscitation with LR, WB, or PC, and then recovered from anesthesia for up to 72-hour observation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded continuously under anesthesia, and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline (BL), 60 minutes post-hemorrhage (HS1h), and 24 hours post-resuscitation (PR24h). Survival was presented on a Kaplan-Meier plot and significance determined with a log-rank test. Cardiovascular and blood gas data were assessed with oneway analysis of variance and post hoc analysis where appropriate.
   Results
   All measured cardiovascular and blood chemistry parameters were equivalent between groups at BL and HS1h. BLMAP values were 90 +/- 3, 86 +/- 1, and 89 +/- 2 mmHg for LR, PC, and WB, respectively. Immediately following resuscitation, MAP values were 57 +/- 4, 74 +/- 5, and 62 +/- 3 mmHg, with PC equivalent to WB and higher than LR (P < 0.05). WB and LR were both lower than BL (P < 0.0001), whereas PC was not (P = 0.13). The PC group's survival to 72 hours was 57%, which was not different from WB (43%) and higher than LR (14%; P < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   A single bolus infusion of PC produced superior survival and MAP response compared to LR, which is the standard fluid resuscitant carried by combat medics. PC was not different from WB in terms of survival and MAP, which is encouraging because its reduced logistical constraints make it viable for field deployment. These promising findings warrant further development and investigation of PC as a low-volume, early treatment for hemorrhagic shock in scenarios where blood products may not be available.

TI  - Quality Indicators for Evaluating Prehospital Emergency Care: A Scoping Review
T2  - PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Historically, the quality and performance of prehospital emergency care (PEC) has been assessed largely based on surrogate, non-clinical endpoints such as response time intervals or other crude measures of care (eg, stakeholder satisfaction). However, advances in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems and services worldwide have seen their scope and reach continue to expand. This has dictated that novel measures of performance be implemented to compliment this growth. Significant progress has been made in this area, largely in the form of the development of evidence-informed quality indicators (QIs) of PEC.
   Problem: Quality indicators represent an increasingly popular component of health care quality and performance measurement. However, little is known about the development of QIs in the PEC environment. The purpose of this study was to assess the development and characteristics of PEC-specific QIs in the literature.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted through a search of PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA); EMBase (Elsevier; Amsterdam, Netherlands); CINAHL (EBSCO Information Services; Ipswich, Massachusetts USA); Web of Science (Thomson Reuters; New York, New York USA); and the Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration; Oxford, United Kingdom). To increase the sensitivity of the literature, a search of the grey literature and review of select websites was additionally conducted. Articles were selected that proposed at least one PEC QI and whose aim was to discuss, analyze, or promote quality measurement in the PEC environment.
   Results: The majority of research (n=25 articles) was published within the last decade (68.0%) and largely originated within the USA (68.0%). Delphi and observational methodologies were the most commonly employed for QI development (28.0%). A total of 331 QIs were identified via the article review, with an additional 15 QIs identified via the website review. Of all, 42.8% were categorized as primarily Clinical, with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest contributing the highest number within this domain (30.4%). Of the QIs categorized as Non-Clinical (57.2%), Time-Based Intervals contributed the greatest number (28.8%). Population on Whom the Data Collection was Constructed made up the most commonly reported QI component (79.8%), followed by a Descriptive Statement (63.6%). Least reported were Timing of Data Collection (12.1%) and Timing of Reporting (12.1%). Pilot testing of the QIs was reported on 34.7% of QIs identified in the review.
   Conclusion: Overall, there is considerable interest in the understanding and development of PEC quality measurement. However, closer attention to the details and reporting of QIs is required for research of this type to be more easily extrapolated and generalized.

TI  - Neurologic Injury in Neonates with Congenital Heart Disease During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: An Analysis of Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry Data
T2  - ASAIO JOURNAL
AB  - The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiology and factors associated with acute neurologic injury in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). It is a retrospective cohort study. Multi-institutional data for purposes of this study were obtained from the extracorporeal life support organization registry Neonates with CHD supported with ECMO during 2005-2010. Of 1,898 neonates with CHD supported with ECMO, 273 (14%) had neurologic injury. Birth weight less than 3 kg (odds ratio [OR]: 1.5; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.1-1.9), pre-ECMO blood pH <= 7.15 (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5-2.0) increased neurologic injury. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with neurologic injury compared with those without (73% vs. 53%; p < 0.001). Neonates with CHD undergoing ECMO are highly vulnerable to acute neurologic injury regardless of cardiac lesion-specific physiology or the occurrence of cardiac surgery. The incidence of neurologic injuries in this population is higher in sicker patients. Severity of illness should therefore become the main target for improvement. Timely deployment of ECMO may therefore influence the development of ECMO complications.

TI  - Clinical Management and Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death
T2  - CIRCULATION RESEARCH
AB  - Despite the revolutionary advancements in the past 3 decades in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with device-based therapy, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an enormous public health burden. Survivors of SCD are generally at high risk for recurrent events. The clinical management of such patients requires a multidisciplinary approach from postresuscitative care to a thorough cardiovascular investigation in an attempt to identify the underlying substrate, with potential to eliminate or modify the triggers through catheter ablation and ultimately an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for prompt treatment of recurrences in those at risk. Early recognition of low left ventricular ejection fraction as a strong predictor of death and association of ventricular arrhythmias with sudden death led to significant investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs. The lack of efficacy and the proarrhythmic effects of drugs catalyzed the development and investigation of the ICD through several major clinical trials that proved the efficacy of ICD as a bedrock tool to detect and promptly treat life-threatening arrhythmias. The ICD therapy is routinely used for primary prevention of SCD in patients with cardiomyopathy and high risk inherited arrhythmic conditions and secondary prevention in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest. This compendium will review the clinical management of those surviving SCD and discuss landmark studies of antiarrhythmic drugs, ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD.

TI  - "Dispatcher, Can You Help Me? A Woman Is Giving Birth". A Pilot Study of Remote Video Assistance with Smart Glasses
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Smart glasses (SG) could be a breakthrough in emergency situations, so the aim of this work was to assess the potential benefits of teleassistance with smart glasses (SG) from a midwife to a lifeguard in a simulated, unplanned, out-of-hospital birth (OHB). Thirty-eight lifeguards were randomized into SG and control (CG) groups. All participants were required to act in a simulated imminent childbirth with a maternal-fetal simulator (PROMPT Flex, Laerdal, Norway). The CG acted autonomously, while the SG group was video-assisted by a midwife through SG (Vuzix Blade, New York, NY, USA). The video assistance was based on the OHB protocol, speaking and receiving images on the SG. The performance time, compliance with the protocol steps, and perceived performance with the SG were evaluated. The midwife's video assistance with SG allowed 35% of the SG participants to perform the complete OHB protocol. No CG participant was able to perform it (p = 0.005). All OHB protocol variables were significantly better in the SG group than in the CG (p < 0.05). Telemedicine through video assistance with SG is feasible so that a lifeguard with no knowledge of childbirth care can act according to the recommendations in a simulated, unplanned, uncomplicated OHB. Communication with the midwife by speaking and sending images to the SG is perceived as an important benefit to the performance.

T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - PurposeThis is the third of three parts of the clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) on fluid management in adult critically ill patients. This part addresses fluid removal in the de-escalation phase of shock management.MethodsThis guideline was formulated by an international panel of clinical experts, methodologists, and patient representatives. A literature search was conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults published up to February 2025. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to evaluate the certainty of evidence and to move from evidence to decision.ResultsBased on data from 13 RCTs, the panel issued three conditional recommendations. The panel suggested de-escalation of fluid therapy over no de-escalation in critically ill adults after the acute phase of fluid resuscitation (low certainty evidence). They suggested protocolized fluid removal by diuretics over usual care in critically ill patients after the acute phase of fluid resuscitation (moderate certainty evidence). A conditional recommendation was issued against the routine use of ultrafiltration or extracorporeal fluid removal in critically ill adults after the acute phase of fluid resuscitation, without other indication for RRT (low certainty evidence). There was limited evidence to comment on fluid removal in specific patient cohorts.ConclusionsThis ESICM guideline provides three recommendations to inform clinicians on fluid removal during the de-escalation phase in critically ill patients with shock who no longer need fluid resuscitation.

TI  - Longitudinal serum neurofilament light kinetics in post-anoxic encephalopathy
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - Serum neurofilament light (sNfL) is a promising marker of outcome after cardiac arrest, but its kinetics are unclear. We prospectively measured sNfL concentrations in 62 patients at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after cardiac arrest. Survivors and non-survivors had similar sNfL at admission (14.2 [8.6-21.9] vs. 22.5 [14.2-46.9] pg/mL) but largely different at 24 h (16.4 [10.2-293] vs. 464.3 [151.8-1658.2], respectively). The AUC for sNfL concentrations predicting death was above 0.95 from Day 1 to 10 (highest on Day 3). Late sNfL measurements may exert prognostic value, especially when early samples are unavailable or prognosis remains unclear.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for critically ill adults
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of life support that targets the heart and lungs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure accesses and returns blood from the venous system and provides non-pulmonary gas exchange. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe cardiac failure or for refractory cardiac arrest (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)) provides gas exchange and systemic circulation. The configuration of ECMO is variable, and several pump-driven and pump-free systems are in use. Use of ECMO is associated with several risks. Patient-related adverse events include haemorrhage or extremity ischaemia; circuit-related adverse effects may include pump failure, oxygenator failure and thrombus formation. Use of ECMO in newborns and infants is well established, yet its clinical effectiveness in adults remains uncertain.
   Objectives
   The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine whether use of veno-venous (VV) or venous-arterial (VA) ECMO in adults is more effective in improving survival compared with conventional respiratory and cardiac support.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 18 August 2014. We searched conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, reference lists of retrieved articles and databases of ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field. We imposed no restrictions on language or location of publications.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that compared adult ECMO versus conventional support.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations against the inclusion criteria. We independently reviewed full-text copies of studies that met the inclusion criteria. We entered all data extracted from the included studies into Review Manager. Two review authors independently performed risk of bias assessment. All included studies were appraised with respect to random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.
   Main results
   We included four RCTs that randomly assigned 389 participants with acute respiratory failure. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one RCT. We found no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality at six months (two RCTs) or before six months (during 30 days of randomization in one trial and during hospital stay in another RCT). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in the estimate of effects because significant changes have been noted in ECMO applications and treatment modalities over study periods to the present.
   Two RCTs supplied data on disability. In one RCT survival was low in both groups but none of the survivors had limitations in their daily activities six months after discharge. The other RCT reported improved survival without severe disability in the intervention group (transfer to an ECMO centre +/- ECMO) six months after study randomization but no statistically significant differences in health related quality of life.
   In three RCTs, participants in the ECMO group received greater numbers of blood transfusions. One RCT recorded significantly more non-brain haemorrhage in the ECMO group. Another RCT reported two serious adverse events in the ECMO group, and another reported three adverse events in the ECMO group.
   Clinical heterogeneity between studies prevented meta-analyses across outcomes. We found no completed RCT that had investigated ECMO in the context of cardiac failure or arrest. We found one ongoing RCT that examined patients with acute respiratory failure and two ongoing RCTs that included patients with acute cardiac failure (arrest).
   Authors' conclusions
   Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains a rescue therapy. Since the year 2000, patient treatment and practice with ECMO have considerably changed as the result of research findings and technological advancements over time. Over the past four decades, only four RCTs have been published that compared the intervention versus conventional treatment at the time of the study. Clinical heterogeneity across these published studies prevented pooling of data for a meta-analysis.
   We recommend combining results of ongoing RCTs with results of trials conducted after the year 2000 if no significant shifts in technology or treatment occur. Until these new results become available, data on use of ECMO in patients with acute respiratory failure remain inconclusive. For patients with acute cardiac failure or arrest, outcomes of ongoing RCTs will assist clinicians in determining what role ECMO and ECPR can play in patient care.

TI  - Management of the airway in multitrauma
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   The primary purpose of this article is to highlight the latest airway research in multitrauma.
   Recent findings
   Management of the airway in multitrauma patients is a critical resuscitation task. Prehospital airway management is difficult with a high risk of failure, complications, or both. In-hospital performed conventional oral intubation with manual in-line stabilization, cricoid pressure, and a backup plan for a surgical airway is still the most efficient and effective approach for early airway control in multitrauma patients. Selective utilization of airway maintenance, instead of ultimate airway control in the field, has been suggested as a primary prehospital strategy. Properties of videolaryngoscopes complement standard laryngoscopes. When compared with a Macintosh laryngoscope, the Airtraq and Airwayscope diminish cervical spine motion during elective orotracheal intubation. Penetrating neck injuries are the most frequent indication for awake intubation, whereas patients with maxillofacial injuries have the highest rate of initial surgical airway.
   Summary
   Risks and benefits of ultimate prehospital airway control is a controversial topic. Utilization of videolaryngoscopes in multitrauma remains open for research. Standardization of training requirements, equipment, and development of prehospital and in-hospital airway algorithms are needed to improve outcomes. Rational utilization of available airway devices, development of new devices, or both may help to promote this goal.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Presentation and Outcomes for Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Findings From the American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background:
   The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed longstanding racial and ethnic inequities in health risks and outcomes in the United States. We aimed to identify racial and ethnic differences in presentation and outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
   Methods:
   The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is a retrospective observational registry capturing consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We present data on the first 7868 patients by race/ethnicity treated at 88 hospitals across the United States between January 17, 2020, and July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and COVID-19 cardiorespiratory ordinal severity score (worst to best: death, cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation with mechanical circulatory support, mechanical ventilation with vasopressors/inotrope support, mechanical ventilation without hemodynamic support, and hospitalization alone. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and each outcome adjusting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and presentation features, and accounting for clustering by hospital.
   Results:
   Among 7868 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 33.0% were Hispanic, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 6.3% were Asian, and 35.2% were non-Hispanic White. Hispanic and Black patients were younger than non-Hispanic White and Asian patients and were more likely to be uninsured. Black patients had the highest prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Black patients also had the highest rates of mechanical ventilation (23.2%) and renal replacement therapy (6.6%) but the lowest rates of remdesivir use (6.1%). Overall mortality was 18.4% with 53% of all deaths occurring in Black and Hispanic patients. The adjusted odds ratios for mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.76-1.14) for Black patients, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.73-1.11) for Hispanic patients, and 1.31 (95% CI, 0.96-1.80) for Asian patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. The median odds ratio across hospitals was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.74-2.48). Results were similar for major adverse cardiovascular events. Asian patients had the highest COVID-19 cardiorespiratory severity at presentation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.16-1.90]).
   Conclusions:
   Although in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ by race/ethnicity after adjustment, Black and Hispanic patients bore a greater burden of mortality and morbidity because of their disproportionate representation among COVID-19 hospitalizations.

TI  - Sociodemographic Disparities and Impact of Palliative Care Utilization During End-of-Life Hospitalizations in Patients with Gastric Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Gastric cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with high symptom burden. Palliative care can enhance quality of life, provide symptom relief, and support end-of-life planning. However, disparities in access may lead to inequitable care, particularly among vulnerable populations with advanced diseases such as gastric cancer. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020), a nationally representative database of U.S. hospitalizations, to identify predictors of palliative care utilization and its impact on outcomes among gastric cancer patients who died during hospitalization. Multivariable regression models assessed associations with length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, and intensive interventions. Results: Among 13,435 weighted hospitalizations ending in death, 57.6% received palliative care. Black patients had 32% lower odds of receiving palliative care than White patients (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54-0.82). Higher palliative care use was associated with greater income, large hospitals, urban teaching hospitals, and private/other insurance. In adjusted analyses, palliative care was linked to a $36,240 reduction in hospital charges (95% CI: -$51,506 to -$20,974, p < 0.01), with no significant difference in LOS. Palliative care was associated with higher odds of DNR status (aOR: 4.77, 95% CI: 3.99-5.70, p < 0.01) and lower odds of CPR, mechanical ventilation, transfusion, and vasopressor use. Conclusion: Palliative care among hospitalized gastric cancer patients in the United States was associated with less intensive care and lower costs without prolonging LOS. However, significant disparities by race, income, insurance, and hospital type persist. Efforts are needed to ensure equitable access to inpatient palliative care at the end of life.

TI  - The Emergency Medical System in Greece: Opening Aeolus' Bag of Winds
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - An Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system must encompass a spectrum of care, with dedicated pre-hospital and in-hospital medical facilities. It has to be organised in such a way as to include all necessary services such as triage accurate initial assessment, prompt resuscitation, efficient management of emergency cases, and transport to definitive care. The global economic downturn has had a direct effect on the health sector and poses additional threats to the healthcare system. Greece is one of the hardest-hit countries. This manuscript aims to present the structure of the Greek EMS system and the impact of the current economic recession on it. Nowadays, primary care suffers major shortages in crucial equipment, unmet health needs, and ineffective central coordination. Patients are also facing economic limitations that lead to difficulties in using healthcare services. The multi-factorial problem of in-hospital EMS overcrowding is also evident and has been linked with potentially poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the ongoing refugee crisis challenges the national EMS. Adoption of a triage scale, expansion of the primary care network, and an effective primary hospital continuum of care are urgently needed in Greece to provide comprehensive, culturally competent, and high-quality health care.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support for cardiogenic shock: influence of concomitant intra-aortic balloon counterpulsationaEuro
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) during extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for cardiogenic shock may improve pulsatility and coronary perfusion, thereby promoting recovery of cardiac function. However, the risks and benefits of IABP during ECLS in real clinical settings have not been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the effect of IABP on the early outcome of ECLS for cardiogenic shock.
   We evaluated 253 adult patients (aged 58.8 +/- 15.3 [mean +/- standard deviation] years, 154 males) undergoing ECLS for cardiogenic shock from January 2005 to August 2012. Of them, 60 patients underwent concomitant IABP (IABP group) and 193 underwent ECLS only (control group). In-hospital outcomes were compared using the inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores.
   The indications for ECLS were low cardiac output after cardiac surgery in 118 patients (46.6%), heart failure in 71 (28.1%), acute myocardial infarction in 49 (19.4%) and others in 15 (5.9%). Successful ECLS weaning rate was significantly higher in the IABP group than in the control group (61.7 vs 42.0%, P = 0.008); however, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two groups (68.6 vs 72.0%, P = 0.58). After adjustment for propensity of treatment assignment conditional on baseline characteristics, the IABP group showed a decreased risk of weaning failure (odds ratio [OR] 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.92, P = 0.024) but with a similar risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.46-1.60; P = 0.62) compared with the control group.
   The use of IABP during ECLS increased a successful ECLS weaning rate, but was not translated into improved survival. Studies on larger populations may verify the survival effect of IABP during ECLS.

TI  - Early fluid therapy trajectories in acute pancreatitis: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Background Individualized management of early fluid therapy in acute pancreatitis (AP) remains challenging. Traditional studies primarily focus on static fluid balance, overlooking the heterogeneity of dynamic trajectories. Methods Based on a single-center retrospective cohort, 3,142 AP patients admitted within 72 h of onset were included. Daily fluid therapy-to-body weight ratio (FWR) and CumFWR (trapezoidal AUC) were calculated. Latent Class Growth Modeling (LCGM) identified dynamic FWR trajectories within 72 h. Multivariate Cox regression analyzed the relationship between FWR and in-hospital mortality risk. Three-dimensional fitted surface plot analysis evaluated interactions between CumFWR and hematocrit. Results LCGM successfully identified five distinct dynamic fluid therapy trajectories within 72 h, showing significant clinical differences: Low Stable Group (LSG1, n = 229, 7.3%), Low-Moderate Sustained Group (LMSG2, n = 340, 10.8%), Moderate Stable Group (MSG3, n = 2073, 66.0%), Moderate-High Fluctuating Group (MHFG4, n = 231, 7.4%), and High Sustained Group (HSG5, n = 269, 8.6%). Multivariate Cox regression revealed significantly increased in-hospital mortality risk compared to MSG3 for both MHFG4 (adjusted HR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.78) and HSG5 (adjusted HR = 2.91, 95%CI 1.77-4.79). Furthermore, each 1 standard deviation increase in CumFWR was associated with a 47% increased mortality risk (HR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.26-1.72). Three-dimensional fitted surface plot demonstrated high mortality risk between high CumFWR and abnormal hematocrit (low/high HCT), particularly prominent in the HSG5 group (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study reveals five distinct dynamic trajectory patterns of early fluid therapy in AP. High-load sustained or fluctuating therapy significantly increases mortality risk. Dynamic monitoring of HCT (within a 35-44% safety window) and therapy trajectories offers a potential strategy to optimize fluid management.

TI  - Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality After Rapid Response Team Calls in a 274 Hospital Nationwide Sample
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Despite wide adoption of rapid response teams across the United States, predictors of in-hospital mortality for patients receiving rapid response team calls are poorly characterized. Identification of patients at high risk of death during hospitalization could improve triage to intensive care units and prompt timely reevaluations of goals of care. We sought to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients who are subjects of rapid response team calls and to develop and validate a predictive model for death after rapid response team call.
   Design: Analysis of data from the national Get with the Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team event registry.
   Setting: Two-hundred seventy four hospitals participating in Get with the Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team from June 2005 to February 2015.
   Patients: 282,710 hospitalized adults on surgical or medical wards who were subjects of a rapid response team call.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was death during hospitalization; candidate predictors included patient demographic- and event-level characteristics. Patients who died after rapid response team were older (median age 72 vs 66 yr), were more likely to be admitted for noncardiac medical illness (70% vs 58%), and had greater median length of stay prior to rapid response team (81 vs 47hr) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The prediction model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.78-0.79), with systolic blood pressure, time since admission, and respiratory rate being the most important variables.
   Conclusions: Patients who die following rapid response team calls differ significantly from surviving peers. Recognition of these factors could improve postrapid response team triage decisions and prompt timely goals of care discussions.

TI  - Risk Adjustment Measures and Outcome Measures for Prehospital Trauma Research: Recommendations from the Emergency Medical Services Outcomes Project (EMSOP)
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: The objectives were to conduct a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature for risk adjustment measures (RAMs) and outcome measures (OMs) for prehospital trauma research and to use a structured expert panel process to recommend measures for use in future emergency medical services (EMS) trauma outcomes research.
   Methods: A systematic literature search and review was performed identifying the published studies evaluating RAMs and OMs for prehospital injury research. An explicit structured review of all articles pertaining to each measure was conducted using the previously established methodology developed by the Canadian Physiotherapy Association ("Physical Rehabilitation Outcome Measures").
   Results: Among the 4,885 articles reviewed, 96 RAMs and/or OMs were identified from the existing literature (January 1958 to February 2010). Only one measure, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), currently meets Level 1 quality of evidence status and a Category 1 (strong) recommendation for use in EMS trauma research. Twelve RAMs or OMs received Category 2 status (promising, but not sufficient current evidence to strongly recommend), including the motor component of GCS, simplified motor score (SMS), the simplified verbal score (SVS), the revised trauma score (RTS), the prehospital index (PHI), EMS provider judgment, the revised trauma index (RTI), the rapid acute physiology score (RAPS), the rapid emergency medicine score (REMS), the field trauma triage (FTT), the pediatric triage rule, and the out-of-hospital decision rule for pediatrics.
   Conclusions: Using a previously published process, a structured literature review, and consensus expert panel opinion, only the GCS can currently be firmly recommended as a specific RAM or OM for prehospital trauma research (along with core measures that have already been established and published). This effort highlights the paucity of reliable, validated RAMs and OMs currently available for outcomes research in the prehospital setting and hopefully will encourage additional, methodologically sound evaluations of the promising, Category 2 RAMs and OMs, as well as the development of new measures.

TI  - Effects of the application of a checklist during trauma resuscitations on ATLS adherence, team performance, and patient-related outcomes: a systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Purpose In this systematic literature review, the effects of the application of a checklist during in hospital resuscitation of trauma patients on adherence to the ATLS guidelines, trauma team performance, and patient-related outcomes were integrated. Methods A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses checklist. The search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane inception till January 2019. Randomized controlled- or controlled before-and-after study design were included. All other forms of observational study designs, reviews, case series or case reports, animal studies, and simulation studies were excluded. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool was applied to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results Three of the 625 identified articles were included, which all used a before-and-after study design. Two studies showed that Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)-related tasks are significantly more frequently performed when a checklist was applied during resuscitation. [14 of 30 tasks (p < 0.05), respectively, 18 of 19 tasks (p < 0.05)]. One study showed that time to task completion (- 9 s, 95% CI = - 13.8 to - 4.8 s) and workflow improved, which was analyzed as model fitness (0.90 vs 0.96; p < 0.001); conformance frequency (26.1% vs 77.6%; p < 0.001); and frequency of unique workflow traces (31.7% vs 19.1%; p = 0.005). One study showed that the incidence of pneumonia was higher in the group where a checklist was applied [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.69, 95% Confidence Interval (CI 1.03-2.80)]. No difference was found for nine other assessed complications or missed injuries. Reduced mortality rates were found in the most severely injured patient group (Injury Severity score > 25, aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.89). Conclusions The application of a checklist may improve ATLS adherence and workflow during trauma resuscitation. Current literature is insufficient to truly define the effect of the application of a checklist during trauma resuscitation on patient-related outcomes, although one study showed promising results as an improved chance of survival for the most severely injured patients was found.

TI  - Survival following pre-hospital arrest with on-scene thoracotomy for a stabbed heart
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - A 34-year-old man was slabbed in the heart with the loss of all signs of life at the site of the incident. A resuscitative thoracotomy was performed at the roadside rather than transport a lifeless patient to hospital. Thoracotomy revealed asystole, pericardial tamponade and a right ventricular stab wound. Following further roadside resuscitation and subsequent air transport, and 30 min after loss of signs of life the patient was defibrillated in hospital and regained sinus rhythm. He recovered and was discharged at 25 days with normal neurology and mentation. Pre-hospital thoracotomy on a patient who had lost signs of life following a penetrating chest wound is an alternative to a scoop and run policy. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Effects of nitroglycerin on sublingual microcirculatory blood flow in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock after a strict resuscitation protocol: A double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Microcirculatory alterations have been associated with morbidity and mortality in human sepsis. Such alterations occur despite pressure-guided resuscitation. Earlier data suggested that impaired microcirculatory blood flow could be corrected with intravenous nitroglycerin in these patients. We tested this concept after fulfillment of preset systemic hemodynamic resuscitation end points in the early phase of sepsis.
   Design: Prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.
   Setting: Closed-format 22-bed mixed intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital.
   Patients: Patients >= 18 yrs with sepsis, according to international criteria, and at least one early sign of organ dysfunction, as the principal reason for intensive care unit admission, were eligible for enrollment.
   Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) after fulfillment of protocol-driven resuscitation end points. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00493415.
   Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcome was sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small vessels, as assessed by side-stream dark field imaging. After protocolized resuscitation, we observed recruitment of sublingual microcirculation in both groups, as indicated by a significant improvement in the microcirculatory flow index after 24 hrs, in comparison to baseline. However, no difference in the sublingual microvascular flow index was observed between groups. The median microvascular flow index in sublingual small-sized vessels was 2.71 (1.85-3) in the nitroglycerin group and 2.71 (1.27-3), p = .80, in the placebo group. In medium-sized vessels, the respective values were 3 (2.75-3) vs. 2.86 (2.19-3), p = .21, and in large-sized vessels, 3 (3-3) vs. 3 (2.89-3), p = .06. In-hospital mortality, as a secondary outcome, was 34.3% in the nitroglycerin group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p = .09.
   Conclusions: In the context of a strict resuscitation protocol, based upon fulfillment of systemic hemodynamic end points in patients with early-phase severe sepsis or septic shock, we conclude that intravenous nitroglycerin does not promote sublingual microcirculatory blood flow.

TI  - Comparison of avalanche survival patterns in Canada and Switzerland
T2  - CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Current recommendations for rescue and resuscitation of people buried in avalanches are based on Swiss avalanche survival data. We analyzed Canadian survival patterns and compared them with those from Switzerland.
   Methods: We extracted relevant data for survivors and nonsurvivors of complete avalanche burials from Oct. 1, 1980, to Sept. 30, 2005, from Canadian and Swiss databases. We calculated survival curves for Canada with and without trauma-related deaths as well as for different outdoor activities and snow climates. We compared these curves with the Swiss survival curve.
   Results: A total of 301 people in the Canadian database and 946 in the Swiss database met the inclusion criteria. The overall proportion of people who survived did not differ significantly between the two countries (46.2% [139/301] v. 46.9% [444/946]; p = 0.87). Significant differences were ob served between the overall survival curves for the two countries (p = 0.001): compared with the Swiss curve, the Canadian curve showed a quicker drop at the early stages of burial and poorer survival associated with prolonged burial. The probability of survival fell quicker with trauma-related deaths and in denser snow climates. Poorer survival probabilities in the Canadian sample were offset by significantly quicker extrication (median duration of burial 18 minutes v. 35 minutes in the Swiss sample; p < 0.001).
   Interpretation: Observed differences in avalanche survival curves between the Canadian and Swiss samples were associated with the prevalence of trauma and differences in snow climate. Although avoidance of avalanches remains paramount for survival, the earlier onset of asphyxia, especially in maritime snow climates, emphasizes the importance of prompt extrication, ideally within 10 minutes. Protective devices against trauma and better clinical skills in organized rescue may further improve survival.

TI  - Haemodynamic management of septic shock
T2  - BURNS & TRAUMA
AB  - Septic shock is a significant challenge in the management of patients with burns and traumatic injuries when complicated by infection, necessitating prompt and effective haemodynamic support. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current strategies for vasopressor and fluid management in septic shock, with the aim to optimize patient outcomes. With regard to vasopressor management, we elaborate on the pharmacologic profiles and clinical applications of catecholamines, vasopressin derivatives, angiotensin II, and other vasoactive agents. Noradrenaline remains central to septic shock management. The addition of vasopressin, when sequentially added to noradrenaline, offers a non-catecholaminergic vasoactive effect with some clinical benefits and risks of adverse effects. Emerging agents such as angiotensin II and hydroxocobalamin are highlighted for their roles in catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Next, for fluid management, crystalloids are currently preferred for initial resuscitation, with balanced crystalloids showing benefits over saline. The application of albumin in septic shock warrants further research. High-quality evidence does not support large-volume fluid resuscitation, and an individualized strategy based on haemodynamic parameters, including lactate clearance and capillary refill time, is recommended. The existing knowledge suggests that early vasopressor initiation, particularly noradrenaline, may be critical in cases where fluid resuscitation takes inadequate effect. Management of refractory septic shock remains challenging, with novel agents like angiotensin II and methylene blue showing potential in recent studies. In conclusion, Further research is needed to optimize haemodynamic management of septic shock, particularly in developing novel vasopressor usage and fluid management approaches.

TI  - Role of Biochemical Markers in Detection of Myocardial Infarction
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Introduction: Acute myocardial infarction causes significant mortality and morbidity. Timely conclusion permits clinicians to risk stratify their patients and select suitable treatment. Biomarkers have been utilized to help with timely decision, whereas an expanding number of novel markers have been recognized to predict result taking after an acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary disorder.
   This may encourage tailoring of appropriate treatment to high-risk patients. This survey focuses on an assortment of promising biomarkers which give symptomatic and prognostic data.
   Objective: To compare the early demonstrative efficiency of the cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) level with that of the cardiac troponin T (cTn-T) level, as well as the creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and myoglobin levels, for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients without an initially diagnostic ECG presenting to the Emergency department within 24 hours of the onset of their symptoms.
   Material and Methods
   Study design: Prospective Observational Cohort
   Settings: Punjab Institute of Cardiology
   Duration: Six months i.e. 1st January 2020 to 30th June 2020
   Data Collection procedure: A planned, observational, cohort study was performed including chest pain patients admitted to territory care hospital. Members were sequential consenting through Emergency department with chest pain and age more than 30 years. Exclusion included having symptoms >24 hours, failure to total information collection, receipt of CPR, and ST-segment elevation on the starting ECG. Estimations included levels of Trop-I, Trop-T, CK, CK-MB, and myoglobin at the time of introduction and 1, 2, 6, and 12-24 hours after presentation as well as showing ECG and clinical follow-up. The collected data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23.
   Results: 140 included for study out of the 200 patients, 21 (14%) were analyzed as having acute myocardial infarction after diagnostic ECG testing. The sensitivities of all 5 biochemical markers for acute myocardial infarction were poor at the time of emergency department induction. The sensitivity of Trop-T was essentially superior to that of Trop-I over the starting 2 hours (3.2-33.1), but both markers' sensitivities were low (<60%) during this time outline. The Trop-I was significantly more particular for acute myocardial infarction than was the Trop-T, but not essentially better than CK-MB or myoglobin. Likelihood proportion analysis appeared that the biochemical markers with the most elevated positive ratios for acute myocardial infarction amid the primary 2 hours taking after emergency department admission were myoglobin and CK-MB. From 6 through 24 hours, the positive probability proportions for Trop I, CK-MB, and myoglobin were predominant to those of CK and Trop-T.
   Conclusion: Trop-I, CK-MB, and myoglobin are essentially more particular for acute myocardial infarction than are CK and Trop-T. Myoglobin is the biochemical marker having the most elevated combination of sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value for acute myocardial infarction inside 2 hours of emergency department induction. Not one or the other Trop-I nor Trop-T offers significant advantages over myoglobin and CK-MB within the early less than 2 hours starting screening for acute myocardial infarction. The cardiac troponins are of advantage in recognizing acute myocardial infarction greater than 6 hours after presentation.

TI  - The biopsychosocial spiritual model applied to the treatment of women with breast cancer, through RIME intervention (relaxation, mental images, spirituality)
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - This postdoctoral study on the application of the RIME intervention in women that had undergone mastectomy and were in treatment, aimed to promote psychospiritual and social transformations to improve the quality of life, self-esteem and hope. A total of 28 women participated and were randomized into two groups. Brief Psychotherapy (PB) (average of six sessions) was administered in the Control Group, and RIME (three sessions) and BP (average of five sessions) were applied in the RIME Group. The quantitative results indicated a significant improvement (38.3%) in the Perception of Quality of Life after RIME according to the WHOQOL, compared both to the BP of the Control Group (12.5%), and the BP of the RIME Group (16.2%). There was a significant improvement in Self-esteem (Rosenberg) after RIME (14.6%) compared to the BP of the Control Group (worsened 35.9%), and the BP of the RIME Group (8.3%). The improvement in well-being, considering the focus worked on (Visual Analog Scale), was significant in the RIME Group (bad to good), as well as in the Control Group (unpleasant to good). The qualitative results indicated that RIME promotes creative transformations in the intrapsychic and interpersonal dimensions, so that new meanings and/or new attitudes emerge into the consciousness. It was observed that RIME has more strength of psychic structure, ego strengthening and provides a faster transformation that BP, therefore it can be indicated for crisis treatment in the hospital environment.

TI  - American College of Surgeons' Committee on Trauma Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Program: Maximal Impact in a Mature Trauma Center
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 69th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - Background: To examine the impact of an ongoing comprehensive performance improvement and patient safety (PIPS) program implemented in 2005 on mortality outcomes for trauma patients at an established American College of Surgeons (ACS)-verified Level I Trauma Center.
   Methods: The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and intensive care unit admissions were used as stratifying variables to examine outcomes over a 5-year period (2004-2008). Institution mortality rates were compared with the National Trauma Data Bank mortality rates stratified by ISS score. Enhancements to our comprehensive PIPS program included revision of trauma activation criteria, development of standardized protocols for initial resuscitation, massive transfusion, avoidance of over-resuscitation, tourniquet use, pelvic fracture management, emphasis on timely angiographic and surgical intervention, prompt spine clearance, reduction in time to computed tomography imaging, reduced dwell time in emergency department, evidence-based traumatic brain injury management, and multidisciplinary efforts to reduce healthcare-associated infections.
   Results: In 2004 (baseline data), the in-hospital mortality rate for the most severely injured trauma patients (ISS >24) at our trauma center was 30%, consistent with the reported mortality rate from the National Trauma Data Bank for patients with this severity of injury. Over 5 years, our mortality rate decreased significantly for severely injured patients with an ISS >24, from 30.1% (2004) to 18.3% (2008), representing a 12% absolute reduction in mortality (p = 0.011). During the same 5-year time period, the proportion of elderly patients (age >65 years) cared for at our trauma center increased from 23.5% in 2004 to 30.6% in 2008 (p = 0.0002). Class I trauma activations increased significantly from 5.5% in 2004 to 15.5% in 2008 based on our reclassification. A greater percentage of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (25.8% in 2004 to 37.3% in 2007 and 30.4% in 2008). No difference was identified in the rate of blunt (95%) or penetrating (5%) mechanism of injury in our patients over this time period. Trauma Quality Improvement Program confirmed improved trauma outcomes with observed-to-expected ratio and 95% confidence intervals of 0.64 (0.42-0.86) for all patients, 0.54 (0.15-0.91) for blunt single-system patients, and 0.78 (0.51-1.06) for blunt multisystem patients.
   Conclusion: Implementation of a multifaceted trauma PIPS program aimed at improving trauma care significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in a mature ACS Level I trauma center. Optimal care of the injured patient requires uncompromising commitment to PIPS.

TI  - LATE SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATHS IN HOSPITALIZED INFANTS WITH BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISEASES OF CHILDREN
AB  - To determine the relative contribution of sudden death as a cause of late inpatient mortality in newborns after prolonged mechanical ventilation, we reviewed the charts of 348 patients who received ventilation assistance and who were admitted to the neonatal intensivecare unit during a 26-month period. The overall mortality rate for these patients was 25% with 88% (77/88) of these deaths occurring within 30 days of birth. Eleven infants died after more than 60 days of mechanical ventilation.  Seven of these late deaths were sudden, unexpected in hospital deaths. Sudden deaths occurred at a mean (uncorrected) age of 12 months (range, 4 to 27 months), during periods, when infants appeared to be stable or clincially improving, were unrelated to recent respiratory exacerbations, and occurred despite prompt resuscitative efforts. Four infants still required mechanical ventilation, and 4 had tracheostomies at the time of death. All of the infants had chronic hypercarbia (> 50 mm Hg) and  an elevated serum bicarbonate level (> 30 mmol/L), but not hyponatremia, hypochloremia (< 80 mmol/L) or alkalemia. Left and right ventricular hypertrophy, multiple drug therapy, recurrent cyanotic episodes, and frequent unexplained fevers were common. In comparison with 17 bronchopulonary dysplasia survivors who required longer than 60 days of ventilation therapy, the late deaths group more frequently had left ventricular hypertrophy and received prolonged combination theophylline anhydrous and .beta.-adrenergic agonist therapy. We report that sudden death can occur in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia despite in-hospital cardiopulmonary monitoring and the rapid institution of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and is a significant cause of late mortality in infants who receive ventilation therapy for longer than 2 mos.

TI  - The Head Injury Transportation Straight to Neurosurgery (HITS-NS) randomised trial: a feasibility study
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: Reconfiguration of trauma services, with direct transport of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to neuroscience centres (NCs), bypassing non-specialist acute hospitals (NSAHs), could potentially improve outcomes. However, delays in stabilisation of airway, breathing and circulation (ABC) and the difficulties in reliably identifying TBI at scene may make this practice deleterious compared with selective secondary transfer from nearest NSAH to NC. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance and systematic reviews suggested equipoise and poor-quality evidence - with regard to 'early neurosurgery' in this cohort - which we sought to address.
   Methods: Pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of bypass to NC conducted in two ambulance services with the ambulance station (n = 74) as unit of cluster [Lancashire/Cumbria in the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) and the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS)]. Adult patients with signs of isolated TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 13 in NWAS, GCS score of < 14 in NEAS] and stable ABC, injured nearest to a NSAH were transported either to that hospital (control clusters) or bypassed to the nearest NC (intervention clusters). Primary outcomes: recruitment rate, protocol compliance, selection bias as a result of non-compliance, accuracy of paramedic TBI identification (overtriage of study inclusion criteria) and pathway acceptability to patients, families and staff. 'Open-label' secondary outcomes: 30-day mortality, 6-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions.
   Results: Overall, 56 clusters recruited 293 (169 intervention, 124 control) patients in 12 months, demonstrating cluster randomised pre-hospital trials as viable for heath service evaluations. Overall compliance was 62%, but 90% was achieved in the control arm and when face-to-face paramedic training was possible. Non-compliance appeared to be driven by proximity of the nearest hospital and perceptions of injury severity and so occurred more frequently in the intervention arm, in which the perceived time to the NC was greater and severity of injury was lower. Fewer than 25% of recruited patients had TBI on computed tomography scan (n = 70), with 7% (n = 20) requiring neurosurgery (craniotomy, craniectomy or intracranial pressure monitoring) but a further 18 requiring admission to an intensive care unit. An intention-to-treat analysis revealed the two trial arms to be equivalent in terms of age, GCS and severity of injury. No significant 30-day mortality differences were found (8.8% vs. 9.1/%; p > 0.05) in the 273 (159/113) patients with data available. There were no apparent differences in staff and patient preferences for either pathway, with satisfaction high with both. Very low responses to invitations to consent for follow-up in the large number of mild head injury-enrolled patients meant that only 20% of patients had 6-month outcomes. The trial-based economic evaluation could not focus on early neurosurgery because of these low numbers but instead investigated the comparative cost-effectiveness of bypass compared with selective secondary transfer for eligible patients at the scene of injury.
   Conclusions: Current NHS England practice of bypassing patients with suspected TBI to neuroscience centres gives overtriage ratios of 13 : 1 for neurosurgery and 4 : 1 for TBI. This important finding makes studying the impact of bypass to facilitate early neurosurgery not plausible using this study design. Future research should explore an efficient comparative effectiveness design for evaluating 'early neurosurgery through bypass' and address the challenge of reliable TBI diagnosis at the scene of injury.

TI  - Management of multiple burn casualties in a high volume ED without a verified burn unit
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of triage, treatment, and transfer interventions on multiple burn casualties managed in a high volume ED that does not have a verified in-hospital burn unit. The charts of 11 male patients injured in a 1999 foundry explosion and brought to Baystate Medical Center (BMC), a level I trauma center, were reviewed. All patients sustained deep partial and full thickness burns. The injury severity score (ISS) ranged from 9 to 75. Five patients had total body surface area (TBSA) burns of 10% to 50% and 6 patients had TBSA burns of 70% to 95%. Transfer times from the scene to BMC ranged from less than 5 minutes to 22 minutes. All 11 were initially triaged, resuscitated, and evaluated at BMC. Of the 9 patients transferred to verified burn units, 8 were intubated, 6 of 6 had negative abdominal ultrasounds, 4 had undergone escharatomies, and 1 had undergone bronchoscopy before transfer. Nine critically injured burn patients with ISS of 9 to 75 were transferred from BMC to verified burn units. For 8 of these patients, the average time from triage, evaluation, and treatment to transfer was 2 hours. The ninth patient was initially admitted overnight then promptly transferred after re-evaluation of his hand burns indicated a need for more specialized care. Two of 9 transferred patients, both with ISS of 75 died. Although 7 other patients had prolonged and complex courses, none of their subsequent complications were referable to missed injuries from this transferring facility. The resources and expertise of a high volume ED without an in-hospital burn unit can be effectively used in the initial resuscitation and treatment of multiple burn casualties. Coordinated responses among emergency medicine, trauma, anesthesia, and nursing personnel are instrumental to the rapid triage, resuscitation, and treatment of critically injured burn patients. Future disaster planning should incorporate a clearly demarcated, ED command center led by an easily identifiable "captain of the ship," as well as more accurate patient identification systems and improved communications with family members.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR THERAPY ON HEALTH-CARE SYSTEMS
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
CP  - Symposium on Electrical Device Therapy for Cardiac Arrhythmias: New Concepts, Problems, and Alternatives
AB  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are now widely used for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death and are being offered as a primary preventive therapy. This technology has potential for significant fiscal impact on health care budgets. Technologic innovation will result in more complex devices that are more effective and better accepted by patients and physicians. The clinical impact of these devices will be predicated, in part, by absolute survival benefits but also by their relative advantages over alternative therapies in terms of survival, safety, morbidity, quality of life, and cost. The impact on public health will depend on the effectiveness of screening methods for identification of populations likely to benefit from primary prevention. Risk stratification algorithms are now being tested in several ongoing clinical trials. Dilution of benefit by competing illnesses may occur to different extents in individual patient populations. The economic impact is predicated on the future cost of ICD systems, limitation of hospitalization costs associated with this therapy, and accurate prospective stratification in primary prevention populations. Cost efficacy analyses and quality of life assessment in ongoing and future clinical trials are essential to the development of this therapy and its diffusion into different health care systems. Achievement of clinical benefits, functional independence, and a return to gainful employment by patients will be important determinants of the support lent by health care systems to the dissemination of this therapy.

TI  - Effect of a quality improvement program on compliance to the sepsis bundle in non-ICU patients: a multicenter prospective before and after cohort study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Sepsis and septic shock are major challenges and economic burdens to healthcare, impacting millions of people globally and representing significant causes of mortality. Recently, a large number of quality improvement programs focused on sepsis resuscitation bundles have been instituted worldwide. These educational initiatives have been shown to be associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-faceted quality implementing program (QIP) on the compliance of a "simplified 1-h bundle" (Sepsis 6) and hospital mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock patients out of the intensive care unit (ICU).
   Methods: Emergency departments (EDs) and medical wards (MWs) of 12 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Lombardy region (Northern Italy) were involved in a multi-faceted QIP, which included educational and organizational interventions. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock according to the Sepsis-2 criteria were enrolled in two different periods: from May 2011 to November 2011 (before-QIP cohort) and from August 2012 to June 2013 (after-QIP cohort).
   Measurements and main results: The effect of QIP on bundle compliance and hospital mortality was evaluated in a before-after analysis. We enrolled 467 patients in the before-QIP group and 656 in the after-QIP group. At the time of enrollment, septic shock was diagnosed in 50% of patients, similarly between the two periods. In the after-QIP group, we observed increased compliance to the "simplified rapid (1 h) intervention bundle" (the Sepsis 6 bundle - S6) at three time-points evaluated (1 h, 13.7 to 18.7%, p = 0.018, 3 h, 37.1 to 48.0%, p = 0.013, overall study period, 46.2 to 57.9%, p < 0.001). We then analyzed compliance with S6 and hospital mortality in the before- and after-QIP periods, stratifying the two patients' cohorts by admission characteristics. Adherence to the S6 bundle was increased in patients with severe sepsis in the absence of shock, in patients with serum lactate <4.0 mmol/L, and in patients with hypotension at the time of enrollment, regardless of the type of admission (from EDs or MWs). Subsequently, in an observational analysis, we also investigated the relation between bundle compliance and hospital mortality by logistic regression. In the after-QIP cohort, we observed a lower in-hospital mortality than that observed in the before-QIP cohort. This finding was reported in subgroups where a higher adherence to the S6 bundle in the after-QIP period was found. After adjustment for confounders, the QIP appeared to be independently associated with a significant improvement in hospital mortality. Among the single S6 procedures applied within the first hour of sepsis diagnosis, compliance with blood culture and antibiotic therapy appeared significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality.
   Conclusion: A multi-faceted QIP aimed at promoting an early simplified bundle of care for the management of septic patients out of the ICU was associated with improved compliance with sepsis bundles and lower in-hospital mortality.

The speed of induction appears to be a key factor in determining its efficacy. However, even when the fastest currently available cooling techniques are used, reaching target temperatures takes at least 2 hrs and usually longer. We hypothesized that infusion of refrigerated fluids could be a safe accessory method to increase cooling speed.
   Design: Prospective intervention study.
   Setting: University teaching hospital.
   Patients: One hundred thirty-four patients with various types of neurologic injury (postanoxic encephalopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury).
   Measurements and Main Results: Hypothermia was induced in 134 patients with various types of neurologic injury, by means ice-water cooling blankets and infusion of refrigerated (4 degrees C) saline (110 patients) or saline and colloids (24 patients). An average volume of 2340 +/- 890 mL of refrigerated fluids was infused in 50 mins. Core temperatures decreased from 36.9 +/- 1.9 degrees C to 34.6 +/- 1.5 degrees C at t = 30 mins and to 32.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C at t = 60 mins (target temperature: 32 degrees C-33 degrees C). Monitoring of blood pressure, heart rhythm, central venous pressure, blood gasses, electrolyte and glucose levels, and platelet and white blood cell count revealed no additional adverse effects. Mean arterial pressure increased by 15 mm Hg, with larger increases in blood pressure occurring in hemodynamically unstable patients. No patient developed pulmonary edema.
   Conclusions. Induction of hypothermia by means of cold-fluid infusion combined with ice-water cooling blankets is safe, efficacious, and quick. Because the speed of cooling is important to increase its protective effects, we recommend that cold-fluid infusion be used in all patients treated with induced hypothermia. This should be combined with another method to safely and accurately maintain hypothermia once target temperatures have been reached.

TI  - Cardioprotection by very mild hypothermia in mice
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY
AB  - Target temperature management is recommended in post-resuscitation care. Additionally, hypothermia is a promising option in adjunctive therapy of acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, first in men data are contradicting. There are still many open questions to identify the optimal regimen and target temperature. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of very mild hypothermia on infarct size (IS) in mice. Mice underwent cardiac ischemia by temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery under conditions of very mild hypothermia (34-36 degrees C). Hypothermia was reached within the first 5 minutes of ischemia (temperature: 34.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 36.8 +/- 1.1., P=0.035). Very mild hypothermia reduced IS in mice undergoing 30 minutes ischemia [IS/area at risk (AAR): 45 +/- 12% vs. 22 +/- 4%, P=0.018] as well as mice undergoing 60 minutes ischemia [IS/AAR: 67 +/- 7% vs. 28 +/- 2%, P=0.0003]. Very mild hypothermia reduces IS. This new approach in adjunctive therapy of patients with acute MI should be investigated in clinical trials.

TI  - Prehospital antibiotics and intravenous fluids for patients with sepsis: protocol for a 2x2 factorial randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Prompt recognition and treatment of patients with sepsis improve survival. Patients transported to hospital with sepsis often do not receive treatment until they are assessed in emergency departments. Initiation of treatments by paramedics at the point of first contact may improve outcomes for these patients. Methods and analysis The study design involves two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted using a 2x2 factorial design comparing use of (1) early intramuscular ceftriaxone versus placebo and (2) an early liberal intravenous fluid strategy (up to 2 L normal saline) versus usual care resuscitation guided by paramedic medical directives. Patients who are >= 18 years of age will be eligible for inclusion if they have sepsis, defined as (1) paramedic suspicion of infection, (2) fever (temperature >= 38.0 degrees C measured by paramedic or history of fever during the previous 24 hours), and (3) hypotension: SBP <100 mm Hg. The primary outcome is mortality prior to hospital discharge or within 90 days of admission. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at 90 days after enrolment; organ dysfunction during first 24 hours (mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, dialysis) and hospitalisation (mechanical ventilation; dialysis); rates and duration of hospital admission; rates of ICU admission during index hospitalisation; discharge destination; proportion of patients with positive blood cultures obtained in hospital (first 24 hours); microbiological profile including distribution of microorganism species and resistant organisms; proportion of patients receiving additional antibiotics within 6 hours and within 24 hours of hospital admission; frequency distribution of first antibiotics (if any) delivered within 24 hours of hospital arrival; mean time to antibiotics delivered within 24 hours of hospital arrival (if any); proportion of patients receiving fluid bolus (>250 mL) within 24 hours of hospital arrival; total amount of crystalloid infused during transport and first 24 hours of hospitalisation; and proportion of enrolled patients not suspected to have sepsis or infection by emergency department physicians. Safety outcomes include the proportion of patients with pulmonary oedema during transport to hospital and on initial chest X-ray and the proportion of patients with anaphylaxis or suspected allergic reactions to study medication. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved through Clinical Trials Ontario's streamlined ethics review process (board of record, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre). It will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulatory requirements. The final results will be disseminated to participating paramedic services through educational materials, presentations and interactive training. We anticipate our trial will achieve wide dissemination through publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presentation at international conferences targeting the fields of prehospital and emergency medicine, resuscitation and critical care.

TI  - Suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (ST2) is a promising biomarker in heart transplantation
T2  - CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Background To evaluate the association between donors' and recipients' serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2) and recipients' outcome after heart transplantation (HT). Methods Blood samples were collected in 50 heart donors before organ procurement and in 50 recipients before HT (D0), a week after HT (D7) and at every first year's endomyocardial biopsy (EMB); sST2 levels were evaluated by ELISA. Results Donors who sustained a cardiac arrest, had significantly higher sST2 levels. Recipients on national high emergency waiting list had significantly higher preoperative sST2 levels compared to recipients who did not. Recipients with postoperative sepsis or continuous renal replacement therapy had significantly higher sST2 levels at D7. Recipients who needed a postoperative ECMO for allograft dysfunction had significantly higher sST2 levels in their corresponding donors. Recipients who died during the hospitalization after the transplantation had significantly higher sST2 levels at D7 compared to recipients who did not. No difference was observed in sST2 levels in recipients who had mild allograft rejection and recipient who did not. Conclusions Higher sST2 levels in donors are associated to allograft dysfunction requiring ECMO in recipients; higher postoperative sST2 levels in recipients are associated with in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Impact of structured advance care planning program on patients' wish items and healthcare utilization
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Structured advance care planning (ACP) program is an important service in the end-of-life care for patients with advanced medical illness. We pioneered a structured and coordinated ACP program for patients with advanced malignancies and end-stage organ failure in Hong Kong. This study investigated the impact of a structured ACP program on the concordance rate for patients' final wishes, patient/family satisfaction, and the number of acute admissions (AA) and length of stay (LOS) in hospital.
   Methods: Patients with advanced malignancy or end-stage organ failure who were able to complete ACP forms during the current admission to medical units were recruited. Patients who could not complete ACP forms or < 18 years of age were excluded. The ACP program comprised the following components: (I) baseline education (workshop/role play) in ACP sessions for linked nurses of different medical units; (II) structured ACP discussions with recruited patients and their proxies during admission, after any change in clinical status, and also at monthly intervals; (III) formal structured review of patients' goals at regular team meetings; (IV) "flagging" of advance directive (AD) in hospital computer system and (V) feedback to linked nurse on the congruence of care. Mentally competent patients who did not receive ACP and matched for disease and demographics were selected as controls in a 1:2.5 ratio.
   Results: Two hundred forty-three patients were included for analysis between August 2016 and July 2017, of which 69 patients joined the ACP program and 174 of them did not. Two hundred and one patients (83%) had advanced cancer. All had done do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation (DNACPR) order in the ACP group. The concordance rates for patients' wishes on quality of life, end-of-life and funeral arrangements were 95%, 100% and 100% respectively. Over 70% of patients and their families (N=10) showed satisfaction with the program. The ACP group also had lower mean AA and shorter LOS (0.78 +/- 0.23 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.8 episode/patient, 4.6 +/- 1.7 vs. 7.5 +/- 2.5 days, P=0.037 and P=0.023 respectively) in the last 3 months of life compared with the non-ACP group.
   Conclusions: This ACP program achieved high concordance rate for patients' wish items and reduced healthcare utilization.

TI  - ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM - IS IT FEASIBLE, BENEFICIAL, AND COST-EFFECTIVE
T2  - ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY-A JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND AND ALLIED TECHNIQUES
AB  - Echocardiography in the emergency room presents exciting practice possibilities that cart facilitate prompt and reliable diagnostic evaluations in patients with suspected cardiovascular emergencies. Echocardiography has the diagnostic potentials to evaluate the entire spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities short of delineating coronary anatomy, and evaluation of the conduction system. By reliably assessing the global and regional function, visualizing the cardiovascular structures from multiple tomographic planes, and quantitating hemodynamic abnormalities, echocardiography should be able to assist emergency room physician's evaluation. and triage of the patients with chest pain syndrome, unexplained dyspnea, hypotension, shock chest trauma, and cardiac arrest, whereby hopefully minimizing the unnecessary admission to the hospital and facilitating inhospital evaluation of the admitted patients with echocardiographic information. However, the optimal echocardiography practice in the emergency room requires well trained sonongraphers and echocardiographers who can respond to the clinical needs at anytime. Whether an emergency room physician can perform and interpret echocardiographic examinations satisfactorily will depend on his/her level of training and continuing education in this area. Currently, there is no established guideline for performing echocardiography in the emergency room. Further clinical investigations are necessary to define the most optimal and economical utilization of this versatile imaging and hemodynamic diagnostic modality in the emergency room.

TI  - Pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma previously treated with lenalidomide (OPTIMISMM): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background As lenalidomide becomes increasingly established for upfront treatment of multiple myeloma, patients refractory to this drug represent a population with an unmet need. The combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone has shown promising results in phase 1/2 trials of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of this triplet regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who previously received lenalidomide.
   Methods We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial at 133 hospitals and research centres in 21 countries. We enrolled patients (aged >= 18 years) with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, who received one to three previous regimens, including a lenalidomide-containing regimen for at least two consecutive cycles. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without pomalidomide using a permutated blocked design in blocks of four, stratified according to age, number of previous regimens, and concentration of beta(2) microglobulin at screening. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously until protocol amendment 1 then either intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1,4, 8, and 11 for the first eight cycles and subsequently on days 1 and 8. Dexamethasone (20 mg [10 mg if age >75 years]) was administered orally on the same days as bortezomib and the day after. Patients allocated pomalidomide received 4 mg orally on days 1-14. Treatment cycles were every 21 days. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, as assessed by an independent review committee. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01734928; patients are no longer being enrolled.
   Findings Between Jan 7, 2013, and May 15,2017,559 patients were enrolled. 281 patients were assigned pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and 278 were allocated bortezomib and dexamethasone. Median follow-up was 15.9 months (IQR 9.9-21.7). Pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone significantly improved progression-free survival compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone (median 11.20 months [95% CI 9.66-13-73] vs 7.10 months [5.88-8-48]; hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0-77; p<0-0001). 278 patients received at least one dose of pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and 270 patients received at least one dose of bortezomib and dexamethasone, and these patients were included in safety assessments. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (116 [42%] of 278 patients vs 23 [9%1 of 270 patients; nine p.m vs no patients had febrile neutropenia), infections (86 [31%] vs 48 118%1), and thrombocytopenia (76 [27%1 vs 79 [29%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 159 (57%) of 278 patients versus 114 (42%) of 270 patients. Eight deaths were related to treatment; six (2%) were recorded in patients who received pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (pneumonia [n=2], unknown cause [n=2], cardiac arrest [n=1], cardiorespiratory arrest [n=11) and two (1%) were reported in patients who received bortezomib and dexamethasone (pneumonia In=11, hepatic encephalopathy [n=1.]).
   Interpretation Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who previously received lenalidomide had significantly improved progression-free survival when treated with pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Adverse events accorded with the individual profiles of pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. This study supports use of pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone as a treatment option in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who previously received lenalidomide.

TI  - Cryoprecipitate use in the PROMMTT study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - PROMMTT Symposium held at the 71st Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma (AAST) / Clinical Congress of Acute Care Surgery
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few clinical data to guide the use of cryoprecipitate in severely injured trauma patients. Cryoprecipitate is a rich source of fibrinogen and has been associated with improved survival in animal as well as limited human studies. Our objectives were to identify patterns and predictors of cryoprecipitate use and determine whether transfusing cryoprecipitate was associated with improved survival.
   METHODS: This secondary analysis of 1,238 of 1,245 PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study patients who had timed transfusion data included 359 (29%) who received cryoprecipitate. For this analysis, one dose of cryoprecipitate was defined as 10 U. Unadjusted predictors of cryoprecipitate use were identified using logistic regression. Multivariable time-dependent Cox models were performed to examine the association of cryoprecipitate on time to in-hospital death.
   RESULTS: Cryoprecipitate use varied significantly by center, ranging from 7% to 82%. Among patients who received cryoprecipitate, the median number of units infused by 24 hours was 10 (interquartile range, 10-20). The median time from admission to first cryoprecipitate unit was 2.7 hours (interquartile range, 1.7-4.4 hours). Of those who died of a hemorrhagic death within 6 hours of admission, 72% received no cryoprecipitate. Other unadjusted predictors of cryoprecipitate use included Injury Severity Score (ISS), initial fibrinogen levels, base deficit, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, hemoglobin, damage-control surgery, and surgical intervention of the chest and abdomen. Cryoprecipitate use was not associated with in-hospital mortality after adjusting for initial pH, initial hemoglobin, emergency department systolic blood pressure, emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, blood product use, ISS, and center.
   CONCLUSION: Ten US Level 1 trauma centers vary greatly in their timing and use of cryoprecipitate in severely injured trauma patients. We could not identify any association of cryoprecipitate use with in-hospital mortality, although most patients did not receive this product. Randomized controlled studies are needed to determine if cryoprecipitate (or fibrinogen concentrates) have a beneficial effect. (Copyright (C) 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)

TI  - Sepsis 2019: What Surgeons Need to Know
T2  - SURGICAL INFECTIONS
AB  - The definition of sepsis continues to be as dynamic as the management strategies used to treat this. Sepsis-3 has replaced the earlier systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-based diagnoses with the rapid Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score assisting in predicting overall prognosis with regards to mortality. Surgeons have an important role in ensuring adequate source control while recognizing the threat of carbapenem-resistance in gram-negative organisms. Rapid diagnostic tests are being used increasingly for the early identification of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs), with a key emphasis on the multidisciplinary alert of results. Novel, higher generation antibiotic agents have been developed for resistance in ESKCAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) organisms while surgeons have an important role in the prevention of spread. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP-IT) trial has challenged the previous paradigm of length of antibiotic treatment whereas biomarkers such as procalcitonin are playing a prominent role in individualizing therapy. Several novel therapies for refractory septic shock, while still investigational, are gaining prominence rapidly (such as vitamin C) whereas others await further clinical trials. Management strategies presented as care bundles continue to be updated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, yet still remain controversial in its global adoption. We have broadened our temporal and epidemiologic perspective of sepsis by understanding it both as an acute, time-sensitive, life-threatening illness to a chronic condition that increases the risk of mortality up to five years post-discharge. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bedside scoring systems can assist the clinician in predicting post-operative sepsis. The public health role of the surgeon is key. This includes collaboration and multi-disciplinary antibiotic stewardship at a hospital level. It also requires controlling pharmaceutical sales and the unregulated dispensing of antibiotic agents globally through policy initiatives to control emerging resistance through prevention.

TI  - A Critical Update of the Assessment and Acute Management of Patients with Severe Burns
T2  - ADVANCES IN WOUND CARE
AB  - Significance: Burns are debilitating, life threatening, and difficult to assess and manage. Recent advances in assessment and management have occurred since a comprehensive review of the care of patients with severe burns was last published, which may influence research and clinical practice. Recent Advances: Recent advances have occurred in the understanding of burn pathophysiology, which has led to the identification of potential biomarkers of burn severity, such as protein C. There is new evidence about the potential superiority of natural colloids over crystalloids during fluid resuscitation, and new evidence about components of initial and perioperative management, including an improved understanding of pain following burns. Critical Issues: The limitations of the clinical examination highlight the need for imaging and biomarkers to assist in estimations of burn severity. Fluid resuscitation reduces mortality, although there is conjecture over the ideal method. The subsequent perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and the evidence for preventing and treating pain, infection, and fluid overload while maximizing wound healing potential is described. Future Directions: Promising developments are ongoing in imaging technology, histopathology, biomarkers, and wound healing adjuncts such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, topical negative pressure therapy, stem cell treatments, and skin substitutes. The greatest benefit from further research on management of patients with burns would most likely be derived from the elucidation of optimal fluid resuscitation protocols, pain management protocols, and surgical techniques from randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Four consecutive yearly point-prevalence studies in Wales indicate lack of improvement in sepsis care on the wards
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The 'Sepsis Six' bundle was promoted as a deliverable tool outside of the critical care settings, but there is very little data available on the progress and change of sepsis care outside the critical care environment in the UK. Our aim was to compare the yearly prevalence, outcome and the Sepsis Six bundle compliance in patients at risk of mortality from sepsis in non-intensive care environments. Patients with a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of 3 or above and suspected or proven infection were enrolled into four yearly 24-h point prevalence studies, carried out in fourteen hospitals across Wales from 2016 to 2019. We followed up patients to 30 days between 2016-2019 and to 90 days between 2017 and 2019. Out of the 26,947 patients screened 1651 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were recruited. The full `Sepsis Six' care bundle was completed on 223 (14.0%) occasions, with no significant difference between the years. On 190 (11.5%) occasions none of the bundle elements were completed. There was no significant correlation between bundle element compliance, NEWS or year of study. One hundred and seventy (10.7%) patients were seen by critical care outreach; the `Sepsis Six' bundle was completed significantly more often in this group (54/170, 32.0%) than for patients who were not reviewed by critical care outreach (168/1385, 11.6%; p < 0.0001). Overall survival to 30 days was 81.7% (1349/1651), with a mean survival time of 26.5 days (95% CI 26.1-26.9) with no difference between each year of study. 90- day survival for years 2017-2019 was 74.7% (949/1271), with no difference between the years. In multivariate regression we identified older age, heart failure, recent chemotherapy, higher frailty score and do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation orders as significantly associated with increased 30-day mortality. Our data suggests that despite efforts to increase sepsis awareness within the NHS, there is poor compliance with the sepsis care bundles and no change in the high mortality over the study period. Further research is needed to determine which time-sensitive ward-based interventions can reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and how can these results be embedded to routine clinical practice.

TI  - Therapeutic Hypothermia for Cardioprotection in Acute Myocardial Infarction
T2  - YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Mild therapeutic hypothermia of 32-35 degrees C improved neurologic outcomes in outside hospital cardiac arrest survivor. Furthermore, in experimental studies on infarcted model and pilot studies on conscious patients with acute myocardial infarction, therapeutic hypothermia successfully reduced infarct size and microvascular resistance. Therefore, mild therapeutic hypothermia has received an attention as a promising solution for reduction of infarction size after acute myocardial infarction which are not completely solved despite of optimal reperfusion therapy. Nevertheless, the results from randomized clinical trials failed to prove the cardioprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia or showed beneficial effects only in limited subgroups. In this article, we reviewed rationale for therapeutic hypothermia and possible mechanisms from previous studies, effective methods for clinical application to the patients with acute myocardial infarction, lessons from current clinical trials and future directions.

TI  - Hippocampal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Abnormalities in Cardiac Arrest are Associated with Poor Outcome
T2  - JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB  - Background: The role of neuroimaging in assessing prognosis in comatose cardiac survivors appears promising, but little is known regarding the import of particular spatial patterns. We report a specific spatial imaging abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that portends a poor prognosis: bilateral hippocampal hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Methods: Eighty sequential comatose cardiac arrest patients underwent MRI scans. Qualitative and quantitative regional analyses were performed. Patients were categorized as HIPPO+ (n = 18) or HIPPO- (n = 62) based on whether they had bilateral hippocampal hyperintensities. Poor outcome was defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >= 4 at 6 months. Results: Patients with bilateral hippocampal abnormalities had a higher frequency of poor outcome (P = .032). HIPPO+ patients suffered more severe cerebral injury, with lower whole brain apparent diffusion coefficient values (P = .043) and a greater number of affected regions on DWI (P = .001) and FLAIR (P = .001) than HIPPO- patients. The hippocampal approach was 100% specific for a poor prognosis; only 1 patient survived and remained in a vegetative state. Conclusions: Bilateral hippocampal hyperintensities on MRI may be a specific imaging finding that is indicative of poor prognosis in patients who suffer global hypoxic-ischemic injury. More research on the prognostic significance of this and similar neuroimaging patterns is indicated.

TI  - Palliative care in the surgical ICU
T2  - SURGICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Mr. Jones is in the surgical ICU (SICU) on a respirator. This is his third admission to the SICU for ventilator support. Three weeks ago he had a pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer and his initial recovery was uneventful; however. on postoperative Day 5 he developed pneumonia, rapid atrial fibrillation, and pancreatic ascites. Despite antibiotics, this progressed to respiratory failure and he was placed on the ventilator. He improved and I week later was extubated and transferred to the hospital floor, only to relapse within 24 hours with respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. He was readmitted to the SICU for ventilator support, continuous renal replacement therapy, and antibiotics. He improves over 3 weeks time and is now dialysis-free with adequate renal function; however, ventilator weaning is slow with multiple exacerbations of hypoxia and fever. His family states that because of his advanced age and multiple underlying health problems, the patient would not want to be maintained on "these machines" for the remainder of his life. The patient had communicated these wishes to his physicians before surgery. The nurses suggest that ongoing life Support is prolonging the patient's suffering; however, the surgeon notes that the prognosis for cancer survival is excellent, and hopes that with time, better nutrition, and slow ventilator weaning, the patient's multiple organ failure will improve and he will Survive to be discharged.
   This patient's lingering course exemplifies the dilemmas that are encountered increasingly in the SICU when prognosis is unclear and multiple organ failure waxes and wanes. Is Mr. Jones likely to survive to discharge with an acceptable quality of life? Or will he die in the ICU while receiving mechanical ventilation? If lie is likely to die, when should care transition to a palliative approach, if at all? As critical care becomes increasingly sophisticated, these sorts of decisions have become part of standard practice for physicians in the ICU.
   The ICU traditionally has focused on prolonging survival and curing disease with advanced technology; 10% to 20% of patients in the ICU will die before discharge from the hospital [1]. Among ICU survivors, mortality remains high at 6 months, particularly among the elderly [2]. Moreover, one of five American deaths occurs in the hospital during or after an ICU stay [3]. The landmark Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment (SUPPORT) study demonstrated that a large proportion of dying patients in ICUs received unwanted life support and therapies with inadequate attention to pain and suffering in the last 3 days of life [4,5]. This occurs despite the fact that in the last decade, medical practice found that most deaths in the ICU are associated with withholding or withdrawal of life support [6,7] These trends suggest that expertise in palliative care is an essential part of the armamentarium of the critical care physician, to ensure pain and symptom management in the ICU and to apply the appropriate principles of withholding or withdrawing of life support.
   Although it is increasingly clear that the principles of palliative care must be integrated into the ICU to ensure high-quality end-of-life care, how best to do this is not. The particular nature of critically ill surgical patients, critical care surgeons, and the culture of the ICU brings forth special difficulties in integrating palliative care into critical care. First, although 10% to 20% of patients who are admitted to ICU will die during their hospitalization, it is difficult to know with certainty which ones will do so and when. Just as it is unclear whether Mr. Jones in the aforementioned case study is dying or merely following the natural history of multiple organ failure, it is difficult to predict the actual likelihood of mortality for a specific patient. Many predictive models that have been developed for the ICU (eg, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome, Trauma Injury and Severity Score), although useful for stratifying populations, have not proven to be helpful for clinicians who are faced with making decisions about individual patients. The literature suggests that clinicians rarely use prognostic or predictive scores or models for clinical decision making; even when they are informed of the likelihood of death for a particular patient in the ICU based on such models, they do not make a transition to a palliative approach [5,8]. The culture of the ICU traditionally views mortality and survival as dichotomous variables [9]; often death must be imminent before clinicians will change from a curative treatment plan to a palliative one. For example, physicians decide to withdraw mechanical ventilation when they judge patients to have poor long-term cognitive function or less than a 10% likelihood of survival [10]. The wide range of practices regarding end-of-life care and withdrawal and withholding support in ICUs illustrate how prognostic uncertainty and varied definitions of medical futility affect palliative care in the ICU setting.
   Most patients who are admitted to the ICU do not have clear advance directives and are unable to participate in medical decisions; this compounds prognostic uncertainty. Only 5% of patients in the ICU can report their possible. The opportunity for a family's presence at the bedside of the patient in the ICU is a critical part of successful palliative care. Unrestricted visiting hours in ICUs is becoming the norm; this sociocultural change has gone a long way toward improving the quality of death and dying in ICUs. Studies showed that the presence of family does not affect care adversely, and probably improves it [46]. The presence of family during CPR is more controversial, but data increasingly suggest that this is helpful during bereavement [47]. If families are present, a bereavement counselor, social worker, pastoral care or other specially-trained personnel should be present to Support the family, explain procedures, and communicate last wishes and preferences to the health care staff. Despite the high technology environment of the ICU, attention can be paid to the spiritual care and death rituals, as appropriate. Families usually need support in after-death procedures, many have little knowledge of how to navigate the social pathways (eg, funeral homes) following death in the hospital. Social worker or spiritual care worker assistance in these matters should be part of the interdisciplinary care that is provided in the ICU.

TI  - Acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac arrhythmia after administration of arsenic trioxide for acute promyelocytic leukemia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY
AB  - Purpose. The case of a patient who developed acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac arrhythmia after receiving arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is described.
   Summary. An 84-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of osteoarthritis sought medical attention for relapse of her APL, which had initially been diagnosed approximately 30 months earlier. Complete remission was accomplished with three cycles of i.v. daunorubicin for 3 days and oral tretinoin for 28 days. After 19 months in remission, she was noted to have increased bruising and blood test values consistent with APL relapse. Two additional trials of oral tretinoin were unsuccessful, and arsenic trioxide was initiated at a daily dosage of 0.15 mg/kg of actual body weight. Less than 24 hours after receiving arsenic trioxide, the patient had "bile-like emesis" and her hemoglobin level decreased. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was suspected and managed aggressively with transfusions of platelets and fresh frozen plasma and i.v. desmopressin. She became anuric, and her serum creatinine level more than doubled. Hemodialysis was started due to a sudden increase in potassium and fluid overload that did not respond to i.v. furosemide. One hour after hemodialysis, the patient was found pulseless and unresponsive by nursing staff. The cardiac arrest team rapidly responded and noted atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate. Postresuscitation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Despite aggressive life-support therapy, the patient remained unresponsive.
   Conclusion. An 84-year-old woman developed acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac arrhythmia after receiving arsenic trioxide for the treatment of APL.

TI  - Prehospital intravenous fluid is associated with increased survival in trauma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - PROMMTT Symposium held at the 71st Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma (AAST) / Clinical Congress of Acute Care Surgery
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delivery of intravenous crystalloid fluids (IVF) remains a tradition-based priority during prehospital resuscitation of trauma patients. Hypotensive and targeted resuscitation algorithms have been shown to improve patient outcomes. We hypothesized that receiving any prehospital IVF is associated with increased survival in trauma patients compared with receiving no prehospital IVF.
   METHODS: Prospective data from 10 Level 1 trauma centers were collected. Patient demographics, prehospital IVF volume, prehospital and emergency department vital signs, lifesaving interventions, laboratory values, outcomes, and complications were collected and analyzed. Patients who did or did not receive prehospital IVF were compared. Tests for nonparametric data were used to assess significant differences between groups (p <= 0.05). Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the independent influence of IVF on outcome and complications.
   RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1,245 trauma patients; 45 were excluded owing to incomplete data; 84% (n = 1,009) received prehospital IVF, and 16% (n = 191) did not. There was no difference between the groups with respect to sex, age, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). The on-scene systolic blood pressure was lower in the IVF group (110 mm Hg vs. 100 mm Hg, p < 0.04) and did not change significantly after IVF, measured at emergency department admission (110 mm Hg vs. 105 mm Hg, p = 0.05). Hematocrit/hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and platelets were lower (p < 0.05), and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio and partial thromboplastin time were higher (p < 0.001) in the IVF group. The IVF group received a median fluid volume of 700 mL (interquartile range, 300-1,300). The Cox regression revealed that prehospital fluid administration was associated with increased survival (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.98; p = 0.03). Site differences in ISS and fluid volumes were demonstrated (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Prehospital IVF volumes commonly used by PRospective Observational Multicenter Massive Transfusion Study (PROMMTT) investigators do not result in increased systolic blood pressure but are associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in trauma patients compared with patients who did not receive prehospital IVF.

TI  - Near-fatal heat stroke during the 1995 heat wave in Chicago
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In July 1995, Chicago sustained a heat wave that resulted in more than 600 excess deaths, 3300 excess emergency department visits, and a substantial number of intensive care unit admissions for near-fatal heat stroke.
   Objective: To describe the clinical features of patients admitted to an intensive care unit with near-fatal classic heat stroke. Patients were followed for 1 year to assess delayed functional outcome and mortality.
   Design: Observational study.
   Setting: Intensive care units in the Chicago area.
   Patients: 58 patients admitted to the hospital from 12 July to 20 July 1995 who met the case definition of classic heat stroke.
   Measurements: The data collection tool was designed to compile demographic and survival data and to permit analysis of organ system function by abstracting data on physical examination findings, electrocardiography and echocardiography results, fluid resuscitation, radiography results, and laboratory findings. Data on functional status at discharge and at 1 year were collected by using a modified Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire.
   Results: Patients experienced multiorgan dysfunction with neurologic impairment (100%), moderate to severe renal insufficiency (53%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (45%), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (10%); Fifty-seven percent of patients had evidence of infection on admission. In-hospital mortality was 21%. Most survivors recovered near-normal renal, hematologic, and respiratory status, but disability persisted, resulting in moderate to severe functional-impairment in 33% of patients at hospital discharge. At 1 year, no patient had improved functional status, and an additional 28% of patients had died.
   Conclusions: Near-fatal classic heat stroke is associated with multiorgan dysfunction. A high percentage of patients had infection at presentation. A high mortality rate was observed during acute hospitalization and at 1 year, in addition, substantial functional impairment at discharge persisted 1 year. The degree of functional disability correlated highly with survival at 1 year.

TI  - Predictive value of veno-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference and central venous oxygen saturation for fluid administration and mortality in critically ill patients with extensive burns
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Objectives: Guiding fluid therapy in severely burned patients presents complex challenges, combining elements of both distributive and hypovolemic shock, accompanied by cardiovascular dysfunction. Whereas parts of hemodynamic assessment in septic shock such as central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and the arterial-venous carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure difference (Delta pCO2 = pcvCO2 - paCO2) can both be used as indicators of hypoperfusion, they are not part of the standard clinical assessment of severely burned patients. The aim of this retrospective study was thus to investigate whether the Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 in severely burned patients correlates with fluid administration and mortality. Methods: Retrospective analysis of severely burned patients with burns larger than 20 % total body surface area (TBSA) admitted between 01/2017 and 06/2021 to the Burns Center of the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Patients were treated according to international guidelines and in-house standards and Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 were assessed at least once within the first 24 h of intensive care unit admission. Results: In total 69 patients were included in this analysis. The median Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 were 1.16 kPa [inter-quartile range IQR, 0.82 - 1.50] and 76 % [IQR, 71 - 81]. This translated to an abnormally elevated Delta pCO2 (>0.8 kPa) in 53 (77 %) and an abnormally reduced ScvO2 (<70 %) in 13 (19 %) patients. Initial Delta pCO2, but not ScvO2, was non-linearly associated with intravenous fluid administration in the following 24 h (estimate(log) 9.6 L [95 % confidence interval CI, 4.1 - 15.2], p = 0.001) and 48 h (estimate(log) 6.0 L [95 % CI, 0.3 - 11.8], p = 0.039). Both initial Delta pCO2 (logarithmic odds ratio ORlog 4.3 [95 % CI, 1.1 - 20.9], p = 0.048) as well as ScvO2 (ORlog 0.1 [95 % CI, 0 - 0.42], p = 0.034) were non-linearly associated with in-hospital mortality. However, the best association with mortality was achieved by combining Delta pCO2 and ScvO2, with patients presenting with abnormalities in both Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 having a predicted mortality of 46 % [95 % CI, 23-71]. Conclusion: In severely burned patients, both Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 are associated with the extent and severity of burns as well as with in-hospital mortality. However, only Delta pCO2 seems to possess potential as a predictor of fluid administration. A multimodal approach to fluid resuscitation including both parameters may show promise in severely burned patients; however, further prospective studies are required to define optimal thresholds and validate its integration into clinical fluid resuscitation practice.

TI  - Ethical considerations in the use of RhD-positive blood products in trauma
T2  - TRANSFUSION
AB  - BackgroundPrehospital and early in-hospital use of low titer group O whole blood (LTOWB) for life-threatening bleeding has been independently associated with improved survival compared to component therapy. However, when RhD-positive blood products are administered to RhD-negative females of childbearing potential (FCP), there is a small future risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). This raises important ethical questions that must be explored in order to justify the use of RhD-positive blood products, including LTOWB, both in clinical practice and research. MethodsThis essay explores the ethical challenges related to RhD-positive blood product administration to RhD-negative or RhD-unknown FCPs as a first-line resuscitation fluid in the trauma setting. These ethical issues include: issues related to decision-making, ethical analysis based on the doctrine of double effect (DDE), and attendant obligations incurred by hospitals that administer RhD-positive blood to FCPs. ResultsEthical analysis through the use of the DDE demonstrates that utilization of RhD-positive blood products, including LTOWB, in the early resuscitation of FCPs is an ethically appropriate approach. By accepting the risk of HDFN, hospitals generate obligations to promote blood donation, evaluate for alloimmunization and counsel patients on the future risk of HDFN, and maintain an understanding of the ethical rationale for RhD-positive blood transfusion.

TI  - Acute palliative and supportive care units provide unique and tailored care: A case report
T2  - PALLIATIVE & SUPPORTIVE CARE
AB  - Objective Acute Palliative and Supportive Care Units (APSCUs) provide unique and tailored care to patients with advanced chronic illness. In an APSCU, patients receive intensive palliative care while remaining in an acute care hospital setting. This allows for physical and psychological suffering to be aggressively treated by a dedicated interdisciplinary team. In the case of our patient, the APSCU changed the trajectory of his expected outcome of in-hospital death to a successful discharge home.Methods We report the case of a patient with advanced colon cancer who suffered cardiac arrest in the emergency department and was expected to die soon after transition to comfort-oriented care.Results After terminal extubation, our patient continued to have agitated delirium and was transferred to our APSCU for aggressive symptom control. He stabilized and progressively became more responsive, prompting a change in his plan of care with a goal of discharge home with hospice. The APSCU's interdisciplinary team was able to adapt to the patient's unexpected clinical improvement and provide him and his family with the medical, psychosocial, and spiritual expertise to prepare him for a successful discharge home, where he ultimately died 6 weeks later.Significance of results The case report demonstrates that an APSCU, with its skilled interdisciplinary team in the acute care hospital, is an ideal setting to provide patient-centered care for seriously ill patients and their families.

TI  - Comparing the Psychological Effects of Manikin-Based and Augmented Reality-Based Simulation Training: Within-Subjects Crossover Study
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Patient simulators are an increasingly important part of medical training. They have been shown to be effective in teaching procedural skills, medical knowledge, and clinical decision-making. Recently, virtual and augmented reality simulators are being produced, but there is no research on whether these more realistic experiences cause problematic and greater stress responses as compared to standard manikin simulators.
   Objective: The purpose of this research is to examine the psychological and physiological effects of augmented reality (AR) in medical simulation training as compared to traditional manikin simulations.
   Methods: A within-subjects experimental design was used to assess the responses of medical students (N=89) as they completed simulated (using either manikin or AR) pediatric resuscitations. Baseline measures of psychological well-being, salivary cortisol, and galvanic skin response (GSR) were taken before the simulations began. Continuous GSR assessments throughout and after the simulations were captured along with follow-up measures of emotion and cortisol. Participants also wrote freely about their experience with each simulation, and narratives were coded for emotional word use.
   Results: Of the total 86 medical students who participated, 37 (43%) were male and 49 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 25.2 (SD 2.09, range 22-30) years and 24.7 (SD 2.08, range 23-36) years, respectively. GSR was higher in the manikin group adjusted for day, sex, and medications taken by the participants (AR-manikin: -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.03; P=.009). The difference in negative affect between simulation types was not statistically significant (AR-manikin: 0.41, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.53; P=.48). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in self-reported stress (AR-manikin: 0.53, 95% CI -2.35 to 3.42; P=.71) or simulation stress (AR-manikin: -2.17, 95% CI -6.94 to 2.59; P=.37). The difference in percentage of positive emotion words used to describe the experience was not statistically significant between simulation types, which were adjusted for day of experiment, sex of the participants, and total number of words used (AR-manikin: -4.0, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.10; P=.12). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in terms of the percentage of negative emotion words used to describe the experience (AR-manikin: -0.33, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.46; P=.41), simulation sickness (AR-manikin: 0.17, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.62; P=.47), or salivary cortisol (AR-manikin: 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.13; P=.41). Finally, preexisting levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, perceived stress, and reported depression were not tied to physiological responses to AR.
   Conclusions: AR simulators elicited similar stress responses to currently used manikin-based simulators, and we did not find any evidence of AR simulators causing excessive stress to participants. Therefore, AR simulators are a promising tool to be used in medical training, which can provide more emotionally realistic scenarios without the risk of additional harm.

TI  - Usefulness of Intracoronary Epinephrine in Severe Hypotension during Percutaneous Coronary Interventions
T2  - KOREAN CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background and Objectives: Life-threatening hypotension during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) is devastating for the patient and is associated with fatal adverse outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of intracoronary epinephrine in severe hypotension unresponsive to other measures during PCI.
   Subjects and Methods: We analyzed the Pusan National University Yangsan hospital cardiac catheterization laboratory database to identify patients who underwent PCI from December 2008 to July 2012. The outcomes were changes of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before and after intracoronary epinephrine and in-hospital mortality.
   Results: A total of 30 patients who were initially stable and received intracoronary epinephrine for severe hypotension during PCI were included. Following administration of intracoronary epinephrine (dose 181 +/- 24.8 microgram), systolic and diastolic BP (from 53.8 +/- 13.0 mm Hg up to 112.8 +/- 21.2 mm Hg, from 35 +/- 7.6 mm Hg up to 70.6 +/- 12.7 mm Hg, respectively) and HR (from 39.4 +/- 5.1 beats/min up to 96.8 +/- 29.3 beats/min) were increased. Additionally, 21 patients (70%) showed hemodynamically acceptable responses to intracoronary epinephrine without the intraaortic balloon pump and temporary pacemaker during the PCI. In-hospital mortality was 17% (n=5).
   Conclusion: Although our study was small, intracoronary epinephrine was found to be well tolerated and resulted in prompt and successful recovery from severe hypotension in most patients when other measures were ineffective. Intracoronary epinephrine could be a safe and useful measure in patients developing severe hypotension during PCI.

TI  - Comparison of children receiving emergent sepsis care by mode of arrival
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To determine if differences in patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes exist between children with sepsis who arrive by emergency medical services (EMS) versus their own mode of transport (self-transport). Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of two large children's hospitals and treated for sepsis from November 2013 to June 2017. Presentation, ED treatment, and outcomes, primarily time to first bolus and first parental antibiotic, were compared between those transported via EMS versus patients who were self-transported. Results: Of the 1813 children treated in the ED for sepsis, 1452 were self-transported and 361 were transported via EMS. The EMS group were more frequently male, of black race, and publicly insured than the self-transport group. The EMS group was more likely to have a critical triage category, receive initial care in the resuscitation suite (51.9 vs. 22%), have hypotension at ED presentation (14.4 vs. 5.4%), lactate >2.0 mmol/L (60.6 vs. 40.8%), vasoactive agents initiated in the ED (8.9 vs. 4.9%), and to be intubated in the ED (14.4 vs. 2.8%). The median time to first IV fluid bolus was faster in the EMS group (36 vs. 57 min). Using Cox LASSO to adjust for potential covariates, time to fluids remained faster for the EMS group (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12, 1.42). Time to antibiotics, ICU LOS, 3-or 30-day mortality rates did not differ, yet median hospital LOS was significantly longer in those transported by EMS versus self-transported (6.5 vs. 5.3 days). Conclusions: Children with sepsis transported by EMS are a sicker population of children than those self transported on arrival and had longer hospital stays. EMS transport was associated with earlier in-hospital fluid resuscitation but no difference in time to first antibiotic. Improved prehospital recognition and care is needed to promote adherence to both prehospital and hospital-based sepsis resuscitation benchmarks. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of specialized pediatric palliative care on advance care planning and healthcare utilization in children and young adults: a retrospective analysis of medical records of in-hospital deaths
T2  - BMC PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - Background Pediatric palliative care supports children and young adults with life-limiting conditions and their families, seeking to minimize suffering and enhance quality of life. This study evaluates the impact of specialized palliative care (SPC) on advance care planning (ACP) and patterns of end-of-life care for patients who died in the hospital.Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of medical records extracted from a clinical data warehouse, covering patients who died aged 0-24 in an academic tertiary children's hospital in South Korea. Participants were categorized into before (2011-2013; pre-period) and after (2017-2019; post-period) the introduction of an SPC service. Within the post-period, patients were further categorized into SPC recipients and non-recipients.Results We identified 274 and 205 patients in the pre-period and post-period, respectively. ACP was conducted more and earlier in the post-period than in the pre-period, and in patients who received palliative care than in those who did not. Patients who received SPC were likely to receive less mechanical ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation and more opioids. A multivariable regression model showed that earlier ACP was associated with not being an infant, receiving SPC, and having a neurological or neuromuscular disease.Conclusions SPC involvement was associated with more and earlier ACP and less intense end-of-life care for children and young adults who died in the hospital. Integrating palliative care into routine care can improve the quality of end-of-life care by reflecting patients' and their families' values and preferences.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a virtual reality basic life support for undergraduate students in Thailand: a project by Mae Fah Luang University (MFU BLiS VR)
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background In traditional basic life support training for university students or the public, trainees practice simulations only once or twice during the course, potentially limiting their competence. In contrast, virtual reality allows trainees to independently study and practice as often as needed, enhancing their skills. This research and development project aimed to develop and evaluate a novel learning device, virtual reality basic life support for undergraduate students of Mae Fah Luang University (MFU BLiS VR).Methods This study employed a two-group, pre- and post-test design, involving seventy students (n = 35 in each group) from Mae Fah Luang University, Thailand. Data were collected from March 2022 to January 2023. The experimental group received the MFU BLiS VR, in addition to traditional teaching, while the control group received only traditional teaching. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon signed ranks test.Results "MFU BLiS VR" provided a learning experience in out-of-hospital basic life support for adult patients in four scenarios: (1) a person who was not breathing but had a pulse; (2) a person who was not breathing, had no pulse, and required defibrillation; (3) a person who was not breathing, had no pulse, and did not require defibrillation; and (4) a person with normal breathing and pulse but was unconscious. Each scenario was presented sequentially from scenario one to scenario four. The scenarios encompassed common and complex situations requiring prompt and effective bystander responses to save lives. The results revealed that the experimental group had a significantly shorter no-flow time compared to the control group (Z = -5.02, p < .001) and achieved significantly higher knowledge scores than the control group (Z = -3.39, p < .01) as well as superior practical skills (Z = -7.26, p < .001). Both groups reported the highest satisfaction levels in all aspects, with no significant differences.Conclusion MFU BLiS VR is an effective training approach for teaching and learning basic life support and the use of an automated electronic defibrillator. It captures students' attention and enhances their understanding of these essential life support skills, which are crucial for everyone.

TI  - Resuscitate early with plasma and platelets or balance blood products gradually: Findings from the PROMMTT study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: The trauma transfusion literature has yet to resolve which is more important for hemorrhaging patients, transfusing plasma and platelets along with red blood cells (RBCs) early in resuscitation or gradually balancing blood product ratios. In a previous report of PROMMTT results, we found (1) plasma and platelet: RBC ratios increased gradually during the 6 hours following admission, and (2) patients achieving ratios more than 1:2 (relative to ratios <1:2) had significantly decreased 6-hour to 24-hour mortality adjusting for baseline and time-varying covariates. To differentiate the association of in-hospital mortality with early plasma or platelet transfusion from that with delayed but gradually balanced ratios, we developed a separate analytic approach.
   METHODS: Using PROMMTT data and multilevel logistic regression to adjust for center effects, we related in-hospital mortality to the early receipt of plasma or platelets within the first three to six transfusion units (including RBCs) and 2.5 hours of admission. We adjusted for the same covariates as in our previous report: Injury Severity Score (ISS), age, time and total number of blood product transfusions upon entry to the analysis cohort, and bleeding from the head, chest, or limb.
   RESULTS: Of 1,245 PROMMTT patients, 619 were eligible for this analysis. Early plasma was associated with decreased 24-hour and 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratios of 0.47 [p = 0.009] and 0.44 [p = 0.002], respectively). Too few patients (24) received platelets early for meaningful assessment. In the subgroup of 222 patients receiving no early plasma but continuing transfusions beyond Hour 2.5, achieving gradually balanced plasma and platelet: RBC ratios of 1:2 or greater by Hour 4 was not associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratios of 0.9 and 1.1, respectively). There were no significant center effects.
   CONCLUSION: Plasma transfusion early in resuscitation had a protective association with mortality, whereas delayed but gradually balanced transfusion ratios did not. Further research will require considerably larger numbers of patients receiving platelets early. (Copyright (C) 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)

TI  - Serum Diamine Oxidase as a Hemorrhagic Shock Biomarker in a Rabbit Model
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: In prolonged hemorrhagic shock, reductions in intestinal mucosal blood perfusion lead to mucosal barrier damage and systemic inflammation. Gastrointestinal failure in critically ill patients has a poor prognosis, so early assessment of mucosal barrier injury in shock patients is clinically relevant. Unfortunately, there is no serum marker that can accurately assess intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess if serum diamine oxidase levels can reflect intestinal mucosal injury subsequent to prolonged hemorrhagic shock.
   Methods: Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: a control group, a medium blood pressure (BP) group (exsanguinated to a shock BP of 50 to 41 mm Hg), and a low BP group (exsanguinated to a shock blood pressure of 40 to 31 mm Hg), in which the shock BP was sustained for 180 min prior to fluid resuscitation.
   Results: The severity of hemorrhagic shock in the low BP group was significantly greater than that of the medium BP group according to the post-resuscitation BP, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and arterial lactate. Intestinal damage was significantly more severe in the low BP group according to Chiu's scoring, claudin-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and myeloperoxidase expression. Serum diamine oxidase was significantly increased in the low BP group compared to the medium BP and control groups and was negatively correlated with shock BP.
   Conclusion: Serum diamine oxidase can be used as a serological marker in evaluating intestinal injury and shows promise as an indicator of hemorrhagic shock severity.

TI  - Precise Control of Target Temperature Using N6-Cyclohexyladenosine and Real-Time Control of Surface Temperature
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Targeted temperature management is standard of care for cardiac arrest and is in clinical trials for stroke. N-6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), an A(1) adenosine receptor agonist, inhibits thermogenesis and induces onset of hibernation in hibernating species. Despite promising thermolytic efficacy of CHA, prior work has failed to achieve and maintain a prescribed target core body temperature (T-b) between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 24 hours. We instrumented Sprague-Dawley rats (n=19) with indwelling arterial and venous cannulae and a transmitter for monitoring T-b and ECG, then administered CHA via continuous IV infusion or intraperitoneal (IP) injection. In the first experiment (n=11), we modulated ambient temperature and increased the dose of CHA in an attempt to manage T-b. In the second experiment (n=8), we administered CHA (0.25mg/[kg.h]) via continuous IV infusion and modulated cage surface temperature to control T-b. We rewarmed animals by increasing surface temperature at 1 degrees C h(-1) and discontinued CHA after T-b reached 36.5 degrees C. T-b, brain temperature (T-brain), heart rate, blood gas, and electrolytes were also monitored. Results show that titrating dose to adjust for individual variation in response to CHA led to tolerance and failed to manage a prescribed T-b. Starting with a dose (0.25mg/[kg.h]) and modulating surface temperature to prevent overcooling proved to be an effective means to achieve and maintain T-b between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 24 hours. Increasing surface temperature to 37 degrees C during CHA administration brought T-b back to normothermic levels. All animals treated in this way rewarmed without incident. During the initiation of cooling, we observed bradycardia within 30 minutes of the start of IV infusion, transient hyperglycemia, and a mild hypercapnia; the latter normalized via metabolic compensation. In conclusion, we describe an intravenous delivery protocol for CHA at 0.25mg/(kg.h) that, when coupled with conductive cooling, achieves and maintains a prescribed and consistent target T-b between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 24 hours.

TI  - Chloremia Disturbances in Critical Care: A Narrative Review of Pathophysiology, Clinical Impact and Management Strategies
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Chloride, the leading extracellular anion, plays a crucial role in acid-base balance, fluid homeostasis, and neuromuscular function. Despite historical underrecognition, emerging evidence demonstrates significant associations between chloremia disturbances and critical care outcomes. This paper aims to narratively review the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management strategies of chloremia disturbances in critically ill patients. Chloremia disturbances are common in ICU patients, with both hypochloremia (<96 mEq/L) and hyperchloremia (>106 mEq/L) independently associated with increased mortality, prolonged ICU length of stay, and organ dysfunction. In sepsis, chloride levels exhibit a prognostic value, with threshold effects around 105 mEq/L. Hyperchloremia particularly increases acute kidney injury risk, while hypochloremia correlates with prolonged mechanical ventilation. The choice of resuscitation fluids significantly influences clinical outcomes, with balanced crystalloids potentially reducing adverse events if compared to normal saline solutions. Recent large-scale trials demonstrate lower rates of major adverse kidney events with chloride-restrictive strategies. Optimal management requires careful patient monitoring along with acid-base assessment. Treatment approaches must identify underlying causes to avoid complications. Prevention strategies include protocol-based fluid therapy, medication selection consideration, and early intervention in high-risk patients. Emerging technologies, including continuous monitoring systems and machine learning algorithms, offer promising advances for predicting and managing chloride disturbances.

TI  - Early coagulation support protocol: A valid approach in real-life management of major trauma patients. Results from two Italian centres
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Introduction: Early coagulation support (ECS) includes prompt infusion of tranexamic acid, fibrinogen concentrate, and packed red blood cells for initial resuscitation of major trauma patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effects, in terms of blood product consumption, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality, of the ECS protocol, compared to the massive transfusion protocol (MTP) in the treatment of major trauma patients.
   Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the registry data of two Italian trauma centres. Adult major trauma patients with, or at risk of, active bleeding who were managed according to the MTP during the years 2011-2012, or the ECS protocol during the years 2013-2014 and were considered at risk of multiple transfusions, were enrolled. The primary endpoint was to determine whether the ECS protocol reduces the use of blood products in the acute management of trauma patients. Secondary endpoints were the outcome measures of length of stay in ICU, length of stay in hospital, and mortality at 24-hours and 28-days after hospital admission.
   Results: Among the 518 major trauma patients admitted to the trauma centres during the study period, 235 patients (118 in the pre-ECS period and 117 in the ECS period) matched one of the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Compared with the pre-ECS period, the ECS period showed a reduction in the average consumption of packed red blood cells (-1.87 units, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.40, -1.34), platelets (-1.28 units; 95% CI, -1.64, -0.91), and fresh frozen plasma (-1.69; 95% CI, -2.14, -1.25) in the first 24-hours. Furthermore, during the ECS period, we recorded a 10-day reduction in the hospital length of stay (-10 days, 95% CI, -11.6, -8.4) and a non-significant 28-day mortality increase.
   Conclusions: The ECS protocol was effective in reducing blood product consumption compared to the MTP and confirmed the importance of early fibrinogen administration as a strategy of rapid coagulation. This novel approach may be adopted in real-life management of major trauma patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bilirubin-A Possible Prognostic Mortality Marker for Patients with ECLS
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a promising therapeutic option for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. However, as the mortality rate still remains high, there is a need for early outcome parameters reflecting therapy success or futility. Therefore, we investigated whether liver enzyme levels could serve as prognostic mortality markers for patients with ECLS. The present study is a retrospective single-center cohort study. Adult patients >18 years of age who received ECLS therapy between 2011 and 2018 were included. Bilirubin, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic-pyruvic-transaminase (GPT) serum levels were analyzed at day 5 after the start of the ECLS therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was all-cause in-hospital mortality. A total of 438 patients received ECLS during the observation period. Based on the inclusion criteria, 298 patients were selected for the statistical analysis. The overall mortality rate was 42.6% (n= 127). The area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for bilirubin on day 5 was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-0.78). Cox regression with multivariable adjustment revealed a significant association between bilirubin on day 5 and mortality, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.24 (95% CI: 1.53-3.30). Based on the results of this study, an increase in serum bilirubin on day 5 of ECLS therapy correlates independently with mortality.

TI  - Guidelines for Enhanced Recovery After Trauma and Intensive Care (ERATIC): Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) and International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC) Society Recommendations: Part 3: Trauma Ethics and Systems Aspects
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundEnhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols reduce length of stay, complications, and costs for elective surgical procedures. It remains challenging to implement ERAS concepts in the acute trauma patient due to deranged physiological reserve from the penetrating or blunt trauma producing altered physiology. However, systems of care improve access to early intervention and potentially reduce mortality. These consensus guidelines examine optimal pre-hospital, resuscitation-room, intra- and post-operative treatment, systems of ethical management, and overall care for trauma patients in the post-resuscitation phase of care. The guideline is presented in three parts, this being part 3.MethodsExperts in aspects of management of trauma surgical patients and intensive care were invited to contribute by the International ERAS Society and IATSIC. Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements using the patient intervention comparator outcome (PICO) consensus questions created by the expert group. Studies were selected with particular attention to randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large cohort studies; reviewed; and summarized recommendations were graded using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. These recommendations based on current best evidence, with extrapolation from elective patient studies where appropriate, were followed by a modified two-round Delphi method to validate final recommendations. Several ERAS components are already standard of care within national and society guidelines and are endorsed. The bulk of the text focuses on key areas pertaining specifically to trauma care of major trauma and polytrauma in the ICU-requiring group.ResultsOverall 37 aspects of trauma care were considered with multiple PICO questions and sub-points. Consensus was reached after two rounds of a modified Delphi process involving all authors, with minor adjustments to some phrasing required but with 87% overall agreement on all statements (100% agreement on 31 of the main statement sets, prior to minor edits to address the points of difference for the rest with 100% total agreement thereafter). None were rejected outright. The recommendations and level of evidence for each aspect of trauma care that may impact on improved recovery and reduced length of hospital stay are presented with grade of recommendation.ConclusionsFour main areas of relevance to ethics and systems are presented as part 3. The guidelines are based on current best evidence for an ERAS approach to patients who have had major injuries and polytrauma. These guidelines are not exhaustive but collate the best available evidence on important components of care for this patient population. As some of the evidence is extrapolated from elective surgery and non-trauma emergency surgery, some of the components need further evaluation in future studies.

TI  - SEVERE DIGITALIS INTOXICATION OF INGESTION OF 1-G DIGOXIN
T2  - DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB  - A 50-year-old, previously healthy, woman swallowed 1 g digoxin powder, dissolved in water, with suicidal intent.  On admission to hospital one hour later, having vomited three times at home, the prominent signs were somnolence and hypersalivation.  Serum digoxin level was 3.37 ng/ml.  There followed repeated episodes of asystole alternating with ventricular fibrillation, requiring ardiopulmonary resuscitation over 90 min and adrenaline administration.  Repeated electrical defibrillation, administration of dopamine, phenytoin and lidocaine, as well as transitory transvenous electrical stimulation became necessary.  Anti-digoxin antibody fragments were administered, initially 80 mg, to a total of 3,280 mg over 24 hours.  After 3 days of intensive care and a further 21 days in hospital she was discharged and referred to psychiatric treatment.  - This case demonstrates that even severe digoxin poisoning can be successfully treated without sequelae by the appropriate administration of digoxin antidote.  The main problems in this case were regulation of the dosage and acquiring the necessary amount of antidote which greatly exceeded the hospital's own depot.

TI  - Buffered solutions versus 0.9% saline for resuscitation in critically ill adults and children
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Fluid therapy is one of the main interventions provided for critically ill patients, although there is no general consensus regarding the type of solution. Among crystalloid solutions, 0.9% saline is the most commonly administered. Buffered solutions may offer some theoretical advantages (less metabolic acidosis, less electrolyte disturbance), but the clinical relevance of these remains unknown.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of buffered solutions versus 0.9% saline for resuscitation in critically ill adults and children.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases to July 2018: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and four trials registers. We checked references, conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with parallel or cross-over design examining buffered solutions versus intravenous 0.9% saline in a critical care setting (resuscitation or maintenance). We included studies on participants with critical illness (including trauma and burns) or undergoing emergency surgery during critical illness who required intravenous fluid therapy. We included studies of adults and children. We included studies with more than two arms if they fulfilled all of our inclusion criteria. We excluded studies performed in persons undergoing elective surgery and studies with multiple interventions in the same arm.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. We assessed our intervention effects using random-effects models, but when one or two trials contributed to 75% of randomized participants, we used fixed-effect models. We reported outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Main results
   We included 21 RCTs (20,213 participants) and identified three ongoing studies. Three RCTs contributed 19,054 participants (94.2%). Four RCTs (402 participants) were conducted among children with severe dehydration and dengue shock syndrome. Fourteen trials reported results on mortality, and nine reported on acute renal injury. Sixteen included trials were conducted in adults, four in the paediatric population, and one trial limited neither minimum or maximum age as an inclusion criterion. Eight studies involving 19,218 participants were rated as high methodological quality (trials with overall low risk of bias according to the domains: allocation concealment, blinding of participants/assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting), and in the remaining trials, some form of bias was introduced or could not be ruled out.
   We found no evidence of an effect of buffered solutions on in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01; 19,664 participants; 14 studies; high-certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate of 119 per 1000, buffered solutions could reduce mortality by 21 per 1000 or could increase mortality by 1 per 1000. Similarly, we found no evidence of an effect of buffered solutions on acute renal injury (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00; 18,701 participants; 9 studies; low-certainty evidence). Based on a rate of 121 per 1000, buffered solutions could reduce the rate of acute renal injury by 19 per 1000, or result in no difference in the rate of acute renal injury. Buffered solutions did not show an effect on organ system dysfunction (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.61; 266 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on the effects of buffered solutions on electrolyte disturbances varied: potassium (mean difference (MD) 0.09, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.27; 158 participants; 4 studies; very low-certainty evidence); chloride (MD -3.02, 95% CI -5.24 to 0.80; 351 participants; 7 studies; very low-certainty evidence); pH (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 200 participants; 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence); and bicarbonate (MD 2.26, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.27; 344 participants; 6 studies; very low-certainty evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   We found no effect of buffered solutions on preventing in-hospital mortality compared to 0.9% saline solutions in critically ill patients. The certainty of evidence for this finding was high, indicating that further research would detect little or no difference in mortality. The effects of buffered solutions and 0.9% saline solutions on preventing acute kidney injury were similar in this setting. The certainty of evidence for this finding was low, and further research could change this conclusion. Patients treated with buffered solutions showed lower chloride levels, higher levels of bicarbonate, and higher pH. The certainty of evidence for these findings was very low. Future research should further examine patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life. The three ongoing studies once published and assessed may alter the conclusions of the review.

TI  - OPENing a new ECLECTIC approach to NSTEMI and cardiac arrest using ECG-less coronary computed tomography angiography. Study design and rationa le of two prospective clinical studies
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
AB  - Background: ECG-less coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a novel and promising tool for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared to conventional ECG-gated CCTA, it is less dependent on heart rate control and gives the possibility of ruling out both pulmonary embolism and CAD using a single contrast injection. Recently, it has shown good sensitivity in detecting obstructive CAD. Given the limitations of current emergency room algorithms-primarily based on clinical presentation, ECG, and biomarkers-the triage of patients with acute chest pain or cardiac arrest may benefit from this emerging imaging modality. Methods: We designed two prospective, single-center, double-blinded clinical studies to investigate the role of ECG-less CCTA in acute scenarios. The ECLECTIC study (ECG-LEss coronary Computed Tomography angiography in the management of patients presenting with hIgh-troponin and Chest pain, NCT07192965) will evaluate diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value in patients presenting with acute chest pain, mildly elevated troponin levels, and a high clinical suspicion of CAD. The OPEN-CCT Arrest (Optimizing Post-arrest Evaluation with Non-gated Cardiac CT) will assess the feasibility and diagnostic utility of this technique in cardiac arrest survivors. In both studies, patients will undergo ECG-less CCTA followed by ICA, considered the gold standard. Clinical implications: ECG-less CCTA pushes the boundaries of using CCTA in acute clinical scenarios. This technique may reduce preparation time and improve workflow, especially in highly instrumented patients. If its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value are proven, ECG-less CCTA could significantly decrease the need for unnecessary invasive procedures, the length of hospital stay, and the overall healthcare costs.

TI  - Feasibility of a remote heart rate variability biofeedback intervention for reducing anxiety in cardiac arrest survivors: A pilot trial
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Background: Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) is a promising non-pharmacologic approach for reducing anxiety. This intervention's feasibility needs testing in psychologically distressed cardiac patients for whom heart-related anxiety is a core concern. To enhance scalability and convenience, remote delivery of HRVB also needs to be assessed. Accordingly, we evaluated the feasibility of remote HRVB in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) with elevated CA-related psychological distress. Methods: The intervention was comprised of daily sessions of diaphragmatic paced breathing and real-time monitoring of cardiac activity guided by a smartphone app and heart rate monitor. This single-arm feasibility trial assessed the percentage of eligible contacted patients who consented and engaged in the study and the selfreported acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and usability of the intervention. Exploratory analyses assessed pre-to-post changes in trait anxiety, negative affect, cardiac-related interoceptive fear, and resting-state HRV. Results: Of 12 eligible CA survivors contacted, 10 enrolled. All 10 patients completed the virtual study visits and the majority (>50 %) of prescribed training sessions. Ninety percent reported good scores for intervention acceptability and feasibility, and 80 % reported good scores for its appropriateness and usability for reducing fear. Trait anxiety decreased significantly pre-to-post intervention. There were no changes in negative affect, interoceptive fear, or resting state HRV. Conclusion: A remotely delivered HRVB intervention was acceptable, feasible, and useable for cardiac patients with CA-related psychological distress. A phase 2 randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of HRVB on cardiac patients' psychological distress, health behaviors, and autonomic dysfunction may be warranted.

TI  - Early goal-directed therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock: insights and comparisons to ProCESS, ProMISe, and ARISE
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Prior to 2001 there was no standard for early management of severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department. In the presence of standard or usual care, the prevailing mortality was over 40-50 %. In response, a systems-based approach, similar to that in acute myocardial infarction, stroke and trauma, called early goal-directed therapy was compared to standard care and this clinical trial resulted in a significant mortality reduction. Since the publication of that trial, similar outcome benefits have been reported in over 70 observational and randomized controlled studies comprising over 70,000 patients. As a result, early goal-directed therapy was largely incorporated into the first 6 hours of sepsis management (resuscitation bundle) adopted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and disseminated internationally as the standard of care for early sepsis management. Recently a trio of trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe), while reporting an all-time low sepsis mortality, question the continued need for all of the elements of early goal-directed therapy or the need for protocolized care for patients with severe and septic shock. A review of the early hemodynamic pathogenesis, historical development, and definition of early goal-directed therapy, comparing trial conduction methodology and the changing landscape of sepsis mortality, are essential for an appropriate interpretation of these trials and their conclusions.

TI  - The role of trauma scoring in developing trauma clinical governance in the Defence Medical Services
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - This paper discusses mathematical models of expressing severity of injury and probability of survival following trauma and their use in establishing clinical governance of a trauma system. There are five sections: (i) Historical overview of scoring systems-anatomical, physiological and combined systems and the advantages and disadvantages of each. (ii) Definitions used in official statistics-definitions of 'killed in action' and other categories and the importance of casualty reporting rates and comparison across conflicts and nationalities. (iii) Current scoring systems and clinical governance-clinical governance of the trauma system in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) by using trauma scoring models to analyse injury and clinical patterns. (iv) Unexpected outcomes-unexpected outcomes focus clinical governance tools. Unexpected survivors signify good practice to be promulgated. Unexpected deaths pick up areas of weakness to be addressed. Seventy-five clinically validated unexpected survivors were identified over 2 years during contemporary combat operations. (v) Future developments-can the trauma scoring methods be improved? Trauma scoring systems use linear approaches and have significant weaknesses. Trauma and its treatment is a complex system. Nonlinear methods need to be investigated to determine whether these will produce a better approach to the analysis of the survival from major trauma.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia for global and focal ischemic brain injury - A cool way to improve neurologic outcomes
T2  - NEUROLOGIST
AB  - Background: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been employed as a neuroprotective strategy for a wide array of clinical problems since the late 1940s. Animal studies have determined that the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia is pleiotropic, impacting many steps in both the ischemic cascade and reperfusion injury. Interest in the neuroprotective effects of TH for ischernic brain injury has been resurgent, fueled by both recent positive and negative clinical trials. A review of preclinical and clinical reports on TH in adult patients is provided in this article.
   Review Summary: Animal data and several large clinical studies of mild to moderate TH (32 degrees C-34 degrees C) for global cerebral ischemia describe favorable neurologic outcomes, with few adverse effects. However, clinical implementation for global ischernia remains poor. Some animal data support a role for TH in focal cerebral ischernia, if instituted soon after the onset of ischemia, and in the setting of reperfusion. Clinical studies of TH for focal cerebral ischemia have so far been equivocal. The available data suggest that, despite sharing some common components in the ischernic cascade, focal and global cerebral ischemia are pathophysiologically disparate, and may respond to different neuroprotective strategies.
   Conclusion: TH is a safe, effective neuroprotective strategy for global cerebral ischemia. Because of the neuroprotective efficacy of TH in adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, neurologists should advocate the implementation of TH is strategy. TH for focal ischernia is a promising therapeutic option, but requires more basic and clinical investigation.

TI  - Novel Therapeutic Strategies to Reduce Reperfusion Injury After Acute Myocardial Infarction
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - For almost 30 years, urgent revasculariza-tion termed primary percutaneous coronary interven-tion has been a cornerstone of modern care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It lowers mortality and improved cardiovascular outcome compared to con-servative therapy including thrombolysis. Reperfusion injury, which occurs after successful re-opening of the formerly occluded coronary artery, had been exploited as a potential therapeutic target. When revasculariza-tion became faster and primary percutaneous coro-nary intervention was successfully performed within 60-90 minutes of symptom onset, the interest in a potential additive effect of targeting reperfusion injury vanished. More recently, several meta-analyses indi-cated that limiting reperfusion injury prevents micro -vascular obstruction and reduces final infarct size, thereby lowering the probability of heart failure events and improving quality of life in AMI survivors. Here, we describe the current strategies to limit reperfusion injury and to improve post-AMI outcomes such as systemic or intracoronary hypothermia, left -ventricular unloading, intracoronary infusion of super-saturated oxygen, intermittent coronary sinus occlusion, and C-reactive protein apheresis.

TI  - PROMOTING COMPLETION OF HEALTH-CARE PROXIES FOLLOWING HOSPITALIZATION - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN A COMMUNITY-HOSPITAL
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The wider use of written advance directives is popular but problematic. We have shown previously that acute hospitalization in the era of the Patient Self-Determination Act can facilitate directive discussions and documentation. We investigated whether a simple educational intervention following hospitalization would increase patients' execution of durable health care proxies.
   Methods: We studied a consecutive series of patients (n=162) recently discharged from the acute care medical service of a community hospital where they had been interviewed about advance directives. The intervention group was randomized to receive an educational brochure and encouragement to execute durable health care proxies. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group with completed durable health care proxies on file in their primary physicians' offices.
   Results: Overall, only 20 (12.3%) of 162 patients had documented proxies, 17 of whom (85%) were 65 years of age or older, with no difference between the intervention and control groups (11 [13.3%] of 83 vs nine [11.4%] of 79, respectively). Subgroup analysis of elderly patients also revealed no intervention effect. Univariate analysis revealed three significant predictors of patients' proxy completion: patient age, whether patients had discussed directives in hospital with their physicians, and whether patients' physicians completed proxies for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that these three variables interact to predict the probability of patients' executing proxies.
   Conclusions: Simple educational interventions,like those mandated by the Patient Self-Determination Act, are unlikely to increase patients' completion of durable healthcare proxies. Multidimensional interventions that target both elderly patients and their personal physicians should be tested in the future. Discussion in hospital about advance directives can be a useful component of such efforts.

TI  - The lactate to albumin ratio linked to all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with septic myocardial injury
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Background The lactate to albumin ratio (LAR) has emerged as a promising prognostic marker in critically ill patients. Despite its potential utility, the prognostic value of LAR in septic myocardial injury (SMI) remains uncertain.Methods This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of LAR in SMI through a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) (v1.4) database. The study included intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients (age >= 18 years) diagnosed with SMI. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.Results A total of 704 patients were included in the study, of which 59.10% were male. Hospital mortality and ICU mortality rates were recorded at 29.97% and 22.87%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate Cox proportional risk analysis demonstrated that LAR was independently associated with an increased risk of both hospital mortality (HR, 1.39 [95% CI: 1.24-1.56] P < 0.001) and ICU mortality (HR, 1.46 [95% CI: 1.29-1.65] P < 0.001). Furthermore, the generalized additive model (GAM) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) model indicated a linear relationship between LAR and mortality rates in the ICU and hospital.Conclusions The LAR may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in critically ill patients with SMI. High LAR levels are associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and can help identify individuals with high mortality rates. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of using LAR as a tool for risk stratification and management of critically ill patients with SMI.

TI  - Does lactate measurement performed on admission predict clinical outcome on the intensive care unit? A concise systematic review
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Background: There is a need for practical, efficient and effective prognostic markers for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis, to identify patients at highest risk and guide and monitor treatment. Although many biomarkers and scoring systems have been advocated, none have yet achieved this elusive combination. Most ICUs already use blood lactate concentrations to monitor patients but the evidence base for this application is unclear.
   Methods: A systematic review of the last five years of evidence of effectiveness of lactate measurement in prediction of outcome in ICUs was performed.
   Results: It was found that there is a lack of high-quality evidence, and no specific studies of prognostic accuracy. D- or L-Lactate concentrations measured in plasma, serum, whole blood or colonic washings were raised at admission in almost all patient groups, and were higher in patient groups who had the worst outcomes (in-hospital mortality, sequential organ failure). However, there was significant overlap in individual concentrations measured in those who died within 28 days of admission, or who developed multiple organ failure, and those who did not. For serum L-lactate concentrations, no specific cut-off value capable of predicting in-hospital mortality or sequential organ failure could be recommended.
   Conclusions: The evidence reviewed suggested that whole blood, plasma or serum lactate measurement could not provide specific prognostic information for individual patients. There may be a role for monitoring for normalization of serum D- or L-lactate concentrations during goal-directed therapy in the ICU but further good-quality studies are needed. Measurement of the D-lactate stereoisomer shows promise, such that further studies are warranted.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness and outcomes associated with direct peritoneal resuscitation in damage control surgery patients with and without hemorrhagic shock
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Introduction: This narrative review aims to evaluate the efficacy of adjunct direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) in the treatment of adult damage control surgery (DCS) patients both with and without hemorrhagic shock, and its impact on associated outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Cochrane were searched for relevant articles published through April 13th, 2023. Studies assessing the utilization of DPR in adult DCS patients were included. Outcomes included time to abdominal closure, intra-abdominal complications, in-hospital mortality, and ICU length of stay (ICU LOS). Results: Five studies evaluating 437 patients were included. In patients with hemorrhagic shock, DPR was associated with reduced time to abdominal closure (DPR 4.1 days, control 5.9 days, p = 0.002), intra-abdominal complications including abscess formation (DPR 27 %, control 47 %, p = 0.04), and ICU LOS (DPR 8 days, control 11 days, p = 0.004). Findings in patients without hemorrhagic shock were conflicting. Closure times were decreased in one study (DPR 5.9 days, control 7.7 days, p < 0.02) and increased in another study (DPR 3.5 days, control 2.5 days, p = 0.02), intra-abdominal complications were decreased in one study (DPR 27 %, control 47 %, p = 0.04) and similar in another, and ICU LOS was decreased in one study (DPR 17 days, control 24 days, p < 0.002) and increased in another (DPR 13 days, control 11.4 days, p = 0.807). Conclusion: In patients with hemorrhagic shock, adjunct DPR is associated with reduced time to abdominal closure, intra-abdominal complications such as abscesses, fistula, bleeding, anastomotic leak, and ICU LOS. Utilization of DPR in patients without hemorrhagic shock showed promising but inconsistent findings.

TI  - Effectiveness of implementation strategies for the improvement of guideline and protocol adherence in emergency care: a systematic review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective Guideline and protocol adherence in prehospital and in-hospital emergency departments (EDs) is suboptimal. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to identify effective strategies for improving guideline and protocol adherence in prehospital and ED settings.
   Design Systematic review.
   Data sources PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane.
   Methods We selected (quasi) experimental studies published between 2004 and 2018 that used strategies to increase guideline and protocol adherence in prehospital and in-hospital emergency care. Pairs of two independent reviewers performed the selection process, quality assessment and data extraction.
   Results Eleven studies were included, nine of which were performed in the ED setting and two studies were performed in a combined prehospital and ED setting. For the ED setting, the studies indicated that educational strategies as sole intervention, and educational strategies in combination with audit and feedback, are probably effective in improving guideline adherence. Sole use of reminders in the ED setting also showed positive effects. The two studies in the combined prehospital and ED setting showed similar results for the sole use of educational interventions.
   Conclusions Our review does not allow firm conclusion on how to promote guideline and protocol adherence in prehospital emergency care, or the combination of prehospital and ED care. For ED settings, the sole use of reminders or educational interventions and the use of multifaceted strategies of education combined with audit and feedback are all likely to be effective in improving guideline adherence.

TI  - NINDS clinical trials in stroke - Lessons learned and future directions
T2  - STROKE
AB  - Since 1977 the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has sponsored 28 phase 3 trials to evaluate treatments of stroke, which when all completed will have randomized a total of 44 862 patients in the United States and other countries. NINDS stroke clinical trials have been successful in finding beneficial and cost-effective treatments for cerebrovascular disease. Future trials are likely to be larger and have simpler designs which allow for the inclusion of more patients and which collect less data for each patient. In addition, measures of cognitive outcomes, particularly timed tests of executive function, disability scales, and quality-of-life outcomes will become more common. The stroke research community can take pride in the solid base of evidence that has been built over the past 2 decades. If we continue to follow the discoveries of science, continue to create new trial methodology, and increase participation in clinical trials, significant advances in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease will continue.

TI  - Effect of Hydroxyethyl Starch on Postoperative Kidney Function in Patients Having Noncardiac Surgery
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Whether intraoperative use of hydroxyethyl starch impairs kidney function remains unknown. The authors thus tested the primary hypothesis that Hextend promotes renal injury in surgical patients. Secondarily, the authors evaluated the dose-outcome relationship, in-hospital and 90-day mortality, and whether the relationship between colloid use and acute kidney injury (AKI) depends on baseline risk for AKI.
   Methods: The authors evaluated the data of 44,176 adults without preexisting kidney failure who had inpatient noncardiac surgery from 2005 to 2012. Patients given a combination of colloid and crystalloid were propensity matched on morphometric, and baseline characteristics to patients given only crystalloid. The primary analysis was a proportional odds logistic regression with AKI as an ordinal outcome based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network classification.
   Results: The authors matched 14,680 patients receiving colloids with 14,680 patients receiving noncolloids for a total of 29,360 patients. After controlling for potential confounding variables, the odds of developing a more serious level of AKI with Hextend was 21% (6 to 38%) greater than with crystalloid only (P = 0.001). AKI risk increased as a function of colloid volume (P < 0.001). In contrast, the relationship between colloid use and AKI did not differ on baseline AKI risk (P = 0.84). There was no association between colloid use and risk of in-hospital (P = 0.81) or 90-day (P = 0.02) mortality.
   Conclusion: Dose-dependent renal toxicity associated with Hextend in patients having noncardiac surgery is consistent with randomized trials in critical care patients.

TI  - Medical emergency teams are associated with reduced mortality across a major metropolitan health network after two years service: a retrospective study using government administrative data
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Medical emergency teams (MET) are implemented to ensure prompt clinical review of patients with deteriorating physiology with the intention of averting further deterioration, cardiac arrest and death. We sought to determine if MET implementation has led to reductions in hospital mortality across a large metropolitan health network utilising routine administrative data submitted by hospitals to the Department of Health Victoria.
   Methods: The Victorian admissions episodes data set (VAED) contains data on all individual hospital separations in the State of Victoria, Australia. After gaining institutional ethics approval, we extracted data on all acute admissions to metropolitan hospitals for which we had information on the presence and timing of a MET system. Using logistic regression we determined whether there was an effect of MET implementation on mortality controlling for age, gender, Charlson comorbidity diagnostic groupings, emergency admission, same day admission, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, year, indigenous ethnicity, liaison nurse service and hospital designation.
   Results: 5911533 individual admissions and 73,599 associated deaths from July 1999 to June 2010 were included in the analysis. 52.2% were male and median age was 57(42-72 IQR). Mortality rates for MET and non-MET periods were 3.92 (3.88-3.95 95% CI) and 4.56 (4.51-4.61 95% CI) deaths per 1000 patient days with a rate ratio after adjustment for year of 0.88 (0.86-0.89 95% CI) P < 0.001. In a multivariable logistic regression, mortality was associated with a MET team being active in the hospital for more than 2 years. The odds ratio for mortality in hospitals where a MET system had been in place for greater than 4 years duration was 0.90 (0.88-0.92). Mortality during the first 2 years of a MET system being in place was not statistically different from pre-MET periods.
   Conclusions: Utilising routinely collected administrative data we demonstrated that the presence of a hospital MET system for greater than 2 years was associated with an independent reduction in hospital mortality across a major metropolitan health network. Mortality benefits after the introduction of a MET system take time to become apparent.

TI  - Self-supervised pretraining-based prediction of mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury complicated by hemorrhagic shock model development
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS) are among the leading causes of trauma-related mortality worldwide. Studies have shown that when TBI is complicated by HS (TBI + HS), the mortality rate of patients increases significantly due to their complex pathophysiological interactions. Early and precise mortality risk assessment is essential for identifying high-risk TBI + HS patients, allocating healthcare resources, and implementing early treatments to improve clinical outcomes. This study proposes STran-TM, a novel mortality prediction framework designed to enhance prognostic accuracy in TBI + HS patients. STran-TM introduces two key innovations: the incorporation of missing-label variables to extract latent clinical semantics from missing data patterns, and the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) to pre-train a feature extractor for vital sign temporal representations. Using clinical data from the first 12 h after TBI + HS diagnosis, STran-TM predicts 48hour, 7-day, and in-hospital mortality. A total of 272 and 181 TBI + HS patients were selected from the MIMIC-IV and eICU databases, respectively. The model was trained and internally validated on MIMIC-IV, and externally validated on eICU. STran-TM achieved excellent predictive performance for 48-hour mortality (AUC: 0.9530 on MIMIC-IV, 0.8722 on eICU) and 7-day mortality (AUC: 0.8831 on MIMIC-IV, 0.8938 on eICU). Although performance slightly declined for in-hospital mortality (AUC: 0.8314 on MIMIC-IV, 0.8430 on eICU), the model maintained high reliability. By integrating missing-label variables and leveraging SSL, STran-TM enhances predictive performance and demonstrates robust generalizability across databases, offering a promising tool for early risk stratification in TBI + HS patients.

TI  - The impact of wearable continuous vital sign monitoring on deterioration detection and clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Timely recognition of the deteriorating inpatient remains challenging. Wearable monitoring systems (WMS) may augment current monitoring practices. However, there are many barriers to implementation in the hospital environment, and evidence describing the clinical impact of WMS on deterioration detection and patient outcome remains unclear.
   Objective: To assess the impact of vital-sign monitoring on detection of deterioration and related clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients using WMS, in comparison with standard care.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in August 2020 using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Health Technology Assessment databases and grey literature. Studies comparing the use of WMS against standard care for deterioration detection and related clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients were included. Deterioration related outcomes (primary) included unplanned intensive care admissions, rapid response team or cardiac arrest activation, total and major complications rate. Other clinical outcomes (secondary) included in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Exploratory outcomes included alerting system parameters and clinical trial registry information.
   Results: Of 8706 citations, 10 studies with different designs met the inclusion criteria, of which 7 were included in the meta-analyses. Overall study quality was moderate. The meta-analysis indicated that the WMS, when compared with standard care, was not associated with significant reductions in intensive care transfers (risk ratio, RR 0.87; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.66-1.15), rapid response or cardiac arrest team activation (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69-1.01), total (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.44-1.32) and major (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.24-1.30) complications prevalence. There was also no statistically significant association with reduced mortality (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18-1.29) and hospital length of stay (mean difference, MD - 0.09; 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.44).
   Conclusion: This systematic review indicates that there is no current evidence that implementation of WMS impacts early deterioration detection and associated clinical outcomes, as differing design/quality of available studies and diversity of outcome measures make it difficult to reach a definite conclusion. Our narrative findings suggested that alarms should be adjusted to minimise false alarms and promote rapid clinical action in response to deterioration.

TI  - Pre-operative Intraperitoneal Drainage Under Local Anesthesia: A Promising Resuscitation Tool in Peritonitis Secondary to Hollow Viscus Perforation During CORONA Pandemic
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction
   To study the role of intraperitoneal drainage in the resuscitation of patients of perforation peritonitis during corona pandemic.
   Materials and methods
   This retrospective study was conducted in the general surgery department of Nishtar Medical University/Hospital Multan from April-2020 to September-2020. Patients of peritonitis who presented with bilateral pulmonary crepitations, SpO2 less than 92%, PaO2 less than 60 mmhg on arterial blood gas (ABG's), and chest X-ray (CXR) finding of bilateral infiltrates are included. Due to high suspicion of associated coronavirus infection such patients needed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for virus detection and special measures were required for resuscitation before any definitive treatment. A delay of six to eight hours is usually encountered while ensuring proper safety measures and dedicated operation theaters. Initial resuscitation started with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics were given to all patients. Twenty-seven patients were resuscitated with preoperative intraperitoneal drainage while waiting for the report of PCR and 13 patients were resuscitated without drainage. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 19 software. The mean was calculated for age while, frequency and percentages were calculated for gender, comorbidities, and causes of delay. The mortality was compared using the Chi-square test.
   Results
   The mean age of patients was 43.73 +/- 16.04 years. The common cause of peritonitis were perforations due to duodenal ulcer, typhoid, tuberculous (TB), and biliary origin. The variables that led to suspicion of coronavirus were SpO2 < 92%, PaO2 <60rnmHg and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. PCR for coronavirus was positive in nine patients. Mortality was 29.6% in those resuscitated with intraperitoneal drainage before the definitive procedure and 54% in those not resuscitated with intraperitoneal drainage.
   Conclusions
   The surge of coronavirus infection has put the healthcare staff at great risk. This has led to strict protocols and precautionary measures in the management of patients with perforation peritonitis with suspected corona infection. The local guidelines of management of patients with acute abdomen should include aggressive measures right from the start during the corona pandemic. Intraperitoneal drainage, early in the management of perforation peritonitis decreases morbidity and mortality in suspected corona infected patients.

TI  - The gut in trauma
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   The purpose of this review is to describe established and emerging mechanisms of gut injury and dysfunction in trauma, describe emerging strategies to improve gut dysfunction, detail the effect of trauma on the gut microbiome, and describe the gut-brain connection in traumatic brain injury.
   Recent findings
   Newer data suggest intraluminal contents, pancreatic enzymes, and hepatobiliary factors disrupt the intestinal mucosal layer. These mechanisms serve to perpetuate the inflammatory response leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). To date, therapies to mitigate acute gut dysfunction have included enteral nutrition and immunonutrition; emerging therapies aimed to intestinal mucosal layer disruption, however, include protease inhibitors such as tranexamic acid, parenteral nutrition-supplemented bombesin, and hypothermia. Clinical trials to demonstrate benefit in humans are needed before widespread applications can be recommended.
   Summary
   Despite resuscitation, gut dysfunction promotes distant organ injury. In addition, postresuscitation nosocomial and iatrogenic 'hits' exaggerate the immune response, contributing to MODS. This was a provocative concept, suggesting infectious and noninfectious causes of inflammation may trigger, heighten, and perpetuate an inflammatory response culminating in MODS and death. Emerging evidence suggests posttraumatic injury mechanisms, such as intestinal mucosal disruption and shifting of the gut microbiome to a pathobiome. In addition, traumatic brain injury activates the gut-brain axis and increases intestinal permeability.

TI  - C-L Case Conference: Torsades de Pointes in a Patient With Lifelong Medical Trauma, COVID-19, Remdesivir, Citalopram, Quetiapine, and Hemodialysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF CONSULTATION-LIAISON PSYCHIATRY
AB  - We present a case of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) in a patient with COVID-19 infection and multiple TdP risk factors including QT-interval prolongation, hemodialy-sis, bradycardia, and treatment with remdesivir, cit-alopram, and quetiapine. The case was complicated by post-resuscitation anxiety superimposed on a history of medical trauma since childhood. Top experts in the field of consultation-liaison psychiatry, trauma informed care, and cardiac electrophysiology provide perspectives on this case with a review of the literature. Key teaching topics include identification of TdP risk factors in patients with a complex illness; the necessity for prompt electrophysiology consultation in clinical scenarios with high risk for TdP; and the approach to patients with medical trauma using a trauma-informed lens. We highlight the contributions of COVID-19, the pharma-cokinetics of QT-interval-prolonging psychotropic medi-cations, the risks of hemodialysis, and the role of remdesivir-induced bradycardia in this first reported case of TdP in a patient treated with remdesivir.

TI  - Retrospective single-centre descriptive study of the characteristics, management and outcomes of adult patients with suspected sepsis in the emergency department
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background Guidelines for adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected sepsis recommend protocols and bundles that promote rapid and potentially intensive treatment, but give little consideration of how patient characteristics, such as age, functional status and comorbidities, might influence management. This study aimed to describe the characteristics, management and outcomes of adults attending the ED with suspected sepsis, and specifically describe the prevalence of comorbidities, functional impairment and escalations of care. Methods We undertook a single-centre retrospective observational study involving medical record review of a random sample of adults admitted to an ED between February 2018 and January 2019 with suspected sepsis. Descriptive statistics were used with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for key proportions. Results We included 509 patients (median age 74 years), of whom 49.3% met the Sepsis-3 criteria. Less than half of the patients were living at home independently (42.5%) or could walk independently (41.5%), 19.3% were care home residents and 89.2% of patients had one or more comorbidity. 22% had a pre-existing do not attempt resuscitation order. 6.5% were referred to intensive care, and 34.3% of the 13.2% who died in-hospital had an escalation plan explicitly documented. Conclusion Adults with suspected sepsis have substantial functional limitations, comorbidities and treatment directives that should be considered in guidelines, especially recommendations for escalation of care.

TI  - The Protocolised Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial statistical analysis plan
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The Protocolised Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial is an open, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early, goaldirected, protocolised resuscitation compared with usual resuscitation for patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in the United Kingdom with early signs of severe sepsis or septic shock. The rationale for the ProMISe trial derives from a single-centre United States RCT that reported a reduction in hospital mortality from 46.5% to 30.5%.
   Objective: To describe the proposed statistical analyses for the evaluation of clinical effectiveness for the ProMISe trial. It is important to complete this plan before inspecting the data, and before completion of two related international studies, so that post-hoc, data-derived decisions are avoided.
   Methods: The primary and secondary outcomes were defined precisely, and the approach to safety monitoring and data collection summarised, with a description of the planned statistical analyses including prespecified subgroup and secondary analyses.
   Results: The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 90 days. The primary analysis will be reported as a relative risk and absolute risk reduction and tested with the Fisher exact test. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be based on age, baseline Medical Emergency Department Sepsis score, baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and time from ED presentation to randomisation. Secondary analyses include adjustment for baseline covariates, estimation of learning curve effects and adjustment for noncompliance.
   Conclusion: In keeping with best practice, we have developed a statistical analysis plan for the ProMISe trial and place it in the public domain before inspecting data from the trial.

TI  - Correcting for case-mix shift when developing clinical prediction models
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundWhen developing a clinical prediction model (CPM), a case-mix shift could occur in the development dataset where the distribution of individual predictors changes, potentially affecting model performance. This study exploits the case-mix shift that is already observed in the development dataset to address the case-mix shift between the development and deployment phase of a CPM.MethodsWe propose a Membership-based method to correct for case-mix shift in the development phase of CPMs. This method uses a probabilistic similarity metric to re-weight data samples in the source set (before the case-mix shift) to more closely match the target set (after the case-mix shift), assuming the target set reflects the target population. We apply the proposed method in a real-world dataset of myocardial infarction patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within 90 days as the outcome. We design nine scenarios (including case-mix shift and no case-mix shift with a range of target/source sets sample sizes) to explore the impact on predictive performance of CPM developed with the proposed method in comparison to CPMs developed by either using all data samples but ignore the shift, or only using the most recent data. We report calibration and discrimination on development and 200 bootstrap samples.Results and ConclusionsThe proposed method shows promise in accounting for case-mix shift when developing a CPM, particularly when the target set sample size is insufficient. In a partial case-mix shift scenario with an insufficient target sample size, the Membership-based model achieved an optimism-adjusted calibration slope (c-slope) of 0.98, outperforming other models. Conversely, when the target set sample size is sufficient, the Unweighted model on target data only had an optimism-adjusted c-slope of 0.95, compared to 0.92 for the Membership-based model. In complete case-mix shift cases, the Membership-based and Unweighted on target data only models performed similarly. Both achieved an optimism-adjusted c-slope of 0.77 with insufficient target sample size, and optimism-adjusted c-slope of 0.94 with a sufficient target sample size. Further investigation and testing are needed, as well as accounting for other types of data distribution shift to improve model fit for the latest distribution shift in the development dataset.

TI  - Personalizing Risk Stratification for Sudden Death in Dilated Cardiomyopathy The Past, Present, and Future
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Results from the DANISH Study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heat Failure on Mortality) suggest that for many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators do not increase longevity. Accurate identification of patients who are more likely to die of an arrhythmia and less likely to die of other causes is required to ensure improvement in outcomes and wise use of resources. Until now, left ventricular ejection fraction has been used as a key criterion for selecting patients with DCM for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention purposes. However, registry data suggest that many patients with DCM and an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not have a markedly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, many patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction die of nonsudden causes of death. Methods to predict a higher or lower risk of sudden death include the detection of myocardial fibrosis (a substrate for ventricular arrhythmia), microvolt T-wave alternans (a marker of electrophysiological vulnerability), and genetic testing. Midwall fibrosis is identified by late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in approximate to 30% of patients and provides incremental value in addition to left ventricular ejection fraction for the prediction of sudden cardiac death events. Microvolt T-wave alternans represents another promising predictor, supported by large meta-analyses that have highlighted the negative predictive value of this test. However, neither of these strategies have been routinely adopted for risk stratification in clinical practice. More convincing data from randomized trials are required to inform the management of patients with these features. Understanding of the genetics of DCM and how specific mutations affect arrhythmic risk is also rapidly increasing. The finding of a mutation in lamin A/C, the cause of approximate to 6% of idiopathic DCM, commonly underpins more aggressive management because of the malignant nature of the associated phenotype. With the expansion of genetic sequencing, the identification of further high-risk mutations appears likely, leading to better-informed clinical decision making and providing insight into disease mechanisms. Over the next 5 to 10 years, we expect these techniques to be integrated into the existing algorithm to form a more sensitive, specific, and cost-effective approach to the selection of patients with DCM for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.

The aims are to reduce variation caused by discontinuity of care; avoid harms caused by inappropriate treatment and promote patients' priorities and preferences. The TEP is based on the goals of treatment - 'What are we trying to achieve?' The goals take account of the context of acute illness, the consequences of interventions and discussion with the patient. They should reflect a shift away from 'fix-it' medicine to what is realistic and pragmatic. A TEP has three escalation categories: full escalation, selected appropriate treatments and palliative/supportive care. Other appropriate/inappropriate treatments are also recorded. Treatment Escalation Plans are associated with significant reductions in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, non-beneficial interventions, harms and complaints. Treatment Escalation Plans contribute to staff well-being by reducing uncertainty. Successful implementation requires training and education in medical decision-making and communication skills.

TI  - Sepsis in pregnancy and the puerperium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC ANESTHESIA
AB  - Sepsis remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Recognition and treatment of maternal sepsis are often delayed due to the physiological adaptations of pregnancy and vague or absent signs and symptoms during its initial presentation. Over the past decade, our understanding of sepsis has evolved and maternal early warning systems have been developed in an effort to help providers promptly identify and stratify parturients who are at risk. In addition, new consensus definitions and care bundles have recently been published by the World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign to facilitate earlier recognition and timely management of sepsis. In this narrative review, we summarize the available evidence about sepsis and provide an overview of the research efforts focused on maternal sepsis to date. Controversies and challenges surrounding the anesthetic management of parturients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis during pregnancy or the puerperium will be highlighted.

TI  - Phosphatidylserine expressing platelet microparticle levels at hospital presentation are decreased in sepsis non-survivors and correlate with thrombocytopenia
T2  - THROMBOSIS RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Sepsis induced platelet activation releases platelet microparticles (PMPs). PMPs express phosphatidylserine (PS) and can serve as a scaffold for the prothrombinase complex, thereby promoting coagulation. Studies of PMPs in intensive care unit sepsis patients demonstrate mixed results, while the earliest changes and potential effects of clinical interventions remain understudied. We hypothesized PMPs would be associated with patient outcome and dysfunctional coagulation shortly after emergency department presentation with sepsis.
   Methods: Cohort study of patients from a single center enrolled in a previously published randomized control trial comparing two early resuscitation strategies. Adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected infection, >= 2 SIRS criteria, and either systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or lactate > 4 mmol/L were eligible. Triple positive platelet microparticles (PMPs) expressing phosphatidylserine and integrin complexes alphallb (CD41) and beta3 (CD61) were quantitated using plasma from the time of enrollment. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included platelet count, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and prothrombin time (PT).
   Results: 193 patients were enrolled and 184 had samples available. In-hospital mortality was 21%. 10 (5%) patients developed DIC. Median platelet count was 197 (IQR 135, 280) and PT was 13.2 (IQR 11.9, 16.8). Median triple positive PMP counts were 932 per mu L (IQR 381, 1872). PMPs were significantly lower in non-survivors (575 vs 1128, p = 0.02) and non-significantly lower in DIC (387 vs 942, p = 0.17). PMPs demonstrated a positive linear association with platelet count (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.21). After adjusting for platelet count, PMPs were no longer significant predictors of mortality (p = 0.28). We observed no association between PMPs and PT.
   Conclusion: Similar to patients enrolled later in the intensive care unit, PS-expressing PMPs are lower in emergency department sepsis non-survivors. These changes primarily reflect the degree of thrombocytopenia, and an independent prognostic role was not observed. Future studies should control for platelet count in assessment of PMP prognosis in sepsis.

TI  - Giant acute epidural hematoma after ventriculoperitoneal shunt: a case report and literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid over-drainage is a common complication of ventriculoperitoneal devices. In terms of haemorrhage, subdural haematomas are usually more frequent lesions than epidural hematomas, which, more rarely, may also be seen after ventricular shunt procedures and may lead to rapid neurological decline and even death unless a surgical procedure can be promptly performed. This study reports the case of a 47 years-old Dandy Walker man, with clinical condition compatible with the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus submitted to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt with a high fixed pressure valve. After discharge, on the second day after the procedure, he presented with headache and impaired level of consciousness. At hospital admission he was in a coma and anisochoric. Underwent endotracheal intubation and a head CT, showed epidural hematoma. We performed emergency craniotomy to drain the hematoma, the patient died in the operating room despite resuscitation attempts. In conclusion, prompt diagnosis and emergency craniotomy is recommended in these cases. We must be aware of this possible evolution and maintain high suspicion besides a longer in-hospital observation after these procedures.

TI  - Evaluating Sepsis Management and Patient Outcomes: A Comprehensive Retrospective Study of Clinical and Treatment Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background/Objectives: Sepsis, as a major cause of mortality worldwide, requires timely diagnosis and prompt treatment to improve patient outcomes. In this study, we evaluated sepsis management strategies and their impact on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted by analyzing clinical and treatment data from the electronic records of sepsis patients who had been admitted to tertiary care hospitals in eastern Saudi Arabia. Using systematic sampling, the details of eligible patients were obtained. Data were collected on patient demographics, vital signs, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and laboratory parameters, treatment (antibiotic therapy, vasopressor use, or fluid resuscitation), and outcomes (survival in hospital). Statistical analyses were performed to assess the association between clinical and treatment strategies and patient outcomes. Results: A total of 234 sepsis cases were analyzed, of which 70.9% were survivors and 29.1% were non-survivors. Patients aged 60 years and above were the most affected. Statistically significant differences were observed across all of the measured vital sign variables and outcomes (p < 0.0001). Based on SOFA scores, 56.41% of patients were assessed as having a moderate risk. Through our comparison of clinical and laboratory parameters between survivors and non-survivors, significant differences were found in all of the measured variables (p < 0.0001). The odds of survival were significantly higher in those who received early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR = 4.9449, p = 0.0001), vasopressor therapy (OR = 1.9408, p = 0.0262), and fluid resuscitation OR = 11.035, p = 0.0001). Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the importance of early sepsis recognition, prompt antibiotic therapy, and standardized protocol adherence in improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality and morbidity.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia for stroke: Unique challenges at the bedside
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia has shown promise as a means to improving neurological outcomes at several neurological conditions. At the clinical level, it has been shown to improve outcomes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and in neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, but has yet to be convincingly demonstrated in stroke. While numerous preclinical studies have shown benefit in stroke models, translating this to the clinical level has proven challenging. Major obstacles include cooling patients with typical stroke who are awake and breathing spontaneously but often have significant comorbidities. Solutions around these problems include selective brain cooling and cooling to lesser depths or avoiding hyperthermia. This review will cover the mechanisms of protection by therapeutic hypothermia, as well as recent progress made in selective brain cooling and the neuroprotective effects of only slightly lowering brain temperature. Therapeutic hypothermia for stroke has been shown to be feasible, but has yet to be definitively proven effective. There is clearly much work to be undertaken in this area.

TI  - The EEG in coma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Neurophysiology-Society
AB  - The EEG allows insight into thalamocortical function in comatose patients when this is inaccessible clinically. A single EEG can help with broad diagnostic categorization whereas continuous or serial EEG provides monitoring for unstable and potentially treatable conditions and for monitoring the effects of therapy, The EEG plays a supplemental role in establishing the prognosis in disease states that are capable of causing neuronal death. The most prevalent and problematic of these conditions involves survivors of cardiac arrest who are initially in coma with intact brainstem reflexes. In such patients single EEGs are of 100% specificity for no possibility of recovery of consciousness only for essentially complete generalized suppression (<10 <mu>V) after the first day of the arrest. Several other generalized patterns, including less marked suppression, burst-suppression, epileptiform activity, periodic complexes, and alpha-Theta coma patterns, usually but not invariably indicate a poor outcome. Serial EEGs, continuous raw and automated "trending," testing of reactivity, and the inclusion of multiple variables hold promise for an improved role in the prognostic determination in these patients.

TI  - Automated Analysis of Background EEG and Reactivity During Therapeutic Hypothermia in Comatose Patients After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Visual analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) background and reactivity during therapeutic hypothermia provides important outcome information, but is time-consuming and not always consistent between reviewers. Automated EEG analysis may help quantify the brain damage. Forty-six comatose patients in therapeutic hypothermia, after cardiac arrest, were included in the study. EEG background was quantified with burst-suppression ratio (BSR) and approximate entropy, both used to monitor anesthesia. Reactivity was detected through change in the power spectrum of signal before and after stimulation. Automatic results obtained almost perfect agreement (discontinuity) to substantial agreement (background reactivity) with a visual score from EEG-certified neurologists. Burst-suppression ratio was more suited to distinguish continuous EEG background from burst-suppression than approximate entropy in this specific population. Automatic EEG background and reactivity measures were significantly related to good and poor outcome. We conclude that quantitative EEG measurements can provide promising information regarding current state of the patient and clinical outcome, but further work is needed before routine application in a clinical setting.

TI  - Hyperthermia and fever control in brain injury
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Fever in the neurocritical care setting is common and has a negative impact on outcome of all disease types. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that fever at onset and in the acute setting after ischemic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest has a negative impact on morbidity and mortality. Data support that the impact of fever is sustained for longer durations after subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. Recent advances have made eliminating fever and maintaining normothermia feasible. However, there are no prospective randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of fever control in these patient populations, and important questions regarding indications and timing remain. The purpose of this review is to analyze the data surrounding the impact of fever across a range of neurologic injuries to better understand the optimal timing and duration of fever control. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine whether the beneficial impact of secondary injury prevention is outweighed by the potential risks of prolonged fever control.

TI  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA IN NEUROCRITICAL PATIENTS
T2  - MEDICINA INTENSIVA
AB  - Induced hypothermia in neurocritical patients is one of the most promising neuroprotective therapies in the last decade. Unfortunately, the promising results obtained in experimental studies have had an unequal reflection in the different diseases that affect the neurocritical patient. The use of therapeutic hypothermia is clearly established in patients with neurological deterioration after cardiac arrest. On the contrary, its use in patients with traumatic brain injury is highly controversial. There is not enough evidence in stroke and hemorrhagic patients to support its use except in clinical trials.
   Nowadays, the greater understanding of the pathophysiology of secondary brain damage, the good clinical results obtained in randomized clinical trials in patients with cerebral anoxia after ventricular fibrillation and the new cooling methods that have appeared have improved the interest of hypothermia in neurocritical patients.
   Induced hypothermia has a role in the intensive care unit. Critical care physicians should be familiar with the physiologic effects, current indications, techniques, and complications of induced hypothermia. This review elaborates on the clinical implications of hypothermia research in traumatic brain injury, anoxic, brain injury, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage.

TI  - Outcomes of Palliative Care Consultations for Hospitalized Patients With Liver Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Context. Although palliative care (PC) has been shown to improve symptoms and end-of-life (EOL) care for patients with cancer, data are lacking on the patterns of use and outcomes of PC consultations for hospitalized patients with liver disease.
   Objectives. We sought to characterize the patterns of use and outcomes of PC consultations for hospitalized patients with liver disease compared with patients with cancer.
   Methods. We conducted an observational study using data from the Palliative Care Quality Network (PCQN). The PCQN contains prospectively collected data on 135,197 hospitalized patients receiving PC consultations at 88 PCQN sites between January 2013 and December 2017. The PCQN data set includes patient demographics, processes of care, and patient-level clinical outcomes.
   Results. The cohort included 44,933 patients, of whom 4402 (9.8%) had liver disease and 40,531 (90.2%) had cancer. Patients with liver disease were younger (58.9 years vs. 65.2 years, P < 0.0001) and had higher in-hospital mortality (28% vs. 16.8%, P < 0.0001). Patients with liver disease were more likely to receive PC consultations to address goals of care (81.7% vs. 67.9%, P < 0.0001) as opposed to pain management (10.9% vs. 34.9%, P < 0.0001). Both groups had similar rates of symptom improvement and change in resuscitation preferences after PC consultation.
   Conclusion. Hospitalized patients with liver disease were more likely to have a PC referral to address goals of care compared with those with cancer and were more likely to die in the hospital. Despite late PC consultations, patients with liver disease experienced improvement in symptoms and clarification of their goals of care, similar to those with cancer.

TI  - Gender-specific predictors of early mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery
T2  - CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Female gender is a risk factor for early mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Yet, the causes for this excess mortality in women have not been fully explained.
   To analyse gender differences in early mortality (30 days post surgery) after CABG and to identify variables explaining the association between female gender and excess mortality, taking into account preoperative clinical and psychosocial, surgical and postoperative risk factors.
   A total of 1,559 consecutive patients admitted to the German Heart Institute Berlin (2005-2008) for CABG were included in this prospective study. A comprehensive set of prespecified preoperative, surgical and postoperative risk factors were examined for their ability to explain the gender difference in early mortality.
   Early mortality after CABG was higher in women than in men (6.9 vs. 2.4 %, HR 2.91, 95 % CI 1.70-4.96, P < 0.001). Women were older than men (+4.7 years, P < 0.001), had lower self-assessed preoperative physical functioning (-16 points on a scale from 0 to 100, P < 0.001), and had higher rates of postoperative low cardiac output syndromes (6.6 vs. 3.3 %, P = 0.01), respiratory insufficiency (9.4 vs. 5.3 %, P = 0.006) and resuscitation (5.2 vs. 1.8 %, P = 0.001). The combination of these factors explained 71 % of the gender difference in early mortality; age and physical functioning alone accounted for 61 %. Adjusting for these variables, HR for female gender was 1.36 (95 % CI 0.77-2.41, P = 0.29).
   Age, physical function and postoperative complications are key mediators of the overmortality of women after aortocoronary bypass surgery. Self-assessed physical functioning should be more seriously considered in preoperative risk assessment particularly in women.

TI  - Consequences of 'conversations not had': insights into failures in communication affecting delays in hospital discharge for older people living with frailty
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH & POLICY
AB  - Objectives
   Older people living with frailty (OPLWF) are often unable to leave hospital even if they no longer need acute care. The aim of this study was to elicit the views of health care professionals in England on the barriers to effective discharge of OPLWF.
   Methods
   We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital-based doctors and nurses with responsibility for discharging OPLWF from one large urban acute care hospital in England. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method.
   Results
   We conducted interviews with 17 doctors (12 senior doctors or consultants and 5 doctors in training) and six senior nurses. Some of our findings reflect well-known barriers to hospital discharge including service fragmentation, requiring skilled coordination that was often not available due to high volumes of work, and poor communication between staff from different organizations. Participants' accounts also referred to less frequently documented factors that affect decision making and the organization of patient discharges. These raised uncomfortable emotions and tensions that were often ignored or avoided. One participant referred to 'conversations not had', or failures in communication, because difficult topics about resuscitation, escalation of treatment and end-of-life care for OPLWF were not addressed.
   Conclusions
   The consequences of not initiating important conversations about decisions relating to the end of life are potentially far reaching not only regarding reduced efficiency due to delayed discharges but also for patients' quality of life and care. As the population of older people is rising, this becomes a key priority for all practitioners in health and social care. Evidence to support practitioners, OPLWF and their families is needed to ensure that these vital conversations take place so that care at the end of life is humane and compassionate.

TI  - Early prediction of in-hospital deterioration after emergency department admission using machine learning models
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Early prediction of clinical deterioration in patients admitted to general wards from the emergency department (ED) is crucial for timely interventions and improved outcomes. Traditional scoring systems often fail to account for dynamic physiological changes occurring during ED stays. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative by integrating comprehensive patient data for enhanced predictive capabilities.<br /> Objective This study aimed to develop and validate an ML-based early warning system to predict adverse events, including cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, within 48 h of hospitalization.<br /> Methods This retrospective multicenter study included data from 169,807 patients across two medical centers to train ML models for predicting adverse events occurring within 48 h of hospitalization. The prediction time origin (T0) was the moment of hospital admission. All ED data obtained before T0 were included as model input, and adverse events were defined as those occurring within 48 h after T0. Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB).The ML models were evaluated in external test cohorts with 54,515 patients from a regional teaching hospital. Model performance was assessed against traditional early warning scores, including the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and Modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (mSOFA) using the area under the curve (AUC).<br /> Results In the internal test set, XGB achieved the highest AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.85-0.89), followed by RF 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87) and LR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81-0.85), outperforming NEWS (AUC 0.71), MEWS (0.69), and mSOFA (0.69). In the external test set, XGB maintained the best discrimination (AUC 0.82, 95% CI: 0.80-0.83), followed by RF 0.78 (95% CI: 0.77-0.80) and LR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79), again exceeding NEWS (0.67), MEWS (0.65), and mSOFA (0.69). SHAP analyses identified respiratory rate and oxygen support as the most influential predictors. Conclusion The ML-based early warning system demonstrated strong predictive performance across diverse healthcare settings, significantly surpassing the capabilities of traditional scoring systems. This approach has the potential to improve risk stratification and enable timely interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

TI  - Hemorrhagic Shock in Isolated and Non-Isolated Pelvic Fractures: A Registries-Based Study
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background Pelvic fractures resulting from high-energy trauma can frequently present with life-threatening hemodynamic instability that is associated with high mortality rates. The role of pelvic exsanguination in causing hemorrhagic shock is unclear, as associated injuries frequently accompany pelvic fractures. This study aims to compare the incidence of hemorrhagic shock and in-hospital outcomes in patients with isolated and non-isolated pelvic fractures. Methods Registries-based study of trauma patients hospitalized following pelvic fractures. Data from 1997 to 2021 were cross-referenced between the Israel Defense Forces Trauma Registry (IDF-TR), documenting prehospital care, and Israel National Trauma Registry (INTR) recording hospitalization data. Patients with isolated pelvic fractures were defined as having an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) <3 in other anatomical regions, and compared with patients sustaining pelvic fracture and at least one associated injury (AIS >= 3). Signs of profound shock upon emergency department (ED) arrival were defined as either a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and/or a heart rate >130 beats per min. Results Overall, 244 hospitalized trauma patients with pelvic fractures were included, most of whom were males (84.4%) with a median age of 21 years. The most common injury mechanisms were motor vehicle collisions (64.8%), falls from height (13.1%) and gunshot wounds (11.5%). Of these, 68 (27.9%) patients sustained isolated pelvic fractures. In patients with non-isolated fractures, the most common regions with a severe associated injury were the thorax and abdomen. Signs of shock were recorded for 50 (20.5%) patients upon ED arrival, but only four of these had isolated pelvic fractures. In-hospital mortality occurred among 18 (7.4%) patients, all with non-isolated fractures. Conclusion In young patients with pelvic fractures, severe associated injuries were common, but isolated pelvic fractures rarely presented with profound shock upon arrival. Prehospital management protocols for pelvic fractures should prioritize prompt evacuation and resuscitative measures aimed at addressing associated injuries.

TI  - Do-not-resuscitate orders in trauma patients may bias mortality-based effect estimates: An evaluation using the PROMMTT study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders has not been systematically evaluated in acute trauma research. We determined the frequency, timing, and impact on mortality-based effect estimates for patients with DNR orders in the Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study.
   METHODS: Trauma patients surviving at least 30 minutes and transfused one or greater unit of red blood cell within 6 hours of admission (n = 1,245) from 10 Level 1 centers were enrolled. We report descriptive statistics and results from survival analysis to compare the association of blood product transfusion ratios with outcome defined as mortality and as a composite, DNR, and death.
   RESULTS: DNRs were reported for 95 patients (7.6%), with 94 in-hospital deaths. There were 172 deaths without DNRs. Of 90 known DNR order times, the median was 53 hours (interquartile range, 9-186 hours) after admission; the median DNR-to-death time was 10 hours (2-32 hours). DNRs were for comfort measures only (43%), no cardiopulmonary resuscitation (40%), and no intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (16%). Compared with the 116 non-DNR deaths that occurred after the earliest DNR order (2 hours), the DNR decedents were significantly older with a less severe base deficit, fewer red blood cell and plasma transfusions, and a later median time of death (98 [21-230] hours vs. 17 [4-91] hours). In multivariable Cox models that accounted for time-varying blood product ratios, the associations were consistent, regardless of whether outcome was defined as mortality or the composite.
   CONCLUSION: DNR orders were instituted after the 24-hour period of highest mortality risk and more often in older patients not in severe shock. Findings from the primary PROMMTT analyses of the impact of blood product ratios on survival did not materially change when the original mortality outcome was redefined as a composite of DNR or death. DNR orders are potentially an important mediating variable that should be systematically evaluated in trauma research. (Copyright (C) 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)

TI  - Amniotic fluid embolism and uterine atony-two case reports and a literature review
T2  - WIENER MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB  - BackgroundAmniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation and triggering a cytokine storm. The incidence of AFE varies across different populations and studies, ranging from 1.9 to 6.1 cases per 100,000 deliveries. It can be classified into two clinical types: the cardiopulmonary collapse type (or classic type) and the disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) type involving atonic bleeding and rapid deterioration of coagulopathy. Here we present the cases of two multiparous women who experienced DIC-type AFE during labor, resulting in uterine atony and emergency peripartum hysterectomy.ReportsWe present two cases: the first of a 38-year-old multiparous pregnant woman at 39 weeks' gestation who was admitted for induction of labor due to a placental disorder, and the second of a 39-year-old multiparous woman at 38 weeks' gestation who was admitted for induction of labor due to intrauterine fetal death. In both cases, after vaginal delivery and delivery of the placenta, the puerpera developed uterine atony, postpartum hemorrhage, and hypovolemic shock, with laboratory findings demonstrating disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Conservative treatment with parenteral fluid resuscitation, transfusion of blood units, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, fibrinogen, and uterotonics showed no significant effect and emergency peripartum hysterectomy was performed. Pathohistological examination of the uterus revealed thrombosis of the vascular spaces and amniotic fluid embolism. Both patients were discharged from hospital and proper recovery was confirmed at follow-up examinations.ConclusionAmniotic fluid embolism is a rare and potentially fatal condition. Prompt resuscitative efforts and emergency treatment are crucial for improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.
   HintergrundEine Fruchtwasserembolie (AFE) ist eine lebensbedrohliche Erkrankung, die durch den Eintritt von Fruchtwasser in den m & uuml;tterlichen Kreislauf gekennzeichnet ist und einen ,,Zytokinsturm" ausl & ouml;st. Die Inzidenz der AFE variiert je nach Population und Studien und liegt zwischen 1,9 und 6,1 F & auml;llen pro 100.000 Geburten. AFE kann in 2 klinische Typen eingeteilt werden: den kardiopulmonalen Kollaps (klassischer Typ) und die disseminierte intravaskul & auml;re Koagulopathie (DIC), die mit atonischen Blutungen und einer raschen Verschlechterung der Koagulopathie einhergeht. Wir pr & auml;sentieren hier 2 F & auml;lle einer 38- und einer 39-j & auml;hrigen Mehrgeb & auml;renden, die w & auml;hrend der Wehen eine AFE vom DIC-Typ erlitten, die zu einer Uterusatonie und einer notfallm & auml;ss igen peripartalen Hysterektomie f & uuml;hrte.KasuistikenWir pr & auml;sentieren 2 F & auml;lle: den ersten Fall einer 38-j & auml;hrigen Mehrgeb & auml;renden in der 39. Schwangerschaftswoche, die wegen einer Plazentast & ouml;rung zur Geburtseinleitung eingeliefert wurde, und den zweiten Fall einer 39-j & auml;hrigen Mehrgeb & auml;renden in der 38. Schwangerschaftswoche, die wegen intrauterinen Fruchttods zur Geburtseinleitung eingeliefert wurde. In beiden F & auml;llen entwickelten sich nach vaginaler Entbindung und Plazentaausl & ouml;sung im Wochenbett eine Uterusatonie, eine postpartale Blutung und ein hypovol & auml;mischer Schock. Laborbefunde belegten eine DIC. Konservative Behandlungen mit parenteraler Fl & uuml;ssigkeitstherapie, Bluttransfusionen, gefrorenem Frischplasma, Thrombozyten, Fibrinogen und Uterotonika zeigten keinen signifikanten Erfolg, und es wurde eine notfallm & auml;ss ige peripartale Hysterektomie durchgef & uuml;hrt. Die pathohistologische Untersuchung der Geb & auml;rmutter ergab eine Thrombose der Gef & auml;ss r & auml;ume und eine Fruchtwasserembolie. Beide Patientinnen wurden aus dem Krankenhaus entlassen, und bei Nachuntersuchungen wurde eine ordnungsgem & auml;ss e Genesung best & auml;tigt.SchlussfolgerungEine Fruchtwasserembolie ist eine seltene und potenziell t & ouml;dliche Erkrankung. Schnelle Wiederbelebungsma ss nahmen und Notfallbehandlungen sind entscheidend f & uuml;r die Verbesserung der m & uuml;tterlichen und neonatalen Prognose.

TI  - Teaching paediatric ward teams to recognise and manage the deteriorating child
T2  - NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Issues around the deterioration of hospitalised children are known: the failure to observe and monitor patients adequately, a failure to recognise the deteriorating patient, a failure to communicative effectively within the healthcare team and a failure to respond appropriately or in a timely manner (Pearson, 2008; NPSA, 2009). In response to this, a new 1-day course called RESPOND (Recognising Signs of Paediatric hOspital iNpatients Deterioration) was developed. Objectives To describe the development of the RESPOND course and present a preliminary evaluation of the first four courses. Methods A written postcourse survey was completed by participants (junior doctors, medical students, nurses and health care assistants) immediately after the course and an electronic survey completed three months later in a large children's hospital in the North West of England. Data were analysed descriptively and by simple thematic analysis of free text responses. Results Sixty-five participants undertook the RESPOND course over four separate days. Overwhelmingly participants found the course positive, with the most frequently cited benefit being improved multidisciplinary communication. Despite a poor response to the second survey, 18% (12 of 65) of respondents remained positive about the impact of the course. Conclusions and relevance to practice This preliminary evaluation combined with a reduction in hospital cardiac arrest rates suggest that the multiprofessional RESPOND course (in conjunction with an early warning tool and response system) is successful as part of a targeted strategy to promote patient safety within a children's hospital.

TI  - Risk factors for mortality in elderly and very elderly critically ill patients with sepsis: a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - BackgroundAge has been traditionally considered a risk factor for mortality in elderly patients admitted to intensive care units. The aim of this prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study is to determine the risk factors for mortality in elderly and very elderly critically ill patients with sepsis.ResultsA total of 1490 patients with 65years of age were included in the study; most of them 1231 (82.6%) had a cardiovascular failure. The mean age (SD) was 74.5 (+/- 5.6)years, and 876 (58.8%) were male. The patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) elderly: 65-79years and (2) very elderly: 80years. The overall hospital mortality was 48.8% (n=727) and was significantly higher in very elderly compared to elderly patients (54.2% vs. 47.4%; p=0.02). Factors independently associated with mortality were APACHE II score of the disease, patient location at sepsis diagnosis, development of acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia in the group of elderly patients. On the other hand, in the group of very elderly patients, predictors of hospital mortality were age, APACHE II score, and prompt adherence of the resuscitation bundle.Conclusion This prospective multicenter study found that patients aged 80 or over had higher hospital mortality compared to patients between 65 and 79years. Age was found to be an independent risk factor only in the very elderly group, and prompt therapy provided within the first 6h of resuscitation was associated with a reduction in hospital mortality in the very elderly patients.

TI  - Mortality and clinical outcomes in paediatric septic shock: a propensity-matched analysis before and after the implementation of an institutional guideline in single centre in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - Paediatric septic shock is a life-threatening condition with high global morbidity and mortality rates. Prior guidelines for paediatric septic shock demonstrated varying levels of effectiveness. In 2017, the institutional paediatric septic shock guidelines were established, emphasizing three pivotal components: prompt recognition, early and appropriate resuscitation, and organ support with intensive stabilization. Herein, we aimed to assess the effect of paediatric septic shock guidelines on mortality and clinical outcomes. This single-centre retrospective cohort study investigating the pre- and postimplementation of paediatric septic shock guidelines was conducted in patients aged 1 month to 15 years diagnosed with septic shock from January 2014 to December 2022. The effectiveness of the guideline implementation was evaluated through propensity matching analysis to compare 30-day in-hospital mortality rates. Adherence to key components of the guidelines was also assessed. In total, 71 and 106 paediatric patients with septic shock were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit during the pre- and postguideline periods, respectively. The postguideline group exhibited a significant reduction in mortality [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.71, P = .007] and a decrease in respiratory dysfunction (aOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18-0.91, P = .03). Guideline adherence revealed a substantial increase in the use of peripheral inotropes and noninvasive cardiac monitoring. The number needed to treat for the protocol to prevent death was six. The implementation of the paediatric septic shock guidelines, emphasizing early shock recognition, prompt resuscitation, infection control, and appropriate organ management in intensive care, significantly improved outcomes.

TI  - Predictors of Mortality and Amputation in Patients With Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections of the Upper Extremity
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
AB  - Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) of the upper extremity is characterized by rapid progression, local tissue necrosis, systemic toxicity, and a high mortality rate. The negative consequences of debridement are balanced against preservation of life and limb. The primary objective of this study was to identify predictors of mortality in upper extremity NSTI. Secondary objectives were to identify predictors of amputation, final defect size, length of stay, and readmission within 30 days.
   Methods An institutional registry for patients with NSTI was retrospectively queried from a single tertiary center covering a large referral population. Data on confirmed upper extremity NSTI were used to determine patient characteristics, infection data, and operative factors. Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores were calculated from primary data to provide a measure of clinical severity. Bivariate screening identifying possible predictors of mortality and multivariable regression was performed to control for confounding. Similar analyses were performed for amputation, final defect size, and readmission within 30 days.
   Results A total of 99 patients met the study criteria. In-hospital mortality occurred in 12 patients, and amputation was performed in 7 patients. Etiology, causative organism, and clinical severity scores were variable. Logistic regression showed mortality to be independently predicted by vasopressor dependency outside of operative anesthesia. The relatively low number of case events, limited sample size, and multiple comparisons limited the evaluation of lesser predictor variables. The LRINEC score did not strongly predict amputation or death in this series.
   Conclusions Necrotizing soft tissue infection of the upper extremity carries risk of mortality and amputation, and effective treatment requires prompt recognition, early goal-directed resuscitation, and early debridement. The strongest independent predictor of in-hospital mortality was vasopressor dependence outside operative anesthesia. The LRINEC score did not strongly predict death or amputation in upper extremity NSTI. Copyright (C) 2022 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. All rights reserved.

TI  - Free-floating thrombi in the right heart -: Diagnosis, management, and prognostic indexes in 38 consecutive patients
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Floating right heart thrombi (FRHTS) are a rare phenomenon, encountered almost exclusively in patients with suspected or proven pulmonary embolism and diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography, Their management remains controversial.
   Methods and Results-We report on a series of 38 consecutive patients encountered over the past 12 years. Thirty-two patients were in NYHA class IV, 20 in cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography usually demonstrated signs of cor pulmonale: right ventricular overload (91.7% of the population), paradoxical interventricular septal motion (75%), and pulmonary hypertension (86.1%). The thrombus was typically wormlike (36 of 38 patients). It extended from the left atrium through a patent foramen ovale in 4 patients. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed in all but 1. Mortality was high (17 of 38 patients) irrespective of the therapeutic option chosen: surgery (8 of 17), thrombolytics (2 of 9), heparin (5 of 8), or interventional percutaneous techniques (2 of 4), The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly linked with the occurrence of cardiac arrest. Conversely, the outcome after discharge was usually good, because 18 of 21 patients were still alive 47.2 months later (range, 1 to 70 months).
   Conclusions-Severe pulmonary embolism was the rule in our series of FRHTS (mortality rate, 44.7%), The choice of therapy had no effect on mortality. Emergency surgery is usually advocated. However, thrombolysis is a faster, readily available treatment and seems promising either as the only treatment or as a bridge to surgery. In patients with contraindications to surgery or lytic therapy, interventional techniques may be proposed.

TI  - Use of lacosamide for focal epilepsy in a child with kidney failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis
T2  - BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Background: Lacosamide (LCM) has become commonly used for focal onset seizures due to its high tolerability and low drug interactions. Unlike patients on hemodialysis (HD), pharmacokinetic data and dosing recom-mendations for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) are scant. Case report: A 2-year-old girl with end-stage kidney disease undergoing PD suffered prolonged focal onset sei-zures. The patient had congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract associated with branchio-oto-renal syndrome due to an EYA1 gene mutation. She also had neurological sequelae from post-resuscitation encepha-lopathy at the age of one month. Antiseizure medication with few drug interactions, less impact on the neuro-developmental state and possibility of intravenous administration was preferred. LCM met those criteria and was carefully administered. Although the patient had recurrent prolonged seizures during the titration periods, LCM could be continued without any apparent side effects. The blood levels of LCM increased linearly to the optimal level. We confirmed excretion of LCM in the PD fluid. Kidney transplantation was done three months after and her seizures were well controlled. Conclusions: LCM might be a promising option for patients undergoing PD. Due to the lower removal efficacy in PD compared with in HD, close attention should be paid to possible drug excess.

TI  - A retrospective comparison of survivors and non-survivors of massive pulmonary embolism receiving veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: While the optimal care of patients with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is unclear, the general goal of therapy is to rapidly correct the physiologic derangements propagated by obstructive clot. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in this setting is promising, however the paucity of data limits its routine use. Our institution expanded the role of ECMO as an advanced therapy option in the initial management of massive PE. The purpose of this project was to evaluate ECMO-treated patients with massive PE at an academic medical center and report shortterm mortality outcomes.
   Methods: Thirty-two patients placed on ECMO for confirmed, massive PE from January 2012 to December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had PE confirmed by computerized tomography and/or invasive pulmonary angiography.
   Results: In our population of patients managed with ECMO, 21 (65.6%) patients survived to decannulation and 17 (53.1%) survived index hospitalization. Baseline characteristics and clinical variables showed no difference in age, gender, right ventricular-to-left ventricular ratios, or peak troponin-T between survivors and non-survivors. Non-survivors tended to have a previous history of malignancy. Cardiac arrest prior to ECMO cannulation was associated with worse outcomes. All 5 patients who received concomitant systemic thrombolysis died, while 11 of 15 patients who received catheter-directed thrombolysis survived. A lactic acid level <= 6 mmol/L had an 82.4% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity for predicting survival to discharge.
   Conclusion: The practical approach of utilizing ECMO for massive PE is to reserve it for those who would receive the greatest benefit. Patients with poor perfusion, for example from cardiac arrest, may gain less benefit from ECMO. Our findings indicate that a serum lactate > 6 mmol/L may be an indicator of worse prognosis. Finally, in our patient population, catheter-directed thrombolytics was effectively combined with ECMO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - OUTCOME OF HEAD-INJURY IN 2298 PATIENTS TREATED IN A SINGLE CLINIC DURING A 21-YEAR PERIOD
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Between 1968 and 1988, 2298 head-injured patients of all grades of severity were registered in the data bank of a single clinic. The majority of patients were admitted to a community hospital and transferred later to the neurosurgical clinic. The data included mechanism of injury and clinical status at admission, including the level of consciousness according to the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) before and after resuscitation. After admission, nearly all patients below a score of 8 were intubated and treated with controlled ventilation until the patient awakened, died, or had remained in a steady state for similar to 3 weeks. Assessment of the final outcome was made according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) both at discharge and again after the patient's status was stabilized. The results show a stable yearly outcome during the 21 years of recording but a significantly improved good recovery and mortality rate when compared with our previous results. Outcome was significantly correlated to age and type and severity of lesion, as judged by the postresuscitation GCS. The outcome of the 1264 most severely injured, comatose patients (GCS < 9) shows a good recovery rate of 55%, a severely disabled rate of 14%, a vegetative rate of 7%, and a mortality rate of 24%. We attribute these results, which compare favorably with others, to prompt airway control and controlled ventilation in unconscious patients.

TI  - Case for change: a standardised inpatient paediatric early warning system in England
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB  - Most children in hospital who are clinically deteriorating are monitored regularly, and their treatment is escalated effectively. However a small, but significant, number of deteriorating children experience suboptimal outcomes because of a failure to recognise and respond to acute deterioration early enough leading to unintended harm. Tragically this occasionally can have fatal consequences. Investigations into these rare events highlight common themes of missed early signs of deterioration in children, prompting regulatory agencies to suggest paediatric early warning systems (PEWS) to aid clinical practice. In England, track and trigger tools (TTT), which are one facet of PEWS have been widely rolled out but in a heterogeneous fashion. The evidence for TTT is mixed but they are complex interventions and current outcomes do not fully define the entirety of their potential impact. This article explains the rationale behind the decision of the NHS England and NHS Improvement, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and Royal College of Nursing to implement a standardised inpatient PEWS as part of a system-wide paediatric observations tracking system in England and how this fits into a wider programme of activity.

TI  - Whole-body computed tomography in severely injured patients
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of reviewTo provide an update on the relevant and recent studies on whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) imaging of severely injured patients.Recent findingsThe advantages of WBCT in time saving, diagnostic accuracy and even in survival have been proven in numerous studies. WBCT can also be beneficial in haemodynamically unstable major trauma patients. The CT scanner should be located close to the emergency department or even in the trauma room. The issue of radiation is still quite important, however, iterative as well as split-bolus protocols can nowadays reduce radiation significantly. The question: which trauma patient should receive WBCT and which not is not yet solved sufficiently. Postmortem WBCT has a promising potential to promptly define the definitive cause of death of trauma victims comparably to traditional autopsy.SummaryOn account of the recent advances, whole-body CT has become a crucial part of the initial in-hospital assessment of severely injured patients. It is recommended as the standard radiological tool for the emergency diagnostic work-up in major trauma patients.

TI  - QUALITY OF SURVIVAL AFTER SEVERE BIRTH ASPHYXIA
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB  - Children [31] who survived severe birth asphyxia defined by a 1-min Apgar score of 0, or a 5-min Apgar score of < 4, were seen at age 5-10 yr for neurological and psychological assessment. Their progress was compared with that of controls matched for sex, birthweight, gestational age and social class; 29 (93%) of the 31 asphyxiated group and all the controls had no serious neurological or mental handicap. Two were severly disabled and mentally retarded. Detailed studies of psychological function showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. Two apparently stillborn infants made normal progress. It was not possible to identify any perinatal factor which predicted the occurrence of serious handicap with certainty. The quality of life enjoyed by the large majority of the survivors was such as to justify a positive approach to the resuscitation of very severely asphyxiated neonates.

TI  - Classification of soft-tissue injuries in open femur fractures: Relevant for systemic complications?
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - 74th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - BACKGROUND A broad range of systemic complications has been described to occur in patients with open major fractures. Various causes have been claimed to play a role. We therefore surveyed a nationwide trauma registry to assess risk factors associated with closed and various types of open femur fractures.
   METHODS This was a cohort study in a nationwide population-based prospective database. Inclusion criteria for selection from database are as follows: individuals with femur fracture, age 16 years or older, and survival until primary admission. Main groups included closed and open femur fracture. Patient demographics, injury severity (New Injury Severity Score), surgical fracture management, length of stay, and systemic complications (e.g., multiple organ failure [MOF], sepsis, mortality) were collected and statistically analyzed using SPSS statistics. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to stratify subgroups for the degree of open soft-tissue injury according to Gustilo and Anderson.
   RESULTS Among 32,582 documented trauma victims (January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2010), a total of 5,761 met the inclusion criteria. Main groups: 4,423 closed (76.8%) and 1,338 open femur fractures (23.2%). Open fractures subgroups were divided into I degrees (334, 28.1%), II degrees (526, 44.3%), and III degrees (328, 27.6%). Open fractures were associated with an increased risk of prehospital hemorrhagic shock (p = 0.01), higher resuscitation requirements (p < 0.001), MOF (p = 0.001), and longer in-hospital (p < 0.001) and intensive care stay (p = 0.001). While New Injury Severity Score values showed a minor increase per subgroup, the prevalence of MOF, sepsis, and mortality multiplied with the degree of open soft-tissue injury. Especially patients with Type III open femur fractures received mass transfusions (28.2%, p < 0.001), and mass transfusions were identified as independent predictor for sepsis (odds ratio [OR], 2.393; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.821-3.143; p < 0.001) and MOF (OR, 2.966; 95% CI, 2.409-3.651; p < 0.001). Our data also indicate an increased mortality in patients with open femur managed outside Level I trauma centers (OR, 1.358; 95% CI, 1.018-1.812; p = 0.037).
   CONCLUSION Open femur fractures are associated with higher in-hospital complications related to incidence of MOF, associated intensive care unit stay, and hospital days when compared with closed femur fractures. For prevention of in-hospital complications, prompt hemorrhage control, surgical fracture fixation, cautious blood management, and triage to a Level I trauma center must be considered.

TI  - Acute Kidney Injury on Presentation to a Major Trauma Service is Associated with Poor Outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: This study sought to describe the burden of disease of acute kidney injury (AKI) among adult South African trauma patients who presented to a tertiary level trauma service.
   Methods: The trauma database was interrogated for the period from December 2012 to July 2017. All patients over the age of 18 y, who were admitted following trauma, were included. Outcome data were reviewed. This included in-hospital mortality, need for intensive care unit admission, and length of stay. AKI was defined according to the latest Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines using the presentation serum creatinine.
   Results: A total of 7613 patients were admitted for trauma over the period under review. Four thousand two hundred sixty-six patients were suitable for analysis. A total of 238 (5.6%) patients presented with AKI, 149 (62.6%) had stage 1 AKI, 40 (16.8%) had stage 2 AKI, and 49 (20.6%) had stage 3 AKI. There was a higher incidence of AKI in patients with blunt trauma. The length of stay, need for intensive care unit admission, and mortality were significantly higher in patients presenting with AKI than in those who did not present with AKI. There were 172 deaths (4.0%). The patients who died were older and had significantly higher Injury Severity Score than survivors. They were more acidotic on presentation, had lower Glasgow Coma Scale, and were more likely to be hypotensive on presentation. They also were significantly more likely to have AKI on presentation. (30.2% versus 5.6% P < 0.001). AKI on presentation was an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio 3.038 95% confidence interval 1.260-7.325).
   Conclusions: AKI is common in patients presenting to our center with acute trauma. The presence of AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Efforts must be directed to improving recognition of at-risk patients. Prompt referral and adequate resuscitation of trauma patients before transfer must be prioritized. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Extravascular lung water in critical care: recent advances and clinical applications
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Extravascular lung water (EVLW) is the amount of fluid that is accumulated in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. In lung oedema, EVLW increases either because of increased lung permeability or because of increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, or both. Increased EVLW is always potentially life-threatening, mainly because it impairs gas exchange and reduces lung compliance. The only technique that provides an easy measurement of EVLW at the bedside is transpulmonary thermodilution. The validation of EVLW measurements by thermodilution was based on studies showing reasonable correlations with gravimetry or thermo-dye dilution in experimental and clinical studies. EVLW should be indexed to predicted body weight. This indexation reduces the proportion of ARDS patients for whom EVLW is in the normal range. Compared to non-indexed EVLW, indexed EVLW (EVLWI) is better correlated with the lung injury score and the oxygenation and it is a better predictor of mortality of patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Transpulmonary thermodilution also provides the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI), which is an indirect reflection of the integrity of the alveolocapillary barrier. As clinical applications, EVLWI and PVPI may be useful to guide fluid management of patients at risk of fluid overload, as during septic shock and ARDS. High EVLWI and PVPI values predict mortality in several categories of critically ill patients, especially during ARDS. Thus, fluid administration should be limited when EVLWI is already high. Whatever the value of EVLWI, PVPI may indicate that fluid administration is particularly at risk of aggravating lung oedema. In the acute phase of haemodynamic resuscitation during septic shock and ARDS, high EVLWI and PVPI values may warn of the risk of fluid overload and prevent excessive volume expansion. At the post-resuscitation phase, they may prompt initiation of fluid removal thereby achieving a negative fluid balance.

TI  - ABYSS: Therapeutic hypothermia by total liquid ventilation following cardiac arrest and resuscitation
T2  - IRBM
AB  - Sudden death in ambulatory is a major public health issue: only few survivors, severe brain damage, high socio-economic cost. To improve survival and neurological recovery of these patients, an early therapeutic moderate hypothermia could be promising, as strongly suggested by previous preclinical studies on small animals through hypothermic total liquid ventilation (TLV) with perfluorocarbons (PFC) that maintain normal gas exchanges, and where lungs act as a heat exchanger (INSERM U955-E3, partner and pioneer of this project).
   Before translation of hypothermic TLV to humans, studies on large animals are necessary. The project ABYSS concerns the development and validation of a total liquid ventilator prototype suitable for large animals (no suitable devices exist on the market). ABYSS involves a consortium of 4 partners: an industrial company (Bertin Technologies) and three academic laboratories (INSERM U955-E3, INSERM U955-E13 and IR4M CNRS UMR8081).
   The study, which lasted three years, has led to: 1) Realize a prototype of total liquid ventilator for ventilating and cooling large animals, 2) Study the cooling on large animals with TLV, both on beating heart and under external cardiac massage, 3) Study another therapeutic indication: organ preservation of dead patients, 4) Compare three PFC already used as medical devices and analyze the impact of using PFCs with quite unusual physical properties on respiratory flows and airway resistance, 5) Study the miniaturization of the ventilator to enable its use in mobile intensive care unit.
   The next task will be to improve the understanding of the broncho-alveolar response (at various scales from organ to pulmonary cells) under total liquid ventilation on large animals, in order to get knowledge to improve and to optimize the tolerance of the respiratory system to liquid ventilation with PFC.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH SURVIVORS - ROLE OF SURGICAL AND CATHETER ABLATION
T2  - CIRCULATION
CP  - SYMP ON CURRENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE PROBLEM OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
AB  - Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are the most common arrhythmias documented at the time of sudden cardiac death. Since pharmacological therapy often does not completely suppress these arrhythmias, surgical procedures have been developed to provide an alternative mode of therapy. Coronary artery revascularization in patients with ischemic heart disease is associated with decreased sudden death mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who have no history of prior cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia. In sudden death survivors, coronary revascularization appears effective chiefly for patients without inducible ventricular tachycardia or with inducible ventricular fibrillation. Cardiac arrest survivors with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at electrophysiological study require an ablative procedure that is usually guided by electrophysiological mapping. Current technique should permit elective operations to be carried out with a less than 10% mortality and a greater than 85% rate for suppressing ventricular tachycardia. Nonsurgical catheter ablation techniques have already shown promise in patients with slower, well-tolerated tachycardias that allow extensive catheter mapping. Application of these techniques in patients with the rapid tachycardias associated with sudden death has, to date, been very limited, but as catheter mapping and energy delivery techniques continue to evolve, they may be feasible even in these patients.

TI  - CARDIORESPIRATORY ARREST AND RESUSCITATION OF CHILDREN
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISEASES OF CHILDREN
AB  - Ninety-one patients had cardiorespiratory arrest in a children''s hospital emergency department over 6 yr. Only 5 children survived, 3 with severe neurologic sequelae. The records of 40 other children in the same community resuscitated by paramedics, but taken to other hospitals, were reviewed and there were 3 survivors. The causes and outcomes of resuscitation of children are clearly different from those of adults. Cardiac disease and ventricular arrhythmias are uncommon. Neurologically intact survival was seen only in those children who received immediate resuscitation and responded promptly. Research in cerebral resuscitation at the cellular level is promising for the future. Prevention of some cardiorespiratory arrests through accident prevention and earlier recognition of serious infections is possible now.

TI  - Effects of different palliative care models on decedents with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis: a nationwide population-based retrospective observational study in Taiwan
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - ObjectivesPatients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis are a particularly important population and carry a heavy disease burden. However, evidence related to palliative care for patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis remains scarce, especially in regard to palliative care consultation services and palliative home care. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different palliative care models on aggressive treatment among patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis during the end of life. DesignA population-based retrospective observational study. SettingThis study used a population database maintained by Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare in combination with Taiwan's National Health Research Insurance Database. ParticipantsWe enrolled all decedents who were patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis from the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 in Taiwan. Main exposure measureHospice care during the 1-year period before death. Main outcome measuresEight aggressive treatments within 30 days before death, more than one emergency department visit, more than one admission, a longer than 14-day admission, admission to an intensive care unit, death in hospital, endotracheal tube use, ventilator use and need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. ResultsA total of 10 083 patients were enrolled, including 1786 (17.7%) patients with kidney failure who received palliative care 1 year before death. Compared with patients without palliative care, patients with palliative care had significantly less aggressive treatments within 30 days before death (Estimates: -0.09, CI: -0.10 to -0.08). Patients with inpatient palliative care, palliative home care or a mixed model experienced significantly lower treatment aggressiveness within 30 days before death. ConclusionsPalliative care, particularly use of a mixed care model, inpatient palliative care and palliative home care in patients with kidney failure receiving dialysis, could all significantly reduce the aggressiveness of treatment within 30 days before death.

TI  - A comparison of outcomes between transferred patients versus patients who presented directly to the emergency department with necrotizing fasciitis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) is a rare life-threatening bacterial infection that necessitates emergent resuscitation and operative intervention. Most of the literature has emphasized the need for early surgical intervention. This is problematic for patients being treated at a facility lacking surgical support, with concerns for increasing mortality and morbidity rates. Methods This is a 10-year retrospective study of emergency department (ED) documentation and surgical operative reports of patients seen at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: the Transfer Group (TG), consisting of those transferred from another facility, and the Direct Admit Group (DAG), comprising those who presented directly to the ED. A comparison was conducted to identify statistically significant differences between the 2 groups of patients with a final diagnosis of NF, with specific emphasis on mortality rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS. Results A total of 134 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NF were included in the final analysis. More than half (50.8%, n = 68) of the patients presented as transfers from area hospitals. Compared to the DAG, the TG had a significantly higher percentage of patients undergoing surgical intervention within six hours of ED presentation (95.6% vs. 10.6%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The TG had a lower mortality rate compared to the DAG (11.8% vs. 22.7%), though the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no statistically significant difference in hospital LOS (13 days vs. 13.5 days, p = 0.9046) or ICU LOS (3 days for both groups, p = 0.4845) between these two groups. Conclusion Aggressive management with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluid resuscitation may mitigate the effect on mortality in patients with necrotizing fasciitis when prompt surgical intervention is not available.

TI  - Characterization of fatal blunt injuries using postmortem computed tomography
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - 36th Scientific Assembly of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid triage of blunt agonal trauma patients is necessary to maximize survival, but autopsy is uncommon, slow, and rarely informs resuscitation guidelines. Postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) can serve as an adjunct to autopsy in guiding blunt agonal trauma resuscitation.
   METHODS: Retrospective cohort review of trauma decedents who died at or within 1 hour of arrival following blunt trauma and underwent noncontrasted PMCT. Primary outcome was the prevalence of mortal injury defined as potential exsanguination (e.g., cavitary injury, long bone and pelvic fractures), traumatic brain injury, and cervical spine injury. Secondary outcomes were potentially mortal injuries (e.g., pneumothorax) and misplacement airway devices. Patients were grouped by whether arrest occurred prehospital/inhospital. Univariate analysis was used to identify differences in injury patterns including multiple-trauma injury patterns.
   RESULTS: Over a 9-year period, 80 decedents were included. Average age was 48.9 +/- 21.7 years, 68% male, and an average ISS of 42.3 +/- 16.3. The most common mechanism was motor vehicle accidents (67.5%) followed by pedestrian struck (15%). Of all decedents, 62 (77.5%) had traumatic arrest prehospital while 18 (22.5%) arrived with pulse. Between groups there were no significant differences in demographics including ISS. The most common mortal injuries were traumatic brain injury (40%), long bone fractures (25%), moderate/large hemoperitoneum (22.5%), and cervical spine injury (25%). Secondary outcomes included moderate/large pneumothorax (18.8%) and esophageal intubation rate of 5%. There were no significant differences in mortal or potentially mortal injuries, and no differences in multiple-trauma injury patterns.
   CONCLUSION: Fatal blunt injury patterns do not vary between prehospital and in-hospital arrest decedents. High rates of pneumothorax and endotracheal tube misplacement should prompt mandatory chest decompression and confirmation of tube placement in all blunt arrest patients.

TI  - Antibiotic therapy for abdominal infection
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Abdominal infections are treated by resuscitation, abdominal drainage, control of the source of infection, and antimicrobial agents. Ideally, antimicrobial therapy is active against expected pathogens, safe and effective in clinical trials, inexpensive, and unlikely to promote drug resistance. Numerous single-agent and combination-drug regimens have been efficacious in clinical trials, based on coverage of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species, the predominant pathogens isolated. Whether expanded antimicrobial coverage is required, especially in hospital-acquired infections, is controversial. Candida infections should be treated with antifungal therapy in patients with recurrent abdominal infections, immunosuppressed patients, and those with candidal abscesses. Most agents have few serious adverse effects; aminoglycosides are the least expensive agents but cause nephro-and ototoxicity. There is little information on the promotion of drug resistance in this condition. Recent developments include the introduction of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, aztreonam/clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin/metronidazole; success with once-daily aminoglycosides; evidence that antibiotics limit infectious complications of pancreatitis; controversy over the value of diagnostic cultures; the use of oral therapy; evidence in favor of shorter courses of treatment; and the introduction of pharmacoeconomic studies. Clinical investigators are challenged to improve drug trials by stratifying and controlling for the adequacy of surgical intervention.

TI  - Development of the Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Prediction Model for Risk-Adjusting Mortality
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To develop a prognostic model for predicting mortality at time of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation for children which is important for determining center-specific risk-adjusted outcomes.
   Design: Multivariable logistic regression using a large national cohort of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients.
   Setting: The ICUs of the eight tertiary care children's hospitals of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network.
   Patients: Five-hundred fourteen children (< 19 yr old), enrolled with an initial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run for any indication between January 2012 and September 2014.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 514 first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs were analyzed with an overall mortality of 45% (n = 232). Weighted logistic regression was used for model selection and internal validation was performed using cross validation. The variables included in the Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Prediction model were age (pre-term neonate, full-term neonate, infant, child, and adolescent), indication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiac, or respiratory), meconium aspiration, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, documented blood stream infection, arterial blood pH, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio. The highest risk of mortality was associated with the presence of a documented blood stream infection (odds ratio, 5.26; CI, 1.90-14.57) followed by extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 4.36; CI, 2.23-8.51). The C-statistic was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80).
   Conclusions: The Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Prediction model represents a model for predicting in-hospital mortality among children receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for any indication. Consequently, it holds promise as the first comprehensive pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation risk stratification model which is important for benchmarking extracorporeal membrane oxygenation outcomes across many centers.

TI  - Coagulopathy and transfusion ratios in pediatric trauma
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Coagulopathy has been associated with poor outcomes in adult and pediatric trauma. Previous clinical trials have shown benefits with balanced transfusion ratios in trauma resuscitation in adults, but smaller retrospective studies have not established the same in pediatrics. We constructed a pediatric trauma database at a Level I trauma center for analysis. METHODS The institutional trauma registry was queried for all pediatric trauma activations from 2008 to 2018. Patient identifiers were used to identify laboratory data from the electronic data warehouse. RESULTS There were 2,769 pediatric patients with trauma identified, with 1,492 arriving direct from the scene. Of those with complete transport data available, 81% arrived within 60 minutes from time of injury. Fifty-two patients were transfused in the first 24 hours, with 25 receiving greater than an estimated 40 mL/kg of blood products. No significant difference in ratios of red cell to plasma transfused at 24 hours was observed between patients surviving to discharge (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6) and deceased (1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-1.9) (p= 0.087). Among direct admissions, an abnormal prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time taken within 2 hours of arrival was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (p= 0.003 and <0.001), but no significant associations were seen for abnormal fibrinogen or platelet counts. Red cell to plasma transfusion ratios were not significantly associated with length of stay or ventilator days (p= 0.74 and 0.28). CONCLUSION There was no significant difference between transfusion ratios of surviving and deceased patients at 3- and 24-hour time points, including in a weight-adjusted highly transfused subgroup. Coagulopathy remains an important issue in pediatric trauma and may guide future multicenter studies in optimizing transfusion ratios in pediatric trauma.

TI  - Risk of complications after a non-ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction in a Latin-American cohort: An application of the ACTION ICU score
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - Background: European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation (NSTEMI) recommend Intensive Care Unit (ICU) surveillance during the first 24-48 h. Interestingly, the in-hospital mortality of NSTEMI patients has consistently decreased, giving some patients the option to be managed in general hospital wards. The ACTION ICU score has been proposed to identify high-risk patients with NSTEMI and guide the selective risk-based need for ICU care.
   Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of the ACTION ICU score to predict patients' risk of developing complications requiring ICU care in a Latin-American cohort with NSTEMI.
   Methods: We applied the ACTION ICU score in a retrospective cohort. A composite primary outcome included: cardiorespiratory arrest, shock, high-grade atrio-ventricular block, respiratory failure, stroke, or death. The predictive performance of this model was estimated with a conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Of 1,062 patients with NSTEMI, the primary outcome was present in 75 patients (7.1%), and 1,019 (96%) were admitted to ICU. The most common event was respiratory failure (4.0%), followed by cardiogenic shock (3.7%), and cardiac arrest (1.7%). The presence of heart failure signs or symptoms had the highest association with the primary outcome (OR:2.16; 95%Cl:1.61-2.92). The best cut-off point for this population was 3 (complications risk: 4.0%, SEN:96%, SP:15.4%, NPV:98.1%, PPV:7.9%).
   Conclusion: The ACTION ICU score may be a promising tool to identify the need for ICU care in Latin-American patients with NSTEMI. Furthermore, additional research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. (C) 2022 The Author( s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Ross Renaissance Trends and Short-Term Outcomes of the Ross Procedure in the United States
T2  - JACC-ADVANCES
AB  - Background The Ross procedure, involving pulmonary autograft replacement of the aortic valve, has remained underutilized. Recent technical advancements have prompted renewed interest in the Ross operation, particularly as an alternative to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine national utilization of the Ross procedure over the last decade and evaluate associated feasibility, safety, and cost, relative to SAVR. Methods We identified adult and pediatric patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement within the 2010-2022 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Ross and SAVR patients were age-matched using coarsened exact matching. Subsequently, multivariable regression was used to compare clinical outcomes, 30-day readmissions, and resource utilization between groups. The primary endpoint was a composite of in-hospital mortality, stroke, prolonged mechanical ventilation, reoperation, acute kidney injury, sepsis, cardiac arrest, and venous thromboembolism. Results Among 109,235 valve replacements, Ross procedures constituted 1.5% of adult and 37.2% of pediatric cases. Utilization increased significantly over time across age groups (P < 0.001). Compared to SAVR, Ross recipients were younger, with fewer comorbidities, and often treated at high-volume teaching hospitals. After age-matching and risk adjustment, the Ross approach was associated with lower odds of composite complications (adjusted OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46-0.91), particularly stroke (adjusted OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.80), as well as lower nonhome discharge and 30-day readmissions. Hospitalization costs were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions The Ross procedure is undergoing a resurgence in pediatric and adult populations, with favorable short-term outcomes and comparable costs to SAVR. These findings support broader adoption of the Ross operation at experienced centers for appropriately selected patients.

TI  - Which Biomarkers Can Be Used as Diagnostic Tools for Infection in Suspected Sepsis?
T2  - SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - The diagnosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis is frequently difficult to achieve with a reasonable degree of certainty. Currently, the diagnosis of infection still relies on a combination of systemic manifestations, manifestations of organ dysfunction, and microbiological documentation. In addition, the microbiologic confirmation of infection is obtained only after 2 to 3 days of empiric antibiotic therapy. These criteria are far from perfect being at least in part responsible for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, in the community and in hospital, and probably the main drive for antibiotic resistance. Biomarkers have been studied and used in several clinical settings as surrogate markers of infection to improve their diagnostic accuracy as well as in the assessment of response to antibiotics and in antibiotic stewardship programs. The aim of this review is to provide a clear overview of the current evidence of usefulness of biomarkers in several clinical scenarios, namely, to diagnose infection to prescribe antibiotics, to exclude infection to withhold antibiotics, and to identify the causative pathogen to target antimicrobial treatment. In recent years, new evidence with "old" biomarkers, like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as new biomarkers and molecular tests, as breathomics or bacterial DNA identification by polymerase chain reaction, increased markedly in different areas adding useful information for clinical decision making at the bedside when adequately used. The recent evidence shows that the information given by biomarkers can support the suspicion of infection and pathogen identification but also, and not less important, can exclude its diagnosis. Although the ideal biomarker has not yet been found, there are various promising biomarkers that represent true evolutions in the diagnosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis.

TI  - Predicting ICU admission and death in the Emergency Department: A comparison of six early warning scores
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To compare the ability of the most used Early Warning Scores (EWS) to identify adult patients at risk of poor outcomes in the emergency department (ED).Methods: Single-center, retrospective observational study. We evaluated the digital records of consecutive ED admissions in patients > 18 years from 2010 to 2019 and calculated NEWS, NEWS2, MEWS, RAPS, REMS, and SEWS based on parameters measured on ED arrival. We assessed the discrimination and calibration performance of each EWS in predicting death/ICU admission within 24 hours using ROC analysis and visual calibration. We also measured the relative weight of clinical and physiological derangements that identified patients missed by EWS risk stratification using neural network analysis.Results: Among 225,369 patients assessed in the ED during the study period, 1941 (0.9%) were admitted to ICU or died within 24 hours. NEWS was the most accurate predictor (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] curve 0.904 [95% CI 0.805-0.913]), followed by NEWS2 (AUROC 0.901). NEWS was also well calibrated. In patients judged at low risk (NEWS < 2), 359 events occurred (18.5% of the total). Neural network analysis revealed that age, systolic BP, and temperature had the highest relative weight for these NEWS-unpredicted events.Conclusions: NEWS is the most accurate EWS for predicting the risk of death/ICU admission within 24 h from ED arrival. The score also had a fair calibration with few events occurring in patients classified at low risk. Neural network analysis suggests the need for further improvements by focusing on the prompt diagnosis of sepsis and the development of practical tools for the measurement of the respiratory rate.

TI  - Comparison of mortality and cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19, RSV, and influenza in hospitalized children and young adults
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background Respiratory viruses are linked to cardiovascular complications. We aim to compare cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19, influenza and RSV. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional data from hospitalized children and young adults (<= 20 years) from 2020 and 2021 using National Inpatient Sample (NIS). We included individuals hospitalized for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza, and weighted data were used to compare cardiovascular complications. Results Of 212,655 respiratory virus admissions, 85,055 were from COVID-19, 103,185 were from RSV, and 24,415 were from influenza. Myocarditis was higher in COVID-19 [0.9%, n = 740] as compared to influenza [0.2%, n = 55] and RSV [0.1%, n = 65]. In the adjusted logistic regression, the odds of myocarditis was 61% lower in influenza [aOR = 0.39 (0.20-0.76), P = 0.006], and 85% lower in RSV [aOR = 0.15 (0.07-0.34) P < 0.001] as compared to COVID-19. Bradyarrhythmias/heart block was higher in COVID-19 [0.8%, n = 690] versus influenza [0.5%, n = 110] and RSV [0.2%, n = 205]. After adjusting for confounders for bradyarrhythmias/heart block, compared to COVID-19, the odds were 49% lower in RSV [aOR = 0.51 (0.33-0.80), P = 0.004] but no statistically significant difference in influenza [aOR = 0.79 (0.48-1.31), P = 0.374] was seen. Tachyarrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, and in-hospital mortality showed no differences after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion Individuals with COVID-19 infection are more likely to develop cardiovascular complications compared to influenza and RSV, highlighting the need for higher index of suspicion and prompt treatment, as well as steps to limit infection and transmission of this virus in children.

TI  - Small volume albumin administration protects against hemorrhagic shock-induced bone marrow dysfunction
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 33rd Annual Meeting of the Western-Trauma-Association
AB  - Background. Unexpected immunomodulatory effects of colloids and crystalloids prompted an investigation of albumin's ability to prevent bone marrow (BM) suppression following trauma/hemorrhagic shock (T/HS: laparotomy + MAP 30 for 90 mins).
   Methods. In vitro: Normal rat BM was plated for granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythrocyte colony forming units (BFU-E) with 2% v/v plasma from sham (T/SS) or T/HS rats and albumin (2-8 mg/mL). In vivo: Male rats (n = 4/group) were subjected to T/SS or T/HS and resuscitated with shed blood and twice the volume as Lactated Ringer's (LR) or blood and 1, 2, or 3 mL of albumin (50 mg/mL). Bone marrow harvested 3 hours post-resuscitation was plated for CFU-GM and BFU-E.
   Results: In vitro: T/HS plasma decreased both CFU-GM and BFU-E growth as compared with T/SS, whereas increasing doses of albumin showed dose-dependent improvement in progenitor growth (p < 0.05). In vivo: The suppression of BM red and white cell progenitor growth seen in T/HS+LR rats as compared with T/SS was fully prevented by as little as 1 mL of albumin (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion. Small doses of albumin fully restore CFU-GM and BFU-E to sham values. We postulate that the binding of circulating toxic factors by albumin may play a role in this prevention of T/HS-induced BM suppression.

TI  - Moving our critically ill patients: Mobility barriers and benefits
T2  - CRITICAL CARE CLINICS
AB  - In the last quarter-century, research developments have led to improvements in diagnosis and resuscitation of critically ill patients. With these improvements, survival for many populations of critically ill patients has increased [1-6]. With these improvements in mortality, the field of critical care has seen increased opportunities to affect the immediate posthospital quality of life for survivors of critical illness. The concept of a successful outcome for an ICU patient has gone through meaningful maturation in the last decade. Not too long ago, for clinical trials in critical care, being alive at 28 days or alive and off the ventilator were the sole endpoints. Examination of ICU processes of care has led to longer periods of observation to determine survival endpoints. Recently, critical care experts also have focused on management factors that may affect survivors' quality of life. Many investigators have become interested in aspects of ICU practice that may affect the speed with which a person may return to premorbid function [7,8]. Authors' descriptions of ICU sequelae long after the 28-day mark have demonstrated mental and physical limitations [7,8]. This issue of Critical Care Clinics will explore care of the critically ill patient from the viewpoint of how ICU mobilization may benefit patients and how usual practice may inhibit the delivery of mobilization.

TI  - A metabolomic approach in an experimental model of hypoxia-reoxygenation in newborn piglets: urine predicts outcome
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
CP  - 6th International Workshop on Neonatology - Personalized Neonatal Medicine
AB  - Perinatal asphyxia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. Response to oxygen treatment is unpredictable and the optimum concentration of oxygen in neonatal resuscitation is still a matter of debate among neonatologists. A metabolomic approach was used to characterize the metabolic profiles of newborn hypoxic-reoxygenated piglets. Urine samples were collected from newborn piglets (n = 40) undergoing hypoxia followed by resuscitation at different oxygen concentrations (ranging from 18% to 100%) and analyzed by <SU1</SUH NMR spectroscopy. Despite reoxygenation 7 piglets, out of 10 which became asystolic, did not respond to resuscitation. Profiles of the <SU1</SUH NMR spectra were submitted to unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis) multivariate analysis. The supervised analyses showed differences in the metabolic profile of the urine collected before the induction of hypoxia between survivors and deaths. Metabolic variations were observed in the urine of piglets treated with different oxygen concentrations comparing T0 (basal value) and end of the experiment (resuscitation). Some of the individual metabolites discriminating between these groups were urea, creatinine, malonate, methylguanidine, hydroxyisobutyric acid. The metabolomic approach appears a promising tool for investigating newborn hypoxia over time, for monitoring the response to the treatment with different oxygen concentrations, and might lead to a tailored management of the disorder.</.

TI  - Medical Emergency Team: How do we play when we stay? Characterization of MET actions at the scene
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The creation, implementation and effectiveness of a medical emergency team (MET) in every hospital is encourage and supported by international bodies of quality certification. Issues such as what is the best composition of the team or the interventions performed by the MET at the scene and the immediate outcomes of the patients after MET intervention have not yet been sufficiently explored. The purpose of the study is to characterize MET actions at the scene and the immediate patient outcome.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study, at a tertiary care, university-affiliated, 600-bed hospital, in the north of Portugal, over two years.
   Results: There were 511 MET activations: 389 (76 %) were for inpatients. MET activation rate was 8.6/1,000 inpatients. The main criteria for activation were airway threatening in 143 (36.8 %), concern of medical staff in 121 (31.1 %) and decrease in GCS > 2 in 98 (25.2 %) patients; MET calls for cardiac arrest occurred in 68 patients (17.5 %). The median (IQR) time the team stayed at the scene was 35 (20-50) minutes. At the scene, the most frequent actions were related to airway and ventilation, namely oxygen administration in 145 (37.3 %); in circulation, fluid were administered in 158 (40.6 %); overall medication was administered in 185 (47.5 %) patients. End-of-life decisions were part of the MET actions in 94 (24.1 %) patients. At the end of MET intervention, 73 (18.7 %) patients died at the scene, 190 (60.7 %) stayed on the ward and the remaining 123 patients were transferred to an increased level of care. Crude hospital mortality rate was 4.1 % in the 3 years previously to MET implementation and 3.6 % in the following 3 years (p < 0.001).
   Discussion: During the study period, the rate of activation for medical inpatients was significantly higher than that for surgical inpatients. In our hospital, there is no 24/7 medical cover on the wards, with the exception of high-dependency and intensive care units; assuming that the number of unplanned admissions and chronic ill patients is greater in medical wards that could explain the difference found, which prompts the implementation of a 24/7 ward residence.
   The team stayed on site for half an hour and during that time most of the actions were simple and nurse-driven, but in one third of all activations medical actions were taken, and in a forth (24%) end-of-life decisions made, reinforcing the inclusion of a doctor in the MET. A significant decrease in overall hospital mortality rate was observed after the implementation of the MET.
   Conclusions: The composition of our MET with an ICU doctor and nurse was reinforced by the need of medical actions in more than half of the situations (either clinical actions or end-of-life decisions). After MET implementation there was a significant decrease in hospital mortality. This study reinforces the benefit of implementing an ICU-MET team.

TI  - EEG-based outcome prediction after cardiac arrest with convolutional neural networks: Performance and visualization of discriminative features
T2  - HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB  - Prognostication for comatose patients after cardiac arrest is a difficult but essential task. Currently, visual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the main modality used in outcome prediction. There is a growing interest in computer-assisted EEG interpretation, either to overcome the possible subjectivity of visual interpretation, or to identify complex features of the EEG signal. We used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict functional outcome based on 19-channel-EEG recorded from 267 adult comatose patients during targeted temperature management after CA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test set was 0.885. Interestingly, model architecture and fine-tuning only played a marginal role in classification performance. We then used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) as visualization technique to identify which EEG features were used by the network to classify an EEG epoch as favorable or unfavorable outcome, and also to understand failures of the network. Grad-CAM showed that the network relied on similar features than classical visual analysis for predicting unfavorable outcome (suppressed background, epileptiform transients). This study confirms that CNNs are promising models for EEG-based prognostication in comatose patients, and that Grad-CAM can provide explanation for the models' decision-making, which is of utmost importance for future use of deep learning models in a clinical setting.

TI  - Brain, drugs and genes
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - In this second paper of the Brain, Drugs and Genes review we would like to discuss illicit drugs and the genetics that may predispose subjects to addiction.
   We describe the effects, action sites and pathophysiological consequences of the use of these illicit drugs. The drugs that are reviewed are marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA, also known as ecstasy. All of them cause an effect on the brain, modifying the activity of the neuronal systems, altering the activity or availability of the neurotransmitters or emulating their actions. The risk of dependence is related to the velocity with which these drugs induce plastic changes in the brain, very much like a learning process. Such changes underlie the patient's dependerce to drugs. Therefore when a long term user quits and deprives the brain abruptly of these drugs, an abstinence syndrome is precipitated and it may be quite severe. Only for marijuana it seems to be mild, misleading people to believe this drug does not cause physical dependence.
   Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) is a plant which has its active principle Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in almost all its parts, i.e. the flowers, stems, seeds and leaves. It actually contains over 60 cannobinoids as well as other chemical compounds. Marijuana causes euphoria followed by relaxation and several other reinforcing effects. Among the adverse effects marijuana causes: alteration of short-term memory, slowness of reflexes, depression and anxiety, bronchitis and lung infections. Marijuana effects depend on the activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors, distributed in the entire body. The CBI receptor is mainly present in the brain. In medicine, Delta 9-THC has been useful in treating symptoms caused by chemotherapy, and in treating the anorexia caused by the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Also, an antagonist of the CB1 receptor, Rimonabant, has been used to treat morbid obesity with certain degree of success. However, despite this promising application of Rimonabant, the side effects it caused led to its withdrawal from the market in Europe, Canada and Mexico.
   Heroin, derived from morphine, which in turn is isolated from opium, causes euphoria and analgesia, suppresses hunger, increases energy and induces sleepiness. The adverse effects are liver and kidney diseases as well as a decrease in breathing and heart rates. This drug acts on the opioid receptors: MOR, DOR and KOR. Cocaine, derived from the coca plant (Erythroxylum coca) produces immediate rewarding effects that last between 30 to 60 min, and causes anxiety once its serum concentration drops. Due to its very short half-life, it is the most addictive of all drugs. Cocaine reduces hunger, thirst and sleep. The most used forms of cocaine are powder and crack (available as rock). The mechanism of action by which cocaine and related compounds induce their effects is the blockade of the dopamine transporter at the synapsis, leaving dopamine available for a longer time at the synapses of the motivation-reward system. Cocaine and related compounds induce blood vessel constriction, muscular spasm, chest pain, and an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk of cardiac arrest and stroke.
   The methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant, is a crystalline, odorless, bitter drug which causes a pleasant feeling and euphoria. Its action mechanism is the blockade of the dopamine transporter, same as cocaine. The effects pursued by the users of crystal methamphetamine are increased alertness, increase in physical activity and decrease in hunger. Its side effects include increase in body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk for stroke. Methamphetamine also triggers violent behavior, anxiety, irritability, confusion, paranoia and hallucinations. This compound has been used for medical reasons, such as in the treatment of narcolepsy and obesity.
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA or ecstasy, is a synthetic compound with stimulant and hallucinatory effects. Its action is exerted mainly on the serotonin transporter, leaving serotonin available at the synapsis for a longer time. After clearance from the bloodstream this drug causes severe depression. Ecstasy is also combined with other stimulants.
   All the drugs discussed here induce body changes that compromise the life of the user, or his health at the very least. Despite this fact, the highly reinforcing effects the drugs produce by over activating the motivation-rewarding system compel their repetitive use. Not all users, however, are equally vulnerable to becoming addicted or respond the same way to the use of drugs. The individual response depends, in part, on genetic factors, as we discuss in the following section.
   It is evident that not only environmental factors account for the vulnerability to addiction. Genetic factors also have a substantial contribution. In order to facilitate the understanding of the interaction environment-gene, we define the following concepts: gene, allele, mutation, polymorphism, heritability and epigenesis. Apparently, the genetic contribution to addiction vulnerability varies depending on the drug. For example, cocaine and opiates are much more dependant on genetic factors to trigger addiction than are nicotine, alcohol or marijuana. Mutations or polymorphisms carried by several genes might make the difference between being at high or low risk for addiction. They may also underlie the degree of response to rehabilitation treatments.
   Addiction, then, is a result of an interaction between environment and genes. Environmental demands make the organism modify its structure and physiology in order to cope efficiently to such demands. One crucial way to do so is by changing gene expression. Changes in gene expression may be a consequence of chemical rearrangements in the chromatin structure, which lead to transcriptional modifications that affect the expression of the proteins the genes encode. Consequently, the normal functions of such proteins in different systems are also altered. These adaptive rearrangements in the chromatin structure are called epigenesis. The epigenetic changes induced by environmental stimuli have been proved to affect the expression of several neurotransmitter receptors and trophic factors, among many other molecules crucial for the proper functioning of the Central Nervous System. Hence, these chromatin's structural changes, triggered by environmental demands, are most likely to help the subject cope with such specific demands. However, this adaptation is not free of charge, and requires a toll to be paid which is: vulnerability to addiction.
   Finally, one question arises: Who is the person most likely to seek a drug of abuse? Statistics have shown that those patients suffering from a psychiatric illness. This hypothesis suggests that addiction is a symptom or a disease caused by a psychiatric illness such as a personality disorder, depression or schizophrenia. Hence, at the end, drug addiction would be a co-morbid entity, generating what in Spanish we call the dual-disease. On the other hand, the self-medication hypothesis also makes sense, at least for an extensive group of patients. This hypothesis suggests that patients take drugs of abuse to relief the symptoms caused by their psychiatric pathology.
   The present review discusses the interaction between brain circuits, drugs and genes to generate an addict patient. We do not intend to revise each field exhaustively, but rather we intend to give the reader a general scenario on the convergence of these three worlds. Thus it may be better understood how addiction develops and how it may be treated.

TI  - Management of Concomitant Severe Thermal Injury and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction
T2  - EUROPEAN BURN JOURNAL
AB  - Acute coronary thrombosis is a known, but rare, contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with thermal and electrical injuries. The overall incidence of myocardial infarction among burn patients is 1%, with an in-hospital post-infarction mortality of approximately 67%, whereas the overall mortality rate of the general burn patient population is from 1.4% to 18%. As such, early detection and effective peri-operative management are essential to optimize patient outcomes. Here, we report the details of the management of an adult male patient with a 65% total body surface area severe thermal injury, who developed an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the resuscitation period. The patient was found to have 100% occlusion of his left anterior descending coronary artery, for which prompt coronary artery stent placement with a drug-eluting stent (DES) was performed. Following stent placement, the patient required dual antiplatelet therapy. The ongoing dual antiplatelet therapy required the development of a detailed peri-operative protocol involving pooled platelets, packed red blood cells, desmopressin (DDAVP (TM)) and intraoperative monitoring of the patient's coagulation parameters with thromboelastography for three staged operative interventions to achieve complete debridement and skin grafting of his burn wounds.

TI  - Antiarrhythmic therapy in the post-infarction setting: Update from major amiodarone studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Many deaths among hospital survivors of acute myocardial infarction are due to sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. This has prompted the evaluation of prophylactic antiarrhythmic drugs and devices. Although it is widely agreed that antiarrhythmic treatment is useful, it is not certain which therapy provides optimal results. Increasing recognition of the efficacy of amiodarone has prompted the design of several trials of the drug. This paper focuses on primary prophylactic antiarryhthmic therapy in the post-infarction setting and particularly on recent amiodarone trials.

TI  - Treatment of a simulated child with anaphylaxis: An in situ two-arm study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
AB  - Aim: This study aims to determine whether junior medical staff correctly identify and treat paediatric anaphylaxis and whether the presence or absence of hypotension influenced the treatment, using a standardised simulated patient encounter.
   Methods: Junior medical staff from the emergency department of a large paediatric tertiary hospital were invited to participate in a two-armed cohort study to assess recognition and management of anaphylaxis in a standardised scenario using a simulated patient with and without hypotension. The primary outcome measure was administration of adrenaline. The secondary outcome measures included time to adrenaline administration, ability to seek and identify relevant features of history and clinical examination and use of other medications.
   Results: Fifty-six junior medical staff participated (90% participation rate). Only 50% of participants administered adrenaline in scenarios of definite anaphylaxis. Adrenaline was more likely to be administered if the scenario included hypotension, where the junior medical officer had previous formal resuscitation training (Advanced Paediatric Life Support) and by medical officers with more years of training.
   Conclusion: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening presentation and requires prompt recognition and appropriate adrenaline administration. Junior medical staff may require more emphasis on recognition and prompt adrenaline administration in both undergraduate and in hospital training and education. Simulated scenarios may provide a platform to deliver this training to ultimately improve patient care.

TI  - Hospital medicine (Part 2): What would improve acute hospital care?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - There are so many obvious delays and inefficiencies in our traditional system of acute hospital care; it is clear that if outcomes are to be improved prompt accurate assessment immediately followed by competent and efficient treatment is essential. Early warning scores (EWS) help detect acutely ill patients who are seriously ill and likely to deteriorate. However, it is not known if any EWS has universal applicability to all patient populations. The benefit of Rapid Response Systems (RRS) such as Medical Emergency Teams has yet to be proven, possibly because doctors and nurses are reluctant to call the RRS for help. Reconfiguration of care delivery in an Acute Medical Assessment Unit has been suggested as a "proactive" alternative to the "reactive" approach of RRS. This method ensures every patient is in an appropriate and safe environment from the moment of first contact with the hospital. Further research is needed into what interventions are most effective in preventing the deterioration and/or resuscitating seriously ill patients. Although physicians expert in hospital care decrease the cost and length of hospitalization without compromising outcomes hospital care will continue to be both expensive and potentially dangerous.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy: a report from the first 3 years of the Baby Cooling Registry of Japan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for moderate and severe neonatal encephalopathy, but is being applied to a wider range of neonates than originally envisaged. To examine the clinical use of therapeutic hypothermia, data collected during the first 3 years (2012-2014) of the Baby Cooling Registry of Japan were analysed. Of 485 cooled neonates, 96.5% were >= 36 weeks gestation and 99.4% weighed >= 1,800 g. Severe acidosis (pH < 7 or base deficit >= 16 mmol/L) was present in 68.9%, and 96.7% required resuscitation for > 10 min. Stage II/III encephalopathy was evident in 88.3%; hypotonia, seizures and abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram were observed in the majority of the remainder. In-hospital mortality was 2.7%; 90.7% were discharged home. Apgar scores and severity of acidosis/encephalopathy did not change over time. The time to reach the target temperature was shorter in 2014 than in 2012. The proportion undergoing whole-body cooling rose from 45.4% to 81.6%, while selective head cooling fell over time. Mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and requirement for tube feeding at discharge remained unchanged. Adherence to standard cooling protocols was high throughout, with a consistent trend towards cooling being achieved more promptly. The mortality rate of cooled neonates was considerably lower than that reported in previous studies.

TI  - The significance of historical troponin elevation in acute heart failure: Not as reassuring as previously assumed
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Historical cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation is commonly interpreted as lessening the significance of current cTn elevations at presentation for acute heart failure (AHF). Evidence for this practice is lacking. Our objective was to determine the incremental prognostic significance of historical cTn elevation compared to cTn elevation and ischemic heart disease (IHD) history at presentation for AHF.
   Methods: A total of 341 AHF patients were prospectively enrolled at five sites. The composite primary outcome was death/cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical cardiac support, intubation, new/emergent dialysis, and/or acute myocardial infarction (AMI)/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)/coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were 30-day AMI/PCI/CABG and in-hospital AMI. Logistic regression compared outcomes versus initial emergency department (ED) cTn, the most recent electronic medical record cTn, estimated glomerular filtration rate, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and IHD history ( positive, negative by prior coronary workup, or unknown/no prior workup).
   Results: Elevated cTn occurred in 163 (49%) patients, 80 (23%) experienced the primary outcome, and 29 had AMI (9%). cTn elevation at ED presentation, adjusted for historical cTn and other covariates, was associated with the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.38), 30-day AMI/ PCI/CABG, and in-hospital AMI. Historical cTn elevation was associated with greater odds of the primary outcome when IHD history was unknown at ED presentation (aOR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24-21.40) and did not alter odds of the outcome with known positive (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.33-1.70) or negative IHD history (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.26- 2.40). Nevertheless, patients with elevated ED cTn were more likely to be discharged if historical cTn was also elevated (78% vs. 32%, p = 0.025).
   Conclusions: Historical cTn elevation in AHF patients is a harbinger of worse outcomes for patients who have not had a prior IHD workup and should prompt evaluation for underlying ischemia rather than reassurance for discharge. With known IHD history, historical cTn elevation was neither reassuring nor detrimental, failing to add incremental prognostic value to current cTn elevation alone.

TI  - Antiarrhythmic drugs: A reorientation in light of recent developments in the control of disorders of rhythm
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
CP  - Symposium on Can Antiarrhythmic Drugs Survive Survival Trials
AB  - Numerous developments in our knowledge of arrhythmias during the past decade or so have had a major influence on antiarrhythmic drug therapy. It has become increasingly evident that arrhythmias merit treatment not only for the relief of symptoms, with improvement in quality of life, but also for the prolongation of survival by decreasing arrhythmic deaths. No longer can mere suppression of arrhythmias, symptomatic or asymptomatic, be equated with prolonged survival. We now know that antiarrhythmic drugs that act by blocking sodium channels can increase mortality and that the most important determinants of arrhythmia mortality are the degree and nature of ventricular dysfunction. To these considerations must be added the advances in nonpharmacologic approaches to controlling cardiac arrhythmias. There has been a shift to the use of implantable devices and of drugs with alternative modes of action, such as beta blockers and class III drugs (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone). However, the side-effect profiles of these 2 classes of compounds have led to the synthesis and characterization of agents that act simply by blocking greater than or equal to 1 membrane ion channels, The isolated block of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kr) has been associated with patent antifibrillatory activity in the atria, with a neutral (e.g., with dofetilide) or deleterious (with d-sotalol) effect on mortality in postinfarct survivors. Therefore, the focus now is on compounds that can block > 1 ion channel (e.g., tedisamil and azimilide). Azimilide is the first of the class III agents that blocks both components of the delayed rectifier potassium current. The drug's overall action is associated with a spectrum of electrophysiologic properties that hold promise in the control of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, with potential for improving survival in patients at risk for cardiac arrest.

TI  - Recovery of Escherichia coli from potentially lethal radiation damage: Characterization of a recovery phenomenon
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY
AB  - The recovery of Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 following irradiation in phosphate buffer at OC was assessed using a two-stage incubation protocol. In the first stage survivors were recovered on basal yeast extract agar (BYEA) plates and incubated at 18C (18C-resuscitation) for specified time intervals (0 to 48 h). In the second stage, the incubation temperature was increased to 37C and the survivors were incubated for an additional 24 h to promote colony development. Controls consisted of survivors which were directly incubated at 37C on BYEA for time intervals equivalent to the total times used in the two-stage incubation protocol. The ratio of colony-forming units obtained with and without (control) the 18C-resuscitation protocol was used to calculate recovery factors (RF). Depending on the applied dose, RFs ranged from ca. 2.5 (0.44 kGy) to 15-18 (0.76 kGy) following an optimal resuscitation time of 24-28 h. Irreparable damage, incurred by incubating survivors directly at 37C (37C-damage) for 10 min prior to their recovery using the two-stage protocol, was minimal regardless of dose; however, extending 37C-damage to 60 min decreased RFs by ca. two-thirds. RFs for cells increased from 1.6 to 375 following irradiation at 0.25 and 0.53 kGy, respectively. In ground beef, RFs for cells treated at the highest dose (1.50 kGy) increased by ca. 100-fold following 18C-resuscitation. In contrast, the 18C-resuscitation protocol exhibited minimal effects when E. coli was irradiated in trypticase soy broth. Survivor levels for E. coli following either gamma or electron beam irradiation appeared similar; however, both appeared higher following the 18C-resuscitation protocol.

TI  - Clinical concern and the deteriorating patient: a review of rapid response 2018-20
T2  - AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW
AB  - Objective. To investigate demographics, clinical patterns and outcomes of rapid response reviews in hospital, reviewing indications for and outcomes of rapid response reviews initiated for clinical concern and to understand the role of clinical concern in identifying the deteriorating patient and at-risk patient populations. Method. This was a retrospective analysis of General Medical inpatients at Alfred Hospital from 1 January 2018 to 31 July 2020. Data extraction from electronic medical records identified patients who had a rapid response review during admission. Demographic and clinical data, investigations and clinical outcomes from rapid response reviews were investigated. Comparisons were performed using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for factors associated with rapid response reviews for clinical concern and clinical outcomes. Results. There were 10 797 admissions of 7409 individual patients. There were 2359 rapid response reviews during the study period, occurring in 13% of admissions. Patients were majority female (50.4%), and the median age was 79 +/- 17.6 years. Rapid response reviews were for cardiovascular (46.8%), respiratory (25.3%) and neurological (14.3%) indications. A total of 11% of rapid response reviews (n = 258) were for clinical concern. Inpatient falls accounted for a significant proportion of rapid response reviews for clinical concern. Reviews were more common in older patients, those admitted after-hours, and patients with disabilities. The latter group were more likely to have rapid response reviews for clinical concern. Rapid response reviews initiated for clinical concern were more likely than those initiated for standard criteria to change patients' clinical status, particularly the withdrawal of active management.Conclusions. Rapid response reviews for clinical concern are important triggers to identify clinical deterioration in vulnerable patients. Reviews were initiated for clinical concern were more likely than those initiated for standard criteria to result in a change in patients' resuscitation status and care trajectory. Clinician concern, even when prompting review for parameters outside of standard clinical review criteria, remains an important factor in recognising the deteriorating patient.

TI  - Tranexamic acid does not prevent rebleeding in an uncontrolled hemorrhage porcine model
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Fluid resuscitation after uncontrolled hemorrhage might promote rebleeding and irreversible shock. Tranexamic acid is a procoagulant drug that limits blood loss after surgery of the hip, knee, and heart. We hypothesized that pretreatment with tranexamic acid reduces the rebleeding in uncontrolled hemorrhage and thereby allows safe administration of crystalloid fluid resuscitation.
   Methods: A 120-minute intravenous infusion of 100 mL/kg of Ringer's solution was given to 24 pigs (mean weight, 20 kg) 10 minutes after lacerating the infrarenal aorta. The animals were randomized to receive an intravenous injection of 15 mg/kg of tranexamic acid or placebo just before starting the resuscitation. Rebleeding events were monitored by two ultrasonic probes positioned proximal and distal to the laceration.
   Results: Tranexamic acid had no effect on the number of rebleeding events, bled volume, or mortality. The initial bleeding stopped within 4 minutes after the injury. The five animals that died suffered from 4.4 rebleeding events on average, which tripled the total blood loss, whereas the survivors had only 1.3 such events during fluid resuscitation (p < 0.02). At autopsy, death was associated with a larger total hemorrhage; the blood recovered from the abdomen weighed 1.4 kg (median) in nonsurvivors and 0.6 kg in survivors (p < 0.001), with the difference being attributable to rebleeding.
   Conclusion: Rebleeding events increased the amount of blood lost and the mortality in uncontrolled aortic hemorrhage. Tranexamic acid offered no benefit.

TI  - Effect of lung ultrasound-guided fluid deresuscitation on duration of ventilation in intensive care unit patients (CONFIDENCE): protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundFluid therapy is a common intervention in critically ill patients. It is increasingly recognised that deresuscitation is an essential part of fluid therapy and delayed deresuscitation is associated with longer invasive ventilation and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. However, optimal timing and rate of deresuscitation remain unclear. Lung ultrasound (LUS) may be used to identify fluid overload. We hypothesise that daily LUS-guided deresuscitation is superior to deresuscitation without LUS in critically ill patients expected to undergo invasive ventilation for more than 24 h in terms of ventilator free-days and being alive at day 28.MethodsThe "effect of lung ultrasound-guided fluid deresuscitation on duration of ventilation in intensive care unit patients" (CONFIDENCE) is a national, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) in adult critically ill patients that are expected to be invasively ventilated for at least 24 h. Patients with conditions that preclude a negative fluid balance or LUS examination are excluded. CONFIDENCE will operate in 10 ICUs in the Netherlands and enrol 1000 patients. After hemodynamic stabilisation, patients assigned to the intervention will receive daily LUS with fluid balance recommendations. Subjects in the control arm are deresuscitated at the physician's discretion without the use of LUS. The primary endpoint is the number of ventilator-free days and being alive at day 28. Secondary endpoints include the duration of invasive ventilation; 28-day mortality; 90-day mortality; ICU, in hospital and total length of stay; cumulative fluid balance on days 1-7 after randomisation and on days 1-7 after start of LUS examination; mean serum lactate on days 1-7; the incidence of reintubations, chest drain placement, atrial fibrillation, kidney injury (KDIGO stadium >= 2) and hypernatremia; the use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and chest-X-ray; and quality of life at day 28.DiscussionThe CONFIDENCE trial is the first RCT comparing the effect of LUS-guided deresuscitation to routine care in invasively ventilated ICU patients. If proven effective, LUS-guided deresuscitation could improve outcomes in some of the most vulnerable and resource-intensive patients in a manner that is non-invasive, easy to perform, and well-implementable.

TI  - Chemotherapy Near the End of Life for Chinese Patients with Solid Malignancies
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
AB  - Introduction. There are increasing concerns about the negative impacts of chemotherapy near the end of life (EOL). There is discrepancy among different countries about its use, and little is known about the real-world situation in China.
   Patients and Methods. This retrospective study was conducted at six representative hospitals across China. Adult decedents with a record of advanced solid cancer and palliative chemotherapy were consecutively screened from 2010 through 2014. The prevalence of EOL chemotherapy within the last 1 month of life was set as the primary outcome. The correlations among EOL chemotherapy, clinicopathological features, and overall survival (OS) were investigated.
   Results. A total of 3,350 decedents who had had cancer were consecutively included; 2,098 (62.6%) were male and the median age was 56 years (range, 20-88). There were 177 (5.3%), 387 (11.6%), and 837 (25.0%) patients who received EOL chemotherapy within the last 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of life, respectively. We identified inferior OS (median OS, 7.1 vs. 14.2 months; hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.53; p < .001), more intensive treatments (e.g., admitted to intensive care unit [ICU] in the last month of life, received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and invasive ventilation support), and hospital death (odds ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.14-2.06; p = .005) among patients who received continued chemotherapy within the lastmonth compared with those who did not. However, subgroup analyses indicated that receiving oral agents correlated with fewer ICU admissions and lower rates of in-hospital death.
   Conclusion. This study showed that EOL chemotherapy is commonly used in China. Intravenous chemotherapy at the EOL significantly correlated with poor outcomes and the role of oral anticancer agents warrants further investigation.
   Implications for Practice: The role of chemotherapy toward the end of life (EOL) in patients with solid cancers is debatable. This article is believed to be the first to report the current prevalence of EOL chemotherapy in China. This study found that, compared with oral anticancer agents, intravenous chemotherapy at the EOL was significantly associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, the role of oral anticancer agents at the EOL stage deserves further investigation.

TI  - "False positive" claims of near-death experiences and "false negative" denials of near-death experiences
T2  - DEATH STUDIES
AB  - Some persons who claim to have had near-death experiences (NDEs) fail research criteria for having had NDEs (false positives'); others who deny having had NDEs do meet research criteria for having had NDEs (false negatives'). The author evaluated false positive claims and false negative denials in an organization that promotes near-death research and in psychiatric outpatients. The frequency of false positives and negatives varied in samples that differed in prevalence of, and knowledge about, NDEs. The influence of participants' knowledge about NDEs on the findings of near-death research makes it critically important to use standardized criteria for identifying NDEs.

TI  - North American COVID-19 ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NACMI) registry: Rationale, design, and implications
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a global pandemic. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to experience severe or critical COVID-19 illness and myocardial injury is a key extra-pulmonary manifestation. These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown. Understanding the natural history and appropriate management of COVID-19 patients presenting with ST elevation is essential to inform patient management decisions and protect healthcare workers.
   Methods The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, NACMI. This registry will enroll confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI) with new ST-segment elevation or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG with clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. We will compare demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of these patients with a historical control group of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium using propensity matching. The primary clinical outcome will be in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, recurrent MI, and repeat unplanned revascularization in COVID-19 confirmed or PUI. Secondary outcomes will include the following: reporting of etiologies of ST Elevation; cardiovascular mortality due to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and /or shock; individual components of the primary outcome; composite primary outcome at 1 year; as well as ECG and angiographic characteristics.
   Conclusion The multicenter NACMI registry will collect data regarding ST elevation on ECG in COVID-19 patients to determine the etiology and associated clinical outcomes. The collaboration and speed with which this registry has been created, refined, and promoted serves as a template for future research endeavors.

TI  - Organ Donation: An Important Outcome after Resuscitative Thoracotomy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AB  - BACKGROUND: The persistent shortage of transplantable organs remains a critical issue around the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate outcomes, including organ procurement, in trauma patients undergoing resuscitative emergency department thoracotomy (EDT). Our hypothesis was that potential organ donor rescue is one of the important outcomes after traumatic arrest and EDT.
   STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study at Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center. Patients undergoing resuscitative EDT from January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2009 were analyzed. Primary outcomes measures included survival. Secondary outcomes included organ donation and the brain-dead potential organ donor.
   RESULTS: During the 42-month study period, a total of 263 patients underwent EDT. Return of a pulse was achieved in 85 patients (32.3%). Of those patients, 37 (43.5%) subsequently died in the operating room and 48 (56.5%) survived to the surgical intensive care unit. Overall, 5 patients (1.9%) survived to discharge and 11 patients (4.2%) became potential organ donors. Five of the 11 potential organ donors had sustained a blunt mechanism injury. Of the 11 potential organ donors, 8 did not donate: 4 families declined consent, 3 because of poor organ function, and 1 expired due to cardiopulmonary collapse. Eventually 11 organs (6 kidneys, 2 livers, 2 pancreases, and 1 small bowel) were harvested from 3 donors. Two of the 3 donors had sustained blunt injury and 1 penetrating mechanism of injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: Procurement of organs is one of the tangible outcomes after EDT. These organs have the potential to alter the survival and quality of life of more recipients than the number of survivors of the procedure itself. (J Am Coll Surg 2010;211:450-455.

TI  - Neurodevelopmental Outcomes for Individuals With Congenital Heart Disease: Updates in Neuroprotection, Risk-Stratification, Evaluation, and Management: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Over the past decade, new research has advanced scientific knowledge of neurodevelopmental trajectories, factors that increase neurodevelopmental risk, and neuroprotective strategies for individuals with congenital heart disease. In addition, best practices for evaluation and management of developmental delays and disorders in this high-risk patient population have been formulated based on literature review and expert consensus. This American Heart Association scientific statement serves as an update to the 2012 statement on the evaluation and management of neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with congenital heart disease. It includes revised risk categories for developmental delay or disorder and an updated list of factors that increase neurodevelopmental risk in individuals with congenital heart disease according to current evidence, including genetic predisposition, fetal and perinatal factors, surgical and perioperative factors, socioeconomic disadvantage, and parental psychological distress. It also includes an updated algorithm for referral, evaluation, and management of individuals at high risk. Risk stratification of individuals with congenital heart disease with the updated categories and risk factors will identify a large and growing population of survivors at high risk for developmental delay or disorder and associated impacts across the life span. Critical next steps must include efforts to prevent and mitigate developmental delays and disorders. The goal of this scientific statement is to inform health care professionals caring for patients with congenital heart disease and other key stakeholders about the current state of knowledge of neurodevelopmental outcomes for individuals with congenital heart disease and best practices for neuroprotection, risk stratification, evaluation, and management.

TI  - Longitudinal analysis of serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein in a patient with non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia following brachial plexus block-induced hypotension: a case study
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) is a promising biomarker for small-bowel ischemia including non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI). A 75-year-old woman with diabetic nephropathy sustained a distal radius fracture. Two days later, she underwent a brachial plexus block to facilitate orthopedic surgery, which resulted in hypotension. Despite prompt fluid resuscitation and ephedrine administration, the patient developed abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed hepatic portal venous gas, but no direct evidence of small-bowel ischemia. The gastrointestinal surgery team opted for cautious in-hospital observation overnight. Unfortunately, the patient's condition significantly worsened the following day, prompting an urgent laparotomy. Surgery confirmed ileal segment necrosis, macroscopically characterized by a distinctive geographic pattern. Retrospective analysis of stored serum samples using a human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that I-FABP levels were moderately elevated (7.2 ng/mL) at the initial outpatient visit for the fracture, peaked (17.9 ng/mL) at the clinical onset of NOMI, and returned to normal (0.7 ng/mL) by postoperative day 2. Serum I-FABP levels correlated with the progression of NOMI, showing potential as an early detection marker. However, the longitudinal analysis of serum I-FABP also highlighted significant challenges of this biomarker, including the influence of renal function and the importance of sampling timing.

TI  - Legal and Ethical Issues in Periviable Decision-Making in the Current Moment
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS
AB  - Periviable births, occurring between 20 and 25 weeks of gestation, present significant challenges due to varying survival rates and potential morbidities for survivors. Medical decision-making in this context raises ethical and legal questions, including considerations of sanctity of life versus quality of life and challenges in the clinician-parent relationship. This article outlines the complex ethical and legal landscape surrounding parental medical decision-making for periviable infants in the United States, discussing the evolution of federal and state laws. Existing laws highlight a vitalist approach that prioritizes life preservation despite potential harm and overlook non-heteronormative and non-traditional family structures, complicating decision-making. The impact of post-Dobbs state abortion bans on parental and clinician autonomy have exacerbated these challenges. We advocate for legislative support for inclusive definitions of legal parenthood to facilitate evidence-based decision-making centered on patients and families. Also needed are legal frameworks that accommodate the intricacies of periviable birth decisions while respecting patient autonomy and medical expertise, especially amidst the evolving legislative environment.

TI  - Rachischisis Totalis Without Acrania in a Newborn Male
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rachischisis totalis is a rare open neural tube defect often associated with lethal acrania. When acrania is not present, mortality remains high and morbidity for survivors is extreme. PATIENT: We describe is a term newborn with in-utero diagnosed rachischisis totalis without acrania and Chiari II malformation with subsequent hydrocephalus. RESULTS: At birth, clinical examination revealed rachischisis totalis without acrania. The spinal defect extended from the mid-cervical to the lower sacral vertebrae. Serial cranial ultrasonography and brain MRI revealed Chiari II malformation with severe hydrocephalus. The spinal defect was closed and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed to relieve the hydrocephalus. The clinical course was complicated by significant central apnea, often necessitating aggressive resuscitation and chest compressions. The infant has survived with expected severe developmental delay but has graduated from hospice care. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates that survival with variable function and quality of life is possible with severe open neural tube defects. A multidisciplinary team approach including family-centered care must be used early to overcome the many ethical challenges that such patients present.

TI  - Treatment Decisions for Babies with Trisomy 13 and 18
T2  - HEC FORUM
AB  - Many babies with trisomy 13 and 18 die in the first year of life. Survivors all have severe cognitive impairment. There has been a debate among both professionals and parents about whether it is appropriate to provide life-sustaining interventions to babies with these serious conditions. On one side of the debate are those who argue that there is no point in providing invasive, painful, and expensive procedures when the only outcomes are either early death or survival with severe cognitive impairment. Others suggest that, although mortality is high and cognitive impairment universal, babies with these conditions have an acceptable quality of life. In this paper, we will discuss both points of view. We will review the ways in which these conditions are portrayed in pediatrics textbooks and on social media sites that offer support to parents. We will then suggest an appropriate way to deal with clinical decisions for babies with these trisomies.

TI  - Early reversal of pediatric-neonatal septic shock by community physicians is associated with improved outcome
T2  - PEDIATRICS
CP  - Joint Meeting of the Pediatric-Academic-Societies/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics
AB  - Objective. Experimental and clinical studies of septic shock support the concept that early resuscitation with fluid and inotropic therapies improves survival in a time-dependent manner. The new American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ACCM-PALS) Guidelines for hemodynamic support of newborns and children in septic shock recommend this therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to determine whether early septic shock reversal and use of resuscitation practice consistent with the new ACCM-PALS Guidelines by community physicians is associated with improved outcome.
   Methods. A 9-year (January 1993-December 2001) retrospective cohort study was conducted of 91 infants and children who presented to local community hospitals with septic shock and required transport to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Shock reversal (defined by return of normal systolic blood pressure and capillary refill time), resuscitation practice concurrence with ACCM-PALS Guidelines, and hospital mortality were measured.
   Results. Overall, 26 (29%) patients died. Community physicians successfully achieved shock reversal in 24 (26%) patients at a median time of 75 minutes (when the transport team arrived at the patient's bedside), which was associated with 96% survival and >9-fold increased odds of survival (9.49 [1.07-83.89]). Each additional hour of persistent shock was associated with >2-fold increased odds of mortality (2.29 [1.19-4.44]). Nonsurvivors, compared with survivors, were treated with more inotropic therapies (dopamine/dobutamine [42% vs 20%] and epinephrine/norepinephrine [42% vs 6%]) but not increased fluid therapy (median volume; 32.9 mL/kg vs 20.0 mL/kg). Resuscitation practice was consistent with ACCM-PALS Guidelines in only 27 (30%) patients; however, when practice was in agreement with guideline recommendations, a lower mortality was observed (8% vs 38%).
   Conclusions. Early recognition and aggressive resuscitation of pediatric-neonatal septic shock by community physicians can save lives. Educational programs that promote ACCM-PALS recommended rapid, stepwise escalations in fluid as well as inotropic therapies may have value in improving outcomes in these children.

TI  - Post-hypoxic status epilepticus - A distinct subtype of status epilepticus with poor prognosis
T2  - EPILEPTIC DISORDERS
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the clinical outcome of patients with possible and definitive post-hypoxic status epilepticus (SE) and to describe the SE types in patients with definitive post-hypoxic SE.Methods: Patients with definitive or possible SE resulting from hypoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest (CA) were prospectively recruited. Intermittent EEG was used for the diagnosis of SE according to clinical practice. Two raters blinded to outcome analyzed EEGs retrospectively for possible and definitive SE patterns and background features (frequency, continuity, reactivity, and voltage). Definitive SE was classified according to semiology (ILAE). Mortality and Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score were evaluated 1 month after CA.Results: We included 64 patients of whom 92% died. Among the survivors, only one patient had a good neurological outcome (CPC 1). No patient survived with a burst suppression pattern, low voltage, or electro-cerebral silence in any EEG. Possible or definitive SE was diagnosed in a median of 47 h (IQR 39-72 h) after CA. EEG criteria for definitive electrographic SE were fulfilled in 39% of patients; in 38% - for electroclinical SE and in 23% - for ictal-interictal continuum (IIC). The outcome did not differ significantly between the three groups. The only patient with good functional outcome belonged to the IIC group. Comatose non-convulsive SE (NCSE) without subtle motor phenomenon occurred in 20% of patients with definitive electrographic SE and outcome was similar to other types of SE.Significance: Possible or definitive SE due to hypoxic brain injury is associated with poor prognosis. The outcome of patients with electrographic SE, electroclinical SE, and IIC did not differ significantly. Outcome was similar in patients with definitive electrographic SE with and without prominent motor features.

TI  - Transcutaneous pressure of oxygen: A noninvasive and early detector of peripheral shock and outcome
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - A noninvasive tool to recognize early shock would improve outcome by providing prompt recognition of tissue ischemia and precise resuscitation endpoint. The skin is the first tissue bed to vasoconstrict in shock states. Studies have demonstrated that transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (PtCO2) increases with higher FiO(2) in nonshock states as arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) increases, but in shock situations, PtCO2 mirrors changes in cardiac output and oxygen delivery with minimum response to increasing FiO(2) and PaO2. This study examined the relationship of hemodynamic variables and the degree of PtCO2 response to FiO(2) Of 1.0 (identified as the "oxygen challenge test") to mortality and organ failure. This prospective observational study examined 38 patients requiring at least 24 h of cardiac output monitoring for shock resuscitation in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Patients were resuscitated to the standard protocol of blood pressure, urine output, oxygen delivery (DO2), and mixed venous O-2 (SVO2). Seventy-nine percent of the patients (30/38) with a mean age of 59 21 years had septic shock or severe sepsis with a 26% mortality (10/38). Measurements included hemodynamic variables, PtCO2, and outcome (mortality and organ failure). In this study, the ability of PtCO2 value to increase by 21 mmHg on a FiO(2) Of 1.0, at 24 h of resuscitation, divided survivors from nonsurvivors, P < .001. The PtCO2 response to FiO(2) may provide an additional noninvasive method of detecting early shock as well as a specific endpoint of resuscitation.

TI  - Suppression of Autonomic Drive Determined by Nonlinear HRV analysis in Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest
T2  - 6TH BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE (BMEICON 2013)
CP  - 6th Biomedical Engineering International Conference (BMEiCON)
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended as a cardiac arrest treatment for neuroprotection. In this study, we aimed to explore nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) with other domains to clearify and setting up the significant index for survival. All patients were divided into two groups by 7 days survival outcome (n = 9 vs. 9). The limb lead II ECG signals are collected (10 minutes, sampling rate: 1000 Hz) for all phases; 6, 18 hours after induction (A and B), during rewarming (C) and recover (D). Fluctuation of heart rate (HR) was presented in both groups especially in C and D phases. Standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) was significantly decreased from phase A to C in survivors (p< 0.05). Abrupt increase in SDNN was observed in non survivors and caused a significant difference compared to survivors in C phase. During A-C, low-frequency to high-frequency power ratio (LF/HF) and SD2 of Poincare's plot were suppressed in survivors and they slightly increased in D phases. Less suppression of those LF/HF ratio and SD2 was evident in non survivors. Gradual increase in sample entropy (SampEn) was consistent with prolong suppression of LF/HF ratio and SD2 in survivors. Significant difference of SampEN in both groups was presented at C phase. Prominent SampEn at rewarm of survivors was consistent with large and more scatter signals in Poincare's plot that may explain the rebound response after autonomic suppression. Contrast to survivors, less and ineffective autonomic suppression from hypothermia lead to a crisis in rewarming phase. Also, we notice significant difference of SDNN, SD2 and SampEN in non survivors. In conclusion, nonlinear HRV with SDNN and LF/HF ratio are able to determine successful, effective and rebound responses of hypothermia through autonomic suppression during A-C periods even though HR of both groups is displayed in C and D periods.

TI  - Culture-negative sepsis may be a different entity from culture-positive sepsis: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background The distinction between culture-positive sepsis and culture-negative sepsis regarding clinical characteristics and outcomes remains contentious. We aimed to elucidate these differences using large-scale nationwide data. Methods This prospective cohort study analyzed data from the Korean Sepsis Alliance registry, comprising 21 intensive care units (ICUs) across 20 hospitals from September 2019 to December 2021. Patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were included. Results Among 11,981 sepsis patients, 3501 were analyzed, all of whom were referred to the ICU through the emergency department (mean age: 72 +/- 13 years; 1976 [56%] males). Of these, 2213 (63%) were culture-positive sepsis and 1288 (37%) were culture-negative sepsis. Compared to the culture-positive sepsis group, the culture-negative sepsis group exhibited less severe illness, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and less deteriorated vital signs. While pulmonary-origin sepsis was common in both groups, culture-negative patients primarily presented with pulmonary infections and had a higher incidence of respiratory failure. In comparison to the culture-positive sepsis group, blood cultures and the administration of empirical antibiotics were performed less promptly in the culture-negative sepsis group. Patients with culture-negative sepsis also showed lower compliance with fluid resuscitation (98.4% vs. 96.9%, p = 0.038; culture-positive sepsis vs. culture-negative sepsis) and received vasopressors earlier (31.1% vs. 35.9%, p = 0.012). In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (31.6% vs. 34.9%, p = 0.073); however, in patients with septic shock, culture-negative sepsis had higher mortality rates (37.6% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.029). The apparent appropriateness of empirical antibiotics in the culture-negative septic shock was higher than that of the culture-positive septic shock (85.2% vs. 96.8%, p < 0.001). Culture-negativity independently predicted poor prognosis in septic shock patients (OR: 1.462, 95% CI [1.060-2.017], p = 0.021). Conclusion In patients with septic shock, culture-negativity was associated with increased mortality, despite the paradoxically higher appropriateness of empirical antibiotics than culture-positive patients. These contradictory findings suggest that the current criteria for determining the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy may not be valid for culture-negative sepsis.

TI  - Emergent Exploratory Thoracotomy with Military Casualties: Contemporary Prehospital Management and Outcome
T2  - ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Chest trauma is among the most common types of trauma, corresponding to 10% of trauma patients admitted to hospitals. In the military setting, thoracic trauma was reported as a significant cause of death. With well-timed treatment, chest trauma is regarded as survivable. Emergency thoracotomy (ET) is considered when the patient with trauma to the chest needs immediate resuscitation. Survival rate is reported as low as 1% in some reports and 20% in others. The survival rate depends on injury mechanism, protocols for intervention, and other decompressive procedures.Objectives: To determine parameters that may impact survival of ET.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare prehospital and in-hospital data regarding ET in the emergency department (ED) versus the operating room (OR).Results: Between 2009 and 2017, 6532 casualties presented to the ED; 1125 with trauma to the chest. Fifty-four of those with chest trauma underwent ET in the hospital (4.8%), 22 (41%) in the ED, and 32 (59%) in the OR. The overall mortality of the ET subgroup was 48%. With regard to thoracotomies, 19/22 of patients (86%) who underwent ET in the ED died compared to 2/28 in the OR (13%).Conclusions: Utilizing ET after chest trauma with appropriate clinical indications, well-trained personnel, and prompt transportation poses a significant challenge, but may be associated with better survival than that reported previously with military casualties. Adoption of indications and timed allocation to the OR may improve outcomes with chest trauma casualties.

TI  - Evaluation of vitrification protocol of mouse ovarian tissue by effect of DNA methyltransferase-1 and paternal imprinted growth factor receptor-binding protein 10 on signaling pathways
T2  - CRYOBIOLOGY
AB  - Transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue has been considered as a promising way of fertility preservation for women. however, this cryopreservation method is prone to post-resuscitation follicle proliferation and oocyte development stagnation, affecting late transplant survival. To evaluate current vitrification works, we investigated the critical pathway alternations in vitrified-warmed juvenile 10-day-old mouse ovary. We showed a significant decrease of protein kinase B (Akt) and Mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk) phosphorylation, during which serine/threonine kinases play central roles in coordinating follicle and oocyte development and stress response. Inhibition of Akt and Mapk activity were associated with one of the imprinted insulin pathway negative regulatory genes, Growth factor receptor-binding protein 10 (Grb10) which remarkably increased in vitrified-warmed juvenile mouse ovary than that of fresh group (p < 0.05). RNAi-induced Grb10 down-regulation reversed the decrease in Akt and Mapk phosphorylation. The increase of GrblO expression was partially caused by the hyper-methylation of the promoter region, associated with the decrease of follicular DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1 protein in different stages of vitrified-warmed group, compared to fresh group (p < 0.05). The mRNA and protein expression of Dnmt1 in ovary of vitrified-warmed juvenile mouse were remarkably lower than those in fresh group (p < 0.05). Dnmtl overexpression dramatically reversed GrblO up regulation and Akt and Mapk phosphorylation reduction. Taken together, our findings suggest that GrblO expression might be helpful in evaluation of effectiveness of vitrification, and considered as a potential target for further vitrification protocols improvement in the future.
