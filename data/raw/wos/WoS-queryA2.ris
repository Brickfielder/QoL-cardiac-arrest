TI  - Improving community-based first response to out of hospital cardiac arrest (FirstCPR): protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with poor survival outcomes, but prompt bystander action can more than double survival rates. Being trained, confident and willing-to-perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are known predictors of bystander action. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a community organisation targeted multicomponent education and training initiative on being willing to respond to OHCAs. The study employs a novel approach to reaching community members via social and cultural groups, and the intervention aims to address commonly cited barriers to training including lack of availability, time and costs. Methods and analysis FirstCPR is a cluster randomised trial that will be conducted across 200 community groups in urban and regional Australia. It will target community groups where CPR training is not usual. Community groups (clusters) will be stratified by region, size and organisation type, and then randomly assigned to either immediately receive the intervention programme, comprising digital and in-person education and training opportunities about CPR and OHCA over 12 months, or a delayed programme implementation. The primary outcome is self-reported 'training and willingness-to-perform CPR' at 12 months. It will be assessed through surveys of group members that consent in intervention versus control groups and administered prior to control groups receiving the intervention. The primary analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles, use log binomial regression accounting for baseline covariates and be conducted at the individual level, while accounting for clustering within communities. Focus groups and interviews will be conducted to examine barriers and enablers to implementation and costs will also be examined. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from The University of Sydney. Findings from this study will be disseminated via presentations at scientific conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals, scientific and lay reports.

TI  - Validation of the Padova Prognostic Score for Colitis in Predicting Long-Term Outcome After Restorative Proctocolectomy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
AB  - Background: In 10%-20% of cases it is impossible to make a differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis. A 50% failure rate of J pouch ilea-anal anastomosis is observed in Crohn's colitis. In 2009, we created the Padua Prognostic Score for Colitis (PPSC) to predict the long-term clinical and functional outcome and quality of life of patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with J pouch. The aim of the present study is to establish and validate the accuracy of a prognostic score for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Patient population and methods: The PPSC was created in 2009 by integrating clinical and histological information of patients undergoing RPC. It included preoperative perianal abscess or fistula, rectal sparing, terminal ileum involvement, skip lesions and histological diagnosis of indeterminate colitis or Crohn's colitis on the operative specimen. The validity of this score was tested in predicting postoperative abscess or fistula, anal canal disease, pouchitis, pouch failure and new diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Correlation analysis, ROC curve analysis and survival analysis were used to validate the PPSC in a different cohort from the previous one. Results: We retrospectively enrolled in this study 138 consecutive patients undergoing CPR for ulcerative colitis (n = 127) or indeterminate colitis (n = 11) in our institution since 2005 to 2020. In this period, we observed 11 patients with postoperative abscess or fistula, 3 with anal canal disease, 40 with pouchitis, 6 with pouch failure and 6 with new diagnosis of Crohn's disease. In the new validation cohort, the PPSC confirmed to have a good accuracy in predicting the onset of postoperative CD (AUC = 74.5%, p = 0.018). Kaplan Meier curves demonstrate how a PPSC over 1 can reliably predicts the long-term onset of, pouchitis (p = 0.002) and anal abscess or fistulae (p = 0.04). Conclusions: In this validation study we confirmed the accuracy of the PPSC in predicting postoperative fistulas or abscesses and pouchitis. Therefore, we believe that in clinical practice patients with a PPSC score greater than 1 should be warned of this risk of possible Crohn's disease diagnosis and pouch failure.

TI  - Neuroprotective-Neurorestorative Effects Induced by Progesterone on Global Cerebral Ischemia: A Narrative Review
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - Progesterone (P4) is a neuroactive hormone having pleiotropic effects, supporting its pharmacological potential to treat global (cardiac-arrest-related) cerebral ischemia, a condition associated with an elevated risk of dementia. This review examines the current biochemical, morphological, and functional evidence showing the neuroprotective/neurorestorative effects of P4 against global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Experimental findings show that P4 may counteract pathophysiological mechanisms and/or regulate endogenous mechanisms of plasticity induced by GCI. According to this, P4 treatment consistently improves the performance of cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, impaired by GCI. This functional recovery is related to the significant morphological preservation of brain structures vulnerable to ischemia when the hormone is administered before and/or after a moderate ischemic episode; and with long-term adaptive plastic restoration processes of altered brain morphology when treatment is given after an episode of severe ischemia. The insights presented here may be a guide for future basic research, including the study of P4 administration schemes that focus on promoting its post-ischemia neurorestorative effect. Furthermore, considering that functional recovery is a desired endpoint of pharmacological strategies in the clinic, they could support the study of P4 treatment for decreasing dementia in patients who have suffered an episode of GCI.

TI  - The evolution of digital health technologies in cardiovascular disease research
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - When implemented in practice, digital technologies have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). For scholars, research into digital technologies in cardiovascular care has been relatively recent, thus it is important to understand the history of digital health technology in cardiovascular research-its emergence, rate of growth, hot topics, and its temporal evolution. The aim of this study was to analyse more than 16,000 articles in this domain based on their scientometric indicators. Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was accessed and searched at several levels, including titles, abstracts, keywords, authors, sources and individual articles. Analysis examined the temporal shifts in research and scholarly focus based on keywords, networks of collaboration, topical divisions in relation to digital technologies, and influential publications. Findings showed this research area is growing exponentially. Co-citation analysis revealed twenty prominent research streams and identified variation in the magnitude of activities in each stream. A recent emergence of research activities in digital technology in cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and arrythmia research was also demonstrated. Conversely, wearable technologies, activity tracking and electronic medical records research are now past their peak of reported research activity. With increasing amounts of novel technologies becoming available and more patients taking part in remote health care monitoring, further evaluation and research into digital technologies, including their long-term effectiveness, is needed. Furthermore, emerging technologies, which are evaluated and/or validated should be considered for implementation into clinical practice as treatment and prevention modalities for CVD.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude, and proficiency of healthcare providers in cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a public primary healthcare setting in Qatar
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - IntroductionEarly and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases both survival rate and post-cardiac arrest quality of life. This study aims to assess the current knowledge and ability of physicians and nurses in health centers (HCs) operated by the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) in Doha, Qatar, to perform CPR. MethodologyThis study consists of two parts. The first part is a descriptive cross-sectional survey using an online form targeting physicians and nurses working in all HCs to assess their CPR knowledge and attitude. The second part is a direct observation of CPR drills to evaluate the skills and competencies of code blue team members in a convenient sample of 14 HCs. A multivariate model was employed to test the independent effect of explanatory variables on the total knowledge score. ResultsA total of 569 physicians and nurses responded to the survey. Only one-half (48.7%) formally received training on basic life support within the last year. Furthermore, 62.7% have tried to revive a dying person with no pulse. All the participants recognize the importance of knowing how to revive a dying adult or child as part of their job. The study showed that being a nurse was the most important predictor of a higher knowledge score in both components. Attending more resuscitation courses (3-6 courses in the last 3 years) ranked second in importance, and a longer experience in clinical practice (5-10 and >10 years) ranked third in predictive power. In addition, the direct observation of CPR drill performance revealed a satisfactory outcome. ConclusionThe level of CPR knowledge and skills practice among healthcare providers in PHCC is deemed satisfactory as most providers reported having performed CPR in the past. Considering that PHCC is the first step to people's healthcare in Qatar, clinical staff should be certified and assessed regularly to ensure retention of resuscitation knowledge and skills.

TI  - Whole Blood Selective Aortic Arch Perfusion for Exsanguination Cardiac Arrest: Assessing Myocardial Tolerance to the Duration of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Introduction: Selective aortic arch perfusion (SAAP) is an endovascular technique that consists of aortic occlusion with perfusion of the coronary and cerebral circulation. It been shown to facilitate return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after exanguination cardiac arrest (ECA), but it is not known how long arrest may last before the myocardium can no longer be durably recovered. The aim of this study is to assess the myocardial tolerance to exsanguination cardiac arrest before successful ROSC with SAAP. Methods: Male adult swine (n = 24) were anesthetized, instrumented, and hemorrhaged to arrest. Animals were randomized into three groups: 5, 10, and 15 min of cardiac arrest before resuscitation with SAAP. Following ROSC, animals were observed for 60 min in a critical care environment. Primary outcomes were ROSC, and survival at 1-h post-ROSC. Results: Shorter cardiac arrest time was associated with higher ROSC rate and better 1-h survival. ROSC was obtained for 100% (8/8) of the 5-min ECA group, 75% (6/8) of the 10-min group, 43% (3/7) of the 15-min group (P = 0.04). One-hour post-ROSC survival was 75%, 50%, and 14% in 5-, 10-, and 15-min groups, respectively (P = 0.02). One-hour survivors in the 5-min group required less norepinephrine (1.31 mg +/- 0.83 mg) compared with 10-SAAP (0.76 mg +/- 0.24 mg), P = 0.008. Conclusion: Whole blood SAAP can accomplish ROSC at high rates even after 10 min of unsupported cardiac arrest secondary to hemorrhage, with some viability beyond to 15 min. This is promising as a tool for ECA, but requires additional optimization and clinical trials. Animal Use Protocol, IACUC: 0919015.

TI  - Assessing student paramedics' measurements of fatigue and quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a simulated cardiac arrest case
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objective: The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and the Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) recommend that high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the key to performance outcomes, emphasising compression and rotation through this process. The proposed study has a two-stage approach to evaluating cardiopulmonary resuscitations effectiveness by out-of-hospital practitioners. The first stage aimed to evaluate the influence of providing real-time biofeedback using the Q-CPR system on the provision of CPR by student paramedics. Secondly, the study quantified the effects of physical fatigue on maintaining quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed by paramedic students.Methods: Forty paramedic students completed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an instrumented manikin with and without audio-visual biofeedback (Q-CPR within the Phillips MRx defibrillator) in a balanced cross-over fashion. To quantify the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation concerning the percentage of applied compressions that meet the current ARC guidelines in terms of rate, depth, and recoil time, a manikin feedback system (SimMan 3 G; Laerdal, Norwegian) was used.Results: When using the Q-CPR prompt with bio-feedback, overall, the depth and fatigue levels increased significantly, highlighting a correlation between correct depth and increased fatigue.Conclusions: Audio prompts improved compression depth; however, fatigue levels increased. The depth during manual compression compared to the Q-CPR prompt was not statistically significant.(c) 2022 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Single-arm feasibility trial of a resilience intervention for cardiac arrest survivors and their family caregivers, Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Emotional distress is common in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and their family caregivers and undermines long-term health and quality of life. To address this, we adapted a resilience intervention for survivors and their caregivers, entitled Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest (RT-CA). Methods: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of RT-CA between 09/2024-03/2025. We enrolled dyads of consecutively admitted CA survivors at Massachusetts General Hospital and their primary family caregivers. Inclusion criteria: adult English speakers, survivors must have ability to meaningfully participate (Short Form Mini Mental State Exam >= 5), one dyad member must have emotional distress (>= 8 on either subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]). Procedure: Dyads participated in six weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist focused on building mindfulness and coping skills. Feasibility outcomes were feasibility of recruitment, assessments, adherence; acceptability outcomes were satisfaction, credibility, expectancy. Dyads completed pre-and post-test psychosocial measures and participated in exit interviews. We calculated frequencies and proportions of our outcomes, conducted exploratory paired t-tests to examine initial signals of changes in psychosocial measures, and performed explanatory-sequential mixed methods to integrate data sources. Results: We screened 12 dyads and enrolled 7. RT-CA exceeded most feasibility and acceptability benchmarks (>70 % on 7 of 8). In exploratory analyses, participants experienced preliminary, yet meaningful reductions in emotional distress (HADS anxiety survivors: mean [95 % CI] = 5.4 [ 3.4, 7.5], p < 0.001; depression survivors = 5.1 [ 2.2, 8], p < 0.01; anxiety caregivers = 3.1 [ 0.8, 5.5], p < 0.05; depression caregivers = 3.5 [ 8, 1.1], p > 0.05). Mixed-methods analysis indicated general concordance between quantitative and qualitative data. Conclusion: Results support preliminary feasibility of RT-CA. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial is now required.

TI  - Shorter Interval from Witnessed Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest to Reaching the Target Temperature Could Improve Neurological Outcomes After Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation with Target Temperature Management: A Retrospective Analysis of a Japanese Nationwide Multicenter Observational Registry
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a more promising treatment for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) than conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). However, previous studies that compared ECPR and CCPR included mixed groups of patients with or without target temperature management (TTM). In this study, we compared the neurological outcomes of OHCA between ECPR and CCPR with TTM in all patients. We performed retrospective subanalyses of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry. Witnessed adult cases of cardiogenic OHCA treated with TTM were eligible for this study. We used univariate and multivariable analyses in all eligible patients to compare the neurological outcomes after ECPR or CCPR. We also conducted propensity score analyses of all patients and according to the interval from witnessed OHCA to reaching the target temperature (IWT) of <= 600, <= 480, <= 360, <= 240, and <= 120 minutes. We analyzed 1146 cases. The propensity score analysis did not show a significant difference in favorable neurological outcomes (defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2 at 1 month after collapse) between EPCR and CCPR (odds ratio: OR 4.683 [95% confidence interval: CI 0.859-25.535], p = 0.747). However, ECPR was associated with more favorable neurological outcomes in patients with IWT of <= 600 minutes (OR 7.089 [95% CI 1.091-46.061], p = 0.406), <= 480 minutes (OR 10.492 [95% CI 1.534-71.773], p = 0.0168), <= 360 minutes (OR 17.573 [95% CI 2.486-124.233], p = 0.0042), <= 240 minutes (OR 38.908 [95% CI 5.045-300.089], p = 0.0005), and <= 120 minutes (OR 200.390 [95% CI 23.730-1692.211], p < 0.001). This study revealed significant differences in the neurological outcomes between ECPR and CCPR in patients with TTM whose IWT was <= 600 minutes.

TI  - Fatal late cardiovascular sequelae of previously unrecognized Kawasaki disease in 12-year-old child
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundKawasaki disease (KD), previously termed mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is a childhood vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. It primarily affects children under five years of age. If left untreated, KD can lead to serious cardiovascular complications, particularly coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) and thrombosis. Incomplete KD presents with fewer clinical criteria, making it more difficult to diagnose. Importantly, long-term sequelae such as CAA may remain clinically silent for years. This case highlights the critical need for awareness that even minimal or transient symptoms can be the only warning sign of life-threatening complications in adolescents with a remote history of incomplete or unrecognized KD.Case presentationWe describe a fatal case of a 12-year-old boy with a history of presumed myocarditis at age five, which retrospectively fulfilled criteria for incomplete KD but remained undiagnosed. From age five to twelve, he was asymptomatic except for occasional, brief chest tightness. At twelve, he presented with mild chest pain followed by rapid clinical deterioration, cardiac arrest, and death. Post-mortem imaging and autopsy revealed a thrombosed giant aneurysm of the left anterior descending coronary artery, consistent with chronic coronary disease.ConclusionThis case illustrates the potentially fatal long-term cardiovascular sequelae of unrecognized and untreated incomplete KD. Early recognition and treatment with IVIG are critical to reduce coronary complications. Healthcare providers must maintain clinical vigilance for patients with a history of KD. Even subtle or transient symptoms in patients with a history of KD should prompt immediate evaluation to prevent fatal outcomes.

TI  - Improvement in timing and effectiveness of external cardiac compressions with a new non-invasive device: the CPR-Ezy
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Prompt and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the first link in the chain of survival following cardiac arrest. We assessed a new device, the CPR-Ezy(TM) (Medteq Innovations Pty Ltd., Brisbane, Australia), to aid timing and effectiveness of external cardiac compressions (ECC), by 32 subjects who had prior community-based training in CPR. ECC was performed on a manikin for 4 min by all subjects without and with the device. There was a statistically significant improvement in timing of ECC. Effectiveness of compressions was also improved over the whole time period, especially so in the last minute. We conclude that the CPR-Ezy can improve timing and effectiveness of ECC, and reduce the effects of resuscitator fatigue, in community-trained subjects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Association of hyperfibrinolysis with poor prognosis in refractory circulatory arrest: implications for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
AB  - Background: Identifying candidates for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) is challenging, and novel predictive markers are urgently needed. Hyperfibrinolysis is linked to tissue hypoxia and is associated with poor outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) can detect or rule out hyperfibrinolysis, and could, therefore, provide decision support for initiation of eCPR. We explored early detection of hyperfibrinolysis in patients with refractory OHCA referred for eCPR. Methods: We analysed ROTEM results and resuscitation parameters of 57 adult patients with ongoing OHCA who presented to our ICU for eCPR evaluation. Results: Hyperfibrinolysis, defined as maximum lysis > 15%, was present in 36 patients (63%) and was associated with higher serum lactate, lower arterial blood pH, and increased low-flow intervals. Of 42 patients who achieved return of circulation, 28 had a poor 30-day outcome. The incidence of hyperfibrinolysis was higher in the poor outcome group compared with patients with good outcomes (75% [21 of 28] vs 7.1% [1 of 14]; P<0.001). < 0.001). The ratio of EXTEM A5 to lactate concentration showed good predictive value in detecting hyperfibrinolysis (AUC of 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.8-1]). Conclusions: Hyperfibrinolysis was common in patients with refractory cardiac arrest, and was associated with poor prognosis. The combination of high lactate with early clot firmness values, such as EXTEM A5, appears promising for early detection of hyperfibrinolysis. This finding could facilitate decisions to perform eCPR, particularly for patients with prolonged low-flow duration but lacking hyperfibrinolysis.

TI  - Experiencing Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Significant Others' Lifeworld Perspective
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - When patients suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA), significant others find themselves with no choice about being there. After the event they are often left with unanswered questions about the life-threatening circumstances, or the patient's death, or emergency treatment and future needs. When it is unclear how the care and the event itself will affect significant others' well-being, prehospital emergency personnel face ethical decisions. In this article we describe the experiences of significant others present at OHCA, focusing on ethical aspects and values. Using a lifeworld phenomenological approach, 7 significant others were interviewed. The essence of the phenomenon of OHCA can be stated as unreality in the reality, which is characterized by overwhelming responsibility. The significant others experience inadequacy and limitation, they move between hope and hopelessness, and they struggle with ethical considerations and an insecurity about the future. The study findings show how significant others' sense of an OHCA situation, when life is trembling, can threaten values deemed important for a good life.

TI  - Disrupted Lives: Caregivers' Experiences of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors' Recovery 5Years Later
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background: Survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) experience ongoing physical and cognitive impairments, often requiring support from a caregiver at home afterwards. Caregivers are important in the survivor's recovery, yet there is little research specifically focused on their experiences once the survivor is discharged home. In this study, we highlight how caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors described and experienced their caregiver role, the strategies they used to fulfill their role, and the additional needs they still have years after the IHCA event.
   Methods and Results: Between March and July 2019, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 12 caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors. Interviews were transcribed, and content analysis was performed. Patterns within the data were further analyzed and grouped into themes. A predominant theme of "disruption" was identified across 3 different domains including the following: (1) disruption in caregiver's life, (2) disruption in caregiver-patient relationship, and (3) disruption in caregiver's well-being. Disruption was associated with both positive and negative caregiver experiences. Strategies caregivers used and resources they felt would have helped them adjust to their caregiver role were also identified.
   Conclusions: Caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors experienced a disruption in many facets of their lives. Caregivers felt the veterans' IHCA impacted various aspects of their lives, and they continued to need additional support in order to care for the IHCA survivor and themselves. Although some were able to procure coping strategies, such as counseling and engaging in stress-relieving activities, most indicated additional help and resources were still needed.

TI  - Alterations in cognitive outcome between 3 and 12 months in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: To prospectively investigate cognitive recovery from 3 to 12 months after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and the associations between cognitive performance at 3 months and health-related quality of life (HRQL), psychological distress and work status after 12 months.
   Methods: At both assessments, neuropsychological tests were used to measure aspects of general mental ability, verbal and visual memory, psychomotor speed and executive function. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to measure mental and physical HRQL, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess psychological distress.
   Results: 33 survivors completed both exams (31 males, mean age 58.6 years, SD =13). The OHCAs were witnessed and due to cardiac origins. Nine patients were awake at admission to the hospital. Longer coma duration was associated with poorer cognitive results. Memory impairments were the most common symptom. The mean changes and effect sizes indicated minor improvements in cognitive performance from 3 to 12 months (Hedges g <= .26). Reliable change indices for an individual's results further confirmed the stability of the group statistics. The HADS scores showed increased depressive symptoms, and mental HRQL was reduced from 3 to 12 months. Higher reports of psychological distress were related to worse HRQL. Work participation increased. Better cognitive results at 3 months were correlated with better HRQL and return to work at 12 months.
   Conclusions: The current data describe stability in results from 3 to 12 months. A worse cognitive performance at 3 months and higher reports of psychological distress were associated with lower HRQL. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The relationship between liver cyst volume and QOL in Japanese ADPKD patients
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEPHROLOGY
AB  - Background Although it is widely accepted that the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients with large liver cysts have a significant decrement in quality of life (QOL), there is insufficient evidence that clearly demonstrates the relationship between the size of the liver cysts and QOL. Therefore, we started this prospective longitudinal study to investigate the impact of liver cysts on QOL. Methods We grouped the 111 included ADPKD patients into 4 groups (control group A; < 25%, group B; 25-49%, group C; 50-75%, group D; > 75%) according to liver cysts-parenchyma ratio (CPR). QOL was measured by FANLTC + FACT-Hep scores. We compared QOL scores and several clinical parameters amongst these groups for 3 years. Results The number of patients in group A, B, C, and D was 31, 14, 14, and 23, respectively. Although there were no significant differences in AST (p = 0.107), ALT (p = 0.925), and serum albumin (p = 0.212) between the four groups, platelet count was significantly decreased along with the extension of cyst volume (p = 0.030). Overall, the mean FANLTC and FACT-Hep scores were 71.8 +/- 12.5, and 32.4 +/- 5.8, respectively. FANLTC (p = 0.017) and FACT-Hep scores (p = 0.003) were significantly decreased with increasing cyst volume. From the data collected at the time of registration, multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that the CPR had a significant influence on FANLTC and FACT-Hep scores. Conclusion In this cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study, we demonstrate the relationship between liver cyst volume and QOL in ADPKD patients. We hope to establish the long-term influence on QOL in this ongoing prospective longitudinal study.

TI  - Global Cerebral Ischemia: Synaptic and Cognitive Dysfunction
T2  - CURRENT DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Cardiopulmonary arrest is one of the leading causes of death and disability, primarily occurring in the aged population. Numerous global cerebral ischemia animal models induce neuronal damage similar to cardiac arrest. These global cerebral ischemia models range from vessel occlusion to total cessation of cardiac function, both of which have allowed for the investigation of this multifaceted disease and detection of numerous agents that are neuroprotective. Synapses endure a variety of alterations after global cerebral ischemia from the resulting excitotoxicity and have been a major target for neuroprotection; however, neuroprotective agents have proven unsuccessful in clinical trials, as neurological outcomes have not displayed significant improvements in patients. A majority of these neuroprotective agents have specific neuronal targets, where the success of future neuroprotective agents may depend on non-specific targets and numerous cognitive improvements. This review focuses on the different models of global cerebral ischemia, neuronal synaptic alterations, synaptic neuroprotection and behavioral tests that can be used to determine deficits in cognitive function after global cerebral ischemia.

TI  - Perioperative and late outcomes of laparoscopic fundoplication for neurologically impaired children with gastro-esophageal reflux disease
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background Persistent gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) due to various pathological factors often results in overt clinical symptoms and signs, which is termed as gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Affected children usually present with failure to thrive, recurrent pneumonia or apnea. Many neurologically impaired children have symptoms related to GERD. Although laparoscopic fundoplication has been established to be an effective treatment modality for children with GERD, data on its role and long-term efficacy for neurologically impaired patients remain sparse. The aim of this study was to review the results of such patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication.
   Methods A retrospective review was performed from 1998 to 2009. All children with neurological impairment who had laparoscopic fundoplication were included.
   Results Fifty-nine GERD patients (male=32, female=27; mean age 6 years) were identified. All subjects showed symptoms of frequent emesis; 32 of them had history of hematemesis (54.2%); 54 had feeding difficulty; 35 (59.3%) had associated respiratory symptoms, including recurrent pneumonia. Gastrostomy was performed concurrently in 39 cases. There was no conversion to open procedure nor was there intra-operative complications and operative mortality. Emesis or hematemesis was controlled adequately in all: However, respiratory symptoms were not controlled in 10 patients (16.9%), and five of them required further respiratory assistance including nasal airway tube and tracheostomy. Clinical recurrence of GERD was not observed in any subject. Twelve patients died during follow-up (range from 3 months to 9 years) due to severe respiratory complications, cardiac arrest, and brain tumor.
   Conclusions Laparoscopic fundoplication is an excellent procedure for controlling clinically significant symptoms in neurological impaired patients with GERD. Further studies are required to assess the improvement of the quality of life in such patients. Chin Med J 2012;125(21):3905-3908

TI  - Recent Trends in the Management of Bladder Exstrophy: The Gordian Knot Has Not Yet Been Cut
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Although enormous effort has been made to further improve the operative techniques worldwide, the management of bladder exstrophy (BE) remains one of the most significant challenges in pediatric urology. Today it is universally agreed that successful and gentle initial bladder closure is decisive for favorable long-term outcome with regard to bladder capacity, renal function and continence. Due to a number of reasons, including a lack of comparable multicenter studies, a range of concepts is currently used to achieve successful primary closure. We review the literature of the last 15 years on the current concepts of bladder exstrophy repair with regard to the time of primary closure (initial vs. delayed closure), the concepts of primary closure (single-stage vs. staged approach; without osteotomy vs. osteotomy) and their outcomes. There is a worldwide lack of multicenter outcome studies with adequate patient numbers and precisely defined outcome parameters, based on the use of validated instruments. The modern staged repair (MRSE) in different variations, the complete primary reconstruction of exstrophy (CPRE), and the radical soft-tissue mobilization (RSTM) had been the most extensively studied and reported procedures. These major concepts are obligatory stable now for more than 20 years. Nevertheless, there are still a lot of open-ended questions e.g., on the potential for development of the bladder template, on continence, on long-term orthopedic outcome, on sexuality and fertility and on quality of life. Management of BE remains difficult and controversial. Further, clinical research should focus on multi-institutional collaborative trials to determine the optimal approach.

TI  - Coronary artery bypass graft outcome: The Trinidad and Tobago experience
T2  - WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The study is a retrospective review of the demographic, clinical, angiographic, and operative data of the first 205 consecutive CABG operations performed by Caribbean Heart Care at the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex (EWMSC), Trinidad and Tobago, between November 1993 and December 1997. The aim of the study was to determine the in-hosptal and intermediate-term follow-up results. The mean age of patients was 59 +/- 10 years and 78% were male. Sixty-four per cent were of East Indian descent, whereas 16% were of African descent. Forty-eight per cent of the patients were hypertensive, 46% were diabetic, 33% had hyperlipidaemia, 20% had a recent history of cigarette smoking and 16% were obese. Sixty-five percent had a positive family history of ischaemic heart disease. The average time interval between angiography and surgery was 2.3 months, At the time of angiography, 63.5% of patients had Canadian Cardiac Society (CCS) class 3 or 4 angina. The mean ejection fraction was 61 +/- 15%. Wall motion abnormalities were seen in 67% of patients. Significant stenoses of the left anterior descending artery, right circumflex artery, circumflex and ramus coronary arteries were present in 91%, 78%, 54% and 5%, respectively. Many patients (67%) had severe diffuse disease on angiography. The mean intensive care stay was 2.2 +/- 0.8 days. In-hospital mortality was 3.9% (8/205). The most frequent post-operative complication was haemorrhage (2.6%). A cute renal failure occurred in 2.1%; pulmonary collapse, 1.6%; stroke, 1% and cardiac arrest, 1%. Both sternal wound infections and systemic sepsis occurred in 0.5%. Intermediate-term follow-up data were obtained for 92% (189/205). The duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 5 years (mean 3.7 years). During the follow-up period, 7 patients (3.4%) died Angina severity was reduced from a mean CCS score of 2.61 +/- 0.95 before CABG to 1.22 +/- 0.55 at the time of follow-up (p < 0.0001). Overall 4-year mortality compared favourably with data from international studies, Among survivors, quality of life improved as evidenced by the reduction in the mean angina score.

TI  - An improved thermal-compositional simulator for gas extraction from hydrate-bearing sediments at the field-scale
T2  - COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS
AB  - Natural gas hydrate (NGH) is considered a highly promising clean energy resource, whose production involves complex multi-field processes. Field-scale simulation provides valuable insights for the economic development of hydrate. However, accurate and robust numerical simulators capable of capturing complex processes specific to hydrate production modeling have remained limited. In this study, a fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-chemical model for gas extraction from hydrate-bearing sediments (HBS) was developed based on a flexible thermalcompositional framework. The model enables simulating the non-isothermal, multi-phase, multi-component flow with hydrate kinetics in the sediments. Furthermore, several strategies were employed to improve the computational efficiency and robustness of field-scale simulations. To achieve this, an isenthalpic flash procedure for phase transition was proposed to ensure local mass and energy conservation. Also, phase-based variable reduction and CPR-preconditioning techniques were incorporated in the hydrate-related linear system. A fully implicit numerical procedure was finally implemented in a three-dimensional simulator named HydrateSys V1.0. The reliability of the enhanced simulator was validated through comparisons with three typical cases. The merit of the isenthalpic flash procedure proposed in this study was demonstrated through a numerical performance comparison. Further, a field-scale case was established to predict gas production and reservoir responses in a long-term simulation. The results demonstrated an improvement in computational performance, highlighting the CPR preconditioner's potential in large-scale hydrate model. Finally, a case for the SHSC2-4 well in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea was conducted under depressurization, demonstrating the applicability of this simulator.

TI  - Early vigabatrin to augment GABAergic pathways in post-anoxic status epilepticus☆
T2  - EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR
AB  - The outcomes of patients who experience status epilepticus during the post-cardiac arrest period, or post-anoxic status epilepticus (PASE), remain dismal despite advances in resuscitation. The combination of therapeutic nihilism and the refractoriness of seizures in a setting where pessimistic prognostic impressions prevail is likely the main driver of such poor outcomes. The resulting pervasive vicious cycle perpetuates this knowledge gap, whereby hypoxic-ischemic insults as the etiology for seizures remain a ubiquitous exclusion criterion for clinal trials in status epilepticus. Effective therapies targeting hyperexcitability resulting from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury are urgently needed. Early inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase with vigabatrin holds potential as an effective adjunctive therapy for PASE. This scientific premise is based on the resulting halted GABA catabolism thereby promoting synergistic augmentation of GABAergic pathway when used in combination with positive GABAergic allosteric modulators. This paper is based on a lecture presented at the 9th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures, in London 8-10 April 2024.

TI  - Empiric tenecteplase is associated with increased return of spontaneous circulation and short term survival in cardiac arrest patients unresponsive to standard interventions
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Prospective and retrospective studies have shown that empiric use of fibrinolytic agents in sudden cardiac arrest is safe and may improve outcomes in sudden cardiac arrest. Use of fibrinolytic agents for this indication is increasing in response to these data.
   Methods: A prospective multicenter observational trial was performed in three emergency departments (EDs) to determine the proportion of patients that respond to empiric fibrinolysis with tenecteplase (TNK) after failing to respond to Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) measures. Cardiac arrest patients unresponsive to ACLS, who were given TNK by their treating physician, were enrolled in an outcome registry. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival, complications, and neurotogical outcomes were recorded.
   Results: Fifty patients received TNK after a mean of 30 min of cardiac arrest and eight doses of ACLS medications. One hundred and thirteen concurrent control patients received standard ACLS measures. ROSC occurred in 26% of TNK patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 16-40%) compared to 12.4% (95% CI 6.9-20%) among ACLS controls (p=.04); 12% (4.5-24%) of TNK patients survived to admission compared to none in the control group (p=.0007); 4% (0.5-14%) survived to 24h (p = NS); and 4% (0.5-14%) survived to hospital discharge (p = NS). All survivors had a good neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2). One intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurred. No other significant bleeding complications were observed.
   Conclusions: Empiric fibrinolysis with TNK in cardiac arrest is associated with increased ROSC and short term survival, and with survival to hospital discharge with good neurological function in patients who fait to respond to ACLS. Results may improve with earlier administration. Prospective controlled interventional trials are indicated to evaluate this promising new therapy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Update of Sepsis in the Intensive Care Unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF INNATE IMMUNITY
AB  - Sepsis, the most common cause of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), has had an increased incidence and prevalence over the last years with a simultaneous decrease in its short-term mortality. Sepsis survivors are more frequently discharged from hospital and often experience long-term outcomes such as late mortality, immune dysfunction, secondary infections, impaired quality of life, and unplanned readmissions. Early recognition and management of sepsis have challenged emergency care and critical care physicians and nurses. New sepsis definitions were produced and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2016 was updated recently. Although hospital readmissions after sepsis are common, associated risk factors and how to manage patients who survive an episode of sepsis still need clarification. The immune dysfunction caused by sepsis/septic shock is complex, persistent, affects inflammatory and anti-inflammatory systems, and might be associated with long-term outcomes of sepsis. Several randomized controlled trials (RCT) that analyzed new (and old) interventions in sepsis/septic shock are discussed in this review in parallel with the SSC 2016 recommendations and other guidelines when relevant. RCTs addressing incidence, treatment, and prevention of important sepsis-associated organ dysfunction such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and brain dysfunction are highlighted. Finally, we briefly discuss the need for novel targets, predictive biomarkers, and new designs of RCTs in sepsis. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - A systematic review and meta-synthesis of the qualitative literature exploring the experiences and quality of life of survivors of a cardiac arrest
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Background: Survival following cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is increasing worldwide, mainly due to greater awareness of the symptoms of cardiac events and an increased attention to CPR training. Although patient outcomes remain unpredictable and quantitative studies suggest that the overall quality of life (QOL) is acceptable, it is valuable to synthesise qualitative studies exploring these phenomena in depth, providing a deeper knowledge of survivors' experiences and QOL.
   Aims: To critically appraise and synthesise the qualitative literature on survivors' experiences of a cardiac arrest and CPR with the aim of identifying common themes that can inform clinical pathways and thereby improve survivor outcomes and QOL.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of the qualitative literature, using Thomas and Harden's framework, and confined to peer-reviewed papers published from 2000 to 2015, which were identified through database searches of EBSCO, OVID and ProQuest.
   Results: The search produced 204 papers, and of these, seven relevant papers were identified for review. Data extraction included setting, participants, research design, data collection, analysis and themes. Five qualitative themes were identified and were the subject of this meta-synthesis: multitude of contrasting feelings; disruption in the continuum of time; new reality and psychological challenges; changed body with new limitations; and confrontation with death.
   Conclusion: This review provides insights into the experiences of survivors' QOL after CPR. Increased knowledge can improve person-centred care in the immediate and forthcoming care after the event, both in terms of planning for discharge and in the future care of people who survive a cardiac arrest.

TI  - Effect of damage control strategy combining pre-hospital emergency treatment with in-hospital treatment on pelvic fracture complicated by multiple injuries
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Objective: To analyze the application value of damage control strategies combining pre-hospital emergency treatment with in-hospital treatment for multiple injuries in treating pelvic fracture complicated by multiple injuries. Methods: 120 patients with pelvic fracture complicated by multiple injuries admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to January 2023 were selected and divided into a damage control group (early temporary reduction after resuscitation, n = 60) and a control group (no reduction and resuscitation only, n = 60) by treatment methods. The control group was treated with conventional methods, while the damage control group was treated with the damage control strategy combining pre-hospital emergency treatment combined with inhospital treatment in addition to conventional methods. The mortality rate, complication rate, fracture reduction quality, long-term efficacy, and patient satisfaction of the two groups were compared. Results: The mortality rate of the damage control group was lower than that of the control group, and the difference has statistical significance (P<0.05); the incidence of infection, DIC, and MODS of the damage control group were lower than that of the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (P<0.05); the incidence of ARDS in the two groups is not that different (P>0.05); the fracture reduction quality and long-term therapeutic effect of patients in the two groups were statistically different, with the damage control group outperforming the control group in both aspects; the difference between the two groups in terms of patient satisfaction was statistically significant (P<0.05), with the patient satisfaction of the damage control group being higher than that of the control group. Conclusion: For patients with pelvic fracture, the application of the damage control strategy combining prehospital emergency treatment and in-hospital treatment is a boon to the standardization of the treatment process, the improvement of the treatment success rate and fracture reduction quality and the reduction of complications, and therefore is worth promoting in clinical practice. the early application of external fixation has helped with the definitive reduction at a time when the patuent was stable.

TI  - Initial electrical frequency predicts survival and neurological outcome in out of hospital cardiac arrest patients with pulseless electrical activity
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Outcome is generally poor in out of hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) with initial non-shockable rhythms. Termination of resuscitation rules facilitate early prognostication at the scene to cease resuscitation attempts in futile situations and to proceed advanced life support in promising conditions. As pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is present as first rhythm in every 4th OHCA we were interested if the initial electrical frequency in PEA predicts survival.
   Methods: All patients > 18 years of age with non-traumatic OHCA and PEA as first rhythm between August 2013 and August 2015 from the Vienna Cardiac Arrest Registry were included in this retrospective observational study. Defibrillator and epidemiological data from the emergency medical system as survival data were processed considering the initial electrical activity in PEA and 30 days survival.
   Results: Out of 2149 OHCA patients, a total of 504 PEA patients were eligible for analyses. These patients were stratified into 4 groups according the initial electrical frequency in PEA: 10-24/min, 25-39/min, 40-59/min, > 60/min. Compared to a frequency > 60/min all other subgroups were associated with higher mortality especially those with an initial electrical frequency 10-24 (adjusted OR 0.56 (0.39-0.79) p =. 001 for each category chance). QRS duration in PEA did not influence outcome. Patients in the > 60/min group showed a 30-days-survival rate of 22% and a good neurological outcome in 15% of all patients - comparable to shockable cardiac arrest rhythms.
   Conclusion: Regardless of other resuscitation factors, higher initial electrical frequency in PEA is associated with increased odds of survival and good neurological outcome.

TI  - Surgical stabilization of severe chest wall injury following cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) contributes to significant chest wall injury similar to blunt trauma. With benefits realized for surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRFs) for flail injuries and severely displaced fractures following trauma, SSRF for chest wall injury following CPR could be advantageous, provided good functional and neurologic outlook. Experience is limited. We present a review of patients treated with SSRF at our institution following CPR. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing SSRF following CPR was performed between 2019 and 2020. Perioperative inpatient data were collected with outpatient follow-up as able. RESULTS Five patients underwent SSRF over the course of the 2-year interval. All patients required invasive ventilation preoperatively or had impending respiratory. Mean age was 59 +/- 12 years, with all patients being male. Inciting events for cardiac arrest included respiratory, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, pulseless electrical activity, and anaphylaxis. Time to operation was 6.6 +/- 3 days. Four patients demonstrated anterior flail injury pattern with or without sternal fracture, with one patient having multiple severely displaced fractures. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture was performed appropriately to restore chest wall stability. Mean intensive care unit length of stay was 9.8 +/- 6.4 days and overall hospital length of stay 24.6 +/- 13.2 days. Median postoperative ventilation was 2 days (range, 1-15 days) with two patients developing pneumonia and one requiring tracheostomy. There were no mortalities at 30 days. One patient expired in hospice after a prolonged hospitalization. Disposition destination was variable. No hardware complications were noted on outpatient follow-up, and all surviving patients were home. CONCLUSION Chest wall injuries are incurred frequently following CPR. Surgical stabilization of these injuries can be considered to promote ventilator liberation and rehabilitation. Careful patient selection is paramount, with surgery offered to those with reversible causes of arrest and good functional and neurologic outcome. Experience is early, with further investigation needed.

TI  - Effectiveness of mechanical chest compression for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in an emergency department
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background: To increase the chance of restoring spontaneous circulation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with high-quality chest compressions is needed. We hypothesized that, in a municipal hospital emergency department, the outcome in nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with standard CPR followed by mechanical chest compression (MeCC) was not inferior to that followed by manual chest compression (MaCC). The purposes of the study were to test our hypothesis and investigate whether the use of MeCC decreased human power demands for CPR.
   Methods: A total of 455 consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients of presumed cardiac etiology were divided into two groups according to the chest compressions they received (MaCC or MeCC) in this retrospective review study. Human power demand for CPR was described according to the Basic Life Support/Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines and the device handbook. The primary endpoint was recovery of spontaneous circulation during resuscitation, and the secondary endpoints were survival to hospital admission and medical human power demands.
   Results: In this study, recovery of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 33.3% of patients in the MeCC group and in 27.1% in the MaCC group (p = 0.154), and the percentages of patients who survived hospitalization were 22.2% and 17.6%, respectively (p = 0.229). A ratio of 2:4 for the human power demand for CPR between the groups was found. Independent predictors of survival to hospitalization were ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia as initial rhythm and recovery of spontaneous circulation.
   Conclusion: No difference was found in early survival between standard CPR performed with MeCC and that performed with MaCC. However, the use of the MeCC device appears to promote staff availability without waiving patient care in the human power-demanding emergency departments of Taiwan hospitals.

TI  - TREATMENT OF VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS AFTER RECOVERY FROM MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF MEDICINE
AB  - Demonstrated associations between postmyocardial infarction ventricular arrhythmias and a higher subsequent risk of both sudden and all-cause mortality have prompted a search for effective and safe treatment modalities. Recently completed clinical trials have provided a rationale for treatment recommendations in some specific settings. Beta-blocking therapy is recommended for postinfarction patients with frequent or complex ventricular premature beats. In contrast, calcium antagonist therapy is not helpful in these cases, and Class I antiarrhythmic therapy is actually harmful. Early indications of benefit from Class m antiarrhythmic therapies, particularly amiodarone, are under evaluation in large trials. Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) occuring late after myocardial infarction require therapy. Viable therapeutic methods include individualized antiarrhythmic therapy selected by the noninvasive approach, individualized antiarrhythmic therapy selected by the invasive approach, empiric amiodarone therapy, transcatheter or surgical ablative therapy (for VT), and use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Clinical trial data have yet to determine which of these approaches is most effective under which circumstances. Postinfarction patients with nonsustained VT are the focus of several ongoing treatment trials. Early data suggest that risks requiring specific therapy are reached only by those patients who also have significant left ventricular dysfunction. The presence of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia at an electrophysiologic study may further risk stratify such patients. High-risk patients with nonsustained ventricular tacycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia should participate in ongoing clinical trials. In the absence of this opportunity, intensive treatment should be considered.

TI  - Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviate Post-resuscitation Cardiac and Cerebral Injuries by Inhibiting Cell Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis in a Swine Model of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the ensuing cardiac and cerebral injuries contribute to the poor outcome of cardiac arrest (CA) victims, in which the pathogenetic process is possibly driven by cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be a promising strategy for post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral protection in rat, but its effectiveness in the clinically relevant swine model and the potential protective mechanism remain unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether MSCs administration could alleviate post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral injuries through the inhibition of cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis in swine. Twenty-four male domestic swine were randomly divided into three groups: sham, CPR, and MSC. A dose of 2.5x10(6)/kg of MSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells was intravenously infused at 1.5, and 3 days prior to CA. The animal model was established by 8 min of CA and then 8 min of CPR. After resuscitation, cardiac, cerebral function and injury biomarkers were regularly evaluated for a total of 24 h. At 24 h post-resuscitation, pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-18), ferroptosis-related proteins (ACSL4, GPX4) and iron deposition in the heart, cortex and hippocampus were measured. Consequently, significantly greater cardiac, cerebral dysfunction and injuries after resuscitation were observed in the CPR and MSC groups compared with the sham group. However, the severity of cardiac and cerebral damage were significantly milder in the MSC group than in the CPR group. In addition, the expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD and ACSL4, the contents of IL-1 beta and IL-18, and the level of iron deposition were significantly higher while the expression level of GPX4 was significantly lower in the heart, cortex and hippocampus in all resuscitated animals compared with the sham group. Nevertheless, MSCs administration significantly decreased post-resuscitation cardiac, cerebral pyroptosis and ferroptosis compared to the CPR group. Our results showed that the administration of MSCs significantly alleviated post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral injuries in swine, in which the protective effects were related to the inhibition of cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

TI  - Managing Chronic Diarrhea With Colorectal Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE NURSING
AB  - Chronic diarrhea is a frequent symptom among colorectal cancer patients, both during and after treatment for the disease. Chronic diarrhea is the frequent passage of loose stools (>3 unformed stools and/or a volume of stool >200 g in 24 hours) with urgency and duration of more than 4 weeks. Chronic diarrhea can result in metabolic disturbances and poor quality of life. There are many causes, both related and unrelated to the physiological changes with colorectal cancer and its treatment. Patients should be assessed for the underlying cause and adverse outcomes of the chronic diarrhea, including dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. It is managed with fluid resuscitation, electrolyte repletion, diet modification, and a variety of nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Patients should be referred to gastrointestinal specialists and dietitians for collaborative management. A case study is used to illustrate assessment and management of this symptom.

TI  - Enhancing the Chain of Survival: The Role of Smartphone Applications in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - This review explores the role of smartphone applications in providing real-time guidance for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) practices and highlights their potential to improve CPR quality among laypersons. A narrative literature review was conducted on the effectiveness of mobile CPR applications for smartphones. Studies published between 2014 and 2024 were included to ensure that new technological advances were examined. Our findings revealed that guided CPR applications significantly improve most critical parameters for efficacious resuscitation. Application users demonstrated that they achieved performance comparable to or even better than CPR-certified individuals. However, these tools have limitations, mostly related to familiarity, which may result in a delay in activating the application and, therefore, in initiating CPR. While smartphone applications are promising tools for enhancing bystander CPR, their integration into emergency medical response requires careful consideration. To fully take advantage of these applications, they should be incorporated into public health campaigns and standard CPR training. This would be even more successful if the application's functionality were standardized across different regions. Our research indicates that a combination of education and technology will likely play a major role in CPR training in the future, improving the efficacy and accessibility of life-saving measures. Smartphone applications could greatly improve the chain of survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) events. The design and accessibility of these applications as well as the integration of these applications with current emergency response frameworks should be the main areas of future research.

TI  - The effect of targeted temperature management on coagulation parameters and bleeding events after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: Targeted temperature management (TTM) is part of the standard treatment of comatose patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) to attenuate neurological injury. In other clinical settings, hypothermia promotes coagulopathy leading to an increase in bleeding and thrombosis tendency. Thus, concern has been raised as to whether TTM can be applied safely, as acute myocardial infarction requiring primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the need of effective antiplatelet therapy is frequent following OHCA. This study investigated the influence of TTM at 33 or 36 degrees C on various laboratory and coagulation parameters.
   Methods and results: In this single-center predefined substudy of the TTM trial, 171 patients were randomized to TTM at either 33 or 36 degrees C in the postresuscitation phase. The two subgroups were compared regarding standard laboratory coagulation parameters, thrombelastography (TEG), bleeding, and stent thrombosis events. Platelet counts were lower in the TTM33-group compared to TTM36 (p = 0.009), but neither standard coagulation nor TEG-parameters showed any difference between the groups. TEG revealed a normocoagulable state in the majority of patients, while approximately 20% of the population presented as hypercoagulable. Adverse events included 38 bleeding events, one stent thrombosis, and one reinfarction, with no significant difference between the groups.
   Conclusions: There was no evidence supporting the assumption that TTM at 33 degrees C was associated with impaired hemostasis or increased the frequency of adverse bleeding and thrombotic events compared to TTM at 36 degrees C. We found that TTM at either temperature can safely be applied in the postresuscitation phase after acute myocardial infarction and primary PCI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dealing with a life changing event: The influence of spirituality and coping style on quality of life after survival of a cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Survivors of a cardiac arrest often have cognitive and emotional problems. As a cardiac arrest is also an obvious life-threatening event, other psychological sequelae associated with surviving such as spirituality may also affect quality of life.
   Objectives: To determine the relationship between spirituality, coping and quality of life in cardiac patients both with and without a cardiac arrest.
   Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, participants received a questionnaire by post. The primary outcome measure was quality of life (LiSat-9). Secondary outcome measures were spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp12), coping style (UPCC), emotional well-being (HADS, IES), fatigue (FSS) and daily activities (FAI). Statistical analyses included multiple regression analyses.
   Results: Data were available from 72 (60% response rate) cardiac arrest survivors and 98 (47%) patients with a myocardial infarction. Against our hypothesis, there were no differences in spirituality or other variables between the groups, with the exception of more depressive symptoms in patients with myocardial infarction without arrest. Analysis of the total data set (170 participants) found that a better quality of life was associated with higher levels of meaning and peace in life, higher levels of social and leisure activities, and lower levels of fatigue.
   Conclusions: Quality of life after a cardiac arrest and after a myocardial infarction without arrest are not different; fatigue, a sense of meaning and peace, and level of extended daily activities are factors related to higher life satisfaction. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - "Heart and kidney transplant from donor with recent veno-arterial extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation"
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
AB  - Objetives ECMO is progressively being adopted as a last resort to stabilize patients receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECMO CPR). A significant number of these patients will present recovery of end-organ function, but evolve with brain death, accounting for only 30% of patients discharged from the hospital alive. Harvesting organs from donors on VA ECMO has recently been proposed as a strategy to expand the pool of available organs for transplantation. Methods We present a case of combined heart and kidney transplantation from a brain death donor with recent out of hospital cardiac arrest rescued with eCPR. Results A 31 year old male patient was admitted to local hospital with diagnosis of drowning after seizure episode. Patient received two rounds of CPR for 8 and 30 minutes respectively, and required emergency insertion of VA ECMO. Patient developed compartment syndrome of right lower extremity (RLE) with CPK = 30,720, prompting discontinuation of ECMO support within 48 hours as cardiac function had recovered, reflected on echocardiographic and enzymatic parameters. Patient was declared brain death and became organ donor. Multiple organ procurement was performed. Combined heart and right kidney transplant was then performed on a 61-year-old male with uneventful course, and with normal function of all implanted allografts at 3 months follow up. Conclusion Our experience supports the concept that VA ECMO is not a contraindication for solid organ donation. Individual evaluation of organ function can lead to successful transplantation of multiple organs from donors with recent history of VA ECMO support.

TI  - ASPHYXIA, CARDIAC-ARREST AND RESUSCITATION IN RATS .2. LONG-TERM BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - A mild insult, sensitive parameter model in contrast to a severe insult, severe damage model of brain resuscitation was investigation. Up to now, the latter approach, which causes neuropathologic changes and neurological abnormalities, has not provided unequivocal data on pharmacological measures to ameliorate post-anoxic brain damage, because of logistical difficulties and many extracranial complicating factors. As tracheotomy and oral intubation in rats proved impractical in studies on recovery from asphyxia transtracheal jet ventilation was tested in 14 rats as a measure for effective prolonged and reversible control of airway and ventilation. Subsequently, in 37 other rats studied, during the 1st postinsult week, the effects of anesthesia, with or without 6 min asphyxia, on behavior, i.e., unrestrained spontaneous locomotor activity and 2 sessions of 1-trail passive avoidance. Transtracheal jet ventilation proved a reliable method for reversible and prolonged controlled ventilation in rats. Spontaneous locomotor activity was affected for at least 48 h after anesthesia and differently so after asphyxia. Passive avoidance was affected only after asphyxia. The recovery of behavior was delayed for days, whereas the recovery of neurologic deficits was only delayed for several post-asphyxia hours. The asphyxiated rats showed hyperexcitability for at least 2 wk. The existence of abnormal behavior during recovery from mild anoxic-ischemic insults to the brain provides parameters for evaluation of therapies of the post-resuscitation disease in a model without the difficulties encountered in models with severe insults, which made post-insult intensive care necessary. The mild insult, sensitive parameter model is promising and further work in this direction is indicated.

TI  - The impact of clinical simulation on bridging the theory-practice gap in nursing education: a systematic review
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundBridging the gap between theoretical instruction and practical competence remains a central challenge in nursing education. Nursing students often struggle to transfer classroom-acquired knowledge into real-world clinical environments, resulting in decreased confidence, impaired decision-making, and compromised patient care. Clinical simulation has emerged as a promising pedagogical tool to address this longstanding theory-practice gap by recreating realistic scenarios in a controlled setting.MethodThis systematic review synthesized studies published from 2010 to 2025 concerning the use of clinical simulation in nursing education. Five databases were searched using defined keywords to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies focused on simulation-based interventions aimed at enhancing nursing students' clinical competence, decision-making, confidence, and knowledge transfer. Data extraction was independently performed by reviewers, and methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2, CASP, and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) checklists. A thematic synthesis approach was employed to analyze both qualitative and quantitative findings.ResultsOf the fifteen included studies, twelve reported significant improvements in nursing students' clinical decision-making, judgment, or self-confidence, involving over 1,100 participants. High-fidelity simulation and structured scenario-based interventions were particularly effective in enhancing core competencies such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), infection control, and diagnostic reasoning. Thematic synthesis categorized findings into six domains: clinical decision-making, clinical judgment, learner self-confidence, empathy development, experiential learning, and learner satisfaction. Reported challenges included limited technological access, inconsistent debriefing, and insufficient faculty training. No adverse outcomes were noted, although potential publication bias and short follow-up durations were identified as limitations.ConclusionSimulation-based education can serve as an effective and scalable strategy to reduce the theory-practice gap in nursing education. Its success depends on sustained implementation, institutional support, and pedagogical integration. Future research should emphasize long-term effectiveness and explore context-specific barriers.

TI  - Saving lives together in sport: A pilot study attempting to increase the number and availability of automated external defibrillators and to initiate voluntary training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation with the use of automated external defibrillators in Norwegian amateur football clubs
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: In Norway, the potential to increase the number of patients connected to an automated external defibrillator (AED) before ambulance arrival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests is substantial. A blended learning approach is effective for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with AED usage, and regular hands-on CPR refresher training is recommended. The objective was to test if provision of CPR-training equipment and learning resources combined with a contract to recruit volunteer CPR trainers could facilitate regular refresher CPR-training in Norwegian football clubs and to increase the number and accessibility of AEDs by providing clubs with AEDs and heated cabinets and mandate registration in the national AED registry. Methods: Non-randomized pilot study (2020-2023). Clubs signed contracts that they would perform CPR training with the use of AEDs for 70% of football players/coaches/staff/volunteers each year and place their received AED outdoors in heated cabinets and register their AED in the Norwegian national AED registry. We explored barriers through follow-up e-mails. Results: We recruited 116 of 278 (42%) eligible football clubs. From 2020 to 2023, 5440 football players and 987 coaches/staff/volunteers from 60 (52%) clubs completed CPR training sessions and 20 (17%) repeated CPR training. We provided 112 AEDs and 116 heated cabinets. By a deadline, 68/116 (59%) of clubs had placed their AED outdoors in the heated cabinet and registered their AED correctly in the national AED registry, 27/116 (23%) placed their AED outdoors but did not complete their registration in the AED registry correctly, 13/116 (11%) kept their AED locked indoors and 8/116 (7%) failed to register their AED. Few clubs (20/116, 17%) provided insights into barriers. Conclusion: We recruited a satisfactory number of football clubs. Over 6000 players/coaches/staff/volunteers completing CRP training shows promise. Most clubs complied to the message of 24/7/365 availability of AEDs and found registration in the national AED registry uncomplicated.

TI  - Vancomycin and cardiac arrest in the infant
T2  - ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE
AB  - Background, - Different adverse effects induced by vancomycin bolus infusion are described, but cardiac arrest seems rare, in children as in adults.
   Case report - Two infants, 5 and 12 months old were admitted after cardiac arrest, following vancomycin bolus infusion in excessive dose. They recovered after prompt resuscitation and their short term follow-up was normal.
   Conclusion. - Two mechanisms are invoked: anaphylactic shock and direct cardiovascular toxicity. Both are dose- and infusion rare-dependent; and probably intersubject dependent. Usually, cardiac arrest is promptly reversed by adequate resuscitation. The rules of prescription are: adequate dilution and slow rate of infusion. If any adverse effect occurred, preventive antihistaminic drug therapy should be advised. (C) 1998, Elsevier, Paris.

   This article is a review of the most recent findings in resuscitation techniques in advanced cardiac life support. The article focuses particularly on the period after July 1, 2003, but relevant new findings before this period are also included.
   Recent findings
   Randomized clinical trial results suggest that the current cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced cardiac life support guidelines may need to be modified. Early defibrillation during the electrical phase of cardiac arrest remains the most crucial intervention, but performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation before defibrillation may be more effective, as compared with immediate defibrillation, during the circulatory phase of cardiac arrest. Biphasic waveforms are superior to monophasic damped sine waveforms in achieving defibrillation. Novel cardiopulmonary resuscitation methods that increase negative intrathoracic pressure promote an increase in blood flow return to the heart. These devices have been correlated with improved short-term survival rates during the circulatory phase of cardiac arrest. Vasopressin administration, given alone or in combination with epinephrine, should be considered during the circulatory phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly in patients presenting with asystole as the initial rhythm. Induction of hypothermia during the metabolic phase in cardiac arrest survivors improves 6-month survival rates and neurologic outcomes.
   Summary
   strategies to improve the low survival outcomes of cardiac arrest victims are available. Clinical trials testing these strategies suggest benefit from certain interventions but are not definitive. These different therapeutic interventions should be performed in a phase-specific-oriented fashion according to the three-phase time-sensitive model of cardiac arrest.

TI  - All else equal: Examining treatment bias and stereotypes based on patient ethnicity and socioeconomic status using in-hospital cardiac arrest clinical vignettes
T2  - HEART & LUNG
AB  - Background: Research on ethnic and socioeconomic treatment differences following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) largely draws on register data. Due to the correlational nature of such data, it cannot be concluded whether detected differences reflect treatment bias/discrimination - whereby otherwise identical patients are treated differently solely due to sociodemographic factors. To be able to establish discrimination, experimental research is needed.
   Objective: The primary aim of this experimental study was to examine whether simulated IHCA patients receive different treatment recommendations based on ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES), holding all other factors (e.g., health status) constant. Another aim was to examine health care professionals' (HCP) stereotypical beliefs about these groups.
   Methods: HCP (N = 235) working in acute care made anonymous treatment recommendations while reading IHCA clinical vignettes wherein the patient's ethnicity (Swedish vs. Middle Eastern) and SES had been manipulated. Afterwards they estimated to what extent hospital staff associate these patient groups with certain traits (stereotypes).
   Results: No significant differences in treatment recommendations for Swedish versus Middle Eastern or high versus low SES patients were found. Reported stereotypes about Middle Eastern patients were uniformly negative. SES-related stereotypes, however, were mixed. High SES patients were believed to be more competent (e.g., respected), but less warm (e.g., friendly) than low SES patients.
   Conclusions: Swedish HCP do not seem to discriminate against patients with Middle Eastern or low SES backgrounds when recommending treatment for simulated IHCA cases, despite the existence of negative stereotypes about these groups. Implications for health care equality and quality are discussed.

TI  - Telephone-based evaluation of cognitive impairment and mood disorders in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic outcomes: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - This study determined the occurrence of cognitive impairment and mood disorders in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors with good neurologic outcomes. We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study with a total of 97 patients. We evaluated cognitive dysfunction via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Alzheimer's disease-8 mood disorders via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We measured quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Levels questionnaire. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders were common among patients with good neurologic recovery. There were 23 patients who experienced cognitive impairments (23.7%) and 28 who suffered from mood disorders (28.9%). Age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12), mood disorders (adjusted OR 22.80, 95% CI 4.84-107.49) and hospital length of stay (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive impairments (adjusted OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.83-35.97) and non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 11.51, 95% CI 3.15-42.15) were risk factors for mood disorders. Quality of life was significantly lower in the OHCA survivors with each disorder than the healthy individuals. Routine screening and intervention are needed for OHCA survivors.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in critically ill survivors: specific impact of cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm
T2  - ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background: Intensive care has a strong impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The specific impact of cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm is poorly known. Patients and methods: We gathered patients included in two randomized controlled trials (AWARE and HYPERION). The HYPERION trial included ICU-treated non-shockable cardiac arrest patients. The AWARE study included ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We compared the 3-months HRQOL of these patients to those of a large sample of the French general population. Physical and mental dimension were compared. Multivariable linear regression was used to pick up factors associated with HRQOL. Results: 72 and 307 patients of the HYPERION and the AWARE studies were compared to 20,574 French controls. ICU patients evidenced lower scores in all the SF-36 dimensions compared to the controls. Similar scores were observed in both HYPERION and AWARe trials. The physical component score was lower in patients from the HYPERION trial compared to those from the AWARE trials and to controls (38.6 [29.6-47.8], 35.4 [27.5-46.4] vs. 53.0 [46.0-56.7], p < 0.001). After adjustment for age and gender, HYPERION and AWARE trial status were associated wit lower physical component score. Conclusion: Health-related quality of life of unshockable cardiac arrest survivors evaluated at 3 months was similar to ICU survivors and significantly lower than in individuals from general population, especially in the physical dimensions.

TI  - Ethics of Resuscitation at Different Stages of Life: A Survey of Perinatal Physicians
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We surveyed US neonatologists and high-risk obstetricians about preferences for resuscitation in ethically difficult situations to determine whether (1) their responses adhered to traditional ethical principles of best interests and patient autonomy and (2) physician specialty seemed to influence the response.
   METHODS: In an electronic survey, we presented 8 vignettes with varying prognoses for survival and long-term outcome. Respondents were provided outcome data for mortality and morbidity in each vignette. We asked whether resuscitation was in the patient's best interest and whether the physician would accede to requests for nonresuscitation.
   RESULTS: We analyzed surveys for 587 neonatologists and 108 high-risk obstetricians (15% overall response rate, 75% of web site visitors). There were no statistically significant differences in responses between the 2 physician subspecialty groups. As expected, in most cases there were inverse relationships between valuation of best interest and deferred resuscitation at the family's request. For example, for the oldest patient (an 80-year-old), 9.9% found resuscitation to be in the patient's best interest and 94.3% would allow nonresuscitation; for a 2-month-old, 93.9% found resuscitation to be in the patient's best interest and 24.5% would allow nonresuscitation. However, this pattern was not observed in the 2 newborn cases, in which resuscitation and nonresuscitation were both acceptable. In the triage scenario, the 7-year-old with cerebral palsy and acute trauma was consistently resuscitated first despite others having equivalent or better short-and long-term prognoses.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our results, physicians' decisions to resuscitate seem to be context-specific, rather than based on prognosis or consistent application of best-interest or autonomy principles. Despite their different professional perspectives, neonatologists and high-risk obstetricians seemed to converge on these judgments. Pediatrics 2011;127:e1221-e1229

TI  - In-hospital major arrhythmias, arrhythmic death and resuscitation after successful primary percutaneous intervention for acute transmural infarction: a retrospective single-centre cohort study
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Transmural acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with a high risk for ventricular arrhythmia before, during and after treatment. Consequently, it is recommended that patients diagnosed with transmural AMI be monitored in a cardiac care unit (CCU) so life-threatening arrhythmias can be treated promptly. We examined the incidence and timing of in-hospital malignant ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac or arrhythmic death (SCD/AD) and resuscitation requirements in patients with transmural AMI recovering from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) undertaken within 12 h of symptom onset and without antecedent thrombolysis.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using the Duisburg Heart Center (Germany) cardiac patient registry. In total, 975 patients met the inclusion criteria. The composite endpoint was post-PCI ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, SCD/AD or requirement for resuscitation. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who met the composite endpoint with those who did not, recorded the timing of endpoint episodes, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with the endpoint criteria.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the length of CCU or hospital stay between the groups. In-hospital mortality was 6.5%, and the composite endpoint was met in 7.4% of cases. Malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurred in 2.8% of the patients, and SCD/AD occurred in 0.3% of the cases. There was a biphasic temporal distribution of endpoint events; specifically, 76.7% occurred < 96 h after symptom onset, and 12.6% occurred 240-360 h after symptom onset. Multivariable regression analysis identified positive associations between an endpoint episode and the following: age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.01-1.05] per year); left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% (OR 3.66, 95% Cl 1.91-6.99); peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration (OR 1.01, 95% Cl 1.00-1.02 per 100 U/dl); leucocytosis (OR 1.86, 95% Cl 1.04-3.32), and coronary thrombus (OR 1.85, 95% Cl 1.04-3.27).
   Conclusions: Most post-PCI malignant ventricular arrhythmias, SCD/AD and resuscitation episodes occurred within 96 h of transmural AMI (76.7%). A substantial minority (12.6%) of these events arose 240-360 h after symptom onset. Further study is needed to establish the influence of age, LVEF < 30%, peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration, leucocytosis and coronary thrombus on post-PCI outcomes after transmural AMI.

TI  - Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Young 26 Years Old Patient: A Rare Sequelae of Blunt Chest Trauma
T2  - CLINICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an important subset of cardiovascular disease, and a medical emergency, where timely reperfusion is needed to reduce short-term and long-term complications from it. AMI following blunt chest trauma is a rare but serious complication of motor vehicle accidents and should be treated promptly. We are presenting a case of 26 years-old male, who presented to ED after a motor vehicle accident, went into cardiac arrest, and was found ST elevated MI (STEMI) on electrocardiography. Subsequently, cardiac catheterization revealed ruptured plaque in the proximal left anterior descending artery, with thrombus extending to mid-LAD, requiring a stent placement.

TI  - Evaluating measurement quality and feasibility of neurocognitive screening instruments for adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To systematically review and appraise the measurement properties, interpretability, and feasibility of outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) for screening neurocognitive function among adult survivors of out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: Online databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsychINFO) from inception-August 23, 2024. Included articles evaluated measurement properties, interpretability (assigning meaning to scores), and/or feasibility (ease of application) of multidomain instruments for screening neurocognitive function among OHCA survivors. Evidence was reviewed according to the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines: Risk of Bias determined study quality; COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties was applied; data were pooled where possible, finally, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria rated the certainty of evidence. Results: Of 2336 titles and abstracts, 27 articles provided evidence for 13 instruments (MoCA, T-MoCA, Mini MoCA, MMSE, MMSE-ALFI, 3MS, TICS, TICS-m, WASI, IQCODE, IQCODE-CA, SF-16 IQCODE-CA, and CFQ). Only three reported measurement properties for two OMIs: the MoCA and the IQCODE-CA. The MoCA demonstrated high quality evidence of criterion validity across two studies (pooled AUC: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.93). There were inconsistent results for the IQCODE-CA. There was limited evidence of score interpretability and feasibility across all 13 OMIs. Conclusions: Insufficient evidence of essential measurement properties limits instrument choice. Whilst the MoCA had acceptable criterion validity, evidence of content validity was inadequate, and reliability and responsiveness lacking. Establishing robust evidence to inform screening of neurocognitive function in this population should be prioritized.

TI  - Long range correlations in the heart rate variability following the injury of cardiac arrest
T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - Cardiovascular and neurological recovery following cardiac arrest (CA) largely influence the morbidity and mortality of the patients. Monitoring the cardiovascular system has been an important clinical issue in intensive care unit (ICU). On the other hand, the rhythms of the heart rate variability following CA are still not fully understood, and there are limited number of literatures reporting the cardiovascular function recovery following CA. In this paper, we studied the scaling properties of heart rate variability (HRV) after CA by centered-moving-average-based detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Our results showed that the scaling factor of the baseline HRV is close to that of Brownian motion, and after a CA event it shifts to a 1/f noise-like rhythm. DFA could be a promising tool in evaluating the cardiovascular long term recovery following CA injury. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Better Nurse Staffing and Nurse Work Environments Associated With Increased Survival of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
AB  - Background:Although nurses are the most likely first responders to witness an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and provide treatment, little research has been undertaken to determine what features of nursing are related to cardiac arrest outcomes.
   Objectives:To determine the association between nurse staffing, nurse work environments, and IHCA survival.
   Research Design:Cross-sectional study of data from: (1) the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database; (2) the University of Pennsylvania Multi-State Nursing Care and and Patient Safety; and (3) the American Hospital Association annual survey. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association of the features of nursing and IHCA survival to discharge after adjusting for hospital and patient characteristics.
   Subjects:A total of 11,160 adult patients aged 18 and older between 2005 and 2007 in 75 hospitals in 4 states (Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and New Jersey).
   Results:Each additional patient per nurse on medical-surgical units was associated with a 5% lower likelihood of surviving IHCA to discharge (odds ratio=0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.99). Further, patients cared for in hospitals with poor work environments had a 16% lower likelihood of IHCA survival (odds ratio=0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.99) than patients cared for in hospitals with better work environments.
   Conclusions:Better work environments and decreased patient-to-nurse ratios on medical-surgical units are associated with higher odds of patient survival after an IHCA. These results add to a large body of literature suggesting that outcomes are better when nurses have a more reasonable workload and work in good hospital work environments. Improving nurse working conditions holds promise for improving survival following IHCA.

TI  - Comparison of the Cerebral Performance Category Score and the Health Utilities Index for Survivors of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: The Cerebral Performance Category score is an easy to use but unvalidated measure of functional outcome after cardiac arrest. We evaluate the comparability of results from the Cerebral Performance Category scale versus those of the validated but more complex Health Utilities Index scale for health-related quality of life.
   Methods: This prospective substudy of the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) Study included adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated in 20 cities. This prospective cohort study included all survivors of out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest enrolled in phase 11 (rapid basic life support with defibrillation) and phase III (advanced life support) of the OPALS Study, as well as the intervening run-in phase. Survivors were interviewed at 12 months for Cerebral Performance Category Score and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (Health Utilities Index).
   Results: Of 8,196 eligible out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 1995 and 2002, 418 (5.1%) survived to discharge, and 305 (3.7%) completed the Health Utilities Index interview and had Cerebral Performance Category scored at 12 months. The 305 patients had the following data: mean age 63.9 years; male 78.0%; paramedic-witnessed arrest 25.6%; bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation 32.1%; initial rhythm ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia 86.9%, Cerebral Performance Category 1267, Cerebral Performance Category 2 26, Cerebral Performance Category 3 12. Overall, the median scores (interquartile range) were Cerebral Performance Category 1 (1 to 1) and Health Utilities Index 0.84 (0.61 to 0.97). The Cerebral Performance Category score ruled out good quality of life (Health Utilities Index >0.80), with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98% to 100%) and specificity 27.1% (95% CI 20% to 35%); thus, when the Cerebral Performance Category score was 2 or 3, it was unlikely that the Health Utilities Index score would be good. The Cerebral Performance Category score had sensitivity 55.6% (95% Cl 42% to 67%) and specificity 96.8% (95% CI 94% to 98%) for predicting poor quality of life (Health Utilities Index >0.40); ie, when Cerebral Performance Category was 1, it was highly unlikely that the Health Utilities Index score would be poor. The weighted K was 0.39 and the interclass correlation was 0.51.
   Conclusion: This represents the largest study yet conducted of the performance of the Cerebral Performance Category score in 1-year survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Overall, the Cerebral Performance Category score classified patients well for their quality of life, ruling out a good Health Utilities Index score with high sensitivity and ruling in poor Health Utilities Index score with high specificity. The Cerebral Performance Category is an important tool in that it indicates broad functional outcome categories that are useful for a number of key clinical and research applications but should not be considered a substitute for the Health Utilities Index.

TI  - The Roles of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Shen-Fu Injection on the Postresuscitation Care Bundle
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Survival rates following in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests remain disappointingly low. Organ injury caused by ischemia and hypoxia during prolonged cardiac arrest is compounded by reperfusion injury that occurs when a spontaneous circulation is restored. A bundle of procedures, which may need to be administered simultaneously, is required. The procedures include prompt identification and treatment of the cause of cardiac arrest, as well as a definitive airway and ventilation together. Additional benefit is possible with appropriate forms of early goal-directed therapy and achieving therapeutic hypothermia within the first few hours, followed by gradual rewarming and ensuring glycaemic control to be within a range of 6 to 10mmol/L. All these would be important and need to be continued for at least 24 hours. Previous studies have showed that the effects of Shen-Fu injection (SFI) are based on aconitine properties, supplemented by ginsenoside, which can scavenge free radicals, improve energy metabolism, inhibit inflammatory mediators, suppress cell apoptosis, and alleviate mitochondrial damage. SFI, like many other complex prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine, was also found to be more effective than any of its ingredient used separately in vivo. As the postresuscitation care bundle is known to be, the present paper focuses on the role of SFI played on the postresuscitation care bundle.

TI  - Identification of Human T-Cell Responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Resuscitation-Promoting Factors in Long-Term Latently Infected Individuals
T2  - CLINICAL AND VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - The Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine is the only tuberculosis (TB) vaccine available, yet it provides limited protection against pulmonary TB in adults and fails to protect against TB reactivation. We hypothesized that immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis "resuscitation-promoting factors" (Rpfs), which are small bacterial proteins that promote proliferation of dormant mycobacteria, may be relevant in the human immune response to M. tuberculosis. In previous unpublished work, we found that Rpfs Rv0867c and Rv2389c induced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in the blood of TB patients' healthy household contacts in several different African populations. Here we examine these two dominant Rpf antigens in more detail and define the nature of the responding T-cell subsets. Multiparameter cytokine profiling showed that Rv2389c and, to a lesser extent, Rv0867c were recognized by mycobacterium-responsive healthy Dutch individuals; peptide-scanning revealed several epitopes, including a single immunodominant epitope in Rv2389c. Rv0867c and, to a lesser extent, Rv2389c Rpf-specific T-cell responses were maintained for decades in long-term M. tuberculosis nonprogressors. Prominent Rv0867c-specific double-and single-cytokine-producing CD8(+) T-cell subset responses were found, including a large population of CD8(+) effector memory and effector T-cell subsets. We conclude that M. tuberculosis Rpf antigens are important targets in the human immune response to M. tuberculosis and represent interesting TB vaccine candidate antigens.

   Setting: Population-based study in homes and chronic care facilities in four states, and Home Ventilator Program of California Kaiser Permanente.
   Patients: Seventy-five ALS patients receiving LTMV were identified; 11 died prior to interview, and 6 were totally locked in; 50 of 58 (86%) who were able to communicate consented to structured interviews, of whom 36 lived at home and 14 in an institution.
   Results: Thirty-eight patients (76%) had completed advance directives, and 96% wanted them, Thirty-eight patients wished to stop LTMV in certain circumstances, of whom 30 had completed advance directives, Those who had completed advance directives were more likely to have communicated their preference to stop LTMV to family and physician than those who had not (76 vs 29%; p=0.05), Patients living at home rated their quality of life on a 10-point scale better than those in an institution (7.2 vs 5.6; p=0.0052), and their yearly expenses were less ($136,560 vs $366,852; p=0.0018).
   Conclusions: Most ALS patients receiving LTMV would want to stop it under certain circumstances, and the process of advance care planning enhances communication of patient preferences to family and physicians, Home-based LTMV is less costly and associated with greater patient satisfaction.

TI  - Return-to-work and rehabilitation needs in cardiac arrest survivors: an exploratory cross-sectional study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
AB  - Patient-reported return-to-work and job functioning 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge and received rehabilitation interventions and unmet rehabilitation needs were explored in a consecutive population of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors. Patients working prior to cardiac arrest were invited to participate in a telephone administered survey. Thirty-eight surveys were conducted and included for analysis, equivalent to a minimum response rate of 95%. Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest had extensive challenges returning to work. Six- and 12-months post-arrest, 58% and 45% were respectively on full time sick leave or working notably less (>10 h/week) and with extensive unmet rehabilitation needs.

TI  - DRONES FOR AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR DELIVERY: WHERE DO WE STAND?
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an important cause of mortality and disability worldwide. The health care community hoped that, with the development of the automated external defibrillator (AED), the mortality and functional outcomes of patients with OHCAs would improve. Despite their effectiveness, their use in OHCA has not yet become common practice. Unfortunately, in 18-59% of cases, public access AEDs were deemed to be in poorly accessible areas or not available all of the time. Objective: We present the existing literature on the implementation of drone delivery of AEDs to improve the response time of the emergency medical services. Discussion: Test flights and mathematical/geographic models have been used to assess the effectiveness of drones in delivering AEDs to patients with OHCA. The results of those studies showed promising outcomes given that drone usage led to improved delivery times of AEDs compared with emergency medical services delivery. Conclusions: While drones have the potential to dramatically improve cardiac arrest patient care, further studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness in real-life clinical scenarios.

TI  - Post-resuscitation management of asphyxiated neonates
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Inspite of major advances in monitoring technology and knowledge of fetal and perinatal medicine, perinatal asphyxia is one of the significant causes of mortality and long term morbidity. Data from National Neonatal Perinatal Database suggests that perinatal asphyxia contributes to almost 20% of neonatal deaths in India. "Failure to initiate or sustain respiration after birth" has been defined as criteria for the diagnosis of asphyxia by WHO. Perinatal asphyxia results in hypoxic injury to various organs including kidneys, lungs and liver but the most serious effects are seen on the central nervous system. Levene's classification is a useful clinical tool for grading the severity of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Good supportive care is essential in the first 48 hours after asphyxia to prevent ongoing brain injury in the penumbra region. Strict monitoring and prompt correction is needed for common problems including temperature maintenance, blood sugars, blood pressure and oxygenation. Phenobarbitone is the drug of choice for the treatment of convulsions.

TI  - Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation(ECPR) - the Future?
T2  - ANASTHESIOLOGIE INTENSIVMEDIZIN NOTFALLMEDIZIN SCHMERZTHERAPIE
AB  - In recent years, invasive resuscitation methods utilizing veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) have gained significant attention. Despite advances in traditional resuscitation measures, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) mortality remains high. In the context of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), VA-ECMO therapy offers a promising approach by providing circulatory support during cardiac arrest, allowing time for diagnostic evaluation and targeted therapy. However, patient selection for ECPR remains a challenge, relying on various factors including initial rhythm, duration of no-flow and low-flow states, as well as presence of reversible causes. Recent studies such as the ARREST, Prague OHCA and INCEPTION trials have investigated the efficacy of ECPR in OHCA patients, yielding mixed results. While the ARREST trial demonstrated a survival benefit with ECPR, the Prague OHCA and INCEPTION trials showed varying outcomes, reflecting the complexity of patient selection and treatment strategies. Despite inherent risks and complications associated with ECPR, it may offer a potential survival advantage under optimal conditions. Future directions in ECPR involve the development of innovative treatment protocols such as the CARL therapy, which incorporates specialized ECMO systems and tailored perfusion solutions. Early studies indicate promising outcomes with CARL therapy, emphasizing the importance of a well-coordinated and structured approach to ECPR implementation. In summary, ECPR shows promise in improving survival rates for OHCA patients within a well-organized healthcare system. However, further research is needed to refine patient selection criteria and optimize treatment protocols, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in cardiac arrest scenarios.

TI  - Electrical storm in patients with an implanted defibrillator: A matter of definition
T2  - ANNALS OF NONINVASIVE ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - The term "electrical storm" (ES) indicates a state of cardiac electrical instability manifested by several episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) within a short time. In patients with an im-plantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), ES is best defined as 3 appropriate VT detections in 24 h, treated by antitachycardia pacing, shock or eventually untreated but sustained in a VT monitoring zone. The number of shocks and inappropriate detections are irrelevant for the definition. ES occurs in approximately 25% of ICD patients within 3 years, with typically 5-55 individual VTs within one storm. Potential triggers can be found in approximately 66% of patients and include new/worsened heart failure, changes in antiarrhythmic medication, context with other illness, psychological stress, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. In most patients, ES consists of monomorphic VT indicating the presence of reentry while ventricular fibrillation indicating acute ischemia is rare. ES seems to have a low immediate mortality (1%) but frequently (50-80%) leads to hospitalization. Long-term prognostic implications of ES are unclear. The key intervention in ES is reduction of the elevated sympathetic tone by beta blockers and frequently benzodiazepines. Anniodarone i.v. has also been successful and azimilide seems promising while class I antiarrhythmic drugs are usually unsuccessful. Substrate mapping and VT ablation may be useful in treatment and prevention of ES. Prevention of ES requires ICD programming systematically avoiding unnecessary shocks (long VT detection, antitachycardia pacing where ever possible) which otherwise can fuel the sympathetic tone and prolong ES.

TI  - SUDDEN CARDIAC-ARREST IN ISRAEL - FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCCESSFUL RESUSCITATION
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were studied in Israel from 1984 to 1985. More than 3,500 patients in cardiac arrest received paramedic care. Eightly-three percent of cases were caused by underlying heart disease. Overall, 17% of patients with arrest caused by heart disease were admitted and 7% were discharged from the hospital. There was a wide variation in the percent discharged among the 15 paramedic service areas, ranging from 0% to 13%. Factors associated with successful resuscitation included witnessed collapse, rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, short interval from collapse to cardipulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and delivery of advanced cardiac life support, collapse at public location, and bystander initiation of CPR. Improvements in survival are likely to result if CPR is more frequently and promptly initiated and the time to arrival of definitive paramedic care can be improved.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of a hybrid emergency room system for severe trauma: a health technology assessment from the perspective of the third-party payer in Japan
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Background: Hybrid emergency room (ER) systems, consisting of an angiography-computed tomography (CT) machine in a trauma resuscitation room, are reported to be effective for reducing death from exsanguination in trauma patients. We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid ER system in severe trauma patients without severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   Methods: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing the hybrid ER system to the conventional ER system from the perspective of the third-party healthcare payer in Japan. A short-term decision tree and a long-term Markov model using a lifetime time horizon were constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and associated lifetime healthcare costs. Short-term mortality and healthcare costs were derived from medical records and claims data in a tertiary care hospital with a hybrid ER. Long-term mortality and utilities were extrapolated from the literature. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $47,619 per QALY gained and the discount rate was 2%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
   Results: The hybrid ER system was associated with a gain of 1.03 QALYs and an increment of $33,591 lifetime costs compared to the conventional ER system, resulting in an ICER of $32,522 per QALY gained. The ICER was lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold if the odds ratio of 28-day mortality was < 0.66. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the hybrid ER system was cost-effective with a 79.3% probability.
   Conclusion: The present study suggested that the hybrid ER system is a likely cost-effective strategy for treating severe trauma patients without severe TBI.

TI  - Physical function, psychological adjustment, and self-efficacy following sudden cardiac arrest and an initial implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in a social cognitive theory intervention: secondary analysis of a randomized control trial
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) survivorship results in unique issues in return to physical and psychological function. The purpose of the study was to compare recovery across the first year between SCA survivors and other arrhythmia patients who received a first-time implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention, participating in a social cognitive theory (SCT) intervention. Methods 168 (129 males, 39 females) who received an ICD for secondary prevention (SCA N = 65; other arrhythmia N = 103) were randomized to one of two study conditions: SCT intervention (N = 85) or usual care (N = 83). Outcomes were measured at baseline hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, & 12 months: (1) Physical Function: Patient Concerns Assessment (PCA), SF-36 (PCS); (2) Psychological Adjustment: State Trait Anxiety (STAI), CES-D depression, SF-36 (MCS); (3) Self-Efficacy: Self-Efficacy (SCA-SE), Self-management Behaviors (SMB), Outcome Expectations (OE). Outcomes were compared over 12 months for intervention condition x ICD indication using general estimating equations. Results Participants were Caucasian (89%), mean age 63.95 +/- 12.3 years, EF% 33.95 +/- 13.9, BMI 28.19 +/- 6.2, and Charlson Index 4.27 +/- 2.3. Physical symptoms (PCA) were higher over time for SCA survivors compared to the other arrhythmia group (p = 0.04), ICD shocks were lower in SCA survivors in the SCT intervention (p = 0.01); psychological adjustment (MCS) was significantly lower in SCA survivors in the SCT intervention over 6 months, which improved at 12 months (p = 0.05); outcome expectations (OE) were significantly lower for SCA survivors in the SCT intervention (p = 0.008). Conclusions SCA survivors had greater number of physical symptoms, lower levels of mental health and outcome expectations over 12 months despite participation in a SCT intervention.

TI  - Local DEA app: Saving lives with accessible and well-located automated external defibrillators
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Purpose Developing technological solutions to reduce care delay and mortality in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases is a challenge both in Brazil and worldwide. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a geolocation application for locating automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in the urban area of a medium-sized city in southern Brazil. Methods A mobile application was developed to locate AEDs in public places, indicating the best route to the nearest AED with an intuitive design for emergency use. The app provides information on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial care, and AED use. The research steps included a literature review on the double diamond design process, prototyping, expert validation, and simulation tests. Results The Local DEA app, developed for Android and iOS, offers features such as route calculation to the nearest AED and emergency services. In an evaluation conducted by 30 experts, the app was well accepted for its ease of use and efficiency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92). Simulation tests demonstrated that the strategic installation of accessible and well-located AEDs improves coverage and significantly reduces travel time to emergency care as compared with ambulance travel times (p < 0.001). Conclusion The Local DEA app is a promising tool for reducing mortality in OHCA, enabling AED geolocation, use instructions, and CPR guidelines. When combined with the strategic placement of public-access AEDs, the application can increase the likelihood of survival in OHCA cases.

TI  - Functional Outcomes in Survivors of Pediatric Sepsis: A Scoping Review and Discussion of Implications for Low- and Middle-Income Countries
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - BackgroundPediatric sepsis is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where there is a huge burden of infectious diseases. Despite shortage of resources, adapting protocol-based care has reduced sepsis-related deaths but survivors of pediatric sepsis are at risk of poor functional outcomes. ObjectivesTo perform a scoping review of the literature on functional outcomes of pediatric sepsis survivors after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) and discuss the implications for patients in LMICs. The outcomes include prevalence of survival with reduced functional outcomes or quality of life (QoL) and changes over time during follow-up or recovery, and these outcomes were compared with other groups of children. MethodsWe searched major medical electronic databases for relevant literature from January 2005 until November 2021, including Medline (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases. We included observational studies and follow-up data from clinical trials involving children/adolescents (<= 18 years) who were admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and got discharged finally. Major focus was on survivors of sepsis in LMIC. We followed PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISM-ScR). ResultsWe included eight papers reporting data of functional outcomes in 2,915 children (males = 53%, and comorbidity present in 56.6%). All included studies were either a prospective or retrospective cohort study. Studies were classified as Level II evidence. Disabilities affecting physical, cognitive, psychological, and social function were reported in children following discharge. Overall disability reported ranged between 23 and 50% at hospital discharge or 28 days. Residual disability was reported at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up with an overall improving trend. Failure to recover from a baseline HRQL on follow-up was seen in one-third of survivors. Organ dysfunction scores such as pSOFA, PeLOD, vasoactive inotrope score, neurological events, immunocompromised status, need for CPR, and ECMO were associated with poor functional outcome. ConclusionsThe research on functional outcomes in pediatric sepsis survivors is scarce in LMIC. Measuring baseline and follow-up functional status, low-cost interventions to improve management of sepsis, and multidisciplinary teams to identify and treat disabilities may improve functional outcomes.

TI  - Discrepancies between Retrospective Review of "Real-Time" Electronic Health Record Documentation and Prospective Observer Documentation of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Quality Metrics in an Academic Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Every year, approximately 200,000 patients will experience in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in the United States. Survival has been shown to be greatest with the prompt initiation of CPR and early interventions, leading to the development of time-based quality measures. It is uncertain how documentation practices affect reports of compliance with time-based quality measures in IHCA. Methods: A retrospective review of all cases of IHCA that occurred in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) at an academic quaternary hospital was conducted. For each case, a member of the code team (observer) documented performance measures as part of a prospective cardiac arrest quality improvement database. We compared those data to those abstracted in the retrospective review of "real-time" documentation in a Resuscitation Narrator module within electronic health records (EHRs) to investigate for discrepancies. Results: We identified 52 cases of IHCA, all of which were witnessed events. In total, 47 (90%) cases were reviewed by observers as receiving epinephrine within 5 min, but only 42 (81%) were documented as such in the EHR review (p = 0.04), meaning that the interrater agreement for this metric was low (Kappa = 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.36). Four (27%) eligible patients were reported as having defibrillation within 2 min by observers, compared to five (33%) reported by the EHR review (p = 0.90), and with substantial agreement (Kappa = 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.79). There was almost perfect agreement (Kappa = 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88) for the initial rhythm of cardiac arrest (25% shockable rhythm by observers vs. 29% for EHR review, p = 0.31). Conclusion: There was a discrepancy between prospective observers' documentation of meeting quality standards and that of the retrospective review of "real-time" EHR documentation. A further study is required to understand the cause of discrepancy and its consequences.

TI  - Can nifekalant hydrochloride be used as a first-line drug for cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA)? Comparative study of out-of-hospital CPA with acidosis and in-hospital CPA without acidosis
T2  - CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background Early defibrillation of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF) is an urgent and most important method of resuscitation for survival in cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). We have previously reported that nifekalant (NIF), a specific IKr blocker developed in Japan, is effective for lidocaine (LID) resistant VT/VF in out-of-hospital CPA (OHCPA). However, little is known about the differences in the effect of NIF on OHCPA with acidosis and in-hospital CPA (IHCPA) without acidosis.
   Methods and Results The present study enrolled 91 cases of DC shock resistant VT/VF among 892 cases of CPA that occurred between June 2000 and May 2003. NIF was used (0.15-0.3 mg/kg) after LID according to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) algorithm of Tokai University. The defibrillation rate was higher in the NIF group for both OHCPA and IHCPA than for LID alone, and the VT/VF rate reduction effect could be maintained even with acidosis. However, sinus bradycardia in OHCPA, and torsades de pointes in IHCPA were occasionally observed. These differences in adverse effects might be related to the amount of epinephrine, serum potassium levels, serum pH, and interaction with LID.
   Conclusions NIF had a favorable defibrillating effect in both CPA groups, and it shows promise of becoming a first-line drug for CPR.

TI  - Hydrocortisone improves post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting the NF-KB pathway
T2  - BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB  - Myocardial dysfunction is a major cause of early mortality after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following cardiac arrest (CA). Following the return of spontaneous circulation, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury can activate the NF-kappa B pathway, leading to the transcription of inflammatory genes that impair myocardial function. While clinical studies show hydrocortisone (HC) improves outcomes in CA patients during CPR, its specific role in modulating the NF-kappa B pathway is unclear. In this study, we established an in vitro model by inducing hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in H9C2 cardiomyocytes using Na2S2O4, followed by HC treatment. The results showed that HC treatment of H/R-injured cardiomyocytes promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and suppressed the NF-kappa B pathway, thereby reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. Moreover, inhibition of the NF-kappa B pathway enhanced the proliferative capacity of H/R cardiomyocytes, decreased apoptosis rates, and reduced IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha expression levels, with these effects being further amplified by HC treatment. These findings were further supported by in vivo experiments. In conclusion, our study suggests that HC may promote H/R cardiomyocyte proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and alleviate inflammatory responses by suppressing the NF-kappa B pathway, providing new evidence to support its potential clinical application in CA management.

TI  - Ratio of PICU Versus Ward Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Events Is Increasing
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative frequency of pediatric in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation events occurring in ICUs compared to general wards. We hypothesized that the proportion of pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation provided in ICUs versus general wards has increased over the past decade, and this shift is associated with improved resuscitation outcomes.
   Design: Prospective and observational study.
   Setting: Total of 315 hospitals in the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database.
   Patients: Total of 5,870 pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation events between January 1, 2000 and September 14, 2010. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation events were defined as external chest compressions longer than 1 minute.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was proportion of total ICU versus general ward cardiopulmonary resuscitation events over time evaluated by chi-square test for trend. Secondary outcome included return of spontaneous circulation following the cardiopulmonary resuscitation event. Among 5,870 pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation events, 5,477 (93.3%) occurred in ICUs compared to 393 (6.7%) in inpatient wards. Over time, significantly more of these cardiopulmonary resuscitation events occurred in the ICU compared to the wards (test for trend: p < 0.01), with a prominent shift noted between 2003 and 2004 (2000-2003: 87-91% vs 2004-2010: 94-96%). In a multivariable model controlling for within center variability and other potential confounders, return of spontaneous circulation increased in 2004-2010 compared with 2000-2003 (relative risk, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13).
   Conclusions: In-hospital pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation is much more commonly provided in ICUs than in wards, and the proportion has increased significantly over the past decade, with concomitant increases in return of spontaneous circulation.

TI  - Use of a load distributing band device (with ventilation prompts) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Over-ventilation can compromise coronary perfusion pressures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and should be minimised. We compared ventilations during manual and mechanical (load-distributing band - LDB) CPR, which gives ventilation prompts. Our primary objective was to compare the ventilation rate between manual CPR and LDB-CPR. Method: This was a phased, non-randomised study at a tertiary hospital emergency department. All out-of-hospital, non-traumatic cardiac arrest adult patients during the study period from February 2007 till July 2008 were eligible. Pregnant females and patients aged less than 18 years of age were excluded. Ventilation rates in the first and second 5 minutes segments were recorded. Over-ventilation was defined as ventilation rate above 12 breaths per minute. All data analyses were performed with SPSS, version 17.0. Mean differences with 95% confidence interval (CI) were compared between the 2 treatment groups. Results: From February 2007 till August 2007, there were 29 patients with manual CPR; and from September 2007 till July 2008, there were 62 with LDB-CPR. In the first 5 minutes of CPR, the proportion of patients that were over-ventilated, was 27.6% (manual) and 4.8% (LDB) (difference = 22.7%; 95% CI: 3.5-46.4%). In the next 5 minutes, the proportion of patients that were over-ventilated was 37.9% and 1.6% for manual and mechanical CPR respectively (difference = 36.3%; 95% CI: 16.5-58.9%). Conclusion: Over-ventilation is reduced significantly in LDB-CPR compared to manual CPR during the first and second 5 minutes of resuscitation.

TI  - Higher Survival With the Use of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Compared With Conventional Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Children Following Cardiac Surgery: Results of an Analysis of the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Registry
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is increasingly used in children suffering cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery. However, its efficacy in promoting survival has not been evaluated. We compared survival of pediatric cardiac surgery patients suffering in-hospital cardiac arrest who were resuscitated with extracorporeal CPR (E-CPR) to those resuscitated with conventional CPR (C-CPR) using propensity matching. DESIGN: Retrospective study using multicenter data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry (2008-2020). SETTING: Multicenter cardiac arrest database containing cardiac arrest and CPR data from U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: Cardiac surgical patients younger than 18 years old who suffered in-hospital cardiac arrest and received greater than or equal to 10 minutes of CPR. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1223 patients, 741 (60.6%) received C-CPR and 482 (39.4%) received E-CPR. E-CPR utilization increased over the study period (p < 0.001). Duration of CPR was longer in E-CPR compared with C-CPR recipients (42 vs. 26 min; p < 0.001). In a propensity score matched cohort (382 E-CPR recipients, 382 C-CPR recipients), E-CPR recipients had survival to discharge (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% CI, 1.7-2.9; p < 0.001). E-CPR survival was only higher when CPR duration was greater than 18 minutes. Propensity matched analysis using patients from institutions contributing at least one E-CPR case (n = 35 centers; 353 E-CPR recipients, 353 C-CPR recipients) similarly demonstrated improved survival in E-CPR recipients compared with those who received C-CPR alone (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.6-2.8; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: E-CPR compared with C-CPR improved survival in children suffering cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery requiring CPR greater than or equal to 10 minutes.

TI  - Predictors of immediate survival in Emergency Department cardiac arrest in Ethiopia: Insights from a resource-limited setting
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Emergency Departments (EDs) remains a leading cause of mortality, particularly in low-resource countries. This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics and predictors of immediate survival among ED cardiac arrest patients in Ethiopian hospitals. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 215 adult patients who experienced IHCA in the EDs of Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College and Addis Ababa Burn, Emergency, and Trauma Hospital between January 2022 and December 2023. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of immediate survival, defined as returns of spontaneous circulation sustained for at least one hour. Results: Among 215 patients, the mean age was 50.7 years, and 58.6 % were male. The overall immediate survival rate was 46.5 % (n = 100). Independent predictors of survival included male sex (AOR 2.20; 95 % CI 1.06-2.89), respiratory failure as the cause of arrest (AOR 15.04; 95 % CI 2.34-95.13), continuous cardiac monitoring (AOR 4.94; 95 % CI 1.59-15.39), and initial shockable rhythms-ventricular fibrillation (AOR 37.93; 95 % CI 2.20-655.58) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (AOR 25.64; 95 % CI 5.08-129.47). Admission for sepsis was associated with lower survival (AOR 0.05; 95 % CI 0.01-0.68). Conclusion: Nearly half of patients with ED cardiac arrest in Ethiopia achieved immediate survival. Continuous monitoring, rapid recognition of shockable rhythms, and prompt management of reversible causes such as respiratory failure improve outcomes, while sepsis remains a predictor of poor survival. Strengthening ED monitoring and resuscitation capacity could improve cardiac arrest outcomes in similar African settings.

TI  - Thiamine as a metabolic resuscitator after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Thiamine is a key cofactor for aerobic metabolism, previously shown to improve mortality and neurological outcomes in a mouse model of cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that thiamine would decrease lactate and improve outcomes in post-arrest patients. Methods; Single center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase II trial of thiamine in adults within 4.5 hours of return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), with coma and lactate >= 3 mmol/L. Participants received 500 mg IV thiamine or placebo twice daily for 2 days. Randomization was stratified by lactate > 5 or <= 5 mmol/L. The primary outcome of lactate was checked at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 hours, and compared using a linear mixed model to account for repeated measures. Secondary outcomes included SOFA score, pyruvate dehydrogenase, renal injury, neurological outcome, and mortality. Results: Of 93 randomized patients, 76 were enrolled and included in the analysis. There was no difference in lactate over 24 hours (mean difference 0.34 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.82, 2.50), p = 0.43). There was a significant interaction between randomization lactate subgroup and the effect of the intervention on mortality (p = 0.01) such that mortality was higher with thiamine in the lactate > 5 mmol/L group and lower with thiamine in the < 5 mmol/L group. This subgroup difference prompted the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend the study be terminated early. PDH activity increased over 72 hours in the thiamine group. There were no differences in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion: In this single-center randomized trial, thiamine did not affect lactate over 24 hours after OHCA.

TI  - Delivering high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation in-hospital
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   This review discusses recent data relating to delivering high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Recent findings
   Delivering high-quality CPR requires interventions at a national, local, team and individual rescuer level. These include measuring patient outcomes, patient safety incident reporting, education, an increased emphasis on human factors, briefing and debriefing of resuscitation teams, and the use of sensing devices that provide real-time prompts or feedback to rescuers during CPR. Data from national registries, patient safety incident reports and mock codes can be used to identify areas for improving practice. Education of staff is essential in both technical and nontechnical resuscitation skills (human factors). Resuscitation team performance can be improved by ensuring teams brief and plan beforehand and also debrief using feedback data collected during resuscitation events. The use of feedback and prompt devices helps improve adherence to guidelines for chest compression quality but data are lacking in terms of showing improved patient outcomes.
   Summary
   Delivering high-quality CPR in-hospital requires a multifaceted approach. Collecting data during arrests and feeding back in real time and postevent during debriefings can be used to improve delivery of high-quality CPR. There are few studies that show improvement in actual patient outcomes (e. g., survival to hospital discharge) with improvements in delivery of high-quality CPR. Recognizing the importance of both technical and nontechnical skills (human factors) to deliver high-quality CPR is essential.

TI  - Public access defibrillation in Austria: Locating possible installation sites for semi-automated defibrillators
T2  - ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN
AB  - In 1998, 32,728 Austrians died due to disorders of the cardio-vascular system, many of them caused by sudden cardiac arrest. Immediate recognition and commencement of cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (CPR) including the use of a defibrillator by bystanders can be decisive in life threatening situations. Following delayed resuscitation attempts many survivors suffer from hypoxic brain damage. To shorten the time period without treatment semi-automated external defibrillators (AEDs) should be provided and accessible in public areas, if the local ambulance service is unable to provide professional help within the first five minutes (call-to-shock time). This is the maximum time span required to provide sufficient help in order to avoid neurological impairment. The AED devices are easy to handle and no special training is needed. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that sudden cardiac arrest occurs in public areas where on average 1.000 people/year are gathered. An average length of time of four to five minutes between collapse to first shock should not be exceeded when an "Out of hospital cardiac arrest"(OHCA) eventuates.
   The AHA recommends the distribution of AEDs in public areas reachable within short walking distances of 1.5 minutes. In the AEDs integrated mobile phones could be activated and help in locating the emergency and assure prompt assistance.

TI  - Do early emergency calls before patient collapse improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests?
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Some out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) are witnessed after emergency calls. This study aimed to confirm the benefit of early emergency calls before patient collapse on survival after OHCAs witnessed by bystanders and/or emergency medical technicians (EMTs).
   Methods: We analysed 278,310 witnessed OHCAs [EMT-witnessed cases (n = 54,172), bystander-witnessed cases (n = 224,138)] without pre-hospital physician involvement from all Japanese OHCA data prospectively collected between 2006 and 2012. The data were analysed for the correlation between neurologically favourable 1-month survival and the time interval between the emergency call and patient collapse.
   Results: When emergency calls were placed earlier before patient collapse, the proportion of EMT-witnessed cases and survival rate after OHCAs witnessed by bystanders and EMTs were higher. When analysed only for bystander-witnessed cases, for earlier emergency calls placed before patient collapse, survival rate and incidences of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and dispatcher-assisted CPR decreased: 2.9%, 33.6% and 24.4%, respectively, for emergency calls placed >6 min before collapse and 5.5%, 48.8% and 48.5%, respectively, for those placed 1-2 min after collapse. Multivariable logistic regression showed that call-to-collapse interval (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval) (0.92; 0.90-0.94) and EMT response time after collapse (0.84; 0.82-0.86) were associated with survival after bystander-witnessed OHCAs with emergency calls before collapse.
   Conclusion: Early emergency calls before patient collapse efficiently increases the proportion of EMT-witnessed cases and promotes survival after witnessed OHCAs. However, early emergency call before collapse may worsen the outcome when the patient's condition deteriorates to cardiac arrest before EMT arrival. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Pre-hospital versus in-hospital initiation of cooling for survival and neuroprotection after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Targeted temperature management (also known under 'therapeutic hypothermia', 'induced hypothermia'", or 'cooling') has been shown to be beneficial for neurological outcome in patients who have had successful resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest, but it remains unclear when this intervention should be initiated.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of pre-hospital initiation of cooling on survival and neurological outcome in comparison to in-hospital initiation of cooling for adults with pre-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and three trials registers from inception to 5 March 2015, and carried out reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.
   Selection criteria
   We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest comparing cooling in the pre-hospital setting to in-hospital cooling. Our primary outcomes were survival and neurological outcome; our secondary outcomes were adverse events, quality of life, and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures.
   Main results
   We included seven RCTs (2369 participants randomized) on the induction of pre-hospital cooling in comparison to in-hospital cooling. There was considerable methodological heterogeneity and risk of bias mainly due to deficits in the administration of cooling, therefore we refrained from pooling the results for survival and neurological outcome and we presented the results for each study separately. Adverse events were rare: based on four studies with 1713 adults pre-hospital induction of cooling may increase the risk of cardiac rearrests. Risk of bias within the seven individual studies was generally moderate. Overall the quality of the evidence was very low. This was mainly driven by inconsistency and low precision.
   Authors' conclusions
   Currently, there is no convincing evidence to clearly delineate beneficial or harmful effects of pre-hospital induction of cooling in comparison to in-hospital induction of cooling. This conclusion is based on very low quality evidence.

TI  - Resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with normal postresuscitation 12-lead electrocardiography
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - A 50-year-old man experienced ventricular fibrillation in the early morning. A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained immediately after resuscitation showed normal findings. However, an emergent coronary angiogram revealed the acute thrombotic obstruction in the high lateral branch. Following emergent percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully implemented. During observation in the intensive care unit, the patient developed spontaneous prominent ST elevation in the inferior leads, third-degree atrioventricular block, and cardiogenic shock. Atropine and isosorbide dinitrate administration quickly resolved the ST elevation and atrioventricular block. The patient was able to be discharged without cerebral and cardiac dysfunction. The present case gives an important suggestion for the postresuscitation care strategy.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis for Prehospital Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Houston, Texas
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objectives: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) is a promising treatment that could improve survival for refractory out-of-hospital (OHCA) patients. Healthcare systems may choose to start eCPR in the prehospital setting to optimize time to eCPR initiation and decrease low-flow time. We used geospatial modeling to evaluate different eCPR catchment strategies for a forthcoming prehospital eCPR program in Houston, Texas. Methods: We studied OHCAs treated by the Houston Fire Department from 2013 to 2021. We included OHCA patients aged 18-65 years old with an initial shockable rhythm that did not have prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Based on the geolocation that each OHCA occurred, we used geospatial modeling to identify eCPR candidates using four mapping strategies based on distance/drive time from the eCPR center: 1) 15-minute drive time, 20-minute drive time, 10-mile drive distance, and 15-mile drive distance. Results: Of 18,501 OHCAs during the study period, 881 met the eCPR inclusion criteria. Compared to non-eCPR candidates, eCPR candidates were younger (median age 52.3 years vs 62.7 years, p < 0.01) and had a higher proportion of males (76.6% v 59.8%, p < 0.01). Of eCPR candidate OHCAs, OHCAs occurred more frequently during the weekdays and the daytime, with 5:00 PM being the most common time. Using geospatial modeling and based on drive time, 219 OHCAs (24.9% of 881) were within a 15-minute drive, and 454 (51.5%) were within a 20-minute drive. Using drive distance, 383 eCPR candidates (43.5%) were within 10 miles, and 703 (79.8%) were within 15 miles. Conclusions: Using geospatial modeling, we demonstrated a process to estimate potential eCPR patient volumes for a geographic region. Geospatial modeling represents a viable strategy for healthcare systems to delineate eCPR catchment areas.

TI  - Improved Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) Outcomes are Associated with a Restrictive Patient Selection Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality. Despite decades of intensive research and several technological advancements, survival rates remain low. The integration of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has been recognized as a promising approach in refractory OHCA. However, evidence from recent randomized controlled trials yielded contradictory results, and the criteria for selecting eligible patients are still a subject of debate. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of refractory OHCA patients treated with ECPR. All adult patients who received ECPR, according to the hospital algorithm, from 2013 to 2021 were included. Two different algorithms were used during this period. A "permissive" algorithm was used from 2013 to mid-2016. Subsequently, a revised algorithm, more "restrictive", based on international guidelines, was implemented from mid-2016 to 2021. Key differences between the two algorithms included reducing the no-flow time from less than three minutes to zero minutes (implying that the cardiac arrests must occur in the presence of a witness with immediate CPR initiation), reducing low-flow duration from 100 to 60 min, and lowering the age limit from 65 to 55 years. The aim of this study is to compare these two algorithms (permissive (1) and restrictive (2)) to determine if the use of a restrictive algorithm was associated with higher survival rates. Results: A total of 48 patients were included in this study, with 23 treated under Algorithm 1 and 25 under Algorithm 2. A significant difference in survival rate was observed in favor of the restrictive algorithm (9% vs. 68%, p < 0.05). Moreover, significant differences emerged between algorithms regarding the no-flow time (0 (0-5) vs. 0 (0-0) minutes, p < 0.05). Survivors had a significantly shorter no-flow and low-flow time (0 (0-0) vs. 0 (0-3) minutes, p < 0.01 and 40 (31-53) vs. 60 (45-80) minutes, p < 0.05), respectively. Conclusion: The present study emphasizes that a stricter selection of OHCA patients improves survival rates in ECPR.

TI  - Management of Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest with Hemoperitoneum from LUCAS Device: A Case Report
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
AB  - Unusual clinical course Witnessed hypothermic cardiac arrest is a rare injury with high mortality, particularly at extreme temperatures. We describe a case of witnessed accidental hypothermia with a profoundly low core temperature of 20 degrees C, resulting in pre-hospital cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully treated with cardiopulmonary bypass rewarming, but the clinical course was further complicated by a liver injury from device-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), necessitating exploratory laparotomy. A 30-year-old man was found roadside in-15 degrees C weather and suffered pre-hospital cardiac arrest, witnessed by emergency medical personnel. Rewarming treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass was performed at our level-1 trauma center after the patient presented with a core temperature of 20 degrees C and underwent 195 minutes of CPR. Intraoperatively, he was noted to have constant loss of volume on bypass as well as a tense, distended abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed showing hemoperitoneum from a liver laceration secondary to CPR with a Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System (LUCAS) device. Delayed sternal and abdominal closure was performed with definitive closure occurring on hospital day 3. The patient experienced full neurologic recovery and was discharged home on hospital day 23. Extracorporeal rewarming is a definitive treatment for cardiac arrest from accidental severe hypothermia and can be accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass. Providers should have heightened clinical suspicion for solid organ injury when CPR is facilitated by a LUCAS device rather than manual compressions. Disproportionately low return volumes on the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit should prompt consideration of a differential diagnosis which in post-resuscitation patients can include traumatic hemoperitoneum.

TI  - RACIAL/ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN BYSTANDER CPR IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
T2  - ETHNICITY & DISEASE
AB  - Background: Bystander CPR (BCPR) has been demonstrated to improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission, and quality of life in survivors. While previous studies have shown that African Americans are less likely to receive BCPR than Caucasians even after adjusting for variables such as socioeconomic status, BCPR rates in Latinos have not been reported.
   Objective: To describe BCPR rates in an urban African American and Latino population as compared to Caucasians.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of the Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Evaluation in Los Angeles (CARE-LA) database combined with the California Death Statistical Master File (CDSMF). The combined database included location, race/ethnicity/ethnic background, witnessed status, socioeconomic status, and other variables that have previously been associated with differing rates of BCPR.
   Results: There were 814 individuals included in the final study group (53% Caucasian, 28% African American, 19% Latino). African Americans and Latinos were younger than the Caucasians, had more events in the home and had a bystander CPR rate of 13% compared to 24% for the Caucasians (OR=0.47 (95%CI: 0.30-0.74) for African Americans and OR=0.48 (95%CI:0.28-0.80) for the Latinos). Bystander CPR was found to be an independent predictor of survival to hospital discharge and, after adjustment, Latino ethnicity was associated with lower rates of bystander CPR (OR 0.45 (95%CI:0.22-0.92)).
   Conclusion: After adjusting for other variables, Latinos in Los Angeles receive bystander CPR at approximately half the rate of Caucasians. (Ethn Dis. 2009;19:401-406)

TI  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy and the need for concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators; (ICDs) are increasingly used for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VAs); however, there is a potential for severe and debilitating anxiety caused by symptoms associated with ICD therapy and anticipation of shocks. Anxiety is a psychologic stressor, including physiologic components that may lead to adrenergic excitation triggering new arrhythmias and ICD therapies. This often requires concomitant antiarrhythmic medication to reduce the frequency of shocks and symptomatic arrhythmias treated by antitachycardia pacing. Although published studies have documented the efficacy of currently available antiarrhythmics, they have limitations in patients with heart failure, may affect the defibrillation threshold, and/or have been associated with major side-effects. In conclusion, for the patient with an ICD experiencing symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VTs) episodes or ICD shocks, there is a need for pharmacologic therapy to reduce the incidence of such events without affecting the performance of the ICD or causing major side-effects.

TI  - Dispatcher-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rural and urban areas and survival outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: We investigated the impact of dispatcher-assisted bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-BCPR) on survival outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) that occurred in rural and urban areas.
   Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study using nationwide emergency medical services (EMS)-based OHCA registry in Korea. All EMS-treated adults with OHCAs and with presumed cardiac etiology were enrolled between 2012 and 2015, excluding cases witnessed by an EMS provider. BCPR was categorized into 3 groups: BCPR-with-DA, BCPR-without-DA, and No-BCPR. The endpoint was good neurologic recovery at discharge. We compared the effects of BCPR on outcomes between rural and urban areas, using a multivariable logistic regression with an interaction term.
   Results: A total of 53,240 patients (36.3% BCPR-with-DA and 12.8% BCPR-without-DA) were included. Among OHCAs that occurred in rural areas (32.3% BCPR-with-DA and 14.0% BCPR-without-DA) and urban areas (36.9% BCPR-with-DA and 12.5% BCPR-without-DA), good neurological recovery was demonstrated in 1.6% and 6.8% of the patients in rural and urban areas, respectively (p < 0.01). The patients with OHCAs who received BCPR in both rural and urban areas were more likely to have good neurologic recovery than the No-BCPR group (AORs, 3.53 (1.84-6.77) BCPR-with-DA and 2.56 (1.23-5.32) BCPR-without-DA in rural; and 1.59 (1.41-1.79) BCPR-with-DA and 1.37 (1.18-1.60) BCPR-without-DA in urban). The effects of the measures of BCPR-with-DA on the outcome were more apparent in rural areas compared to urban areas.
   Conclusions: BCPR, regardless of DA, was associated with improved neurologic recovery after OHCA in rural and urban areas. However, the effect of BCPR-with-DA was prominent for OHCA that occurred in rural areas.

TI  - FACTORS ANALYSIS OF CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION OUTCOMES IN THE ELDERLY IN TAIWAN
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY
AB  - Performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can save countless lives, but its use is rather controversial in elderly patients. Some researchers believe that there is an inverse ratio between the success of CPR and the age of the patient, while others believe that the uniqueness of each case and existing comorbidities are more important factors. CPR can result in severe injury for patients. Therefore, physicians often face a dilemma between rational and moral decisions when dealing with older patients suffering from cardiac arrest. The solution to this problem rests on the determination of whether CPR will benefit the patient. This analysis, supported by a literature review and a review of the outcomes of CPR, considered different factors in elderly patients, including age, sex, prehospital emergency medical service, preexisting disease, witnessed cardiac arrest, initial arrest electrocardiogram rhythm, CPR locations, and ethics. Quality of life and the cost of medical care for the elderly affect the benefit analysis of CPR. Indeed, a large amount of money is spent on elderly CPR patients who remain in critical condition before finally dying in the hospital. Factors contributing to decisions to resuscitate also include post-resuscitation quality of life, and the will of patients, families and doctors. In short, patient age is not a barrier to performing CPR. However, to achieve the best outcome of CPR, one must consider the disease diagnosis of elderly patients as a useful reference to help improve medical care for this group.

TI  - Amplitude Spectrum Area of ventricular fibrillation to guide defibrillation: a small open-label, pseudo-randomized controlled multicenter trial
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background Ventricular fibrillation (VF) waveform analysis has been proposed as a potential non-invasive guide to optimize timing of defibrillation. Methods The AMplitude Spectrum Area (AMSA) trial is an open-label, multicenter randomized controlled study reporting the first in-human use of AMSA analysis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The primary efficacy endpoint was the termination of VF for an AMSA = 15.5 mV-Hz. Adult shockable OHCAs randomly received either an AMSA-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or a standard-CPR. Randomization and allocation to trial group were carried out centrally. In the AMSA-guided CPR, an initial AMSA = 15.5 mV-Hz prompted for immediate defibrillation, while lower values favored chest compression (CC). After completion of the first 2-min CPR cycle, an AMSA < 6.5 mV-Hz deferred defibrillation in favor of an additional 2-min CPR cycle. AMSA was measured and displayed in real-time during CC pauses for ventilation with a modified defibrillator.Findings The trial was early discontinued for low recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemics. A total of 31 patients were recruited in 3 Italian cities, 19 in AMSA-CPR and 12 in standard-CPR, and included in the data analysis. No difference in primary outcome was observed between the two groups. Termination of VF occurred in 74% of patients in the AMSA-CPR compared to 75% in the standard CPR (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.18-4.90]). No adverse events were reported.Interpretation AMSA was used prospectively in human patients during ongoing CPR. In this small trial, an AMSA-guided defibrillation provided no evidence of an improvement in termination of VF.

TI  - Dietary Nitrate Supplementation Protects Against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiomyopathy by Improving Mitochondrial Function
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that long-term dietary nitrate supplementation protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by improving ventricular function and reducing mitochondrial respiratory chain damage.
   Background Doxorubicin is a powerful anthracycline antibiotic used to treat divergent human neoplasms. Its clinical use is limited because of severe cardiotoxic side effects. Dietary nitrate and nitrite are essential nutrients for maintenance of steady-state tissue levels of nitric oxide and may play a therapeutic role in diseases associated with nitric oxide insufficiency or dysregulation. Dietary nitrate and nitrite supplementation alleviates myocardial injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion and cardiac arrest-resuscitation.
   Methods Adult male CF-1 mice were given a single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and left ventricular contractile function was assessed 5 days later using both echocardiography and pressure-volume Millar catheterization. A nitrate supplementation regimen (1 g/l sodium nitrate in drinking water) was started 7 days before doxorubicin injection and continued thereafter. Cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis, tissue lipid peroxidation, and plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were assessed. In addition, mitochondrial complex I activity, oxidative phosphorylation capacity, and hydrogen peroxide generation were determined in parallel experiments.
   Results Doxorubicin caused impairment of ventricular contractility and cell death, which were significantly reduced by nitrate supplementation (p < 0.05). These cardioprotective effects were associated with a significant decrease in tissue lipid peroxidation. Nitrate supplementation significantly preserved mitochondrial complex I activity and oxidative phosphorylation and attenuated hydrogen peroxide generation after doxorubicin treatment.
   Conclusions Long-term oral intake of inorganic nitrate attenuates doxorubicin-induced ventricular dysfunction, cell death, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial respiratory chain damage. Nitrate could be a promising therapeutic agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2011; 57: 2181-9) (C) 2011 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation

TI  - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training in High School Using Avatars in Virtual Worlds: An International Feasibility Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Approximately 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) annually in the United States. Less than 30% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today's youth (ie, the digital native generation).
   Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training.
   Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables.
   Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P<.001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P=.006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P=.05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P<.001). We found a significant positive correlation (P<.001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use.
   Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training.

TI  - Early defibrillation in a university hospital
T2  - ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN
AB  - With regional variations, the survival rate of patients who experience an in-hospital cardiac arrest (approximate incidence 1:1.000 hospital patients) is under 10 %. Staff instruction in basic reanimation and the establishment of a medical emergency team (MET) do not suffice to improve outcome. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of automated external defibrillators (AED) accessible to and for use by the lay public is a promising approach to reducing mortality in the out-of-hospital setting. In order to shorten the time interval between cardiac arrest and initiation of shock treatment in the peripheral wards of a large decentralised hospital, an AED-program was implemented at the Wurzburg University Hospital. In the present article we discuss the Wurzburg AED-teaching concept, and the planning and realization of the AED-project. Together with the MET, the AED-project represents a basic feature of the in-hospital emergency plan.

TI  - Independent evaluation of an out-of-hospital termination of resuscitation (TOR) clinical decision rule
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Recently, investigators described a clinical decision rule for termination of resuscitation (TOR) designed to help determine whether to terminate emergency medical services (EMS) resuscitative efforts for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OOHCA). The authors sought to evaluate the hypothesis that TOR would predict no survival for patients in an independent cohort of patients with OOHCA.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted in the state of Arizona. Consecutive, adult, OOHCA were prospectively evaluated from October 2004 through October 2006. A statewide OOHCA database utilizing Utstein-style reporting from 30 different EMS systems was used. Data were abstracted from EMS first care reports and hospital discharge records. The TOR guidelines predict that no survival to hospital discharge will occur if 1) an OOHCA victim does not have return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 2) no shocks are administered, and 3) the arrest is not witnessed by EMS personnel. Data were entered into a structured database. Continuous data are presented as means (+/- standard deviations [SD]) and categorical data as frequency of occurrence, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as appropriate. The primary outcome measure was to determine if any cohort member who met TOR criteria survived to hospital discharge.
   Results: There were 2,239 eligible patients; the study group included 2,180 (97.4%) patients for whom the data were complete; mean age was 64 (+/- 11) years, and 35% were female. The majority of patients in the study group met at least one or more of the TOR criteria. A total of 2,047 (93.8%) patients suffered from cardiac arrest that was unwitnessed by EMS; 1,653 (75.8%) had an unwitnessed arrest and no ROSC. With respect to TOR, 1,160 of 2,180 (53.2%) patients met all three criteria; only one (0.09%; 95% CI = 0% to 0.5%) survived to hospital discharge.
   Conclusions: The authors evaluated TOR guidelines in an independent, statewide OOHCA database. The results are consistent with the findings of the TOR investigation and suggest that this algorithm is a promising tool for TOR decision-making in the field.

TI  - Nursing roles for in-hospital cardiac arrest response: higher versus lower performing hospitals
T2  - BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
AB  - Background Good outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) depend on a skilled resuscitation team, prompt initiation of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, and organisational structures to support IHCA response. We examined the role of nurses in resuscitation, contrasting higher versus lower performing hospitals in IHCA survival. Methods We conducted a descriptive qualitative study at nine hospitals in the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry, purposefully sampling hospitals that varied in geography, academic status, and risk-standardised IHCA survival. We conducted 158 semistructured interviews with nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, quality improvement staff, and administrators. Qualitative thematic text analysis followed by type-building text analysis identified distinct nursing roles in IHCA care and support for roles. Results Nurses played three major roles in IHCA response: bedside first responder, resuscitation team member, and clinical or administrative leader. We found distinctions between higher and lower performing hospitals in support for nurses. Higher performing hospitals emphasised training and competency of nurses at all levels; provided organisational flexibility and responsiveness with nursing roles; and empowered nurses to operate at a higher scope of clinical practice (eg, bedside defibrillation). Higher performing hospitals promoted nurses as leaders-administrators supporting nurses in resuscitation care at the institution, resuscitation team leaders during resuscitation and clinical champions for resuscitation care. Lower performing hospitals had more restrictive nurse roles with less emphasis on systematically identifying improvement needs. Conclusion Hospitals that excelled in IHCA survival emphasised mentoring and empowering front-line nurses and ensured clinical competency and adequate nursing training for IHCA care. Though not proof of causation, nurses appear to be critical to effective IHCA response, and how to support their role to optimise outcomes warrants further investigation.

TI  - PULS - Austrian Cardiac Arrest Awareness Association: An overview of a multi-tiered and multi-facetted regional initiative to save lives
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) still leads to dismal outcomes worldwide. The crucial gap between cardiac arrest and advanced life support can only be filled by bystander-CPR. However, knowledge and willingness of the public towards basic life support (BLS) remain low. Global and national initiatives for awareness building and CPR training have produced promising improvements, but an additional focus on regional initiatives might be necessary to truly implement change.Methods and results: In order to support other like-minded groups, we present a "coming of age" narrative review of PULS - Austrian Cardiac Arrest Awareness Association, along with a future outlook and "lessons learned". Interviews with past and present employees, members, and functionaries were conducted by the authors. Additionally, the organization's archives were assessed.Conclusion: Following current guidelines and the Utstein formula of survival, building a system to save lives is essential to achieve progress concerning cardiac arrest survival and outcomes. As kinds of "regional offices" of global resuscitation efforts, a network of individual local initiatives and organizations such as PULS can carry the respective messages, engage with local key figures of implementation, and keep up perpetual work for cardiac arrest awareness and BLS education.

TI  - Tree-Based Algorithms and Association Rule Mining for Predicting Patients' Neurological Outcomes After First-Aid Treatment for an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest During COVID-19 Pandemic Application of Data Mining
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: The authors performed several tree-based algorithms and an association rules mining as data mining tools to find useful determinants for neurological outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients as well as to assess the effect of the first-aid and basic characteristics in the EMS system.
   Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. The outcome was Cerebral Performance Categories grading on OHCA patients at hospital discharge. Decision tree-based models inclusive of C4.5 algorithm, classification and regression tree and random forest were built to determine an OHCA patient's prognosis. Association rules mining was another data mining method which we used to find the combination of prognostic factors linked to the outcome.
   Results: The total of 3520 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 67.53 (+/- 18.4) year-old and 63.4% were men. To overcome the imbalance outcome issue in machine learning, the random forest has a better predictive ability for OHCA patients in overall accuracy (91.19%), weighted precision (88.76%), weighted recall (91.20%) and F1 score (0.9) by oversampling adjustment. Under association rules mining, patients who had any witness on the spot when encountering OHCA or who had ever ROSC during first-aid would be highly correlated with good CPC prognosis.
   Conclusion: The random forest has a better predictive ability for OHCA patients. This paper provides a role model applying several machine learning algorithms to the first-aid clinical assessment that will be promising combining with Artificial Intelligence for applying to emergency medical services.

TI  - Contemporary Management of Complex Ventricular Arrhythmias
T2  - ARRHYTHMIA & ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Percutaneous catheter ablation is an effective and safe therapy that can eliminate ventricular tachycardia, reducing the risks of both recurrent arrhythmia and shock therapies from a defibrillator. Successful ablation requires accurate identification of arrhythmic substrate and the effective delivery of energy to the targeted tissue. A thorough pre-procedural assessment is needed before considered 3D electroanatomical mapping can be performed. In contemporary practice, this must combine traditional electrophysiological techniques, such as activation and entrainment mapping, with more novel physiological mapping techniques for which there is an ever-increasing evidence base. Novel techniques to maximise energy delivery to the tissue must also be considered and balanced against their associated risks of complication. This review provides a comprehensive appraisal of contemporary practice and the evidence base that supports recent developments in mapping and ablation, while also considering potential future developments in the field.

TI  - Elderly Patients and Management in Intensive Care Units (ICU): Clinical Challenges
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - There is a growing population of older adults requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). This population outpaces the ability of clinicians with geriatric training to assist in their management. Specific training and education for intensivists in the care of older patients is valuable to help understand and inform clinical care, as physiologic changes of aging affect each organ system. This review highlights some of these aging processes and discusses clinical implications in the vulnerable older population. Other considerations when caring for these older patients in the ICU include functional outcomes and morbidity, as opposed to merely a focus on mortality. An overall holistic approach incorporating physiology of aging, applying current evidence, and including the patient and their family in care should be used when caring for older adults in the ICU.

TI  - Quality-of-life and outcome predictors following massive burn injury
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB  - DBackground: Quality of life is a major criterion when decisions regarding resuscitation, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of patients with massive burn injuries are being considered. There has been little research focusing on quality of life following burn injuries involving more than 50 percent total body surface area in the adult population. The authors' goals were to describe quality of life and identify specific clinical and functional indices that predict good quality of life following massive burn injuries.
   Methods: Using a prospective study design, 47 patients who survived a massive burn between 1980 and 2001 were recruited from a single burn unit. Clinical data were collected from hospital records, function was assessed using the Abbreviated Burn-Specific Health Scale, and quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 survey. The Short Form-36 scores were compared with population norms. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify factors predicting Short Form-36 scores.
   Results: Overall, the mean age was 28 +/- 1.8 years, 96 percent (45 of 47) were men, and the mean burn size was 64 2.1 percent total body surface area. Compared with Canadian population norms, burn patients had significantly lower Short Form-36 scores in the domains of role physical (69.1 versus 82.1, p = 0.0067) and general health perception (67.2 versus 77.0, p = 0.00014). At the time of injury, the amount of total full-thickness burn predicted follow-up Short Form-36 physical summary scores (R-2 = 15 percent, p < 0.001). At the time of follow-up, addition of the patient's hand function significantly contributed to the prediction of Short Form-36 physical summary scores (R-2 = 44 percent, p < 0.001). At the time of injury, the age of the patient predicted follow-up Short Form-36 mental summary scores (R = 25 percent, p < 0.001). At the time of follow-up, addition of the patient's perceived level of social support significantly contributed to the prediction of Short Form-36 mental summary scores (R-2 = 44 percent, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Survivors of massive burn injury reported a good quality of life in most Short Form-36 domains. The authors identified the size of the total full-thickness injury and the age of the patient as factors available at the tune of injury that predict quality of life. The addition of hand function and the patient's perceived level of social support at the time of follow-up improved prediction of quality of life. Accordingly, this information on quality of life after massive burn injury could aid in decision making at the time of resuscitation, reconstruction, and rehabilitation.

TI  - Patients With Refractory Out-of-Cardiac Arrest and Sustained Ventricular Fibrillation as Candidates for Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation - Prospective Multi-Center Observational Study
T2  - CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: We investigated whether patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and sustained ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT) or conversion to pulseless electrical activity/asystole (PEA/asystole) benefit more from extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).
   Methods and Results: We analyzed data from the Study of Advanced Life Support for Ventricular Fibrillation with Extracorporeal Circulation in Japan, which was a prospective, multicenter, observational study with 22 institutions in the ECPR group and 17 institutions in the conventional CPR (CCPR) group. Patients were divided into 4 groups by cardiac rhythm and CPR group. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2 at 6 months. A total of 407 patients had refractory OHCA with VF/pVT on initial electrocardiogram. The proportion of ECPR patients with favorable neurological outcome was significantly higher in the sustained VF/pVT group than in the conversion to PEA/asystole group (20%, 25/126 vs. 3%, 4/122, P<0.001). Stratifying by cardiac rhythm, on multivariable mixed logistic regression analysis an ECPR strategy significantly increased the proportion of patients with favorable neurological outcome at 6 months in the patients with sustained VF/pVT (OR, 7.35; 95% CI: 1.58-34.09), but these associations were not observed in patients with conversion to PEA/asystole.
   Conclusions: OHCA patients with sustained VF/pVT may be the most promising ECPR candidates (UMIN000001403).

TI  - Prompt Advanced Life Support Improves Survival from Ventricular Fibrillation
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objective. To determine whether the interval between the arrival of basic life support (BLS) providers and the arrival of advanced life support (ALS) providers is associated with patient outcome after cardiac arrest. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all witnessed, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrests between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2007. Eligible patients (n = 1,781) received full resuscitation efforts from both BLS and ALS providers. Results. The BLS-to-ALS arrival interval was a significant predictor of survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-0.99); the likelihood of survival decreased by 4% for every minute that ALS arrival was delayed following BLS arrival. Other significant predictors of survival were whether the arrest occurred in public (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19-1.85), whether a bystander administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68), and the interval between the 9-1-1 call and BLS arrival (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.83). Conclusions. We found that a shorter BLS-to-ALS arrival interval increased the likelihood of survival to hospital discharge after a witnessed, out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest. We conclude that ALS interventions may provide additional benefits over BLS interventions alone when utilized in a well-established, two-tiered emergency medical services (EMS) system already optimized for rapid defibrillation. The highest priorities in any EMS system should still be early CPR and early defibrillation, but timely ALS services can supplement these crucial interventions.

TI  - The SLANT Score Predicts Poor Neurologic Outcome in Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: An External Validation Using a Retrospective Cohort
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Hypoxic brain injury is the leading cause of death in comatose patients following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Neurological outcome can be difficult to prognosticate following resuscitation, and goals of care discussions are often informed by multiple prognostic tools. One tool that has shown promise is the SLANT score, which encompasses five metrics including initial nonshockable rhythm, leukocyte count after targeted temperature management, total adrenaline dose during resuscitation, lack of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. This cohort study aimed to provide an external validation of this score by using a database of comatose cardiac arrest survivors from our institution. Methods We retrospectively queried our database of cardiac arrest survivors, selecting for patients with coma, sustained return of spontaneous circulation, and use of targeted temperature management to have a comparable sample to the index study. We calculated SLANT scores for each patient and separated them into risk levels, both according to the original study and according to a Youden index analysis. The primary outcome was poor neurologic outcome (defined by a cerebral performance category score of 3 or greater at discharge), and the secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Univariable and multivariable analyses, as well as a receiver operator characteristic curve, were used to assess the SLANT score for independent predictability and diagnostic accuracy for poor outcomes. Results We demonstrate significant association between a SLANT group with increased risk and poor neurologic outcome on univariable (p = 0.005) and multivariable analysis (odds ratio 1.162, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.346, p = 0.046). A receiver operating characteristic analysis indicates that SLANT scoring is a fair prognostic test for poor neurologic outcome (area under the curve 0.708, 95% confidence interval 0.536-0.879, p = 0.024). Among this cohort, the most frequent SLANT elements were initial nonshockable rhythm (84.5%) and total adrenaline dose >= 5 mg (63.9%). There was no significant association between SLANT score and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.064). Conclusions The SLANT score may independently predict poor neurologic outcome but not in-hospital mortality. Including the SLANT score as part of a multimodal approach may improve our ability to accurately prognosticate comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

TI  - Advances in interdisciplinary care for term and preterm neonates with congenital heart disease: a narrative review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common major birth defect, affecting nearly 1% of live-born infants. There is a high prevalence of CHD among premature neonates, with prematurity and low birth weight compounding the risks associated with CHD and leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in diagnosis, surgery, and intensive care, outcomes for preterm infants with CHD remain guarded, particularly in the earliest gestational age groups. These infants face heightened risks of neonatal decompensation, cardiac arrest, and early mortality, but also long-term complications including neurodevelopmental impairment. The interplay between maternal-fetal factors, perinatal environment, and the complex physiology of both prematurity and CHD underscores the need for multidisciplinary care. Prenatal diagnosis, careful delivery planning, specialized postnatal management, and tailored surgical timing are critical to optimizing outcomes. Neonatal and cardiac intensivists, cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and allied professionals must collaborate closely to address diverse challenges including hemodynamic instability, respiratory support, nutrition, neuroprotection, and social disparities. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of neonates with CHD with a focus on prematurity. We highlight evolving models of interdisciplinary care and outline priorities for research. A physiology-based, team-oriented approach is essential to improve both survival and long-term quality of life for this vulnerable population. What is Known:center dot CHD is the most common birth defect and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.center dot Prematurity and low birthweight worsen outcomes, with complications and surgical risk inversely related to gestational age.What is New:center dot Pregnancies with CHD carry up to a threefold higher risk of preterm delivery.center dot Outcomes reflect maternal-fetal and neonatal factors, highlighting the need for tailored timing, evaluation, and surgical strategies, with a key role for multidisciplinary care.

TI  - Altered neurodevelopmental DNA methylation status after fetal growth restriction with brain-sparing
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB  - It is under debate how preferential perfusion of the brain (brain-sparing) in fetal growth restriction (FGR) relates to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Epigenetic modification of neurotrophic genes by altered fetal oxygenation may be involved. To explore this theory, we performed a follow-up study of 21 FGR children, in whom we prospectively measured the prenatal cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) with Doppler sonography. At 4 years of age, we tested their neurodevelopmental outcome using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. In addition, we collected their buccal DNA to determine the methylation status at predefined genetic regions within the genes hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), erythropoietin (EPO), EPO-receptor (EPOR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2 (NTRK2) by pyrosequencing. We found that FGR children with fetal brain-sparing (CPR <1, n = 8) demonstrated a trend (0.05 < p < 0.1) toward hypermethylation of HIF1A and VEGFA at their hypoxia-response element (HRE) compared with FGR children without fetal brain-sparing. Moreover, in cases with fetal brain-sparing, we observed statistically significant hypermethylation at a binding site for cyclic adenosine monophophate response element binding protein (CREB) of BDNF promoter exon 4 and hypomethylation at an HRE located within the NTRK2 promoter (both p <0.05). Hypermethylation of VEGFA was associated with a poorer Performance Intelligence Quotient, while hypermethylation of BDNF was associated with better inhibitory self-control (both p <0.05). These results led us to formulate the hypothesis that early oxygen-dependent epigenetic alterations due to hemodynamic alterations in FGR may be associated with altered neurodevelopmental outcome in later life. We recommend further studies to test this hypothesis.

TI  - Experiences among firefighters and police officers of responding to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a dual dispatch programme in Sweden: an interview study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to explore firefighters' and police officers' experiences of responding to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in a dual dispatch programme.
   Design A qualitative interview study with semi-structured, open-ended questions where critical incident technique (CIT) was used to collect recalled cardiac arrest situations from the participants' narratives. The interviews where transcribed verbatim and analysed with inductive content analysis.
   Setting The County of Stockholm, Sweden.
   Participants Police officers (n=10) and firefighters (n=12) participating in a dual dispatch programme with emergency medical services in case of suspected OHCA of cardiac or non-cardiac origin.
   Results Analysis of 60 critical incidents was performed resulting in three consecutive time sequences (preparedness, managing the scene and the aftermath) with related categories, where first responders described the complexity of the cardiac arrest situation. Detailed information about the case and the location was crucial for the preparedness, and information deficits created stress, frustration and incorrect perceptions about the victim. The technical challenges of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and managing the airway was prominent and the need of regular team training and education in first aid was highlighted.
   Conclusions Participating in dual dispatch in case of suspected OHCA was described as a complex technical and emotional process by first responders. Providing case discussions and opportunities to give, and receive feedback about the case is a main task for the leadership in the organisations to diminish stress among personnel and to improve future OHCA missions.

CP  - Conference on Making a World of Difference - Independent Living and Ventilation
AB  - Thirteen persons diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were interviewed to determine the factors involved in making a decision whether to use mechanical ventilatory support.  All study participants believed that they alone should make the decision regarding use of mechanical ventilation.  The factors they considered to be of most importance were quality of life, severity of disability, availabilty of ventilation by means of a nasal mask, possible admission to a long-term care facility, ability to discontinue use of mechanical ventilation, desire to live, concern for their families' emotional health, and concern for care demands placed on their families.  Suggestions are offered to facilitate the patient's decision-making process through provision of more information and improved dialogue between patient and professional.

TI  - One-year longitudinal study of psychological distress and self-assessed health in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Few studies have investigated the psychological and health-related outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) over time. This longitudinal study aims to evaluate psychological distress in terms of anxiety and depression, self-assessed health and predictors of these outcomes in survivors of OHCA, 3 and 12 months after resuscitation.
   Methods Recruitment took place from 2008 to 2011 and survivors of OHCA were identified through the national Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry. Inclusion criteria were age >= 18 years, survival >= 12 months and a Cerebral Performance Category score <= 2. Questionnaires containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) were administered at 3 and 12 months after the OHCA. Participants were also asked to report treatment-requiring comorbidities.
   Results Of 298 survivors, 85 (29%) were eligible for this study and 74 (25%) responded. Clinically relevant anxiety was reported by 22 survivors at 3 months and by 17 at 12 months, while clinical depression was reported by 10 at 3 months and 4 at 12 months. The mean EQ-5D-3L index value increased from 0.82 (+/- 0.26) to 0.88 (+/- 0.15) over time. There were significantly less symptoms of psychological distress (p=0.01) and better self-assessed health (p=0.003) at 12 months. Treatment-requiring comorbidity predicted anxiety (OR 4.07, p=0.04), while being female and young age predicted poor health (OR 6.33, p=0.04; OR 0.91, p=0.002) at 3 months. At 12 months, being female was linked to anxiety (OR 9.23, p=0.01) and depression (OR 14.78, p=0.002), while young age predicted poor health (OR 0.93, p=0.003).
   Conclusion The level of psychological distress and self-assessed health improves among survivors of OHCA between 3 and 12 months after resuscitation. Higher levels of psychological distress can be expected among female survivors and those with comorbidity, while survivors of young age and who are female are at greater risk of poor health.

TI  - The intensive care medicine research agenda on septic shock
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Septic shock remains a global health challenge with millions of cases every year, high rates of mortality and morbidity, impaired quality of life among survivors and relatives, and high resource use both in developed and developing nations. Care and outcomes are improving through organisational initiatives and updated clinical practice guidelines based on clinical research mainly carried out by large collaborative networks. This progress is likely to continue through the collaborative work of the established and merging trials groups in many parts of the world and through refined trial methodology and translational work. In this review, international experts summarize the current position of clinical research in septic shock and propose a research agenda to advance this field.

TI  - 500 PATIENTS WITH MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION MONITORED WITHIN ONE HOUR OF SYMPTOMS
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Of 2886 patients monitored during acute myocardial infarction, 500 were observed within 1 h of the onset of symptoms. Half of the early admission group were admitted in response to emergency 999 calls and 435 of them traveled in resuscitation ambulances, where surveillance for arrhythmias was instituted. Pulmonary edema occurred in 130 patients (26%), cardiogenic shock supervened in 60 (12%) and 115 (23%) died in hospital. Ventricular fibrillation was observed in 98 patients (20%). Of them, 42 survived to be discharged, including 20 of 24 with primary fibrillation which had occurred first in hospital. In only 1 case did primary ventricular fibrillation occur after the 1st 10 h of onset of illness. Sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation were all observed more frequently in patients admitted within 1 h after the onset of symptoms than in those admitted later. An element of selection is inevitable when early admission is encouraged by the existence of a resuscitation ambulance system; this will depend in part on the early recognition of risk and the geographical location of the attack. These factors may bias the group towards relatively high risk. Prompt admission after myocardial infarction should improve survival by permitting successful management both of ventricular fibrillation and of other arrhythmias which may influence short- and long-term prognoses.

TI  - Hypertonic resuscitation improves neuronal and behavioral outcomes after traumatic brain injury plus hemorrhage
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Resuscitation with hypertonic saline or hypertonic saline Plus L-arginine acutely improves cerebral blood How after traumatic brain injury (TBI) followed by hemorrhagic hypotension. The authors investigated whether hypertonic saline or hypertonic L-arginine would improve long-term neuronal survival and behavioral outcomes 15 days after TBI and hemorrhagic hypotension.
   Methods: Mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, pH, plasma glucose, hematocrit, and hemoglobin were measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats before and after moderate (2.0 atm) fluid percussion TBI. Rats were assigned to one of six groups: (1) sham TBI, (2) hemorrhage only, (3) TBI only, (4) TBI plus hemorrhage and resuscitation with 0.9% saline, (5) TBI plus hemorrhage and resuscitation with hypertonic saline (7.50/6), or (6) TBI plus hemorrhage and resuscitation with L-arginine (100 mg/kg) in hypertonic saline. On postinjury days 1-5, vestibulomotor function was assessed using beam balance and beam walking tasks. On postinjury days 11-15, spatial memory function was assessed using the Morris water maze. After behavioral testing, neuronal counting was performed bilaterally on specific hippocampal. regions.
   Results: Groups receiving hypertonic saline (P < 0.05, day 15 vs. day 11) or hypertonic L-arginine (P < 0.05, days 13-15 vs. day 11) showed improved performance over time on the Morris water maze, as well as significantly improved neuronal survival in the contralateral hippocampus (P < 0.05, hypertonic saline or hypertonic L-arginine vs. normal saline) compared with untreated TBI or normal saline-treated TBI plus hemorrhage groups.
   Conclusions: Hypertonic saline and hypertonic L-arginine were both effective at promoting long-term neuronal survival and behavioral recovery. The slightly earlier improvement in Morris water maze performance in the hypertonic L-arginine group warrants further studies to determine whether higher doses Of L-arginine provide additional improvement. This study supports the therapeutic benefits of hypertonic resuscitation after TBI plus hemorrhagic hypotension.

TI  - Delayed perinephric hematoma following ESWL in an anticoagulated patient: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB  - Introduction and importance: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a widely used non-invasive treatment for renal stones; however, it carries a risk of hemorrhagic complications, particularly in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and anticoagulation therapy. Perinephric hematoma is a rare but potentially serious complication that requires prompt recognition and appropriate management. Case presentation: We report a case of a 58-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes, and long-term anticoagulation who developed a massive perinephric hematoma one week after undergoing ESWL for bilateral renal stones. He presented with severe left flank pain and a significant hemoglobin drop, with imaging confirming a large perinephric hematoma. He was managed conservatively in the intensive care unit (ICU) with close monitoring, bed rest, fluid resuscitation, pain control, and temporary cessation of anticoagulation. Over 10 days, his condition improved without the need for invasive intervention, and he was discharged on oral medications with a planned follow-up for renal function assessment and anticoagulation resumption. Clinical discussion: This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis using CT imaging in patients presenting with post-ESWL flank pain and anemia. Conservative management, including strict monitoring, supportive care, and temporary anticoagulation withdrawal, was successful in achieving hemodynamic stability without invasive intervention. This underscores the need for individualized treatment strategies based on patient risk factors and clinical presentation. Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition of ESWL-associated hemorrhagic complications, particularly in high-risk patients. It also highlights the effectiveness of conservative management as a viable approach to achieving successful recovery without the need for surgical or interventional procedures.

TI  - Withholding advanced cardiac life support in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A prospective study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: To evaluate the decision criteria leading to refrain from starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the prehospital setting.
   Materials and methods: We conducted a prospective, descriptive study, in a physician-staffed emergency medical service during a 12 month period. All patients presenting with a cardiac arrest were included. Patients were allocated to two groups: immediate decision to give CPR (R group) or withholding CPR (NR group). Characteristics of patients including previous health status, time intervals, therapies and outcomes, were collected. Data were compared between the two groups, p < 0.05.
   Results: One hundred and fourteen patients (aged 61 18 years) were enrolled in R group and 113 (73 +/- 19 years*) in NR group. Patients of NR group more frequently presented with a deterioration of functional independence (51% versus 10%*), cognitive impairment (21% versus 8%*) and higher McCabe score and Knaus class (McCabe 2: 24% versus 2%*; Knaus class D: 23% versus 3%*). Presence of a bystander (75% versus 44%*) or basic life support (BLS) started by the bystander (40% versus 12%*) were more frequent in R than NR. Age (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1), McCabe score >0 (OR, 10.5; 95%CI, 1.4-79.0), lack of bystander BLS (OR, 11.2; 95%CI, 2.2-60.7) and ineffectiveness of BLS by EMTs (OR, 12.1; 95% Cl, 2.0-72.8) were independent factors of withholding CPR. The physician conducted often the discussion atone (48%).
   Conclusion: Decision criteria leading to refrain from starting CPR in the prehospital setting are age, previous health status and initial BLS. Further thought should be allowed to ensure a share in the decision-making process in this particular practice. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - "Sorry, what did you say?" Communicating defibrillator retrieval and use in OHCA emergency calls
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The defibrillator prompt, which directs callers to retrieve a defibrillator during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, is crucial to the emergency call because it can save lives. We evaluated communicative effectiveness of the prompt instated by the Medical Priority Dispatch System (TM) Version 13, namely: if there is a defibrillator (AED) available, send someone to get it now, and tell me when you have it.
   Methods: Using Conversation Analysis and descriptive statistics, we examined linguistic features of the defibrillator sequences (call-taker prompt and caller response) in 208 emergency calls where non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was confirmed by the emergency medical services, and they attempted resuscitation, in the first six months of 2019. Defibrillator sequence durations were measured to determine impact on time to CPR prompt. The proportion of cases where bystanders retrieved defibrillators was also assessed.
   Results: There was low call-taker adoption of the Medical Priority Dispatch System (TM) Version 13 prompt (99/208) compared to alternative prompts (86/208) or no prompt (23/208). Caller responses to the Version 13 prompt tended to be longer, more ambiguous or unrelated, and have more instances of repair (utterances to address comprehension trouble). Defibrillators were rarely brought to the scene irrespective of defibrillator prompt utilised.
   Conclusion: While the Version 13 prompt aims to ensure the use of an available automatic external defibrillator, its effectiveness is undermined by the three-clause composition of the prompt and exclusion of a question structure. We recommend testing of a re-phrased defibrillator prompt in order to maximise comprehension and caller action.

TI  - Sex and age specific time patterns and long term time trends of pre-hospital delay of patients presenting with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Prompt initiation of treatment after symptom onset of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a central goal in limiting myocardial damage because of the time-dependent nature of reperfusion therapies. We examined time patterns and long term time trends of pre-hospital delay time (PHDT) of STEMI patients.
   Methods: PHDT from 3093 STEMI patients derived from the Augsburg Myocardial Infarction Registry (19852004) surviving >24 h after admission was obtained by a standardized bedside interview. Patients with in-hospital MI (n=140) and resuscitation (n=157) were excluded. Linear regression models were used to examine monthly median PHDT and individual PHDT over time.
   Results: Female sex was associated with longer PHDT (189 (98-542 quartiles) min vs. 154 (85-497) min; p<0.0003). Median PHDT in the youngest male subgroup (25-54 years) was 128 (73-458) min and mounted to 205 (107-600) min in the oldest female subgroup (65-74 years). A minority of 12.4% of patients reached hospital within 1 h of delay ranging from 8.7% (in oldest women) to 15.9% (in youngest men). The age-adjusted linear regressionmodel formonthly PHDT revealed no significant change over 20-year time in both sexes. The corresponding average annual percentage change estimates were-0.45 (95% CI:-1.40 to 0.54) for men and -0.08 (95% CI:-1.80 to 1.67) for women. Emergency ambulance use increased over time, however transportation time remained stable.
   Conclusions: PHDT in STEMI patients is constantly high over a 20-year observation period. Room for improvement especially in older women was evidenced. Preventive strategies with focused efforts on this subgroup are warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Effects of Public Access Defibrillation on Survival After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest A Systematic Review of Observational Studies
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances, the average survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains <10%. Early defibrillation by an automated external defibrillator is the most important intervention for patients with OHCA, showing survival proportions >50%. Accordingly, placement of automated external defibrillators in the community as part of a public access defibrillation program (PAD) is recommended by international guidelines. However, different strategies have been proposed on how exactly to increase and make use of publicly available automated external defibrillators. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of PAD and the different PAD strategies on survival after OHCA.
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched on August 31, 2015 for observational studies reporting survival to hospital discharge in OHCA patients where an automated external defibrillator had been used by nonemergency medical services. PAD was divided into 3 groups according to who applied the defibrillator: nondispatched lay first responders, professional first responders (firefighters/police) dispatched by the Emergency Medical Dispatch Center (EMDC), or lay first responders dispatched by the EMDC.
   RESULTS: A total of 41 studies were included; 18 reported PAD by nondispatched lay first responders, 20 reported PAD by EMDC-dispatched professional first responders (firefighters/police), and 3 reported both. We identified no qualified studies reporting survival after PAD by EMDC-dispatched lay first responders. The overall survival to hospital discharge after OHCA treated with PAD showed a median survival of 40.0% (range, 9.1-83.3). Defibrillation by nondispatched lay first responders was associated with the highest survival with a median survival of 53.0% (range, 26.0-72.0), whereas defibrillation by EMDC-dispatched professional first responders (firefighters/police) was associated with a median survival of 28.6% (range, 9.0-76.0). A meta-analysis of the different survival outcomes could not be performed because of the large heterogeneity of the included studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed a median overall survival of 40% for patients with OHCA treated by PAD. Defibrillation by nondispatched lay first responders was found to correlate with the highest impact on survival in comparison with EMDC-dispatched professional first responders. PAD by EMDC-dispatched lay first responders could be a promising strategy, but evidence is lacking.

TI  - Association Between Body Weight Changes and Subsequent Development of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Population-Based Nested Case-Control Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Body weight is a modifiable demographic factor. Although the association of body mass index (BMI) categories with sudden cardiac death was reported, dynamic changes of BMI and the risk of cardiac arrest remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurrence within a year and the percent changes of BMI preceding the OHCA. Methods: This population-based nested case-control study used the National Health Insurance Service Data of Korea. In all, 24,465 patients with non-traumatic OHCA between 2010 and 2018, who underwent national health check-up twice (one within a year and the other within 2-4 years before OHCA) and 32,434 controls without OHCA, were matched for age and sex. The association between the risk of OHCA and BMI percent change stratified by sex was investigated. Results: All the BMI percent changes of >= 5% significantly increased the OHCA occurrence with a reverse J-shaped association. Compared to individuals with a stable weight, those with severe (> 15%) BMI decrease had the highest odds ratio (OR) of 4.29 (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 3.72-4.95) for OHCA occurrence followed by those with moderate (10-15%) weight loss (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.55-3.08) and those with severe (> 15%) weigh gain (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.96-2.57), respectively. The impact of weight loss on the cardiac arrest occurrence was more prominent in men, while the impact of weight gain was more prominent in women. Conclusion: Significant weight changes increase the risk of OHCA within a year with a reverse J-shaped association. Significant weight loss might be a warning sign for OHCA especially for men.

TI  - Culture and personal influences on cardiopulmonary resuscitation- results of international survey
T2  - BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Background: The ethical principle of justice demands that resources be distributed equally and based on evidence. Guidelines regarding forgoing of CPR are unavailable and there is large variance in the reported rates of attempted CPR in in-hospital cardiac arrest. The main objective of this work was to study whether local culture and physician preferences may affect spur-of-the-moment decisions in unexpected in-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Cross sectional questionnaire survey conducted among a convenience sample of physicians that likely comprise code team members in their country (Indonesia, Israel and Mexico). The questionnaire included details regarding respondent demographics and training, personal value judgments and preferences as well as professional experience regarding CPR and forgoing of resuscitation.
   Results: Of the 675 questionnaires distributed, 617 (91.4%) were completed and returned. Country of practice and level of knowledge about resuscitation were strongly associated with avoiding CPR performance. Mexican physicians were almost twicemore likely to forgo CPR than their Israeli and Indonesian/Malaysian counterparts [OR1.84 (95% CI 1.03, 3.26), p = 0.038]. Mexican responders also placed greater emphasison personal and patient quality of life (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, degree of religiosity was most strongly associated with willingness to forgo CPR; orthodox respondents were more than twice more likely to report having forgone CPR for apatient they do not know than secular and observant respondents, regardless of the country of practice [OR 2.12 (95%CI 1.30, 3.46), p = 0.003].
   Conclusions: In unexpected in-hospital cardiac arrest the decision to perform or withhold CPR may be affected by physician knowledge and local culture as well as personal preferences. Physician CPR training should include information regarding predictors of patient outcome at as well as emphasis on differentiating between patient and personal preferences in an emergency.

TI  - Successful Treatment and Transport of a Prolonged Cardiac Arrest from the Antarctic Continent with Full Neurological Recovery
T2  - WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - We describe full neurologic recovery from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a prolonged arrest time (35 min) and prehospital interval (12 h) from the Antarctic continent after the use of standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols and thrombolytic therapy. A 61-year-old male had a witnessed collapse in the dining facility at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, resulting in prompt activation of emergency services. The responding firefighter team found the patient in ventricular fibrillation and administered defibrillations. After the defibrillations, the responding team transported the patient to the base clinic. Clinic staff in the resuscitation bay achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after successful defibrillation and medication administration. The postarrest electrocardiogram (EKG) showed that an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction was the cause of the ventricular fibrillation. Clinic staff administered tenecteplase, and the patient was prepared for transport to New Zealand. The patient was transported aboard an LC-130 aircraft with a transport time of 7 h. The total time from cardiac arrest to arrival at the receiving hospital was 12 h. On arrival to definitive care, the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention revealing 100% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. The vessel was opened and 2 drug-eluting stents were placed. Remarkably, the patient survived the arrest completely neurologically intact. This case highlights the effectiveness of the current ACLS algorithms and chain of survival despite austere locales and long transport times.

TI  - Values clarification: Eliciting the values that inform and influence parents' treatment decisions for periviable birth
T2  - PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background Values clarification can assist families facing the threat of periviable delivery in navigating the complexity of competing values related to death, disability, and quality of life (QOL). Objective We piloted values clarification exercises to inform resuscitation decision making and qualitatively assess perceptions of QOL. Methods We conducted a mixed-method study of women with threatened periviable delivery (22 0/7-24 6/7 weeks) and their important others (IOs). Participants engaged in three values clarification activities as part of a semi-structured interview-(a) Card sorting nine conditions as an acceptable/unacceptable QOL for a child; (b) Rating/ranking seven common concerns in periviable decision making (scale 0-10, not at all to extremely important); and (c) "Agreed/disagreed" with six statements regarding end-of-life treatment, disability, and QOL. Participants were also asked to define "QOL" and describe their perceptions of a good and poor QOL for their child. Analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.4 and NVivo 12. Results All mild disabilities were an acceptable QOL, while two-thirds of participants considered long-term mechanical ventilation unacceptable. Although pregnant women rated "Impact on Your Physical/Mental Health" (average 5.6) and IOs rated "financial Concerns" the highest (average 6.6), both groups ranked "financial Concerns" as the most important concern (median 5.0 and 6.0, respectively). Most participants agreed that "Any amount of life is better than no life at all" (pregnant women 62.1%; IOs 75.0%) and disagreed that resuscitation would cause "Too much suffering" for their child (pregnant women 71.4%; IOs 80.0%). Half were familiar with the phrase "QOL". Although the majority described a good QOL in terms of emotional well-being (eg "loved", "happy", "supported"), a poor QOL was described in terms of functionality (eg "dependent" and "confined"). Additionally, financial stability emerged as a distinctive theme when IOs discussed poor QOL. Conclusion Our study offers important insights on parental perspectives in periviable decision making and potential values clarification tools for decision support.

TI  - Opioid-Associated Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Distinctive Clinical Features and Implications for Health Care and Public Responses: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans 25 to 64 years of age, and opioid use disorder affects >2 million Americans. The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered. Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with take-home naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose.

AB  - Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with an overall survival of less than 5%. Upon cardiac arrest, cessation of coronary blood flow rapidly leads to intense myocardial ischemia and activation of the sarcolemmal Na+-H+ exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1). NHE-1 activation drives Na+ into cardiomyocytes in exchange for H+ with its exchange rate intensified upon reperfusion during the resuscitation effort. Na+ accumulates in the cytosol driving Ca2+ entry through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, eventually causing cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and worsening myocardial injury by compromising mitochondrial bioenergetic function. We have reported clinically relevant myocardial effects elicited by NHE-1 inhibitors given during resuscitation in animal models of ventricular fibrillation (VF). These effects include: (a) preservation of left ventricular distensibility enabling hemodynamically more effective chest compressions, (b) return of cardiac activity with greater electrical stability reducing post-resuscitation episodes of VF, (c) less post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, and (d) attenuation of adverse myocardial effects of epinephrine; all contributing to improved survival in animal models. Mechanistically, NHE-1 inhibition reduces adverse effects stemming from Na+-driven cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. We believe the preclinical work herein discussed provides a persuasive rationale for examining the potential role of NHE-1 inhibitors for cardiac resuscitation in humans.

TI  - Anomalous Left Coronary Artery Connected to the Pulmonary Artery in a 15-Year-Old Girl: Case Report and Discussion on Secondary Prevention of Sudden Death
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background. Anomalous left coronary artery connected to the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease. Adaptive development of sufficient heterocoronary collaterality in the newborn may allow survival to a later age. In older children or adults, malignant ventricular arrhythmias can reveal the disease. Case Report. A 15-year-old girl was referred to the local hospital after a resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. CT scan and coronary angiography revealed an ALCAPA. Direct aortic reimplantation of the left coronary artery was performed. Postoperative ECG monitoring showed short episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI revealed subendocardial fibrosis of the anterolateral papillary muscle. Beta-blockade therapy was initiated at first intention. After hospital discharge, the patient reported several fainting without loss of consciousness. Considering sudden death nonrelated to effort, episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and areas of myocardial fibrosis, the patient underwent subcutaneous cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. 6-month follow-up is satisfactory without clinical or rhythmic abnormalities. Discussion. Indication for surgical correction of ALCAPA is well defined, but rhythmic secondary prevention after resuscitated cardiac arrest is less consensual. Cardiac MRI is an essential tool in the identification of a potential rhythmic substrate and should be taken into account in the discussion of a preventive cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.

TI  - Tenecteplase in Pulmonary Embolism Patients: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE).
   Methods: We completed the literature search on May 31, 2021 using PubMed, EMBASE and the Web of Science. Analyses were conducted according to PE risk stratification, study design and duration of follow-up. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) and its 95% confident intervals (CIs) for death and major bleeding were calculated using a random-effect model.
   Results: A total of six studies, with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two cohort studies, were included in this study out of the 160 studies retrieved. For patients with high-risk PE, tenecteplase increased 30-day survival rate (16% vs 6%; P = 0.005) and did not increase the incidence of bleeding (6% vs 5%; P = 0.73). For patients with intermediate-risk PE, four RCTs suggested that tenecteplase reduced right ventricular insufficiency at 24h early in the onset and the incidence of hemodynamic failure without affecting mortality in a short/long-term [< 30 days RR = 0.83, 95% CI (0.47, 1.46);>= 30 days RR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.88, 1.22)]. However, tenecteplase was associated with high bleeding risk [< 30 days RR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.61, 2.00); >= 30 days RR = 1.28, 95% CI (0.62, 2.64)].
   Conclusions: Tenecteplase may represent a promising candidate for patients with high risk PE. However, tenecteplase is not recommended for patients with intermediate-risk PE because of high bleeding risk. More large-scale studies focused on tenecteplase are still needed for PE patients.

TI  - Spectral Content of Electroencephalographic Burst-Suppression Patterns May Reflect Neuronal Recovery in Comatose Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: To assess the potential biologic significance of variations in burst-suppression patterns (BSPs) after cardiac arrest in relation to recovery of consciousness. In the context of recent theoretical models of BSP, bursting frequency may be representative of underlying network dynamics; discontinuous activation of membrane potential during impaired cellular energetics may promote neuronal rescue.
   Methods: We reviewed a database of 73 comatose post-cardiac arrest patients who underwent therapeutic hypothermia to assess for the presence of BSP and clinical outcomes. In a subsample of patients with BSP (n = 14), spectral content of burst and suppression periods were quantified using multitaper method.
   Results: Burst-suppression pattern was seen in 45/73 (61%) patients. Comparable numbers of patients with (31.1%) and without (35.7%) BSP regained consciousness by the time of hospital discharge. In addition, in two unique cases, BSP initially resolved and then spontaneously reemerged after completion of therapeutic hypothermia and cessation of sedative medications. Both patients recovered consciousness. Spectral analysis of bursts in all patients regaining consciousness (n = 6) showed a prominent theta frequency (5-7 Hz) feature, but not in agematched patients with induced BSP who did not recover consciousness (n = 8).
   Conclusions: The prognostic implications of BSP after hypoxic brain injury may vary based on the intrinsic properties of the underlying brain state itself. The presence of theta activity within bursts may index potential viability of neuronal networks underlying recovery of consciousness; emergence of spontaneous BSP in some cases may indicate an innate neuroprotective mechanism. This study highlights the need for better characterization of various BSP patterns after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Shock outcome prediction before and after CPR: A comparative study of manual and automated active compression-decompression CPR
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - We report on a study designed to compare the relative efficacy of manual CPR (M-CPR) and automated mechanical CPR (ACD-CPR) provided by an active compression-decompression (ACD) device. The ECG signals of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients of cardiac aetiology were analysed just prior to, and immediately after, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to assess the likelihood of successful defibrillation at these time points. The cardioversion outcome prediction (COP) measure previously developed by our group was used to quantify the probability of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after countershock and was used as a measure of the efficacy of CPR. An initial validation study using COP to predict shock outcome from the patient data set resulted in a performance of 60% specificity achieved at 100% sensitivity on a blind test of the data. This is comparable with previous studies and provided confidence in the robustness of the technique across hardware platforms. Significantly, the COP marker also displayed an ability to stratify according to outcomes: asystole, ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), normal sinus rhythm (NSR). We then used the validated COP marker to analyse the ECG data record just prior to and immediately after the chest compression segments. This was initially performed for 87 CPR segments where VF was both the pre- and post-CPR waveform. An increase in the mean COP values was found for both CPR types. A signed rank sum test found the increase due to manual CPR not to be significant (p > 0.05) whereas the automated CPR was found to be significant (p < 0.05). This increase was larger for the automated CPR (1.26, p = 0.024) than for the manual CPR (0.99, p = 0.124). These results indicate that the application of CPR does indeed provide beneficial. preparation of the heart prior to defibrillation therapy whether manual or automated CPR is applied. The COP marker shows promise as a definitive, quantitative determinant of the immediate positive effect of both types of CPR regardless of the details of use. In work of a more exploratory nature we then used the validated COP marker to analyse the ECG pre- and post-CPR for all rhythm types (212 traces). We show a significant increase in the COP measure (p < 0.001 in both cases) as indicated by a shift in the median COP marker distribution values. This increase was more pronounced for automated ACD-CPR than for manual CPR. However, a detailed statistical analysis carried out between the groups adjusted for pre-CPR value showed no significant difference between the two methods of CPR (p = 0.20). Similarly, adjusting for length of CPR showed no significant difference between the groups. Secondary, subgroup analysis of the ECG according to the length of time for which CPR was performed showed that both types of CPR led to an increase in the likelihood Of Successful defibrillation after increasing durations of CPR, however results were less reliable after longer periods of continuous CPR.

TI  - Harnessing electroacupuncture: a promising strategy against sleep deprivation-exacerbated post-cardiac arrest brain injury
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA)-induced post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) represents a critical contributor to global mortality and neurological disability. While sleep deprivation (SD) is recognized to aggravate neurological outcomes, its role in PCABI pathogenesis remains underexplored. This study investigated the mechanisms by which SD exacerbates PCABI and evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA). A CA model was established in SD rats, followed by RNA sequencing and molecular analyses to assess brain injury biomarkers, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling pathways. SD disrupted circadian rhythms, amplified neuronal apoptosis, and suppressed glutamate transporter Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2) expression post-CA, correlating with worsened cognitive deficits. EA treatment significantly attenuated these effects, restoring EAAT2 levels, mitigating calcium overload, and enhancing synaptic integrity. Mechanistically, EA modulated the EAAT2/calcium signaling axis and rebalanced autonomic nervous activity, thereby reducing oxidative stress and neuronal excitotoxicity. These findings identify EAAT2 downregulation as a key mediator of SD-aggravated PCABI and establish EA as a dual-target intervention that rectifies glutamatergic dysregulation and autonomic dysfunction. The study provides translational insights into EA's therapeutic potential for PCABI, particularly in populations with comorbid sleep disturbances.

TI  - Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients (ICECAP): study protocol for a multicenter, randomized, adaptive allocation clinical trial to identify the optimal duration of induced hypothermia for neuroprotection in comatose, adult survivors of after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background Cardiac arrest is a common and devastating emergency of both the heart and brain. More than 380,000 patients suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest annually in the USA. Induced cooling of comatose patients markedly improved neurological and functional outcomes in pivotal randomized clinical trials, but the optimal duration of therapeutic hypothermia has not yet been established. Methods This study is a multi-center randomized, response-adaptive, duration (dose) finding, comparative effectiveness clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. We investigate two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest to ascertain the shortest duration of cooling that provides the maximum treatment effect. The design is based on a statistical model of response as defined by the primary endpoint, a weighted 90-day mRS (modified Rankin Scale, a measure of neurologic disability), across the treatment arms. Subjects will initially be equally randomized between 12, 24, and 48 h of therapeutic cooling. After the first 200 subjects have been randomized, additional treatment arms between 12 and 48 h will be opened and patients will be allocated, within each initial cardiac rhythm type (shockable or non-shockable), by response adaptive randomization. As the trial continues, shorter and longer duration arms may be opened. A maximum sample size of 1800 subjects is proposed. Secondary objectives are to characterize: the overall safety and adverse events associated with duration of cooling, the effect on neuropsychological outcomes, and the effect on patient-reported quality of life measures. Discussion In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having a good outcome. If the treatment effect of cooling is increasing across duration, for at least some set of durations, then this provides evidence of the efficacy of cooling itself versus normothermia, even in the absence of a normothermia control arm, confirming previous RCTs for OHCA survivors of shockable rhythms and provides the first prospective controlled evidence of efficacy in those without initial shockable rhythms.

TI  - OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST - RACIAL-DIFFERENCES IN OUTCOME IN SEATTLE
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives. Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest is a key area in which to study the dual problem of the poorer health status of minority populations and their poorer access to the health care system. We proposed to examine the relationship between race (Black/White) and survival.
   Methods. We determined the incidence and outcome of cardiac arrests in Seattle for which medical assistance was requested.
   Results. Over a 26-month period, the age-adjusted incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was twice as great in Blacks than in Whites (3.4 vs 1.6 per 1000 aged 20 and over). The initial resuscitation rate was markedly poorer in the Black victims (17.1% vs 40.7%), and rates of survival to hospital discharge were also lower in Blacks (9.4% vs 17.1%). Both effective initial resuscitation and survival were significantly related to White race following adjustment for other covariates.
   Conclusion. The differences in outcomes were not fully explained by features of the collapse or relevant service factors. Possible explanations include delays in instituting therapy, less bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, poorer levels of health, and differences in the underlying cardiac disorders.

TI  - Comparison of end-of-life care in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer: A systematic review
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background:
   Palliative care has been widely implemented in clinical practice for patients with cancer but is not routinely provided to people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   Aim:
   The study aims were to compare palliative care services, medications, life-sustaining interventions, place of death, symptom burden and health-related quality of life among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer populations.
   Design:
   Systematic review with meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42019139425).
   Data sources:
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched for studies comparing palliative care, symptom burden or health-related quality of life among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer or populations with both conditions. Quality scores were assigned using the QualSyst tool.
   Results:
   Nineteen studies were included. There was significant heterogeneity in study design and sample size. A random effects meta-analysis (n = 3-7) determined that people with lung cancer had higher odds of receiving hospital (odds ratio: 9.95, 95% confidence interval: 6.37-15.55, p < 0.001) or home-based palliative care (8.79, 6.76-11.43, p < 0.001), opioids (4.76, 1.87-12.11, p = 0.001), sedatives (2.03, 1.78-2.32, p < 0.001) and dying at home (1.47, 1.14-1.89, p = 0.003) compared to people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People with lung cancer had lower odds of receiving invasive ventilation (0.26, 0.22-0.32, p < 0.001), non-invasive ventilation (0.63, 0.44-0.89, p = 0.009), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (0.29, 0.18-0.47, p < 0.001) or dying at a nursing home/long-term care facility (0.32, 0.16-0.64, p < 0.001) than people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Symptom burden and health-related quality of life were relatively similar between the two populations.
   Conclusion:
   People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receive less palliative measures at the end of life compared to people with lung cancer, despite a relatively similar symptom profile.

TI  - Goal directed fluid removal with furosemide versus placebo in intensive care patients with fluid overload: A trial protocol for a randomised, blinded trial (GODIF trial)
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background Fluid overload is a risk factor for mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Administration of loop diuretics is the predominant treatment of fluid overload, but evidence for its benefit is very uncertain when assessed in a systematic review of randomised clinical trials. The GODIF trial will assess the benefits and harms of goal directed fluid removal with furosemide versus placebo in ICU patients with fluid overload. Methods An investigator-initiated, international, randomised, stratified, blinded, parallel-group trial allocating 1000 adult ICU patients with fluid overload to infusion of furosemide versus placebo. The goal is to achieve a neutral fluid balance. The primary outcome is days alive and out of hospital 90 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at day 90 and 1-year after randomisation; days alive at day 90 without life support; number of participants with one or more serious adverse events or reactions; health-related quality of life and cognitive function at 1-year follow-up. A sample size of 1000 participants is required to detect an improvement of 8% in days alive and out of hospital 90 days after randomisation with a power of 90% and a risk of type 1 error of 5%. The conclusion of the trial will be based on the point estimate and 95% confidence interval; dichotomisation will not be used. identifier: NCT04180397. Perspective The GODIF trial will provide important evidence of possible benefits and harms of fluid removal with furosemide in adult ICU patients with fluid overload.

TI  - Usefulness of chloride levels for fluid resuscitation in patients undergoing targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Chloride is an important electrolyte in the body. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the associations between chloride levels on emergency department (ED) admission and neurologic outcomes by stratifying patients undergoing targeted temperature management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) into three groups (hyper/normo/hypochloremia); we also assessed the effect of changes in chloride levels from baseline over time on outcomes.
   Methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study of 346 patients was conducted between 2011 and 2019. The chloride levels were categorized as hypochloremia, normochloremia, and hyperchloremia by predetermined definitions. The primary endpoint was poor neurologic outcomes after hospital discharge. We evaluated the associations between chloride levels on ED admission and neurologic outcomes and assess the effect of changes in chloride levels over time on clinical outcomes.
   Results: On ED admission, compared with normochloremia, hypochloremia was significantly associated with unfavorable neurologic outcomes (OR, 2.668; 95% CI, 1.217-5.850, P = 0.014). Over time, unfavorable neurologic outcomes were significantly associated with increases in chloride levels in the hyperchloremia and normochloremia groups after ED admission. The rates of poor neurologic outcomes in the hyperchloremia and normochloremia groups were increased by 14.2% at Time-12, 20.1% at Time-24, and 9.3% at Time-48 with a 1-mEq/L increase in chloride levels.
   Conclusion: In clinical practice, chloride levels can be routinely and serially measured cost-effectively. Thus, baseline chloride levels may be a promising tool for rapid risk stratification of patients after OHCA. For fluid resuscitation after cardiac arrest, a chloride-restricted solution may be an early therapeutic strategy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - This prospective cohort study evaluated the impact of the time-related elements of the "chain of survival" on the quality of life of patients, taking their characteristics into account. Between 1995 and 2002, consecutive, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from Amsterdam and the surrounding areas were included in this study. A total of 227 patients (12%) survived to hospital discharge and 174 were definitive survivors who were available for assessment at 6 months. Quality of life was measured with the 136-item Sickness Impact Profile (SIP); cognitive functioning was assessed through the Mini Mental State Examination. SIP, profiles were compared with profiles of an open Dutch population of the elderly and patients who experienced a stroke. Time intervals of the chain of survival were calculated from the estimated moment of collapse and related to outcome using regression analysis. The SIP profile of survivors was a little above the reference profile, indicating a slightly poorer quality of life, and below the profile of patients after stroke, indicating a better quality of life. Impaired cognitive function was associated with delay in the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 19). Absence of the need for advanced cardiopulmonary life support was. associated with, better cognitive functioning (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1, to 0.9). Female gender and older age were associated with impaired physical functioning. Trends were found for better outcomes after early access, immediate resuscitation, early defibrillation, and early advanced care. (C) 2004 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

TI  - The Use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation-Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Prolonged Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Patients Is it Time to Expand It?
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted as an aid to in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) nearly 23 years ago, this led to remarkable improvement in survival considering the mortality rate associated with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Given this success, one begins to wonder whether the time has come for expanding the use of E-CPR to outside hospital cardiac arrests especially in the light of development of newer extracorporeal life support devices that are small, mobile, and easy to assemble. This editorial will review recent studies on this subject and address some key guidelines and limitations of this evolving and promising technology.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for a patient awaiting heart a case
T2  - EINSTEIN-SAO PAULO
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a method of cardiopulmonary resuscitation that uses extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation and has emerged as a promising intervention for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. This report describes the case of a 44-year-old man at significant risk for mortality according to his high RESCUE-IHCA Score who was awaiting heart transplantation and experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest during hemodialysis. Prompt recognition, immediate activation of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation team, and initiation of support within 60 minutes contributed to a favorable outcome. This case emphasizes important considerations associated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation implementation, including optimal patient selection, intervention timing, and nuances of cannulation procedures. Continuous monitoring, involvement of a specialized extracorporeal membrane oxygenation team, recognition of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as bridge therapy, and integration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with definitive treatment strategies are highlighted. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a vital intervention for patients with refractory cardiac arrest, and adequate patient selection and swift implementation are crucial to improving outcomes. A comprehensive review of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is also presented to highlight its efficacy and challenges associated with in-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of in-home automated external defibrillators for individuals at increased risk of sudden cardiac death - There's no place like home?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
CP  - 27th Annual Meeting of the Society-of-General-Internal-Medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: In-home automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly recommended as a means for improving survival of cardiac arrests that occur at home. The current study was conducted to explore the relationship between individuals' risk of cardiac arrest and cost-effectiveness of in-home AED deployment.
   DESIGN: Markov decision model employing a societal perspective.
   PATIENTS: Four hypothetical cohorts of American adults 60 years of age at progressively greater risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD): 1) all adults (annual probability of SCD 0.4%); 2) adults with multiple SCD risk factors (probability 2%); 3) adults with previous myocardial infarction (probability 4%); and 4) adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy unable to receive an implantable defibrillator (probability 6%).
   INTERVENTION: Strategy 1: individuals suffering an in-home cardiac arrest were treated with emergency medical services equipped with AEDs (EMS-D). Strategy 2: individuals suffering an in-home cardiac arrest received initial treatment with an in-home AED, followed by EMS.
   RESULTS: Assuming cardiac arrest survival rates of 15% with EMS-D and 30% with AEDs, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY) of providing in-home AEDs to all adults 60 years of age is $216,000. Costs of providing in-home AEDs to adults with multiple risk factors (2% probability of SCD), previous myocardial infarction (4% probability), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (6% probability) are $132,000, $104,000, and $88,000, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of in-home AEDs is intimately linked to individuals' risk of SCD. However, providing in-home AEDs to all adults over age 60 appears relatively expensive.

TI  - Cognitive function and health-related quality of life four years after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Neuropsychological testing has uncovered cognitive impairment in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic outcome according to the cerebral performance categories. We investigated cognitive function and health-related quality of life four years after cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Thirty cardiac arrest survivors over the age of 18 in cerebral performance category 1 or 2 on hospital discharge completed the EQ-5D-5L and HADS questionnaires prior to cognitive testing using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The results were compared with population norms.
   Results: Twenty-nine per cent of patients were cognitively impaired. The pattern of cognitive impairment reflects dysfunction in the medial temporal lobe, with impaired short-time memory and executive function slightly but distinctly affected. There was a significant reduction in quality of life on the EQ-VAS, but not on the EQ index.
   Conclusion: Cognitive impairment four years after cardiac arrest affected more than one quarter of the patients. Short-term memory was predominantly affected. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Functional outcomes following an in-hospital cardiac arrest: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - AUSTRALIAN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background/Purpose: Whilst much is known about the survival outcomes of patients that suffer an in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Australia very little is known about the functional outcomes of survivors. This study aimed to describe the functional outcomes of a cohort of patients that suffered an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and survived to hospital discharge in a regional Australian hospital.Methods: This is a single-centre retrospective observational cohort study conducted in a regional Australian hospital. All adult patients that had an IHCA in the study hospital between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2019 and survived to hospital discharge were included in the study. Functional outcomes were reported using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a six-point scale for which increasing scores represent increasing disability. Scores were assigned through a retrospective review of medical notes.Results: Overall, 102 adult patients had an IHCA during the study period, of whom 50 survived to hospital discharge. The median age of survivors was 68 years, and a third had a shockable initial arrest rhythm. Of survivors, 47 were able to be assigned both mRS scores. At discharge, 81% of patients achieved a favourable functional outcome (mRS 0-3 or equivalent function at discharge equal to admission).Conclusions: Most survivors to hospital discharge following an IHCA have a favourable functional outcome and are discharged home. Although these results are promising, larger studies across multiple hospitals are required to further inform what is known about functional outcomes in Australian IHCA survivors.(c) 2021 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

TI  - EFFECTS OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS ON POSTRESUSCITATION RENAL AND INTESTINAL INJURIES IN A PORCINE CARDIAC ARREST MODEL
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Objectives: Systemic ischemia-reperfusion triggered by cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation often causes postresuscitation multiple organ injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proven to be a promising treatment for regional renal and intestinal ischemia reperfusion injuries. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs on renal and intestinal injuries after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in a porcine CA model. Methods: Twenty-two male pigs were randomly assigned to the sham (n = 6), CA/CPR (n = 8), and CA/CPR + MSC (n = 8) groups. Mesenchymal stem cells were differentiated from human embryonic stem cells and then intravenously administered at a dose of 2.5 x 10(6)/kg at 1.5 and 3 d before the CA/CPR procedure. The experimental model was established by 8 min of untreated CA, followed by 8 min of CPR. Renal and intestinal injuries were evaluated based on the serum levels of creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and diamine oxidase at 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after resuscitation. At the end of the experiment, pathological damage was determined by cell apoptosis and ferroptosis in the renal and intestinal tissues. Results: During CPR, five pigs in the CA/CPR group and seven pigs in the CA/CPR + MSC group were successfully resuscitated. After resuscitation, the serum levels of creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and diamine oxidase were significantly increased in the CA/CPR and CA/CPR + MSC groups compared with those in the sham group. However, MSC administration significantly decreased the levels of renal and intestinal injury biomarkers compared with those in the CA/CPR group. Cell apoptosis and ferroptosis, which were indicated by the levels of apoptotic cells, iron deposition, lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and ferroptosis-related proteins, were observed in renal and intestinal tissues after resuscitation in the CA/CPR and CA/CPR + MSC groups. Nevertheless, both were significantly milder in the CA/CPR + MSC group than in the CA/CPR group. Conclusions: MSC administration was effective in alleviating postresuscitation renal and intestinal injuries possibly through inhibition of cell apoptosis and ferroptosis in a porcine CA model.

TI  - Ways of understanding cognitive impairment in cardiac arrest survivors: A phenomenographic study
T2  - INTENSIVE AND CRITICAL CARE NURSING
AB  - Aim: To describe the variation in ways that registered nurses perceive and understand cognitive impairment in cardiac arrest survivors.
   Design: A qualitative, inductive design with individual semi-structured interviews was applied. Data was analysed using a phenomenographic approach.
   Setting: The participants were nineteen Swedish registered nurses, experienced in cardiovascular care and providing follow-up care.
   Findings: The nurses perceived the cognitive impairment of the survivors in qualitatively different ways, as illustrated in two categories: 'The perceptible and obvious' and 'The elusive and challenging'. The nurses perceived a variety of signs of cognitive impairment, emotional expressions related to these, and recovery from cognitive impairment. They perceived confidence in capturing cognitive function when they understood the signs of cognitive impairment as severe and obvious. However, it was perceived as difficult to assess cognitive function when impairments were subtle, resulting in uncertainty in terms of how to make assessments. Nurses made use of their own strategies for assessments, which were sometimes found to be inadequate when they understood that they had misinterpreted the survivors' cognitive impairment.
   Conclusion: Nurses feel uncertainty regarding detecting mild impairment in cardiac arrest survivors. By involving next of kin, nurses will gain a broader understanding of survivors' cognitive function. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Early recovery of frontal EEG slow wave activity during propofol sedation predicts outcome after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: EEG slow wave activity (SWA) has shown prognostic potential in post-resuscitation care. In this prospective study, we investigated the accuracy of continuously measured early SWA for prediction of the outcome in comatose cardiac arrest (CA) survivors.
   Methods: We recorded EEG with a disposable self-adhesive frontal electrode and wireless device continuously starting from ICU admission until 48 h from return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in comatose CA survivors sedated with propofol. We determined SWA by offline calculation of C-Trend (R) Index describing SWA as a score ranging from 0 to 100. The functional outcome was defined based on Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at 6 months after the CA to either good (CPC 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5).
   Results: Outcome at six months was good in 67 of the 93 patients. During the first 12 h after ROSC, the median C-Trend Index value was 38.8 (interquartile range 28.0-56.1) in patients with good outcome and 6.49 (3.01-18.2) in those with poor outcome showing significant difference (p < 0.001) at every hour between the groups. The index values of the first 12h predicted poor outcome with an area under curve of 0.86 (95% CI0.61-0.99). With a cutoff value of 20, the sensitivity was 83.3% (69.6%-92.3%) and specificity 94.7% (83.4%-99.7%) for categorization of outcome.
   Conclusion: EEG SWA measured with C-Trend Index during propofol sedation offers a promising practical approach for early bedside evaluation of recovery of brain function and prediction of outcome after CA.

TI  - Long-term follow-up and amputation-free survival in 497 casualties with combat-related vascular injuries and damage-control resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - 42nd Annual Meeting of the Western-Trauma-Association
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of damage-control resuscitation (DCR) has been demonstrated in recent US conflicts. Wartime casualties treated for hemorrhagic shock from vascular wounds were studied to report the 24-hour transfusion requirements, graft patency, and amputation-free survival for major vascular injuries.
   METHODS: Joint Theater Trauma Registry data from August 2006 to April 2011 (56 months) were retrospectively reviewed. Included were casualties with a vascular injury who presented to US combat support hospitals in Iraq or Afghanistan. Amputation-free survival and graft patency were determined from record and imaging review.
   RESULTS: The study group consisted of 497 severely wounded local national and military casualties (mean [SD] Injury Severity Score [ISS], 17 [8.5]) presenting with acidosis (pH 7.29 [0.15]), tachycardia (heart rate, 110 [29.31]), and coagulopathy (international normalized ratio, 1.6 [2.33]). Given DCR and early management of vascular injury, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, hemoglobin, and base deficit improved promptly (p < 0.05) by intensive care unit admission. Transfusion requirements included packed red blood cells (15 [13] U; range, 1-70 U), fresh frozen plasma (14 [13] U; range, 1-72 U), cryoprecipitate (13 [15] U; range, 1-49 U), and platelets (8 [6] U; range, 1-36 U). Mean operative time was 232 minutes (range, 16-763 minutes). US casualties (n = 111) had limb salvage attempted for 113 extremity vascular injuries (3 [2%] iliac, 33 [30%] femoral, 23 [20%] popliteal, 13 [12%] tibial, 33 [30%] brachial, 4 [3%] ulnar, and 4 [(3%] radial). In this subgroup, 28 (25%) were revascularized by a primary repair or end anastomosis, 80 (71%) were revascularized by saphenovenous grafts, and 5 (4%) were revascularized by prosthetic grafts. The follow-up ranged from 29 days to 1,079 days, (mean, 347 days), during which 96 grafts (84.9%) remained patent, 16 casualties (14.2%) required a delayed amputation, and 110 (99.1%) survived. Popliteal injuries had the highest amputation rate (7 of 23, 30.4%). The amputation-free survival was 84%.
   CONCLUSION: In severely wounded casualties, wartime surgical strategies to save both life and limb evidently permit definitive procedures at initial surgery with excellent limb salvage results. This outcome analysis in a large cohort can help to refine surgical judgment and support contemporary DCR practices for major vascular injury. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2012;73: 1517-1524.

TI  - Development and validation of machine learning-based prediction model for outcome of cardiac arrest in intensive care units
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) poses a significant global health challenge and often results in poor prognosis. We developed an interpretable and applicable machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h. A total of 721 patients were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, divided into the training set (n = 576) and the internal validation set (n = 145). The external validation set containing 856 cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang Province. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms were utilized to establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost model exhibited the best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately selected as key features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a compact model. The final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in the internal validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation. SHAP summary plots and force plots visually explained the predicted outcomes. In conclusion, 72-h CatBoost showed promising performance in predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h. The model still requires further optimization and improvement.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic longitudinal studies of antibiotics administered via a permanent intraosseous device in micropigs
T2  - MEDICAL AND PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background. In critically ill children, intraosseous (IO) administration of a medicine provides an alternate Vascular access route when IV access is not readily available. We investigated the short and long-term efficacy and safety of a totally intraosseously implantable device. Procedure. This study was undertaken in micropigs (i) to compare serum levels achieved by equal bolus dosages of two antibiotics (amikacin and vancomycin) administered through an intratibial needle, an intraosseous implantable device and central IV routes to determine whether standard parenteral dosing guidelines for antibiotics may be applied without modification for IO injection, and (ii) to show the efficiency of the implantable device over a prolonged period, as a permanent access to intraosseous space. Results. The area under the plasma concentration time curves were similar for IV, intratibial and through the intraosseous implantable device, for intermittent administrations of amikacin and vancomycin, over a period of 6 months. However, vancomycin did not reach therapeutic levels via both IO routes. We did not find any alteration of amikacin and vancomycin pharmacokinetics over a period of 6 months using the implantable device. No complication occurred. Conclusions. Long-term administration of antibiotics through a totally implantable intraosseous device is feasible and safe in micropigs. Although the procedure seems promising, additional studies of the continuous infusion of chemotherapeutic agents, blood products and antimicrobial solutions are needed prior to use in humans, (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Therapeutic Potentials of an Artificial Oxygen-Carrier, Liposome-Encapsulated Hemoglobin, for Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Cerebral Dysfunction in Rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - We performed this study to elucidate whether a newly developed liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin, TRM-645 (TRM), can prevent cerebral dysfunction resulting from acute ischemic stroke when used as an oxygen carrier. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant path dentate gyrus synapses and anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus-maze test were evaluated as indices of cerebral functional outcomes in the rat with two-vessel occlusion (2VO), which was induced by 10-min clamping of bilateral common carotid arteries. Saline or TRM (hemoglobin concentration of 6 g/dl: 2.5 or 5 ml/kg) was administered via the tail vein immediately after ischemic insult. Hippocampal LTP formation was markedly impaired and the open arm durations in the elevated plus-maze decreased significantly 4 days after 2VO, compared to those of sham-operated (control) rats, suggesting the hippocampal synaptic dysfunction and anxio-genic properties in 2VO rats. TRM (5 ml/kg) restored the hippocampal LTP formation and normalized the anxiety-related behavior. TRM also improved the decreased tissue oxygen partial pressure in the 2VO rat hippocampus, possibly due to oxygen delivery to ischemic regions. Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin TRM might have therapeutic potentials for protecting the brain from neurological complications associated with acute ischemic stroke, as a promising blood substitute for oxygen therapy.

TI  - Depression and anxiety in relatives of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: Results of a prospective observational study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose: Relatives of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) may suffer from adverse psychological outcomes. We assessed prevalence and risk factors for depression and anxiety in such relatives 90 days after ICU admission.
   Materials and methods: This study included consecutive relatives of OHCA patients admitted to the ICU of University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. Relatives were interviewed upon admission regarding psychosocial risk factors and satisfaction with communication. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 90 days after inclusion.
   Results: Of 101 included relatives, 17% and 13% of relatives reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Witnessing cardiopulmonary resuscitation was associated with depression (gender- and age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.71; 95%CI 1.27 to 35.34; p = .025). Satisfaction with information and decision-making was associated with lower risk of depression (adjusted OR 0.95; 95%CI 0.91 to 0.99; p = .013). Unemployment (adjusted OR 10.42; 95%CI 1.18 to 92.35; p = .035) and lower perceived health status were associated with anxiety (adjusted OR 0.93; 95%CI 0.87 to 0.99; p = .025).
   Conclusions: Many relatives of OHCA patients report symptoms of depression and anxiety after 90 days. Improving initial care and communication may help to reduce these risks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-Term Stored Hemoglobin-Vesicles, a Cellular Type of Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carrier, Has Resuscitative Effects Comparable to That for Fresh Red Blood Cells in a Rat Model with Massive Hemorrhage without Post-Transfusion Lung Injury
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Hemoglobin-vesicles (HbV), encapsulating highly concentrated human hemoglobin in liposomes, were developed as a substitute for red blood cells (RBC) and their safety and efficacy in transfusion therapy has been confirmed in previous studies. Although HbV suspensions are structurally and physicochemically stabile for least 1-year at room temperature, based on in vitro experiments, the issue of whether the use of long-term stored HbV after a massive hemorrhage can be effective in resuscitations without adverse, post-transfusion effects remains to be clarified. We report herein on a comparison of the systemic response and the induction of organ injuries in hemorrhagic shock model rats resuscitated using 1-year-stored HbV, freshly packed RBC (PRBC-0) and by 28-day-stored packed RBC (PRBC-28). The six-hour mortality after resuscitation was not significantly different among the groups. Arterial blood pressure and blood gas parameters revealed that, using HbV, recovery from the shock state was comparable to that when PRBC-0 was used. Although no significant change was observed in serum parameters reflecting liver and kidney injuries at 6 hours after resuscitation among the three resuscitation groups, results based on Evans Blue and protein leakage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the lung wet/dry weight ratio and histopathological findings indicated that HbV as well as PRBC-0 was less predisposed to result in a post-transfusion lung injury than PRBC-28, as evidenced by low levels of myeloperoxidase accumulation and subsequent oxidative damage in the lung. The findings reported herein indicate that 1-year-stored HbV can effectively function as a resuscitative fluid without the induction of post-transfused lung injury and that it is comparable to fresh PRBC, suggesting that HbV is a promising RBC substitute with a long shelf-life.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to hanging: a retrospective analysis
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background There has been little research into the prehospital management of cardiac arrest following hanging despite it being among the most prevalent methods of suicide worldwide. The aim of this study was to report the characteristics, resuscitative treatment and outcomes of patients managed in the prehospital environment for cardiac arrest secondary to hanging and compare these with all-cause out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
   Methods Data from a UK ambulance service cardiac arrest registry were extracted for all cases in which treatment was provided for OHCA due to hanging between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2018. Cases were linked to outcome data obtained from the Trauma Audit and Research Network. Comparison of the cohort was made to previously published data from a UK study of all-cause OHCA with 95% Cls calculated for the proportional difference between the studies in selected presentation and outcome variables.
   Results 189 cases were identified. 95 patients were conveyed to hospital and four of these survived to discharge. 40 patients were conveyed despite absence of a spontaneous circulation and none of these patients survived. While only three patients were initially in a shockable rhythm, DC shocks were administered in 20 cases. There was one case of failed ventilation prompting front-of-neck access for oxygenation. By comparison with all-cause OHCA the proportion of patients with a spontaneous circulation at hospital handover was similar (27.0% vs 27.5%; 0.5% difference, 95% CI -5.9% to 6.8%, p=0.882) but survival to hospital discharge was significantly lower (2.2% vs 8.4%; 6.2% difference, 95% CI 4.1% to 8.3%, p=0.002).
   Conclusion Clinical outcomes following OHCA due to hanging are poor, particularly when patients are transported while in cardiac arrest. Failure to ventilate was uncommon, and clinicians should be alert to the possibility of shockable rhythms developing during resuscitation.

TI  - Selenium prevents microparticle-induced endothelial inflammation in patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Microparticles are elevated in patients after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and may play a role in the development of endothelial dysfunction seen in post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), a life threatening disease with high mortality. To identify mechanisms of endothelial activation and to develop novel approaches in the therapy of PCAS, the impact of selenium, a trace element with antioxidative properties, was characterized in endothelial dysfunction induced by microparticles of resuscitated patients. Additionally, course of plasma selenium levels was characterized in the first 72 hours post-CPR.
   Methods: Endothelial cells were exposed to microparticles isolated of the peripheral blood of resuscitated patients, and leukocyte-endothelial interaction was measured by dynamic adhesion assay. Expression of adhesion molecules was assessed by immunoblotting and flow chamber. Blood samples were drawn 24, 48 and 72 hours after CPR for determination of plasma selenium levels in 77 resuscitated patients; these were compared to 50 healthy subjects and 50 patients with stable cardiac disease and correlated with severity of illness and outcome.
   Results: Microparticles of resuscitated patients enhance monocyte-endothelial interaction by up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Selenium administration diminished ICAM-1 and VCAM-1-mediated monocyte adhesion induced by microparticles of resuscitated patients, suggesting that selenium has anti-inflammatory effects after CPR. Lowered selenium plasma levels were observed in resuscitated patients compared to controls and selenium levels immediately and 24 hours after CPR, inversely correlated with clinical course and outcome after resuscitation.
   Conclusions: Endothelial dysfunction is a pivotal feature of PCAS and is partly driven by microparticles of resuscitated patients. Administration of selenium exerted anti-inflammatory effects and prevented microparticle-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Decline of selenium was observed in plasma of patients after CPR and is a novel predictive marker of ICU mortality, suggesting selenium consumption promotes inflammation in PCAS.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest Care on United States Golf Courses-Up to Par Yet?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS OPEN
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue with a <10% survival rate. Although exercise is beneficial for cardiovascular health, it is also associated with increased risk of OHCA during and immediately after exertion. Golf courses present the fifth most frequent location for OHCA in public settings. Bystander interventions, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) use, are crucial for improving survival rates. Despite recommendations from organizations like the Professional Golfers' Association of America recommending AEDs at golfing facilities, AED availability and utilization on golf courses prior to Emergency Medical Services arrival remain unknown. Objectives: This investigation aimed to determine the incidence of OHCA on golf courses and to examine patient demographics, event and golf course characteristics, and their association with bystander CPR provision, AED use, and survival outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study utilized data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival from 2020 to 2023. Addresses of cardiac arrests in recreational facilities were spatially linked to a comprehensive list of golf course addresses using ArcGIS. Cases identified as occurring in a recreational location, within 400 m of both the incident address and a nearby golf course, were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the frequency of bystander interventions for either CPR or AED use. Secondary outcomes included survival to hospital admission and discharge, and a favorable neurologic outcome (cerebral performance category 1 or 2). Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were employed to examine patient demographics, golf course characteristics, bystander interventions, and patient outcomes. Multi-variable regression analysis was also used to assess these associations. Results: A total of 476 OHCA cases were identified on golf courses during the study period. The patients were predominantly male (91.4%, n = 435) and White (85.1%, n = 330), with a mean age of 64.6 (SD 15.5). Most patients (61.8%) had an initial shockable rhythm. Distribution of cases was not different by course geographic region, course size, or public vs private course. Overall survival to discharge was 30.5% (n = 145), with almost all survivors (97.2%, n = 141) having a good neurologic outcome. For patients with Utstein characteristics (witnessed, shockable rhythm) and who had an AED placed, survival to discharge was 63.8%. AED use was associated with significantly increased survival to hospital discharge (37.9% vs 18.7% ORadj 1.9 (95% CI, 1.1, 3.3, P <.05), with AEDs being used more frequently on private courses (32.1% vs 19.7%, P = .003). Conclusion: Patients experiencing OHCA on golf courses frequently receive bystander interventions, including both CPR and AED use. OHCA patients on golf courses had high survival rates and excellent neurologic outcomes. This study underscores the benefit of, and critical need for, initiatives promoting CPR and AED resources, as well as comprehensive CPR training and rapid response protocols at golf courses

TI  - Effect of Audiovisual Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Feedback Device on Improving Chest Compression Quality
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The one month survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the paediatric population remains low. Improving survival in paediatric OHCA by enhancing the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is important. In this study, we aimed to analyse the factors associated with CPR quality by using a real-time feedback device. Participants were prospectively divided into 4 groups: paediatric research fellows, paediatric residents, medical students (clerks), and paediatric critical care nurses. Then, the participants were asked to perform 5 cycles of CPR on a paediatric simulation manikin without prompts from feedback devices, and to repeat another 5 cycles of CPR after education with the 2015 paediatric advanced life support guidelines. A total of 75 participants were evaluated. In the overall analysis, an improvement in the percentage of participants meeting the target compression rate was observed (from 49.82% to 71.23%, P < 0.001). The percentage of participants achieving the target compression depth improved from 73.77% to 85.63% (P = 0.005). Among the 4 groups, the residents showed the most significant improvement in both compression rate (from 48.41% to 86.57%, P < 0.001) and compression depth (from 63.50% to 95.57%, P < 0.001). Inappropriate rate was a more important factor resulting in inadequate CPR performance than inappropriate depth. An excessive compression rate was also a common problem. In conclusions, the real-time CPR feedback device may help clinical physicians and nurses in improving the quality of chest compression. Excessive CPR compression rate may be a major cause of inadequate CPR performance.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Revolutionizing Resuscitation Through Precision and Prediction-A Narrative Review
T2  - VASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remains a fundamental intervention in the management of cardiac arrest, with timely initiation and optimal performance serving as critical determinants of survival and neurological recovery. In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the effectiveness of CPR by delivering realtime feedback, supporting clinical decision-making, and enabling individualized resuscitation strategies. This narrative review summarizes the current applications of AI in CPR, including rhythm interpretation, quality monitoring, and post-resuscitation care. In addition, it discusses major challenges related to data privacy, system interoperability, algorithmic fairness, and ethical governance. Future directions emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous model validation, and structured training for clinical users. Although additional validation is required, the integration of AI into resuscitation practices holds significant promise for enhancing patient outcomes and potentially reducing mortality associated with sudden cardiac arrest.

TI  - Early neurologically focused follow-up after cardiac arrest is cost-effective: A trial-based economic evaluation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention service for cardiac arrest survivors called 'Stand still..., and move on' from a societal perspective.
   Intervention: This concise nursing intervention consists of screening for cognitive and emotional problems, information provision and support, self-management promotion, and further referral if necessary. Earlier research confirmed the feasibility of the intervention and its effectiveness in improving emotional functioning and quality of life.
   Methods: In this multicentre randomized controlled trial with one year follow-up 185 patients were included between April 2007 and December 2010. The experimental group received the intervention, the control group received care-as-usual. Intervention costs, other direct healthcare costs (e.g. hospital care, rehabilitation, medication, home care) and indirect costs (productivity loss) were measured during ten months using monthly cost-diaries. The economic evaluation comprised a cost-utility analysis (SF-36) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (QOLIBRI) using bootstrapping (5000 replications) to quantify uncertainty concerning the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was estimated. To check the robustness of the findings, two sensitivity analyses were performed using the EQ-5D and the complete cases respectively.
   Results: Of 136 (74%) participants sufficient data concerning costs were collected to be included in this economic evaluation. Intervention costs were on average (sic) 127 (SD 85). No significant differences between groups were found with regard to overall costs. The ICERs of the cost-utility and the cost-effectiveness analyses supported the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 54-76% for the SF-36 and 94% for the QOLIBRI. Findings were robust.
   Conclusion: The intervention 'Stand still..., and move on' has positive societal economic effects and has a high probability to be cost-effective. Implementation in regular healthcare is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Systematic Review/Meta-analysis Mediators of the Association Between Socioeconomic Status and Survival After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Systematic Review
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with poor outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Patient characteristics, care processes, and other contextual factors may mediate the association between SES and survival after OHCA. Interventions that target these mediating factors may reduce disparities in OHCA outcomes across the socioeconomic spectrum. This systematic review identi fi ed and quanti fi ed mediators of the SES - survival after OHCA association. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science) and grey literature sources were searched from inception to July or August 2023. Observational studies of OHCA patients that conducted mediation analyses to evaluate potential mediators of the association between SES (de fi ned by income, education, occupation, or a composite index) and survival outcomes were included. A total of 10 studies were included in this review. Income (n = 9), education (n = 4), occupation (n = 1), and composite indices (n = 1) were used to de fi ne SES. The proportion of OHCA cases that had bystander involvement, presented with an initial shockable rhythm, and survived to hospital discharge or 30 days increased with higher SES. Common mediators of the SES-survival association that were evaluated included initial rhythm (n = 6), emergency medical services response time (n = 5), and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n = 4). Initial rhythm was the most important mediator of this association, with a median percent excess risk explained of 37.4% (range 28.6%-40.0%; n = 5; 1 study reported no mediation) and mediation proportion of 41.8% (n = 1). To mitigate socioeconomic disparities in outcomes after OHCA, interventions should target potentially modi fi able mediators, such as initial rhythm, which may involve improving bystander awareness of OHCA and the need for prompt resuscitation.

TI  - Rationale and methods of the Advanced R2Eperfusion STrategies for Refractory Cardiac Arrest (ARREST) trial
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has emerged as a prominent therapy for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. However, the optimal time of initiation remains unknown.
   Aim The aim was to assess the rate of survival to hospital discharge in adult patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with 1 of 2 local standards of care: (1) early venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-facilitated resuscitation for circulatory support and percutaneous coronary intervention, when needed, or (2) standard advanced cardiac life support resuscitation.
   Design Phase II, single-center, partially blinded, prospective, intention-to-treat, safety and efficacy clinical trial.
   Population Adults (aged 18-75), initial out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia, no ROSC following 3 shocks, body morphology to accommodate a Lund University Cardiac Arrest System automated cardiopulmonary resuscitation device, and transfer time of <30 minutes.
   Setting Hospital-based.
   Outcomes Primary: survival to hospital discharge. Secondary: safety, survival, and functional assessment at hospital discharge and 3 and 6 months, and cost.
   Sample size Assuming success rates of 12% versus 37% in the 2 arms and 90% power, a type 1 error rate of .05, and a 15% rate of withdrawal prior to hospital discharge, the required sample size is N = 174 evaluated patients.
   Conclusions The ARREST trial will generate safety/effectiveness data and comparative costs associated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, informing broader implementation and a definitive Phase III clinical trial.

TI  - Mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest - A nationwide survey on the implementation of the ILCOR guidelines in German intensive care units
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To investigate the implementation of mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) after cardiac arrest into clinical practice.
   Methods and results: A structured evaluation questionnaire was sent to all German hospitals registered to have ICUs; 58% completed the survey. A total of 93 ICUs (24%) reported to use MTH. Of those, 93% started MTH in patients after out-of-hospital resuscitation with observed ventricular fibrillation and 72% when other initial rhythms were observed. Only a minority of ICUs initiate MTH in patients after cardiac arrest with cardiogenic shock (28%), whereas 48% regarded cardiogenic shock as a contra-indication for MTH. On average, target temperature was 33.1 +/- 0.6 degrees C and duration of cooling 22.9 +/- 4.9h. Many centres used economically priced cold packs (82%) and cold infusions (80%) for cooling. The majority of the ICUs considered infection, hypotension and bleeding as relevant complications of hypothermia which was of therapeutic relevance in less than 25% of the cases.
   Conclusions: MTH is underused in German ICUs. Centres which use MTH widely follow the recommendations of ILCOR with respect to the indication and timing of cooling. In hospitals that use MTH the technique is considered to be safe and inexpensive. More efforts are needed to promote this therapeutic option and hypothermia since MTH has now been included into European advanced cardiovascular life support protocols. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Cognitive problems in patients in a cardiac rehabilitation program after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: Estimate prevalence of cognitive problems due to hypoxic brain injury in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors referred for cardiac rehabilitation and association with quality of life as well as autonomy and participation.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Method/design: Consecutive OHCA patients. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were administered 4 weeks after the OHCA. Cognitive problems were defined if MMSE <28, CFQ >32 or IQCODE >3.6. The Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ) (participation/autonomy), the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) (quality of life) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety/depression) were administered. Correlations between cognitive problems and participation/autonomy and quality of life were calculated.
   Results: 63 of 77 patients were male (82%), median age 59 years (range 15-84). MMSE median 29 (interquartile range 28-30), CFQ mean 20.9 (SD 9.4) and IQCODE mean 3.1 (SD 0.2). Eighteen patients (23%) scored positive for cognitive problems. Significant correlations were found between MMSE and IPAQ: autonomy inside (r = -0.38), family role (r = -0.26), autonomy outside (r = -0.32), social relations (r = -0.38) and social functioning (r = 0.32). MMSE was related to SF-36: social functioning (r = 0.32). The CFQ was related to IPAQ: autonomy outdoors (r = 0.29) and SF-36: bodily pain (r = -0.37), vitality (r = -0.25), mental health (r = -0.35) and role emotional (r = -0.40). The IQCODE was related to IPAQ: autonomy indoors (r = 0.26) and to SF-36: vitality (r = -0.33) and social functioning (r = -0.41).
   Conclusion: Twenty-three percent of the patients referred for cardiac rehabilitation showed cognitive problems. Associations were found between cognitive problems and several aspects of participation/autonomy and perceived quality of life. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - "Shrink back is not my intention": a qualitative exploration of Chinese security guards' experiences with bystander CPR
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health burden worldwide. Promoting bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (B-CPR) is a key element in improving the survival rate of OHCA. The security guard is a specific population in China that plays a significant role as bystanders in public settings. However, less is known about their experiences regarding B-CPR intention and performance. This study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of Chinese security guards regarding B-CPR and identify barriers to its performance.MethodsFifteen in-depth interviews were conducted with security guards in various public settings, including hospitals, residential living areas, office buildings, and public transportation stations. All interviews were audio recorded. Two researchers independently analyzed the transcripts through deductive and inductive content analysis. Informed by the "Intention-focused" model of B-CPR performance, deductive content analysis was initially performed to identify categories that align with the theoretical framework and thereby validate the theory. Subsequently, inductive content analysis was applied to code newly discovered content, therefore enriching the theory.ResultsAn "intention & performance-focused" model of B-CPR was developed. It was revealed that security personnel were more inclined to perform CPR without hesitation when the victim was a trusted individual. However, when faced with unfamiliar individuals, they tended to shrink back due to various barriers. Specifically, four layers of barriers to CPR performance were identified, encompassing security personnel factors, victim-related factors, organizational factors, and societal factors. Participants also shared their perspectives on the desired CPR training, including trainers, training contents, training formats, and training incentives.ConclusionSecurity guards should receive comprehensive CPR training to maximize their occupational value. In addition to strengthening CPR-related training, which includes theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice, psychological coping skills for managing overwhelming emotions and understanding relevant laws are also essential training elements that cannot be overlooked. When developing relevant intervention strategies, policies, and regulations, it's critical to consider the country's context and the cooperation of the organization where the security guard is employed. The model developed in this study can provide a reference for designing interventions and policy to improve the B-CPR intention and performance for other specific groups.

TI  - Human-Centered Design of Cadre: A Digital Platform to Support Cardiac Arrest (Co-) Survivorship
T2  - HCI INTERNATIONAL 2024 POSTERS, PT VI, HCII 2024
CP  - 26th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII)
AB  - Life after sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) encompasses multifaceted challenges pertaining to the psychological, financial, lifestyle, and cognitive aspects of both the survivor and their family's recovery. Current health services do not address their complex and evolving needs once they return home, leaving them to navigate (co-)survivorship on their own with limited support. In this study, we describe the process of developing user-centered requirements for a digital healthcare intervention, called Cadre. The goals were to address the limitations of equitably providing services and support to cardiac arrest survivors. In Phase I, user journey mapping and Scenario-Based Design methods, supported by Actor-Network Theory, were used to analyze focus group interview data and develop user personas and problem scenarios. Phase II involved the ideation of application features for Cadre. Phase I results include the emergence of a new theme - every cardiac arrest survivor experience is unique - and the creation of personas and scenarios that reflect this theme. The identified needs (validation, guidance, and lack of emotional support) were translated into a vision for Cadre that will be evaluated via iterative prototype development and usability testing in the future. This project addresses a critical opportunity in the field of SCA survivorship as it not only advances the design of a comprehensive support solution for survivors and their families but also represents a crucial move toward equitable post-discharge care for all.

TI  - Associations among gender, marital status, and outcomes of adult in-hospital cardiac arrest: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To analyse the association between gender and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and the influences of age and marital status on the gender-based difference in clinical outcome.
   Methods: This retrospective observational study conducted in a single medical centre evaluated patients who had experienced IHCA from 2006 to 2014. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study associations between independent variables and outcomes. Patients 18-49 years old were considered of reproductive age. The presence or absence of a legitimate spouse was retrieved from the family pedigree presented in the medical records. Reproductive age and marital status were each analysed as an interaction term with gender.
   Results: A total of 1524 patients, of which 598 were women (39.2%), were included in this study. There were 269 patients (17.7%) of reproductive age and 490 patients (32.2%) without a living spouse. Only 215 patients (14.1%) survived to hospital discharge. Among these, 110 patients (7.2%) demonstrated a favourable neurological status. Our analysis indicated that being female was inversely associated with a favourable neurological outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.87; p = 0.02). Being female without a living spouse was inversely associated with a favourable neurological outcome (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.17-0.96; p = 0.05). Neither female nor female-associated interaction terms were significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge.
   Conclusion: Female patients with IHCA had worse neurological outcomes than their male counterparts, especially for women without a living spouse. However, survival outcome did not differ between genders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Toxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine following therapeutic use or overdose
T2  - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: While chloroquine, a derivative of quinine, has been used as an antimalarial for 70 years, hydroxychloroquine is now used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In 2020, hydroxychloroquine (and to a lesser extent chloroquine) also received attention as a possible treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During investigation for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, concerns for serious adverse events arose.
   Objective: We review the toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine use both short-term and long-term and in overdose.
   Methods: Medline (viaOVID) was searched from its inception through June 7 2020 using the following as either MeSH or keyword terms: ("Chloroquine/" or "Hydroxychloroquine/") AND ("Adverse Drug Event/" or "Toxicities, Drug/" or "Toxic.mp." or "Toxicity.mp." or "Overdose.mp."). We limited resultant articles to those published in English and reporting on Human subjects. This search yielded 330 articles, of which 57 were included. Articles were excluded due to lack of relevance, not reporting desired outcomes, or being duplicative in their content. Twenty-five additional articles were identified through screening references of included articles. To identify toxicities in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with COVID-19, we searched PubMed on June 10th, 2020: ("Chloroquine" or "Hydroxychloroquine") AND ("Coronavirus" or "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2"). This search resulted in 638 articles. We reviewed articles for reporting of adverse events or toxicities. Most citations were excluded because they did not include original investigations or extrapolated data from subjects that did not have COVID-19; 34 citations were relevant. For the drug-interactions section, relevant classes and agents were identified through a screen of thewebsite. We then conducted targeted searches of PubMed up to June 7th 2020 combining "chloroquine" and "hydroxychloroquine" with terms for specific drug classes and drugs identified from the drug-interaction site as potentially relevant. We found 29 relevant articles.
   Toxicity with short-term use: Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common to occur following initiation of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea account for most reported intolerances.Glucose abnormalities: Alterations in blood glucose concentrations may occur with hydroxychloroquine but are rare with standard therapeutic use.Cardiotoxicity: Short-term use can produce conduction abnormalities. Evidence from COVID-19 treatment suggests QT/QTc prolongation is of concern, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin, although disagreement exists across studies.Dermatologic: Drug eruptions or rashes, followed by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pruritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may occur within days to weeks of exposure but usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy.Neuropsychiatric: Reported symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and hallucination within 24-48 h of drug initiation.Other toxicities:Hemolysis and anemia may occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 was associated with elevation in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB activities with more events in the higher-dose group.
   Toxicity with long-term use: Retinopathy: Retinopathy is the major dose-limiting toxicity associated with long-term use; the risk is higher with increasing age, dose, and duration of usage.Cardiotoxicity: Long-term use has been associated with conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disorders.Neurotoxicity: Rarely myositis and muscle weakness, extremity weakness, and pseudoparkinsonism have been reported. Toxicity in overdose Symptoms in overdose manifest rapidly (minutes to hours) and cardiotoxicity such as cardiovascular shock and collapse are most prominent. Neurotoxic effects such as psychosis and seizure may also occur.
   Conclusions: Hydroxychloroquine is a generally well-tolerated medication. Short-term (days to weeks) toxicity includes gastrointestinal effects and rarely glucose abnormalities, dermatologic reactions, and neuropsychiatric events. Cardiotoxicity became of increased concern with its use in COVID-19 patients. Long-term (years) toxicities include retinopathy, neuromyotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy). Deaths from overdoses most often result from cardiovascular collapse.

TI  - Barriers for Responding to Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest During Emergency Medical Calls: A Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid recognition of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) is a critical component to prompt initiation of bystander interventions. We aimed to investigate barriers for responding to POHCA during emergency medical calls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all POHCA calls (aged 0-18 years) from the emergency dispatch center in the Capital Region of Denmark between 2018 and 2021 and excluded POHCAs with no resuscitation order, found dead, where trained health professionals were on site, or where there was no possibility for initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A qualitative analysis was undertaken. POHCA calls were divided according to the speed of telecommunicator-recognition into 3 groups: POHCA recognition within 90 seconds (group 1), POHCAs recognition >90 seconds (group 2), and POHCAs recognized by the emergency medical services at ambulance arrival (group 3). A total of 20 calls were included. We identified 3 major barriers to telecommunicator recognition of POHCA. First, prolonged conversations between callers and telecommunicators focusing on the cause of the child's condition rather than adherence to the assessment of consciousness and breathing. Second, challenges in assessing breathing such as cases where the child had agonal or unregular breathing or gasping breaths. Finally, callers who were unable to communicate or follow instructions from the telecommunicator. CONCLUSIONS: Telecommunicator recognition of POHCA is challenged by factors such as prolonged conversations focusing on causes rather than initiating bystander interventions, barriers in assessing breathing, as well as callers' abilities to partake in communication with telecommunicators. Efforts to address these barriers in current dispatch protocols may improve recognition of POHCA.

TI  - Medical Optimization and Liberation of Adult Patients From VA-ECMO
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) can be an efficacious cardiopulmonary support for adults as rescue from refractory cardiogenic shock. It is best employed as a bridging strategy to recovery or alternative support rather than sustained, long-term mechanical circulatory support. The purpose of this paper is to discuss strategies to optimize patient management on VA-ECMO and approaches to promote successful separation from support. Rapid medical optimization will assist in reducing the time on VA-ECMO, thereby improving the likelihood of patient salvage. Suitably trained physicians and personnel, guided by structured protocols, can promote excellence in team care and provision of consistent management. Focusing on anticoagulation, careful neurologic monitoring, prevention of leg ischemia, awareness of differential hypoxemia, optimizing mechanical ventilation, identifying and timely intervention for left-ventricular distension (LVD), along with a strategic weaning algorithm, can prevent significant morbidity and mortality. LVD physiology, diagnosis, and risk factors are reviewed. Indications for LV decompression, along with medical and mechanical management options, are elucidated.

TI  - Briefer activation time is associated with better outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) requires prompt intervention. Better outcomes are associated with briefer time from dispatch of emergency medical services (EMS) providers to arrival on scene, application of a defibrillator or insertion of an advanced airway. We assessed whether time from receipt of a call by a telecommunicator to dispatch of EMS providers was associated with outcomes.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of persons who had OHCA treated by EMS providers in Seattle, WA. Activation interval was defined as time from call pick up by telecommunicator to notification of EMS providers to respond to the call. Response interval was defined as the time from notification of EMS providers to their arrival at patient side. We determined the association between time intervals and outcomes of sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge and neurologically favorable survival using multiple logistic regression. Secondary analyses assessed the relative contribution of activation versus response interval, and adjusted for post-treatment patient and EMS characteristics.
   Results: Among 2,687 patients, activation interval was mean 1.2 +/- 0.6 min. Response interval was mean 6.1 +/- 2.4 min. 1,232 (45.9%) achieved ROSC; 475 (17.7%) survived to discharge; and 428 (15.9%) had favorable neurologic status at discharge. Compared to an activation interval of at least 1.5 min, patients with briefer intervals were more likely to survive to discharge (adjusted odds ratio (OR) for <1 min, 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26, 2.28); adjusted odds ratio for 1 to 1.49 min, 1.54 (95% CI, 1.14, 2.08); p value = 0.002). With baseline survival of 10%, the absolute increase in survival associated with a 30s decrease in activation interval was 0.7% and for a 30 s decrease in response interval was 0.4%.
   Conclusions: Briefer activation interval was independently associated with greater survival. Further research is needed to assess whether reduction of the activation interval improves outcome after OHCA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION - HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES, PHYSIOLOGY, AND FUTURE-DIRECTIONS
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose: To review the historical evolution and rationale for the development
   Data Sources: English-language studies published after 1960 were identified by computer and manual search using MEDLINE and Index Medicus. Historical references were obtained through a HISTLINE search. Additional information was acquired from personal files and bibliographies of existing literature.
   Study Selection: Critical review with emphasis on study size, methods, and reproducibility of results.
   Results: Survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest and institution of CPR is approximately 10% to 15%. Investigation of the physiology of blood flow during CPR has led to the conclusion that flow may occur because of direct cardiac compression or thoracic pump forces. Based on these observations, several new techniques of CPR have been introduced. Interposed abdominal compression, pneumatic vest, and active compression-decompression resuscitation have been shown to improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in animal models and humans after cardiac arrest. Only interposed abdominal compression CPR has been shown to improve longterm survival in human subjects after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Although these techniques have shown promising results in animal studies and a limited number of clinical trials, none has gained widespread use.
   Conclusions: Improved methods of CPR are now available. Selective use of CPR in the hospital and community training in the use of these new adjunctive techniques should have the greatest impact on improved survival after sudden cardiac arrest.

TI  - Emergency call processing and survival from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
CP  - 7th Congress of the European-Resuscitation-Council
AB  - Objectives: Our aim was to report the effect of the emergency call processing in the dispatching centre on survival from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF).
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Helsinki Emergency Medical Services. All consecutive cases with out-of-hospital bystander witnessed VF of cardiac origin between I January 1997 and 31 December 2002 were included. Data were collected prospectively. Call processing times, call numbers per dispatcher and telephone guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were studied. Discharge alive from hospital was used as primary end point.
   Results: The study population consisted of 373 cases. Cardiac arrest (CA) was recognised in 296 cases (79.4%) by the dispatcher. Survival to discharge was 37.2% (110/296) if CA was recognised and 28.6% (22/77) if it was not recognised (p = 0.1550). When the dispatcher handled < 4 VF calls during the Study period survival to discharge was 22.1% (17/77) compared to 38.2% (50/131) and 39.4% (65/165) when the call volume was 4-9 or > 9 (p = 0.0227). The mean time to dispatch a first responding unit (FRU) was 77.1 +/- 44.3 s. Survival to discharge was 39.4% (65/165) when the FRU dispatching time was < 60 s and 32.2% (67/208) when dispatching took >= 60 s (p = 0.1496). The mean time to CA recognition was 170.2 +/- 130.1 s. Spontaneous circulation was achieved more rapidly when the time was < 150 s (p = 0.0426), but there was no difference in survival to discharge. Telephone guided CPR instructions were given in 123 cases (35.5%). Survival to discharge was 43.1% (53/123) when CPR instructions were given and 31.7% (72/223) when they were not given (p = 0.0453).
   Conclusions: We showed that low CA call numbers per dispatcher is associated with a decreased probability of survival. Giving telephone guided CPR instructions should be promoted as they influence the outcome. Further studies are needed to determine optimal call processing times. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Causes of cardiopulmonary arrest, resuscitation management, and functional outcome in dogs and cats surviving cardiopulmonary arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Objective: To describe the functional outcome of canine and feline survivors of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and the clinical characteristics surrounding their resuscitation.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Veterinary teaching hospital.
   Animals: Client-owned dogs (15) and cats (3) with CPA.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and main results: Eighteen animals were identified to have survived to discharge following CPA. Cardiopulmonary arrest was associated with anesthesia with or without preexisting disease in 10 animals, cardiovascular collapse in 5 animals, and chronic disease with an imposed stress in 3 animals. All CPAs were witnessed in the hospital. The most common initial rhythm at CPA was asystole (72%). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in less than 15 minutes from the onset of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) in all animals. No animals had a recurrence of CPA after the initial CPA. Animals were of a wide range of ages (0.5-16 years) and breeds. Two animals were neurologically abnormal at discharge, one of which was normal at 2 months following CPA.
   Conclusions: A good functional recovery after CPCR was documented in the small number of CPA survivors presented in this study This may be due to the reversible nature of their inciting cause of CPA, early detections of CPA ('witnessed), and/or the animal's underlying normal health status.

TI  - Effect of intermediate airway management on ventilation parameters in simulated paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a multicentre randomised crossover trial
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates remain low despite advancements in resuscitation science. Prompt restoration of oxygenation is crucial for achieving return of spontaneous circulation. Delays in airway management are associated with decreased survival rates. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether early i-gel (R) insertion, without prior bag-valve-mask, could enhance ventilation parameters in comparison with a bag-valve-mask-only approach. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised crossover study used a simulated paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest model to compare standard American Heart Association guidelines with an intermediate airway management approach using an i-gel (R) device. Paramedics and emergency medical technicians from eight participating emergency medical service centres were randomised into teams and performed two 10-minute simulations. Each team employed one of the airway management strategies. Data was automatically collected by a high-fidelity manikin. The primary outcome was alveolar ventilation per minute. Secondary outcomes included metrics for ventilation quality and timing, chest compression performance and timing of adrenaline administration. Statistical analysis involved paired tests suitable for the crossover design. RESULTS: From 30 January 2023 to 13 June 2023, 68 participants formed 34 resuscitation teams. Minute alveolar ventilation was similar between intermediate airway management and bag-valve-mask strategies (difference: 36 ml [95% CI-28 to 99]). A sensitivity analysis showed comparable results. Intermediate airway management delivered more ventilations, but bag-valve-mask enabled quicker ventilation initiation and more ventilations within the target volume. Chest compression fraction was higher with intermediate airway management, although chest recoil was better with bag-valve-mask. Adrenaline administration rates and times were similar in both strategies. Minor protocol deviations were observed but did not introduce significant bias. The study was underpowered due to an error in the sample size calculation, limiting the robustness and generalisability of the findings. CONCLUSION: In a simulated paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest model, immediate use of intermediate airway management did not show relevant differences compared to bag-valve-mask. Intermediate airway management devices cannot be recommended as first-line choice but may be considered when bag-valve-mask is challenging. Whichever device is used, the focus should remain on providing high-quality ventilations.

TI  - Application of Entropy-Based Features to Predict Defibrillation Outcome in Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ENTROPY
AB  - Prediction of defibrillation success is of vital importance to guide therapy and improve the survival of patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Currently, the most efficient methods to predict shock success are based on the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) during ventricular fibrillation (VF), and recent studies suggest the efficacy of waveform indices that characterize the underlying non-linear dynamics of VF. In this study we introduce, adapt and fully characterize six entropy indices for VF shock outcome prediction, based on the classical definitions of entropy to measure the regularity and predictability of a time series. Data from 163 OHCA patients comprising 419 shocks (107 successful) were used, and the performance of the entropy indices was characterized in terms of embedding dimension (m) and matching tolerance (r). Six classical predictors were also assessed as baseline prediction values. The best prediction results were obtained for fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn) with m = 3 and an amplitude-dependent tolerance of r = 80 mu V. This resulted in a balanced sensitivity/specificity of 80.4%/76.9%, which improved by over five points the results obtained for the best classical predictor. These results suggest that a FuzzEn approach for a joint quantification of VF amplitude and its non-linear dynamics may be a promising tool to optimize OHCA treatment.

TI  - Efficiency of virtual reality for cardiopulmonary resuscitation training of adult laypersons: A systematic review
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Background:Virtual reality (VR) is an interesting and promising way to teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to adult laypersons as its high immersive characteristics could improve the level of skills and acquired knowledge in learning basic life support (BLS). Methods:This systematic review assesses current literature about BLS training with VR and its possible effect on CPR-quality parameters, self-efficacy, perceived learning, and learners' satisfaction and short and long-term patients' outcome. We screened the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and included only clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies published from inception to October 1, 2021, which analyzed adult laypersons' BLS training with the use of VR. Primary outcomes were CPR parameters (chest compression rate and depth, Automated External Defibrillator use). Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, perceived learning and learners satisfaction, and patients' outcomes (survival and good neurologic status). The risk of bias of included study was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions tool to evaluate randomized control trials and the transparent reporting of evaluations with nonrandomized designs checklist for nonrandomized studies. Results:After full article screening, 6 studies were included in the systematic review (731 participants) published between 2017 and 2021. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies, we focused on describing the studies rather than meta-analysis. The assessment of the quality of evidence revealed overall a very low quality. Training with VR significantly improved the rate and depth of chest compressions in 4 out of 6 articles. VR was described as an efficient teaching method, exerting a positive effect on self-efficacy, perception of confidence, and competence in 2 articles. Conclusion:VR in BLS training improves manual skills and self-efficacy of adult laypersons and may be a good teaching method in a blended learning CPR training strategy. VR may add another way to divide complex parts of resuscitation training into easier individual skills. However, the conclusion of this review suggests that VR may improve the quality of the chest compressions as compared to instructor-led face-to-face BLS training.

TI  - Finding a new rhythm: child health-related quality of life, parent psychological distress, and unmet needs among families of children with cardiac channelopathies
T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundChildren with cardiac channelopathies face significant challenges, including exposure to medical trauma, complex genetic testing options, activity restrictions, lifelong surveillance, and increased risk of sudden death. This study assessed parental perceptions of child health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and unmet cardiac care needs, as well as predictors of traumatic stress among parents of children with a cardiac channelopathy.MethodsParents of children diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, or Brugada Syndrome were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Sixty-eight parents from 45 families (response rate: 75%) completed measures assessing child HRQOL, unmet cardiac care needs, and parent symptoms of traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression.ResultsPrior to attending their first multidisciplinary arrhythmia clinic, parents reported an average of 12 unmet needs. Half of mothers (50%) and 38% of fathers indicated their child was at-risk in terms of emotional functioning. Having a cardiac implantable electronic device, lower social support, and greater parental psychological stress predicted lower child HRQOL. Child out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was the strongest predictor of parent post-traumatic stress.ConclusionsPsychosocial screening and access to integrated, trauma-informed, family-centered psychological care should form part of best practice recommendations for children with cardiac channelopathies.

TI  - Negotiating grey areas: an interview-based analysis of paramedic uncertainty and decision-making in cardiac arrest events
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundParamedics are responsible for critical resuscitation decisions when attending Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA). Existing research indicates that a range of clinical and non-clinical factors moderate their decision-making. Within the United Kingdom (UK), there is little evidence on how and why paramedics make their decisions at actual OHCA events.MethodsWe explored the experiences of UK paramedics using individually recalled OHCA events as catalysts for discussion. Pen portraits developed from semi-structured interviews with 31 paramedics across two UK ambulance services were thematically analysed, enabling cross-participant comparisons whilst retaining depth and context.ResultsWe identified four themes: uncertainties encountered in resuscitation guidelines, influences on decision-making, holistic perspectives, and indirect moderators. We found that paramedics experienced uncertainty at all stages of the resuscitation process. Uncertainties arose from indeterminate, ambiguous or complex information and were described as having both clinical and ethical dimensions. Whilst guidelines drove paramedics' decisions, non-clinical personal, practical and relational factors moderated their assessments of survivability and decision-making, with attitudes to interactions between patient age, frailty and quality of life playing a substantial role. Coping strategies such as uncertainty reduction, assumption-based reasoning and weighing pros and cons were evident from interviews.ConclusionsThe complexity of interactions between clinical and non-clinical factors points to an element of variability in paramedics' responses to uncertainty. Exploring UK paramedics' uncertainties and decision-making during specific OHCA events can help acknowledge and address uncertainties in resuscitation guidelines and paramedic training, providing paramedics with the tools to manage uncertainty in a consistent and transparent way.

T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - This case report presents the management and diagnosis of an 80-year-old gentleman who presented to the Accident and Emergency Department with refractory hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia. Initially diagnosed with sepsis and cellulitis, it was later discovered that the patient was suffering from an Addisonian crisis due to adrenal insufficiency induced by long-term steroid use for rheumatoid arthritis. Prompt administration of intravenous hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation led to a significant improvement in the patient's condition. This case emphasizes the importance of considering adrenal insufficiency in patients with similar clinical presentations and highlights the critical role of early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPROVING SURVIVAL FROM OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Since the implementation of a paramedic system in Seattle, yearly survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation have averaged 25% without any significant increase over the years. Outcome for cardiac arrest associated with other rhythms has been poor: when asystole was the first rhythm recorded, only 1% of patients survived; when electromechanical dissociation was initially present, only 6% survived. For cases of electromechanical dissociation, neither the  type of rhythm nor the rate appear to influence outcome. Survival from ventricular fibrillation can be improved by shortening the delay to initiation of CPR and to defibrillation. When outcome in 244 witnessed arrests was related to the times to beginning CPR and to initial defribillation, mortality increasd 3% each minute until CPR was begun and 4% a minuted until the first shock was delivered. New strategies that minimize delays appear to have the greatest promise for improving survival after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Development of a Predictive Model for Survival Over Time in Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Ensemble-Based Machine Learning
T2  - CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING
AB  - As of now, a model for predicting the survival of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has not been established. This study aimed to develop a model for identifying predictors of survival over time in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during their stay in the emergency department, using ensemble-based machine learning. A total of 26 013 patients from the Korean nationwide out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry were enrolled between January 1 and December 31, 2019. Our model, comprising 38 variables, was developed using the Survival Quilts model to improve predictive performance. We found that changes in important variables of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were observed 10 minutes after arrival at the emergency department. The important score of the predictors showed that the influence of patient age decreased, moving from the highest rank to the fifth. In contrast, the significance of reperfusion attempts increased, moving from the fourth to the highest rank. Our research suggests that the ensemble-based machine learning model, particularly the Survival Quilts, offers a promising approach for predicting survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Survival Quilts model may potentially assist emergency department staff in making informed decisions quickly, reducing preventable deaths.

TI  - Enhancing Safety and Quality of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation During Coronavirus Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Professional knowledge and experience of healthcare organization went through continuous change and development with the progression of COVID-19 pandemic waves. However, carefully developed guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remained largely unchanged regardless of the epidemic situation, with the largest change being a more prominent bioethical approach. It would be possible to further improve the quality of CPR by systematic data collection, the facilitation of prospective studies, and further development of the methodology based on this evidence, as well as by providing information and developing provisions on interventions with expected poor outcomes, and ultimately by refusing resuscitation. Methods: This study involved the critical collection and analysis of literary data originating from the Web of Science and PubMed databases concerning bioethical aspects and the efficacy of CPR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: According to the current professional recommendation of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), CPR should be initiated immediately in case of cardiac arrest in the absence of an exclusionary circumstance. One such circumstance is explicit refusal of CPR by a well-informed patient, which in practice takes the form of a prior declaration. ERC prescribes the following conjunctive conditions for do-not-attempt CPR (DNACPR) declarations: present, real, and applicable. It is recommended to take the declaration as a part of complex end-of-life planning, with the corresponding documentation available in an electronic database. The pandemic has brought significant changes in resuscitation practice at both lay and professional levels as well. Incidence of out-of-hospital resuscitation (OHCA) did not differ compared to the previous period, while cardiac deaths in public places almost halved during the epidemic (p < 0.001) as did the use of AEDs (p = 0.037). The number of resuscitations performed by bystanders and by the emergency medical service (EMS) also showed a significant decrease (p = 0.001), and the most important interventions (defibrillation, first adrenaline time) suffered a significant delay. Secondary survival until hospital discharge thus decreased by 50% during the pandemic period. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic provided a significant impetus to the revision of guidelines. While detailed methodology has changed only slightly compared to the previous procedures, the DNACPR declaration regarding self-determination is mentioned in the context of complex end-of-life planning. The issue of safe environment has come to the fore for both lay and trained resuscitators. Future Directions: Prospective evaluation of standardized methods can further improve the patient's autonomy and quality of life. Since clinical data are controversial, further prospective controlled studies are needed to evaluate the real hazards of aerosol-generating procedures.

TI  - Prehospital extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in goat with severe primary blast lung Injury-a pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundAlthough extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promise for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA), limited data exist regarding its application in cases involving severe primary blast lung injury (PBLI). This study evaluated the feasibility, indications, complications, and early management of ECPR for refractory out-of-hospital CA in goats with severe PBLI.MethodsTwenty adult goats (30.47 +/- 4.74 kg) were randomly divided into five groups based on their distance from an 8 kg TNT-equivalent explosive: 2.5 m (n = 3), 3 m (n = 5), 4 m (n = 4), 5 m (n = 4), and 6 m (n = 4). Goats were positioned in concentric circles and fixed in special iron frames in the same direction (with the right chest facing the core of the explosion). Following detonation, all animals were transported 500 m to a field rescue unit. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated 1 min after CA. Two of the twenty goats were used for gross lung pathology assessment. Four goats underwent neck vessel cannulation and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Crystalloid and blood transfusions were administered, and animals were monitored for 4 h.ResultsAll goats within 3 m suffered severe lung damage and CA after the explosion. Despite effective chest compression support, six of the eight goats within 3 m of the explosion died due to progressive circulatory failure. Four goats received ECPR. Among them, two were successfully resuscitated using VA - ECMO, with perfusion pressures restored to 65 mmHg (range: 60-70 mmHg) at 25 and 30 min post-CA. In the remaining two, large thrombi in the carotid arteries prevented effective flow initiation. No complications such as hemorrhage or failed vascular access were observed during cannulation. The ECMO circuit was established via an open carotid artery and the jugular vein cannula started, leading to the return of spontaneous circulation in the two successfully treated animals. All goats in the 4-, 5-, and 6-meter groups survived.ConclusionsPrehospital ECPR improved the restoration of spontaneous circulation and hemodynamic stability in goats with severe PBLI-induced CA. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and early efficacy of ECPR in austere conditions. Further investigations in larger animal cohorts and human trials are warranted to validate its potential as a life-saving intervention for blast-induced CA.

TI  - Dissemination of CPR video self-instruction materials to secondary trainees: Results from a hospital-based CPR education trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) video self-instruction (VSI) materials have been promoted as a scalable approach to increase the prevalence of CPR skills among the lay public, in part due to the opportunity for secondary training (i.e., sharing of training materials). However, the motivations for, and barriers to, disseminating VSI materials to secondary trainees is poorly understood.
   Methods: This work represents an ancillary investigation of a prospective hospital-based CPR education trial in which family members of cardiac patients were trained using VSI. Mixed-methods surveys were administered to primary trainees six months after initial enrollment. Surveys were designed to capture motivations for, and barriers to, sharing VSI materials, the number of secondary trainees with whom materials were shared, and the settings, timing, and recipients of trainings.
   Results: Between 07/2012 and 05/2015, 653 study participants completed a six-month follow-up interview. Of those, 345 reported sharing VSI materials with 1455 secondary trainees. Materials were shared most commonly with family members. In a logistic regression analysis, participants in the oldest quartile (age >63 years) were less likely to share materials compared to those in the youngest quartile (age <= 44 years, OR 0.58, CI 0.37-0.90, p = 0.02). Among the 308 participants who did not share their materials, time constraints was the most commonly cited barrier for not sharing.
   Conclusions: VSI materials represent a strategy for secondary dissemination of CPR training, yet older individuals have a lower likelihood of sharing relative to younger individuals. Further work is warranted to remedy perceived barriers to CPR dissemination among the lay public using VSI approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation for Long QT Syndrome 50 Years' Experience Provides Guidance for Management
T2  - JACC-CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to report our single-center experience with left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) for long QT syndrome (LQTS) since 1973. BACKGROUND LCSD is still underutilized because clinicians are often uncertain whether to use it versus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). METHODS We performed LCSD in 125 patients with LQTS (58% women, mean QT interval corrected for frequency [QTc] 527 +/- 60 ms, 90% on beta blockers) with a follow-up of 12.9 +/- 10.3 years. They were retrospectively divided into 4 groups according to the clinical/genetic status: very high risk (n =18, symptomatic in the first year of life or with highly malignant genetics), with aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) (n = 31), with syncope and/or ICD shocks on beta blockers (n = 45), in primary prevention (n = 31). RESULTS After LCSD, 17% in the very high risk group remained asymptomatic, compared with 52%, 47%, and 97% in the other 3 groups (P < 0.0001), with an overall 86% decrease in the mean yearly cardiac event rate (P < 0.0001). Among 45 patients with only syncope/ICD shocks before LCSD, none had ACA/sudden death as first symptom after LCSD and a 6-month post-LCSD QTc <500 ms predicted excellent outcome. Patients with a QTc $500 ms have a 50% chance of shortening it by an average of 60 ms. LCSD results are not affected by common genotypes. CONCLUSIONS We provide definitive evidence for the long-term efficacy of LCSD in LQTS. The degree of antiarrhythmic protection is influenced by patient's specificity and amount of QTc shortening. This novel approach to the analysis of the outcome allows cardiologists to rationally decide and tailor their management strategies to the individual features of their patients.

TI  - Acute burn injury
T2  - CLINICS IN PLASTIC SURGERY
AB  - Almost 2 million people in the United States suffer from burns annually. Children and the elderly have the greatest incidence of burn injuries during cooking or bathing accidents, whereas young adults are most often injured in the work place [1]. Approximately 10% of burn patients require admission to hospitals or major burn centers for care. A small percentage of these injuries are fatal, but all require some degree of medical attention [1,2].
   Burn injury is associated with anatomic, physiologic, endocrinologic, and immunologic alterations. Cutaneous injury triggers a reaction at a local and systemic level through the release of multiple inflammatory mediators. When the injury is extensive, this becomes a systemic reaction [2,3]. On a local level, these reactions will affect the surgical decision making and need to be understood to ensure the best possible short- and long-term outcomes. On a systemic level, the cascade of cellular alterations can lead to generalized inflammation and multiple system organ dysfunction. These problems need to be identified and treated properly to prevent or minimize the extent of the damage [1,4].
   Although most injuries due to burns are minor, the care of the injuries requires specialized knowledge for improved outcomes. In recent years, advances in burn treatment have reduced morbidity and mortality and improved the quality of life for burn survivors. These advances have been made in the treatment of the acute injury, the quality of the initial resuscitation, the effectiveness of infection control, and the surgical decision making for improved short- and long-term outcomes [5].
   In major burn centers, a more comprehensive, team-oriented approach has been introduced over the last 10 years. Personnel include a surgeon, critical care specialist, specialized nursing care, nutritionist, pharmacist, and physical therapist. This approach has improved survival rates for victims of increasingly more complex burn injuries and has improved rehabilitation outcomes, Historically, age, depth of injury, and surface area were important predictors of morbidity and mortality; however, current practice has altered these predictors [1,5].

TI  - At the border: out-of-hospital resuscitation of the elderly
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Epidemiologic data suggests that emergency medicine will be increasingly affected by the aging population. Since death is more common among the elderly emergency physicians and paramedics more often will encounter patients experiencing cardiac arrest. In elderly patients cardiac arrest might be not a sudden event but the end of the process of dying and to withhold or to abandon CPR might be appropriate. Can we define patients with no chance of survival? Recent studies suggest that age is associated with survival? Recent studies suggest that age is associated with survival, being lower among the elderly. In particular in nursing homes the benefits of resuscitation attempts are very limited. However, age seems to be only a relatively weak independent predictor of outcome. If there is any doubt about the appropriateness of resuscitation attempt, standard of care remains prompt initiation of CPR. Decisions to withhold CPR should be based on sound clinical reasons. Since patients have a right to refuse treatment, their preferences should be taken into account. The probability of survival might influence patients' preferences. Patients should be encouraged to determine in advance whether resuscitative efforts should be initiated and these decisions should be written down. This enables the emergency personnel to consider the patients' individual hierarchy of values.

TI  - Reliability of prognostic biomarkers after prehospital extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation with target temperature management
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) performed at the emergency scene in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) can minimize low-flow time. Target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest can improve neurological outcome. A combination of ECPR and TTM, both implemented as soon as possible on scene, appears to have promising results in OHCA. To date, it is still unknown whether the implementation of TTM and ECPR on scene affects the time course and value of neurological biomarkers. Methods 69 ECPR patients were examined in this study. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 72 h after ECPR and analyzed for S100, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lactate, D-dimers and interleukin 6 (IL6). Cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were used to assess neurological outcome after ECPR upon hospital discharge. Resuscitation data were extracted from the Regensburg extracorporeal membrane oxygenation database and all data were analyzed by a statistician. The data were analyzed using non-parametric methods. Diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers was determined by area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Results were compared to the relevant literature. Results Non-hypoxic origin of cardiac arrest, manual chest compression until ECPR, a short low-flow time until ECPR initiation, low body mass index (BMI) and only a minimal need of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support were associated with a good neurological outcome after ECPR. Survivors with good neurological outcome had significantly lower lactate, IL6, D-dimer, and NSE values and demonstrated a rapid decrease in the initial S100 value compared to non-survivors. Conclusions A short low-flow time until ECPR initiation is important for a good neurological outcome. Hypoxia-induced cardiac arrest has a high mortality rate even when ECPR and TTM are performed at the emergency scene. ECPR patients with a higher BMI had a worse neurological outcome than patients with a normal BMI. The prognostic biomarkers S100, NSE, lactate, D-dimers and IL6 were reliable indicators of neurological outcome when ECPR and TTM were performed at the emergency scene.

Follow up points were 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 36th month with clinical and ultrasound evaluation. At 6th, 12th and 36th month CT pyelography and urodynamic evaluation were performed and we used a questionnaire for subjective bladder function and the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire to evaluate quality of Perioperative complications were ileus (2 patients; 2.1%) (Clavien Grade IIIb), one postoperative death (1.0%) (Clavien Grade 10 and a resuscitated cardiac arrest (1.0%) (Clavien Grade IVa). Postoperative complications were incisional hernias (n=4 patients; 4.21%) (Clavien Grade I) and hydronephrosis in five patients (5.26%) due to ureteric/neobladder stricture (Clavien Grade IIIb). Urine retention due to neobladder neck stenosis was observed in one patient (1.0%) (Clavien Grade IIIb) and an ileo-neobladder fistula in one (1.0%) patient (Clavien Grade IIIb). During follow up there were two cancer related deaths (2.1%). According to urodynamic evaluations neobladder capacity increased, end-filling pressure and Qmax decreased while residual urine and the number of intrinsic contractions remained stable. Continence rates and quality of life were high and stable during follow up. VIP technique for bladder substitution is a relatively easy technique with low rate of complications, good functional results which respect the patient's quality of life.

TI  - Cardiac condition during cooling and rewarming periods of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Hypothermia has been used in cardiac surgery for many years for neuroprotection. Mild hypothermia (MH) [body temperature (BT) kept at 32-35 degrees C] has been shown to reduce both mortality and poor neurological outcome in patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study investigated whether patients who were expected to benefit neurologically from therapeutic hypothermia (TH) also had improved cardiac function.
   Methods: The study included 30 patients who developed in-hospital cardiac arrest between September 17, 2012, and September 20, 2013, and had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following successful CPR. Patient BTs were cooled to 33 degrees C using intravascular heat change. Basal BT, systolic artery pressure (SAP), diastolic artery pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), extravascular lung water index (ELWI), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) were measured at 36 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 34 degrees C and 33 degrees C during cooling. BT was held at 33 degrees C for 24 hours prior to rewarming. Rewarming was conducted 0.25 degrees C/h. During rewarming, measurements were repeated at 33 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 36 degrees C. A final measurement was performed once patients spontaneously returned to basal BT. We compared cooling and rewarming cardiac measurements at the same BTs.
   Results: SAP values during rewarming (34 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 36 degrees C) were lower than during cooling (P < 0.05). DAP values during rewarming (basal temperature, 34 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 36 degrees C) were lower than during cooling. MAP values during rewarming (34 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 36 degrees C) were lower than during cooling (P < 0.05). CO and CI values were higher during rewarming than during cooling. GEDI and ELWI did not differ during cooling and rewarming. SVRI values during rewarming (34 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 36 degrees C and basal temperature) were lower than during cooling (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing cardiac function at the same BTs during cooling and rewarming. In patients experiencing ROSC following CPR, TH may improve cardiac function and promote favorable neurological outcomes.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of single-dose cardioplegia in high-risk coronary bypass
T2  - ASIAN CARDIOVASCULAR & THORACIC ANNALS
AB  - Background Despite the increasing popularity of single-dose cardioplegia techniques in coronary artery bypass grafting, the time window for successful reperfusion remains unclear. This study aimed to compare different cardioplegic techniques based on early and 30-day clinical outcomes via thorough monitoring. Methods This prospective cohort study included high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and receiving 3 different types of cardioplegia between January 2017 and June 2019. Group 1 (n = 101) had a single dose of del Nido cardioplegia, group 2 (n = 92) had a single dose of histidine-tryptophane-ketoglutarate, and group 3 (n = 119) had cold blood cardioplegia. Patients were examined perioperatively by memory loop recording and auto-triggered memory loop recording for 30 days, with documentation of predefined events. Results Interleukin-6 and cardiac troponin levels in group 1 were significantly higher than those in groups 2 and 3. The incidence of predefined events as markers of inadequate myocardial protection was significantly higher group 1, with more frequent atrial fibrillation attacks and more hospital readmissions. The readmission rate was 17.6% in group 1, 9% in group 2, and 8% in group 3. Conclusions Our data demonstrate the long-term efficacy of cardioplegic techniques, which may become more crucial in high-risk patients who genuinely have a chance to benefit from adjunct myocardial protection. Patients given del Nido cardioplegia had a significantly more prominent inflammatory response and higher troponin levels after cardiopulmonary bypass. This group had issues in the longer term with significantly more cardiac events and a higher rehospitalization rate.

TI  - Patients with sudden cardiac death receiving an implantable cardiac device: survival at 30 days and one year
T2  - REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE
AB  - Background: The use of implantable cardiac devices in patients with sudden cardiac arrest has contributed to their survival. Aim: To determine the survival rate at 30 days and one year after hospital discharge of patients who had a cardiac arrest with subsequent placement of an implantable cardiac device. Material and Methods: Twenty-three patients older than 18 years who presented sudden extra-institutional or intra-institutional death with subsequent implantation of an implantable cardiac device and whose survival was recorded at 30 days and one year, were included. A univariate analysis was performed. Results: Eighteen patients had an extra institutional cardiac arrest. All patients were discharged alive. We could not ascertain the health status of one patient at follow-up. Twenty-one patients had a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1 at discharge. One patient died of a stroke within 30 days and one patient died due to an arrhythmic electrical storm one year later. Twenty patients survived at least one year after hospital discharge. Conclusions: Survival at 30 days and one year, was high in patients with sudden death or cardiac arrest who required intracardiac devices.

TI  - Early neurologically-focused follow-up after cardiac arrest improves quality of life at one year: A randomised controlled trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Survivors of a cardiac arrest frequently have cognitive and emotional problems and their quality of life is at risk. We developed a brief nursing intervention to detect cognitive and emotional problems, provide information and support, promote self-management, and refer them to specialised care if necessary. This study examined its effectiveness.
   Methods: Multicentre randomised controlled trial with measurements at two weeks, three months and twelve months after cardiac arrest. 185 adult cardiac arrest survivors and 155 caregivers participated. Primary outcome measures were societal participation and quality of life of the survivors at one year. Secondary outcomes were the patient's cognitive functioning, emotional state, extended daily activities and return to work, and the caregiver's well-being. Data were analysed using 'intention to treat' linear mixed model analyses.
   Results: After one year, patients in the intervention group had a significantly better quality of life on SF-36 domains Role Emotional (estimated mean differences (EMD) = 16.38, p = 0.006), Mental Health (EMD = 6.87, p = 0.003) and General Health (EMD = 8.07, p = 0.010), but there was no significant difference with regard to societal participation. On the secondary outcome measures, survivors scored significantly better on overall emotional state (HADS total, EMD = -3.25, p = 0.002) and anxiety (HADS anxiety, EMD = -1.79, p = 0.001) at one year. Furthermore, at three months more people were back at work (50% versus 21%, p = 0.006). No significant differences were found for caregiver outcomes.
   Conclusion: The outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors can be improved by an intervention focused on detecting and managing the cognitive and emotional consequences of a cardiac arrest.

TI  - Fertility outcomes in women experiencing severe complications after surgery for colorectal endometriosis
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the fertility outcomes in women wishing to conceive after experiencing a severe complication from surgical removal of colorectal endometriosis?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: The pregnancy rate (PR) among women who wished to conceive after a severe complication of surgery for colorectal endometriosis was 41.2% (spontaneously for 80%, after ART procedure for 20%).
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: While the long-term benefit of surgery on pain and quality of life is well documented for women with colorectal endometriosis, it exposes women to the risk of severe complications. However, little is known about fertility outcomes in women experiencing such severe postoperative complications.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective cohort study included women who experienced a severe complication after surgery for colorectal endometriosis between January 2004 and June 2014, and who wished to conceive. A total of 53 patients met the inclusion criteria. The fertility outcome was available for 48 women, who were therefore included in the analysis. The median follow-up was 5 years.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All the women underwent complete removal of colorectal endometriosis. Postoperative severe complications were defined as grades III-IV of the Clavien-Dindo classification. Fertility outcomes, PR and cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR), were estimated.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most women experienced a grade IIIb complication (83.3%). Of 48 women, 20 became pregnant (overall PR: 41.2%); spontaneously for 16 (80%) and after ART procedure for 4 (20%). The median interval between surgery and first pregnancy was 3 years. The live birth rate was 14/48 (29.2%). The 5-year CPR was 46%. A lower CPR was found for women who experienced anastomotic leakage (with or without rectovaginal fistula) (P = 0.02) or deep pelvic abscess (with or without anastomotic leakage) (P = 0.04).
   LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Due to a lack of information, no sub-analysis was done to investigate other parameters potentially impacting fertility outcomes.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The PR for our population was slightly lower to that observed in the literature for women who experience such surgery without consideration for the occurrence of complications. However, 'severe complications' covers a range of conditions which are likely to have a very different impacts on fertility. Even if the PR and CPR appear satisfactory, septic complications can negatively impact fertility outcomes. Rapid ART may be a good option for these patients.

TI  - δ-Opioid receptor agonist reduces severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is recognized as a leading cause of early death after initially successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In the present study, we hypothesized that a delta-opioid receptor agonist would decrease the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and improve survival. Fifteen Sprague-Dawley rats, fasted overnight with access to water, were anesthetized by an injection of 45 mg/kg ip pentobarbital sodium. Additional doses of 10 mg/kg were administered at hourly intervals but not within 30 min before induced ventricular fibrillation (VF). Either the delta-opioid receptor agonist pentazocine (300 mug/kg), pentazocine pretreated with the opioid receptor-blocking agent naloxone (I mg/kg), or saline placebo was injected into the right atrium after 5 min of untreated VF and 3 min before initiation of CPR. After an additional 8 min of CPR administration, defibrillation was attempted. All animals were successfully resuscitated. Left ventricular rate of pressure increase at 40 mmHg and cardiac index values were significantly improved in pentazocine-treated animals, which also had significantly longer survival times (60 +/- 11 vs. 16 +/- 7 h; P < 0.01). Except for ease of defibrillation, the beneficial effects of pentazocine were completely abolished by pretreatment with naloxone. The concept of pharmacological hibernation employing a delta-opioid receptor agonist is a novel and promising intervention for minimizing global ischemic injury during CPR and postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.

TI  - Influence of early defibrillation on the survival rate and quality of life after CPR in prehospital emergency medical service in a German metropolitan area
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Early defibrillation by emergency medical personnel has been shown to improve survival in patients suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation. Due to organisational differences it is difficult to compare results in various studies. Comparison of studies has been simplified by introduction of the Utstein template. After introduction of an early defibrillation program in Hamburg, we compared the patients being treated with early defibrillation by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) with patients being defibrillated by physicians in an out-of-hospital emergency service in a prospective study. All patients suffered from non EMT-witnessed ventricular fibrillation of cardiac origin. During 1 year, 103 patients were analyzed with respect to survival rate and quality of life. Of the 53 patients in the early defibrillation group (G 1) 11 regained a palpable pulse at physicians' arrival, whereas all patients of the control group (G2) showed ventricular fibrillation. More patients treated with early defibrillation regained sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmics in the prehospital phase (G1: n = 43 (86%); G2: H = 32 (60%); P < 0.05) and had a shorter in-hospital stay (G1: median, 23 days; range 5-51 days; G2: median 39, range 15-88 days; P < 0.05). Twelve patients in G1 and 16 in G2 were discharged from hospital. The survival rate was similar in both groups (after 6 months G1: n = 12; G2: n = 14, after 12 months G1: n = 10; G2: n = 13 and after 24 months G1: n = 9; G2: n = 10), and the quality of life according to Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) and Overall Performance Category (OPC) scores also was comparable between groups. We conclude that early defibrillation provides a higher incidence of return of a spontaneous circulation, a reduced need for antiarrhythmics and shorter in-hospital treatment times in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation.

TI  - Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Arrest Survivors Having Versus Not Having Coronary Angiography
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Prompt percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with improved survival in patients presenting with cardiac arrest. Few studies; however, have focused on patients with cardiac arrest not selected for coronary angiography. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cardiac arrest denied emergent angiography. Patients with cardiac arrest were identified within a registry that included all catheterization laboratory activations from 2008 to 2012. Logistic regression and proportional-hazards models were created to assess the clinical characteristics and mortality associated with denying emergent angiography. Among 664 patients referred for catheterization, 110 (17%) had cardiac arrest, and 26 of these patients did not undergo emergent angiography. Most subjects (69%) were turned down for angiography for clinical reasons and a minority for perceived futility (27%). After multivariate adjustment, pulseless electrical activity as the initial arrest rhythm (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 13.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76 to 100.12), <1.0 mm of ST-segment elevation (AOR 10.26,95% CI 1.68 to 62.73), female gender (AOR 4.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 19.08), and advancing age (AOR 1.10 per year, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16) were associated with increased odds of with-holding angiography. The mortality rate was markedly higher for patients who were denied emergent angiography (hazard ratio 3.64, 95% CI 2.05 to 6.49), even after adjustment for medical acuity (hazard ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.41). In conclusion, Older subjects, women, and patients without ST-segment elevation were more commonly denied emergent angiography after cardiac arrest. Patients denied emergent angiography had increased mortality that persisted after adjustment for illness severity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The importance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a fundamental component of initial care for the victim of cardiac arrest. In the past few years, increasing quantitative evidence has demonstrated that survival from cardiac arrest is dependent on the quality of delivered CPR. This review will focus on this body of evidence and on a range of practical approaches to improving CPR performance.
   Recent findings
   A number of strategies to improve CPR quality have been evaluated recently, during both prehospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest care. These strategies have included the use of real-time CPR sensing and feedback, the employment of physiologic monitoring such as end-tidal CO2 measurement and the use of metronome prompting. The use of mechanical CPR devices to avoid the challenges of manual CPR performance has also represented a topic of great current interest. Additional approaches have focused on both prearrest training (e.g. high-fidelity simulation education and CPR refreshers) and postarrest training (e.g. debriefing).
   Summary
   A number of strategies have been evaluated to improve CPR performance. While many questions remain surrounding the relative value of each approach, it is likely that combinations of these methods may be useful in a variety of care settings to improve care for cardiac arrest victims.

TI  - Priorities for paediatric critical care research: a modified Delphi study by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Paediatric Study Group
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: Most interventions in paediatric critical care lack high grade evidence. We aimed to identify the key research priorities and key clinical outcome measures pertinent to research in paediatric intensive care patients.
   Design: Modified three-stage Delphi study combining staged online surveys, followed by a face-to-face discussion and final voting.
   Setting: Paediatric intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand.
   Participants: Medical and nursing staff working in intensive care.
   Main outcome measurements: Self-reported priorities for research.
   Results: 193 respondents provided a total of 267 research questions and 234 outcomes. In Stage 3, the top 56 research questions and 50 outcomes were discussed face to face, which allowed the identification of the top 20 research questions with the Hanlon prioritisation score and the top 20 outcomes. Topics centred on the use of intravenous fluids (restrictive v liberal fluids, use of fluid resuscitation bolus, early inotrope use, type of intravenous fluid, and assessment of fluid responsiveness), and patient- and family-centred outcomes (health-related quality of life, liberation) emerged as priorities. While mortality, length of stay, and organ support/organ dysfunction were considered important and the most feasible outcomes, long term quality of life and neurodevelopmental measures were rated highly in terms of their importance.
   Conclusions: Using a modified Delphi method, this study provides guidance towards prioritisation of research topics in paediatric critical care in Australia and New Zealand, and identifies study outcomes of key relevance to clinicians and experts in the field.

TI  - Six-month outcome of emergency percutaneous coronary intervention in resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest complicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-The outcome of resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest complicating acute myocardial infarction remains poor, primarily because of the relatively low success rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation management. Existing data suggest potential beneficial effects of early myocardial reperfusion, but the predictors of survival in these patients remain unknown.
   Methods and Results-From 1995 to 2005, 186 patients (78% men; mean age, 60.4 +/- 13.8 years) underwent immediate percutaneous coronary intervention after successful resuscitation for cardiac arrest complicating acute myocardial infarction. Prompt prehospital management was performed by mobile medical care units in 154 of 186 patients, whereas 32 had in-hospital cardiac arrest. Infarct location was anterior in 105 patients (56%), and shock was present on admission in 96 (52%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (stenting rate 90%) was successful in 161 of 186 patients (87%). Six-month survival rate was 100 of 186 (54%), and 6-month survival free of neurological sequelae was 46%. By multivariate analysis, predictors of 6-month survival were a shorter interval between the onset of cardiac arrest and arrival of a first responder (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.84), a shorter interval between the onset of cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96), and absence of diabetes (odds ratio, 7.30; 95% CI, 1.80 to 29.41).
   Conclusions-In patients with resuscitated cardiac arrest complicating acute myocardial infarction, prompt prehospital management and early revascularization were associated with a 54% survival rate at 6 months. A strategy including adequate prehospital management, early revascularization, and specific care in dedicated intensive care units should be strongly considered in resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest complicating acute myocardial infarction.

TI  - ANTITACHYCARDIA DEVICES - REALITIES AND PROMISES
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Nonpharmacologic therapy for ventricular arrhythmias has gained growing attention with the development of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. In addition, the reports of adverse effects of drug therapy from several studies, including the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), have supported the need for these devices. The development of new implantable cardioverter-defibrillators that have the capability of antitachycardia pacing, bradycardia pacing, cardioversion and defibrillation has enhanced their clinical utility.
   The currently available implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have been shown to significantly improve survival after sudden cardiac arrest in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Newer devices with expanded capabilities may reduce mortality even further. In this report the features of currently available antitachycardia devices and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are reviewed and the features and current implant data on newer antitachycardia devices are discussed.

TI  - ECPR2: Expert Consensus on PeRcutaneous Cannulation for Extracorporeal CardioPulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has emerged as a promising resuscitation strategy for select patients suffering from refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), though limited data exist regarding the best practices for ECPR initiation after OHCA.Methods: We utilized a modified Delphi process consisting of two survey rounds and a virtual consensus meeting to systematically identify detailed best practices for ECPR initiation following adult non-traumatic OHCA. A modified Delphi process builds content validity and is an accepted method to develop consensus by eliciting expert opinions through multiple rounds of questionnaires. Consensus was achieved when items reached a high level of agreement, defined as greater than 80% responses for a particular item rated a 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale.Results: Snowball sampling generated a panel of 14 content experts, composed of physicians from four continents and five primary specialties. Seven existing institutional protocols for ECPR cannulation following OHCA were identified and merged into a single comprehensive list of 207 items. The panel reached consensus on 101 items meeting final criteria for inclusion: Prior to Patient Arrival (13 items), Inclusion Criteria (8), Exclusion Criteria (7), Patient Arrival (8), ECPR Cannulation (21), Go On Pump (18), and Post-Cannulation (26).Conclusion: We present a list of items for ECPR initiation following adult nontraumatic OHCA, generated using a modified Delphi process from an international panel of content experts. These findings may benefit centers currently performing ECPR in quality assurance and serve as a template for new ECPR programs.

TI  - Organ-Specific Mitochondrial Alterations Following Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is triggered by systemic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and affects various organs, is a key factor in the development of post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). Current research on PCAS primarily addresses generalized mitochondrial responses, resulting in a knowledge gap regarding organ-specific mitochondrial dynamics. This review focuses on the organ-specific mitochondrial responses to IR injury, particularly examining the brain, heart, and kidneys, to highlight potential therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction to enhance outcomes post-IR injury. Methods and Results: We conducted a narrative review examining recent advancements in mitochondrial research related to IR injury. Mitochondrial responses to IR injury exhibit considerable variation across different organ systems, influenced by unique mitochondrial structures, bioenergetics, and antioxidative capacities. Each organ demonstrates distinct mitochondrial behaviors that have evolved to fulfill specific metabolic and functional needs. For example, cerebral mitochondria display dynamic responses that can be both protective and detrimental to neuronal activity and function during ischemic events. Cardiac mitochondria show vulnerability to IR-induced oxidative stress, while renal mitochondria exhibit a unique pattern of fission and fusion, closely linked to their susceptibility to acute kidney injury. This organ-specific heterogeneity in mitochondrial responses requires the development of tailored interventions. Progress in mitochondrial medicine, especially in the realms of genomics and metabolomics, is paving the way for innovative strategies to combat mitochondrial dysfunction. Emerging techniques such as mitochondrial transplantation hold the potential to revolutionize the management of IR injury in resuscitation science. Conclusions: The investigation into organ-specific mitochondrial responses to IR injury is pivotal in the realm of resuscitation research, particularly within the context of PCAS. This nuanced understanding holds the promise of revolutionizing PCAS management, addressing the unique mitochondrial dysfunctions observed in critical organs affected by IR injury.

TI  - Ruthenium red alleviates post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by upregulating mitophagy through inhibition of USP33 in a cardiac arrest rat model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) remains a leading cause of death, with suboptimal survival rates despite efforts involving cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced life-support technology. Post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction (PRMD) is an important determinant of patient outcomes. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury underlies this dysfunction. Previous reports have shown that ruthenium red (RR) has a protective effect against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury; however, its precise mechanism of action in PRMD remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of RR on PRMD and analyzed its underlying mechanisms. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in rats, which were then subjected to cardiopulmonary resuscitation to establish an experimental CA model. At the onset of return of spontaneous circulation, RR (2.5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. Our study showed that RR improved myocardial function and reduced the production of oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSSG), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. RR also helped maintain mitochondrial structure and increased ATP and GTP levels. Additionally, RR effectively attenuated myocardial apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed downregulation of proteins closely related to mitophagy, including ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) and P62, whereas LC3B (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B) was upregulated. The upregulation of mitophagy may play a critical role in reducing myocardial injury. These results demonstrate that RR may attenuate PRMD by promoting mitophagy through the inhibition of USP33. These effects are likely mediated through diverse mechanisms, including antioxidant activity, apoptosis suppression, and preservation of mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism. Consequently, RR has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for addressing post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction.

TI  - Reduced survival following resuscitation in patients with documented clinically abnormal observations prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Patients suffering in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) often have abnormal clinical observations documented prior to the arrest. This study assesses whether these patients have a less favourable outcome following IHCA.
   Methods: A multiple logistic regression analysis of retrospectively collected hospital chart data and prospectively collected Utstein style resuscitation data. Patients were defined as having abnormal clinical observations if they had one of the following documented 8 h before the arrest: systolic arterial blood pressure below 90 or over 200, pulse rate below 40 or over 140 beats per min or oxygen saturation below 90% with or without supplemental oxygen. Pre-arrest variables included were: age, sex and functional status, co-morbidities, reason for hospital admission, days in the hospital before the arrest, witnessed or un-witnessed arrest, arrest occurring outside regular working hours, monitored or non-monitored ward, whether basic life support was performed before the arrival of the resuscitation team, delay to arrival of resuscitation team and initial rhythm.
   Results: Survival to hospital discharge of patients with clinically abnormal observations was 9% and among those without 18% (p=0.037). Independent pre-arrest predictors of survival were: un-witnessed arrest (odds ratio [OR] 0.1, confidence interval (0) 0.01-0.8), initial rhythm other than ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (OR 0.13, Cl 0.05-0.3), delay to arrival of the resuscitation team exceeding 2 min (median) (OR 0.4, Cl 0.15-0.9) and the presence of documented clinical abnormal observations prior to the arrest (OR 0.3, Cl 0.09-0.95).
   Conclusions: Patients with documented clinically abnormal observations before IHCA have a worse outcome than those without, despite prompt resuscitation. Efforts should be made to identify these patients in time, thereby possibly avoiding the arrest. This can also be used when assessing the prognosis in IHCA. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Effect of mavacamten and disopyramide on left ventricular mechanical dispersion and life-threatening arrhythmia in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING
AB  - Aims Disopyramide and mavacamten both decrease left ventricular outflow tract gradients in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Yet, their effects on myocardial mechanics remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of mavacamten and disopyramide on left ventricular mechanical dispersion (LVMD) and its association with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and results Consecutive subjects (n = 120) with obstructive HCM treated with either Mavacamten or disopyramide from 2018 to 2024 were identified. Echocardiographic speckle-tracking strain imaging with myocardial work indices and LVMD quantification was performed at baseline and follow-up. Patients were followed up for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias: sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), up to 2 years. Propensity matching was performed for age and sex to compare the groups. Mavacamten significantly reduced LVMD (85.1 +/- 26.4 ms vs. 64.3 +/- 16.7 ms, P = 0.013) and global wasted work (GWW) (268 mmHg% (185-378) vs. 150 mmHg% (124-262), P = 0.006) and increased global work efficiency (GWE) (87% (82-92) vs. 90% (86-94), P = 0.038). None of the favourable effects were observed with disopyramide. The median follow-up duration was 12 (range 6-24) months. LVMD at follow-up was significantly associated with the outcome events [area under curve: 0.784, 95% CI (0.622-0.945), P < 0.001]. LVMD <72 ms at follow-up was associated with improved event-free survival (X6.4, log-rank P = 0.011). Mavacamten and global work indices were independent determinants of LVMD at follow-up. Conclusion Mavacamten, but not disopyramide, decreased LVMD, GWW, and increased GWE in obstructive HCM. LVMD <72 ms at follow-up is promising for assessing the risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

TI  - Predicting one-year mortality of critically ill patients with early acute kidney injury: data from the prospective multicenter FINNAKI study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: No predictive models for long-term mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) exist. We aimed to develop and validate two predictive models for one-year mortality in patients with AKI based on data (1) on intensive care unit (ICU) admission and (2) on the third day (D3) in the ICU.
   Methods: This substudy of the FINNAKI study comprised 774 patients with early AKI (diagnosed within 24 hours of ICU admission). We selected predictors a priori based on previous studies, clinical judgment, and differences between one-year survivors and non-survivors in patients with AKI. We validated the models internally with bootstrapping.
   Results: Of 774 patients, 308 (39.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 36.3 to 43.3) died during one year. Predictors of one-year mortality on admission were: advanced age, diminished premorbid functional performance, co-morbidities, emergency admission, and resuscitation or hypotension preceding ICU admission. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (95% CI) for the admission model was 0.76 (0.72 to 0.79) and the mean bootstrap-adjusted AUC 0.75 (0.74 to 0.75). Advanced age, need for mechanical ventilation on D3, number of co-morbidities, higher modified SAPS II score, the highest bilirubin value by D3, and the lowest base excess value on D3 remained predictors of one-year mortality on D3. The AUC (95% CI) for the D3 model was 0.80 (0.75 to 0.85) and by bootstrapping 0.79 (0.77 to 0.80).
   Conclusions: The prognostic performance of the admission data-based model was acceptable, but not good. The D3 model for one-year mortality performed fairly well in patients with early AKI.

TI  - Rapid implementation of therapeutic hypothermia in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background: The implementation of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) into daily clinical practice appears to be slow. We present our experiences with rapid implementation of a simple protocol for TH in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors.
   Methods: From June 2002, we started cooling pre-hospitally with sport ice packs in the groin and over the neck. In the intensive care unit (ICU), we used ice-water soaked towels over the torso. All patients were enclotracheally intubated, on mechanical ventilation and sedated and paralysed. The target temperature was 33 1 degrees C to be maintained for 12-24 h. We used simple inclusion criteria: W no response to verbal command during the ambulance transport independent of initial rhythm and cause of CA; (ii) age 18-80 years; and (iii) absence of cardiogenic shock (SBP < 90 mmLHg despite vasopressors). We compared the first 27 comatose survivors with a presumed cardiac origin of their OHCA with 34 historic controls treated just before implementation.
   Results: TH was initiated in all 27 eligible patients. The target temperature was reached in 24 patients (89% success rate). ICU-and hospital-length of stay did not differ significantly before and after implementation of TH. Hypokalemia (P = 0.001) and insulin resistance (P = 0.025) were more common and seizures (P = 0.01) less frequently reported with the use of TH. The implementation of TH was associated with a higher hospital survival rate (16/27; 59% vs. 11/34; 32%, respectively; P < 0.05). Our results indicate a population-based need of approximately seven cooling patients per 100,000 person-years served.
   Conclusion: Our simple, external cooling protocol can be implemented overnight in any system already treating post-resuscitation patients. It was well accepted, feasible and safe, but not optimal in terms of cooling rate. Neither safety concerns nor costs should be a barrier for implementation of TH.

TI  - Effects of Oxygen Concentrations on Postresuscitation Myocardial Oxidative Stress and Myocardial Function in a Rat Model of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Lipid peroxidation induced by free-radical species plays a prominent role in myocardial injury following ischemia and reperfusion. However, there is a lack of data in different oxygen concentrations on myocardial lipid peroxidation during the early phase of reperfusion. In this study, we investigated whether ventilation with medium or normal concentration of oxygen would decrease the severity of myocardial lipid peroxidation and postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study.
   Setting: University-affiliated animal research institution.
   Subjects: Sixty-three healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Interventions: Animals were randomized into three groups: 1) 100% group, 2) 50% group, and 3) 21% group. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and untreated for 8 minutes, and defibrillation was attempted after 8 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ventilation with 100%, 50%, or 21% oxygen was initiated in all groups during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 1 hour following the return of spontaneous circulation. Normoxic ventilation was maintained thereafter.
   Measurements and Main Results: Myocardial function, including ejection fraction and myocardial performance index, were measured at baseline, 4, or 72 hours after resuscitation. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 15 minutes, 1, 4, or 72 hours after resuscitation for the measurements of blood gas or biomarkers. Significantly better myocardial function and longer duration of survival were observed in the 50% group. Compared with the 21% and 100% groups, a mild hyperoxia and greater oxygen extraction with lower 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 were observed in the 50% group. Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 was positively correlated with myocardial performance index at 4 hours postresuscitation.
   Conclusions: In a rat model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, ventilation with 50% inspired oxygen during early postischemic reperfusion phase contributed to a decreased lipid peroxidation and a better myocardial function and duration of survival.

TI  - Early Identification of Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest With No Chance of Survival and Consideration for Organ Donation
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), care requirements can conflict with the need to promptly focus efforts on organ donation in patients who are pronounced dead.
   Objective: To evaluate objective criteria for identifying patients with OHCA with no chance of survival during the first minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to enable prompt orientation toward organ donation.
   Design: Retrospective assessment using OHCA data from 2 registries and 1 trial.
   Setting: France (Paris Sudden Death Expertise Center [SDEC] prospective cohort [2011 to 2014] and PRESENCE multicenter cluster randomized trial [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01009606] [2009 to 2011]) and the United States (King County, Washington, prospective cohort [2006 to 2011]).
   Patients: 1771 patients from the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort (2011 to 2012) and 5192 from the validation cohorts.
   Measurements: Evaluation of 3 objective criteria (OHCA not witnessed by emergency medical services personnel, nonshockable initial cardiac rhythm, and no return of spontaneous circu-lation before receipt of a third 1-mg dose of epinephrine), survival rate at hospital discharge among patients meeting these criteria, performance of the criteria, and number of patients eligible for organ donation.
   Results: In the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort, the survival rate among the 772 patients with OHCA who met the objective criteria was 0% (95% CI, 0.0% to 0.5%), with a specificity of 100% (CI, 97% to 100%) and a positive predictive value of 100% (CI, 99% to 100%). These results were verified in the validation cohorts. Ninety-five (12%) patients in the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort may have been eligible for organ donation.
   Limitation: Several patients had unknown outcomes.
   Conclusion: Three objective criteria enable the early identification of patients with OHCA with essentially no chance of survival and may help in decision making about the organ donation process.

TI  - A prediction tool for initial out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Improvement in predicting survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is of major medical, scientific and socioeconomic interest. The current study aimed at developing an accurate outcome-prediction tool for patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study was based on a cardiac arrest registry. From out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients (n = 1932), a set of variables established before restoration of spontaneous circulation was explored using multivariable logistic regression. To obtain reliable estimates of the classification performance the patients were allocated to training (oldest 80%) and validation (most recent 20%) sets. The main performance parameter was the area under the ROC curve (AUC), classifying patients into survivors/non-survivors after 30 days. Based on rankings of importance, a subset of variables was selected that would have the same predictive power as the entire set. This reduced-variable set was used to derive a comprehensive score to predict mortality.
   Results: The average AUC was 0.827 (CI 0.793-0.861) for a logistic regression model using all 21 variables. This was significantly better than the AUC for any single considered variable. The total amount of adrenaline, number of minutes to sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation, patient age and first rhythm had the same predictive power as all 21 variables. Based on this finding, our score was built and had excellent predictive accuracy (the AUC was 0.810), discriminating patients into 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% survival probabilities.
   Conclusion: The current results are promising to increase prognostication accuracy, and we are confident that our score will be helpful in the daily clinical routine. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence predict readiness for hospital discharge in a prospective sample of cognitively intact cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To inform screening, referral and treatment initiatives, we tested the hypothesis that emotional distress, social support, functional dependence, and cognitive impairment within 72 hours prior to discharge predict readiness for discharge in awake and alert cardiac arrest (CA) survivors. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective single-center cohort of CA survivors enrolled between 4/2021 and 9/2022. We quantified emotional distress using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge. Results: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard deviation +/- 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted b's [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Hospital systems should consider implementing routine in-hospital screening for emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence for CA survivors who are awake, alert and approaching hospital discharge, and prioritize brief in hospital treatment or post- discharge referrals.

TI  - The impact of myocardial infarction on basal and stress-induced heart rate variability and cortisol secretion in women: A pilot study
T2  - COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Coronary heart disease (CHD), of which myocardial infarction (MI) is a subtype, is the leading cause of death for women. Nonetheless, women remain neglected in CHD research, resulting in treatments and recommendations being primarily based on data collected in men. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have supported dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) following cardiac arrest and MI to promote the development of mental health disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder). However, studies addressing changes in HPAA activation under basal and stress-induced conditions in women samples have been lacking. Thus, we conducted this study to determine basal and stress-induced changes in heart rate, respiration and cortisol secretion (via 8 saliva samples) in a sample of women with a history of MI (n = 13) and a control group (n = 16). We measured altered stress reactivity through exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test. In addition, participants completed questionnaires assessing perceived stress and mental health status (i.e., anxiety and mood). Overall, our findings indicated comparable assessments of perceived situational stress in both groups. Interestingly, salivary cortisol secretion support reduced stress-induced HPAA activation related to TSST exposure in MI women compared to control counterparts. Our observations are consistent with findings supporting glucocorticoid resistance noted following MI and cardiac arrest. Akin to cardiac arrest survivors, HPAA dysregulation in MI survivors could have an impact on the development of mental health disorders. More studies are needed to address this critical question.

TI  - Rare case of diaphragmatic rupture following resuscitation in a pregnant woman first in literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
AB  - IntroductionComplications following Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are rare and usually follows a vigorous CPR or in special cases like pregnancy are due to lack of knowledge and clinical practice of how to preform CPR in pregnancy. One of this complication is diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of abdominal organs. Surgical intervention needs to be planned carefully in multidisciplinary team approach and requires fine surgical techniques for better outcome. There are few reported cases of diaphragmatic rupture after Cardiopulmonary resuscitation but none in pregnant woman.Case presentationWe report a rare case of diaphragmatic rupture in a 29-year-old pregnant patient who experienced a full-blown diaphragmatic defect and herniation of the abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity, as a complication of CPR. Following careful assessment and diagnosis, the patient underwent urgent laparotomy with reduction of the contents and primary closure of the defect. One year follow up was satisfactory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of the abdominal organs following CPR in a pregnant woman in the literature.ConclusionThe application of external cardiac massage through CPR is a life-saving procedure for the management of cardiac arrest. Common complications related to CPR include rib fractures, sternal fractures and haemothorax. Diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of the abdominal organs is a rare complication, having been reported only once in the literature (Sabzi F, Faraji R, Tanaffos 16:170-172, 2017); however, it represents a serious and life-threating event. Thus, careful evaluation of the patient by a multidisciplinary team and prompt intervention is recommended in order to improve outcomes.

TI  - Neonatal Cardiac ECMO in 2019 and Beyond
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Worldwide, the use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) for cardiac failure has been steadily increasing in the neonatal population and has become a widely accepted modality. Especially in centers caring for children with (congenital) heart disease, ECMO is now an essential part of care available for those with severe heart failure as a bridge to recovery, long term mechanical support, or transplantation. Short-term outcomes depend very much on indication. Hospital survival is similar to 40% for all neonatal cardiac ECMO patients combined. ECMO is being used for pre- and/or post-operative stabilization in neonates with congenital heart disease and in neonates with medical heart disease such as myocarditis, cardiomyopathy or refractory arrhythmias. ECMO use during resuscitation (ECPR) or for sepsis is summarized elsewhere in this special edition of Frontiers in Pediatrics. In this review article, we will discuss the indications for neonatal cardiac ECMO, the difficult process of patients' selection and identifying the right timing to initiate ECMO, as well as outline pros and cons for peripheral vs. central cannulation. We will present predictors of mortality and, very importantly, predictors of survival: what can be done to improve the outcomes for your patients. Furthermore, an overview of current insights regarding supportive care in neonatal cardiac ECMO is given. Additionally, we will address issues specific to neonates with single ventricle physiology on ECMO, for example cannulation strategies and the influence of shunt type (Blalock-Taussig shunt vs. "right ventricle to pulmonary artery" shunt). We will not only focus on short term outcomes, such as hospital survival, but also on the importance of long-term neuro-developmental outcomes, and we will end this review with suggestions for future research.

TI  - Immediate prediction of recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Short-latency somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring has been reported to be useful in predicting neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. To obtain the immediate data of SSEP and evaluate the relationship between the presence of cortical activity and the recovery of consciousness, SSEP was recorded immediately after return of spontaneous circulation.
   Design and setting: Prospective observational study in an intensive care unit of a university general hospital.
   Patients: The study included 30 patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Interventions. Basic and advanced cardiac life support, and intensive care.
   Measurements and results. SSEP were recorded between 40 and 170 min (median 65) after spontaneous circulation returned. In the initial study all 30 patients showed the Erb's point potential and the N11-13 component, while only 12 (40%) showed cortical activity. Patients were assessed neurologically for recovery of consciousness until I month after cardiac arrest. Of 12 these patients 8 recovered consciousness within 10 days, while all patients without cortical activity died without opening, their eyes.
   Conclusion: Even immediately following resuscitation, absence of cortical activity in SSEP indicates unlikelihood of recovering consciousness, while the preservation of such activity suggests that consciousness is improved. The result promises further accumulation of patients to validate the predictive ability of SSEP in managing postresuscitated patients.

TI  - Neurologic and cognitive outcomes associated with the clinical use of xenon: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
AB  - Xenon has been shown to have positive neurologic effects in various pre-clinical models. This study systematically reviewed the randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) investigating neurologic and cognitive outcomes associated with the clinical use of xenon.
   We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, elibrary.ru (for Russian studies), Google Scholar (for Russian studies), and Wanfang (for Chinese studies) for appropriate RCTs comparing neurologic or cognitive outcomes after clinical use of xenon with control treatment or with other anesthetic agents.
   Seventeen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Two studies investigated the effects of xenon plus therapeutic hypothermia to treat neonatal asphyxia or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Compared with therapeutic hypothermia alone, xenon and therapeutic hypothermia reduced cerebral white matter abnormalities after cardiac arrest but had no effect on neurocognitive outcome and mortality. Xenon had no added value when used to treat neonatal asphyxia. Thirteen RCTs compared neurocognitive effects of xenon with other anesthetic agents in surgical patients. While xenon may be associated with improved short-term (< three hours) cognitive outcome, no medium-term (six hours to three months) advantage was observed, and longer-term data are lacking. No differences in biochemical (S-100 beta, neuron-specific enolase) and neuropsychologic (attentional performance) outcomes were found with xenon compared with other anesthetic drugs. Finally, two studies suggest that brief, intermittent administration of sub-anesthetic doses of xenon to patients during the acute phase of substance withdrawal may improve neurocognitive outcomes.
   Despite promising pre-clinical results, the evidence for positive clinical neurologic and cognitive outcomes associated with xenon administration is modest. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that xenon may be associated with better neurologic outcomes compared with the standard of care therapy in certain specific clinical situations. More clinical trials are needed to determine any potential benefit linked to xenon administration.

TI  - Including patients in resuscitation decisions in Switzerland: from doing more to doing better
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Background Decisions regarding Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders remain demanding, as does including patients in the process.
   Objectives To explore physicians' justification for CPR/DNAR orders and decisions regarding patient inclusion, as well as their reports of how they initiated discussions with patients.
   Methods We administered a face-to-face survey to residents in charge of 206 patients including DNAR and CPR orders, with or without patient inclusion.
   Results Justifications were provided for 59% of DNAR orders and included severe comorbidity, patients and families' resuscitation preferences, patients' age, or poor prognosis or quality of life. Reasons to include patients in CPR/DNAR decisions were provided in 96% and 84% of cases, and were based on respect for autonomy, clinical assessment of the situation as not too severe, and the view that such inclusion was required. Reasons for not including patients were offered in 84% of cases for CPR and in 70% for DNAR. They included absent decision-making capacity, a clinical situation viewed as good (CPR) or offering little hope of recovery (DNAR), barriers to communication, or concern that discussions could be emotionally difficult or superfluous. Decisions made earlier in the patient's management were infrequently viewed as requiring revision. Residents reported a variety of introductions to discussions with patients.
   Conclusions These results provide better understanding of reasons for CPR/DNAR decisions, reasons for patient inclusion or lack thereof, and ways in which such inclusion is initiated. They also point to potential side-effects of implementing CPR/DNAR recommendations without in-depth and practical training. This should be part of a regular audit and follow-up process for such recommendations.

TI  - Tubastatin A Improves Post-Resuscitation Myocardial Dysfunction by Inhibiting NLRP3-Mediated Pyroptosis Through Enhancing Transcription Factor EB Signaling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background Myocardial dysfunction is the leading cause of early death following successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in people with cardiac arrest (CA), which is potentially driven by cell pyroptosis mediated by NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Recently, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibition was shown to exert effective myocardial protection against regional ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we investigated whether tubastatin A, a specific histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor, could improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction through the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated cell pyroptosis and its modulation mechanism. Methods and Results Healthy male white domestic swine were used to establish the model of CA/CPR in vivo, and the H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation model was used to simulate the CA/CPR process in vitro. Consequently, tubastatin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, decreased proinflammatory cytokines production and cell pyroptosis, and increased cell survival after hypoxia/reoxygenation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. In addition, tubastatin A increased the acetylated levels of transcription factor EB and its translocation to the nucleus, and its protective effect above was partly abrogated by transcription factor EB short interfering RNA after hypoxia/reoxygenation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Similarly, tubastatin A promoted cardiac transcription factor EB nuclear translocation, inhibited NLRP3-mediated cell pyroptosis, and mitigated myocardial dysfunction after CA/CPR in swine. Conclusions The inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 activity by tubastatin A limited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell pyroptosis probably through the enhancement of transcription factor EB signaling, and therefore improved myocardial dysfunction after CA/CPR.

TI  - Protecting the future: neuroprotective strategies in the pediatric intensive care unit
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose of review
   Brain injury is the leading cause of death in pediatric intensive care units, and improvements in therapy and in understanding the pathogenesis are urgently needed. This review presents recent advances in the understanding of neuroprotective therapy and brain-specific monitoring for critically ill pediatric patients.
   Recent findings
   Two neuroprotective strategies are becoming increasingly accepted as they are applied to different mechanisms of brain injury. The rapid application of hypothermia and avoidance of hyperoxia after cardiac arrest and other brain injuries are each being more commonly used as both human and animal data advocating for these approaches accumulate. In addition, more advanced and noninvasive technologies are emerging that are designed to serve as surrogates for brain function and may be used to help predict outcome. Near-infrared spectroscopy is one such commonly used technique that has prompted many studies to understand how to incorporate it into practice.
   Summary
   Protection of the pediatric brain from both a primary insult and the common subsequent secondary injury is essential for improving long-term neurologic outcomes. Whereas monitoring technology is being constantly modified, it must be proven efficacious in order to understand the utility of new and presumed neuroprotective therapies like hypothermia and avoidance of hyperoxia.

TI  - Early Results of Total Coronary Revascularization via Left Anterior Thoracotomy
T2  - THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON
AB  - Background Avoidance of sternotomy while preserving complete revascularization remains challenging in multivessel coronary disease. Technical issues and in-hospital outcomes of total coronary revascularization via a small left anterior thoracotomy (TCRAT) in nonselected patients with multivessel disease are reported.Methods From November 2019 to September 2021, coronary artery bypass grafting via left anterior minithoracotomy on cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic cardiac arrest was performed in 102 patients (92 males; 67 +/- 10 [42-87] years). Slings were placed around ascending aorta, left pulmonary veins, and inferior vena cava for exposure of lateral and inferior ventricular wall. All patients had multivessel coronary disease (three-vessel disease: n = 72; two-vessel disease: n = 30; left main stenosis: n = 44). We included patients at old age (> 80 years, 14.7%), with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 30%, 6.9%), massive obesity (body mass index > 35, 11.6%), and at increased risk (EuroSCORE II > 4, 15.7%).Results Left internal thoracic artery ( n = 101), radial artery (n = 83), and saphenous vein (n = 39) grafts were used for total (61.8%) or multiple (19.6%) arterial grafting. A total of 323 distal anastomoses (3.2 +/- 0.7 [2-5] per patient) were performed to revascularize left anterior descending (100%), circumflex (91.2%), and right coronary artery (67.7%). Complete revascularization was achieved in 95.1%. In-hospital mortality was 2.9%, stroke rate was 1.0%, myocardial infarction rate was 2.9%, and repeat revascularization rate was 2.0%.Conclusion This novel surgical technique allows complete coronary revascularization in the broad majority of multivessel disease patients without sternotomy. TCRAT can be introduced into clinical routine safely. Long-term results remain to be investigated.

TI  - Implementation of a Pediatric Emergency Department Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality Bundle
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have previously demonstrated that standardized handoff from prehospital to hospital clinicians can improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in a pediatric emergency department (ED). We leveraged our previous quality improvement initiative to standardize performance of a bundle of 5 discrete aspects of resuscitation for OHCA patients: intravenous or intraosseous catheter (IV/IO) access, epinephrine administration, advanced airway placement, end-tidal capnography (ETCO2) application, and cardiac rhythm verbalization. We aimed to reduce time to completion of the bundle from 302 seconds at baseline to less than 120 seconds within 1 year.
   METHODS: A multidisciplinary team performed video-based review of actual OHCA resuscitations in our pediatric ED. We designed interventions aimed at key drivers of bundle performance. Interventions included specific roles and responsibilities and a standardized choreography for each bundle element. To assess the effect of the interventions, time to performance of each bundle element was measured by standardized review of video recordings from our resuscitation bay. Balancing measures were time off the chest and time to defibrillator pad placement.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 56 cases of OHCA from May 2019 through May 2021. Time to bundle completion improved from a baseline of 302 seconds to 147 seconds. Four of 5 individual bundle elements also demonstrated significant improvement. These improvements were sustained without any negative impact on balancing measures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Standardized choreography for the initial minutes of ED cardiac arrest resuscitation shows promise to decrease time to crucial interventions in children presenting to the pediatric ED with OHCA.

TI  - Early neuroprotection after cardiac arrest
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review Despite decades of advances in prehospital and in-hospital medical care, patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest continue to have poor neurologic and cardiac function following otherwise successful resuscitation. This review examines the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies currently under development to activate the post-conditioning pathways and thereby improve survival and function. Recent findings Post-conditioning utilizes the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) and survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) pathways as common avenues to promote cell survival and function. Ischemic post-conditioning and multiple medications activate these pathways resulting in improved cardiac and neurological function in animal models of cardiac arrest. Detailed knowledge of the RISK and SAFE pathways can be used for further drug development. Human studies are now underway to test some of these strategies, but further clinical trials are necessary to translate these therapies to clinical practice.

TI  - The Association Between Functional Status and Health-Related Quality of Life Following Discharge from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Despite one third of children with acquired brain injury (ABI) experiencing new functional impairments following critical care admission, there is limited research investigating the impact of new functional impairments on overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) or among important HRQOL domains. We aimed to investigate the association between new functional impairments, measured by the Functional Status Scale (FSS), and HRQOL in pediatric patients with ABI after critical care. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of 275 children aged 2 months to 18 years with ABI. The primary exposure evaluated was change in FSS from baseline at hospital discharge, categorized per prior work (no change, 1-2 point increase, and >= 3 point increase). The primary outcome was overall HRQOL 6 months after hospital discharge, measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) total score. Secondary outcomes were PedsQL domain scores. PedsQL total and domain scores were transformed into age-standardized z scores for analyses. Multiple linear regression models evaluated the association between FSS change category and HRQOL (overall and domain z scores) when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics and were reported as beta-coefficients with 95% confidence intervals. Results Complete data were analyzed for 195 (71%) children, including 127 with traumatic brain injury. New functional impairment was common with 32 (16%) patients experiencing FSS increases >= 3, 50 (26%) patients with FSS increases of 1-2 points, and 113 (58%) patients with no change from prehospital baseline. The majority of children (63%) demonstrated HRQOL ratings >= 1 standard deviation below healthy age-based standards (z scores <= - 1). Regression models demonstrated older age, female sex, presence of comorbidities, and preadmission cardiopulmonary resuscitation were all significantly associated with poorer overall HRQOL (all p < 0.05). FSS increase >= 3 at discharge was significantly associated with worse overall HRQOL at follow-up (beta = - 1.07; 95% confidence interval = - 1.63 to - 0.52) when controlling for the aforementioned significant factors, and significantly improved model fit (p value for change = 0.001). Similar findings in secondary analyses were found for physical domain scores, with FSS increase showing a significant association with worse physical HRQOL scores and improvements in model fit. Change in FSS was not significantly associated with other HRQOL domain scores (emotional, social, school, psychosocial). Conclusions Many children with ABI after critical care experience new functional impairments (FSS increases) and worse HRQOL than healthy peers. FSS increase at discharge is a significant risk factor for worse HRQOL in the months after hospital discharge and improves HRQOL models beyond illness and demographic variables alone.

TI  - 1H NMR-metabolomics: Can they be a useful tool in our understanding of cardiac arrest?
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: This review focuses on the presentation of the emerging technology of metabolomics, a promising tool for the detection of identifying the unrevealed biological pathways that lead to cardiac arrest.
   Data sources: The electronic bases of PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched. Research terms were identified using the MESH database and were combined thereafter. Initial search terms were "cardiac arrest", "cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "post-cardiac arrest syndrome" combined with "metabolomics".
   Results: Metabolomics allow the monitoring of hundreds of metabolites from tissues or body fluids and already influence research in the field of cardiac metabolism. This approach has elucidated several pathophysiological mechanisms and identified profiles of metabolic changes that can be used to follow the disease processes occurring in the peri-arrest period. This can be achieved through leveraging the strengths of unbiased metabolome-wide scans, which include thousands of final downstream products of gene transcription, enzyme activity and metabolic products of extraneously administered substances, in order to identify a metabolomic fingerprint associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest.
   Conclusion: Although this technology is still under development, metabolomics is a promising tool for elucidating biological pathways and discovering clinical biomarkers, strengthening the efforts for optimizing both the prevention and treatment of cardiac arrest.

TI  - Sedation, temperature and pressure after cardiac arrest and resuscitation-The STEPCARE trial: A statistical analysis plan
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - BackgroundBasic management for patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest and are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after resuscitation includes setting targets for blood pressure and managing sedation and temperature. However, optimal targets and management are unknown.MethodsThe STEPCARE (Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation) trial is a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, factorial, superiority trial in which sedation, temperature, and blood pressure strategies will be studied in three separate comparisons (SED-CARE, TEMP-CARE, and MAP-CARE). The trial population will be adults admitted to intensive care who are comatose after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes will be poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6), Health-Related Quality of Life using EQ-VAS, and specific serious adverse events in the intensive care unit predefined for each trial. All outcomes will be assessed at 6 months after randomization. The prognosticators, outcome assessors, statisticians, data managers, steering group, and manuscript writers will be blinded to treatment allocation. This statistical analysis plan includes a comprehensive description of the statistical analyses, handling of missing data, and assessments of underlying statistical assumptions. Analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, that is, all randomized participants with available data will be included. The analyses will be performed independently by two statisticians following the present plan.ConclusionThis statistical analysis plan describes the statistical analyses for the STEPCARE trial in detail. The aim of this predefined statistical analysis plan is to minimize the risk of analysis bias.

TI  - Effectiveness of a 30-min CPR self-instruction program for lay responders: a controlled randomized study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The length of current 4-h classes in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a barrier to widespread dissemination of CPR training. The effectiveness of video-based self-instruction (VSI) has been demonstrated in several studies; however, the effectiveness of this method with older adults is not certain. Although older adults are most likely to witness out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, these potential rescuers are underrepresented in traditional classes. We evaluated a VSI program that comprised a 22-min video, an inflatable training manikin, and an audio prompting device with individuals 40-70 years old. The hypotheses were that VSI results in performance of basic CPR skills superior to that of untrained learners and similar to that of learners in Heartsaver classes.
   Methods: Two hundred and eighty-five adults between 40 and 70 years old who had had no CPR training within the past 5 years were assigned to an untrained control group, Heartsaver training, or one of three versions of VSI. Basic CPR skills were measured by instructor assessment and by a sensored manikin.
   Results: The percentage of subjects who assessed unresponsiveness, called the emergency telephone number 911, provided adequate ventilation, proper hand placement, and adequate compression depth was significantly better (P < 0.05) for the VSI groups than for untrained controls. VSI subjects tended to have better overall performance and better ventilation performance than did Heartsaver subjects.
   Conclusions. Older adults learned the fundamental skills of CPR with this training program in about half an hour. If properly distributed, this type of training could produce a significant increase in the number of lay responders who can perform CPR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Compression force-depth relationship during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Recent clinical studies reporting the high frequency of inadequate chest compression depth (< 38 mm) during CPR, have prompted the question if adult human chest characteristics render it difficult to attain the recommended compression depth in certain patients.
   Material and methods: Using a specially designed monitor/defibrillator equipped with a sternal pad fitted with an accelerometer and a pressure sensor, compression force and depth was measured during CPR in 91 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.
   Results: There was a strong non-linear relationship between the force of compression and depth achieved. Mean applied force for all patients was 30.3 +/- 8.2 kg and mean absolute compression depth 42 8 mm. For 87 of 91 patients 38 mm compression depth was obtained with less than 50 kg. Stiffer chests were compressed more forcefully than softer chests (p < 0.001), but softer chests were compressed more deeply than stiffer chests (p=0.001). The force needed to reach 38mm compression depth (F38) and mean compression force were higher for mates than for females: 29.8 +/- 14.5 kg versus 22.5 +/- 10.2 kg (p < 0.02), and 32.0 +/- 8.3 kg versus 27.0 +/- 7.0 kg (p < 0.01), respectively. There was no significant variation in F38 or compression depth with age, but a significant 1.5 kg mean decrease in applied force for each 10 years increase in age (p < 0.05). Chest stiffness decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) with an increasing number of compressions performed. Average residual force during decompression was 1.7 +/- 1.0 kg, corresponding to an average residual depth of 3 +/- 2 mm.
   Conclusion: In most out-of-hospitaL cardiac arrest victims adequate chest compression depth can be achieved by a force < 50kg, indicating that an average sized and fit rescuer should be able to perform effective CPR in most adult patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Flipped Classroom Model for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training Among Novice Nursing Students in Oman: Exploratory Quasi-Experimental One-Group Pretest/Post-Test Design
T2  - SAGE OPEN NURSING
AB  - Background: The flipped classroom model (FC) has gained prominence in nursing education for its emphasis on active, student-centered learning. While global evidence supports its efficacy in skill-based training such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), limited studies have evaluated its impact within Middle Eastern nursing programs, particularly in Oman. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the FC approach in enhancing CPR knowledge, skills, and learner perception among first-year nursing students. Methods:Exploratory quasi-experimental one-group pretest/post-test design was conducted among 177 first-year nursing students enrolled in the Fundamentals of Nursing I course at the University of Buraimi, Oman. Participants completed preclass materials, followed by collaborative case-based discussions and skill demonstrations. CPR knowledge was assessed through multiple-choice tests, skills through a standardized checklist, and perceptions using a validated Likert-scale questionnaire. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in CPR knowledge scores from pretest (M = 6.81, SD = 3.20) to post-test (M = 10.88, SD = 2.00; p < .001). Knowledge scores moderately correlated with CPR skill performance (r = .209, p = .005), though no significant correlations were found with perception scores. Female students demonstrated significantly higher CPR performance than males (p = .023). Overall, students expressed positive perceptions of the FC model. Conclusion: The FC approach significantly improved CPR knowledge and moderately influenced skill acquisition among novice nursing students, irrespective of academic standing. These findings suggest potential benefits of integrating FC methods but should be interpreted as exploratory within a single-group design. Support the integration of active, student-centered methodologies in nursing education across the Middle East. Further research is recommended to explore long-term retention and clinical application.

TI  - Ventilatory targets after cardiac arrest
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - The mortality of postcardiac arrest patients has gradually reduced in years but it still is as high as 50%, despite advancements in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, i.e. revascularization and therapeutic moderate hypothermia. However, recent evidence suggests that other therapeutic interventions aimed to minimize progressive deterioration of the brain and other organs function might be helpful to reduce in-hospital mortality and improve neurologic outcome as well as quality of life after cardiac arrest. In this article, we discuss the role of ventilator management on the prognosis after cardiac arrest. We performed a meta-analysis showing that in adult patients not only hypcoda but also hyperoxia was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, while hypercapnia and hypocapnia worse neurologic outcome. In pediatric patients, hypoxia and hyperoxia were not associated with higher in.:hospital mortality, while hypocapnia and hypercabia with higher in-hospital mortality worse neurologic outcome. We propose a general bundle for ventilator treatment after cardiac arrest, including: 1) therapeutic hypothermia for 12-24 hours; 2) mean arterial pressure >=.65-75 mmHg; 3) PaO2 between 60-200 mmHg and PCO2 betweeri 30 and 50 mmHg; 4) protective MV with tidal volume of 6-8 mL/kg and positive end expiratory pressure of between 5-10 cmH(2)O; 5) monitoring of respiratory mechanics, extravascular lung water, hemodynamics, non-invasive transcranial Doppler and intracranial pressure monitoring; and 6) others supportive care, i.e. blood sugar and seizures control.

TI  - Tension pneumoperitoneum complicating gastric rupture following cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Gastric rupture with tension pneumoperitoneum (TP) is a rare surgical complication of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We present a case of TP after an untrained lay rescuer provided chest compression. A 63-year-old woman with history of depression was found unresponsive after she consumed antidepressant drugs. The duration of compression only CPR was 7 minutes. On arrival to the emergency department, femoral pulsation was not palpable. Subcutaneous emphysema was palpable in both shoulder and neck area. Abdomen was massively distended, rigid, tympanic and hyper-resonant to percussion. Chest radiography revealed massive air collection in abdominal cavity and TP was diagnosed. Immediate percutaneousgaged needle decompression of the peritoneum with an 18-gaged catheter was attempted. After needle decompression, haemodynamic instability was restored. She underwent exploratory laparotomy and multiple gastric perforations were found and repaired. This case highlights both high index of suspicion and prompt decompression of TP is needed for gastric rupture complicating bystander CPR.

TI  - ACUTE BLEEDING FROM PEPTIC-ULCERS - HOW TO RESTORE HEMOSTASIS AND PREVENT RECURRENCE
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE
AB  - Prompt resuscitation is the cornerstone in management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy has become the diagnostic procedure of choice because it offers the chance for hemostatic therapy. For patients in whom endoscopy reveals actively bleeding peptic ulcers or nonbleeding ulcers with visible vessels, endoscopic therapy decreases the likelihood that the patient will bleed further, require surgery, or die. Patients with critical illnesses requiring intensive care should receive prophylaxis against stress ulcers.
   Long-term management of bleeding peptic ulcer disease includes educating patients to quit smoking, avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and comply with maintenance therapy with a histamine2 receptor antagonist.

TI  - Impact of Effective Management Strategies on Patients With the Most Extreme Phenotypic Expression of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Advances in treatment options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) have proven effective in many patients for promoting favorable long-term outcomes. Whether this expectation is similar for patients with the most extreme expression of massive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a particularly aggressive form of the disease is unresolved. Of 1,766 consecutive HC patients presenting to Tufts HC Institute (2004 to 2015), 92 were identified with extreme LV wall thickness (30 to 48 mm), and compared with 1,674 HC patients with less marked hypertrophy (13 to 29 mm). Follow-up assessment was over 5.3 +/- 3.4 years. Patients with massive LV hypertrophy (n = 92) had higher sudden death event rates (3.0%/year) than did patients with lesser hypertrophy (0.8%/year; p < 0.001). In 16 of the 92 patients (17%), potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia were successfully aborted by primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy at 30 +/- 13 years (n = 11), or by resuscitated cardiac arrest with external defibrillation (n = 5) and later by secondary prevention interventions (n = 3); no patient experienced arrhythmic sudden death. Aborted sudden death events (3.0%/year) exceeded HC-related mortality by 7-fold (n = 2; 0.4%/year; p < 0.001). European Society of Cardiology risk score would have failed to identify 60% of patients with arrhythmic sudden death events, leaving them exposed to sudden death without ICDs. In addition, 35 patients required surgical myectomy for progressive heart failure due to LV outflow obstruction (improved to NYHA I/II in 30). Eighty-eight (96%) of the 92 patients have survived to age 38 +/- 14 years (23% >= 50 years). All-cause mortality did not differ from an age and gender-matched general population (p = 0.62). In conclusion, in this referral-based population, patients with the most extreme expression of HC are at increased arrhythmic sudden death risk reliably prevented with prophylactic ICDs. Progressive heart failure secondary to outflow obstruction was reversible with surgical myectomy. Despite extreme phenotypic expression, with contemporary treatment interventions young HC patients have an opportunity to achieve extended survival with good quality of life. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors with inconclusive coronary angiogram: Impact of cardiovascular magnetic resonance on clinical management and decision-making
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Non-traumatic out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the leading cause of death worldwide, mainly due to acute coronary syndromes. Urgent coronary angiography with view to revascularisation is recommended in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Diagnosis and management of patients with inconclusive coronary angiogram (unobstructed coronaries or unidentified culprit lesion) is challenging. We sought to assess the role of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) in the diagnosis and management of OHCA survivors with an inconclusive coronary angiogram.
   Methods and results: This is a retrospective multicentre CMR registry analysis of OHCA survivors with an inconclusive angiogram. Clinical, ECG and multi-modality imaging data were analysed. Clinical impact of CMR was defined as a change in diagnosis or management. Out of 174 OHCA survivors referred for CMR, 110 patients (63%, 84 male, median age 58) had an inconclusive angiogram. CMR identified a pathologic substrate in 76/110 patients (69%): ischemic heart disease was found in 45 (41%) and non-ischemic heart disease in 31 (28%). A structurally normal heart was found in 25 patients (23%) and non-specific findings in 9 (8%). As compared to trans-thoracic echocardiogram, CMR proved to be superior in identifying a pathologic substrate (69% vs 54%, p = 0.018). The CMR study carried a clinical impact in 70% of patients, determining a change in diagnosis in 25%, in management in 29% and a change in both in 16%.
   Conclusions: CMR showed a promising role in the diagnostic work-up of OHCA survivors with inconclusive angiogram and its wider use should be considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Primary Outcome Measures in Pediatric Septic Shock Trials: A Systematic Review
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To evaluate all published pediatric randomized controlled trials of patients with septic shock from any cause to examine the outcome measures used, the strengths and limitations of these measurements and whether the trial outcomes met feasibility criteria.
   Data Sources: We used a previously published database of pediatric critical care randomized controlled trials (PICUtrials. net) derived from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL.
   Study Selection: We included randomized controlled trials of interventions to children admitted to a PICU with septic or dengue hemorrhagic shock which were published in English.
   Data Extraction: Study characteristics and outcomes were retrieved by two independent reviewers with disagreement being resolved by a third reviewer. We defined feasibility as 1) recruitment of at least 90% of the targeted sample size and agreement of the observed outcome rate in the control group with the rate used for the sample size calculation to within 10% or 2) finding of a statistically significant difference in an interim or final analysis.
   Data Synthesis: Nineteen of 321 identified articles were selected for review. Fourteen of 19 studies (74%) provided an a priori definition of their primary outcome measure in their "Methods section."Mortality rate was the most commonly reported primary outcome (8/14; 57%), followed by duration of shock (4/14; 29%) followed by organ failure (1/14; 7%). Only three of 19 included trials met feasibility criteria.
   Conclusions: Our review found that use of mortality alone as a primary outcome in pediatric septic shock trials was associated with significant limitations and that long-term patient-centered outcomes were not used in this setting. Composite outcomes incorporating mortality and long-term outcomes should be explored for use in future pediatric septic shock trials.

TI  - Long-term liver damage due to trauma
T2  - CHIRURG
AB  - Severe trauma has a major influence on the visceral organs, especially on the liver. Splanchnic hypotension leads to necrosis of the bile duct cells as well as to damage to hepatocytes. Furthermore, the liver is a very immunologically active organ so that damage to the liver can increase the amount of proinflammatory cytokines. The major complication of post-traumatic damage to the liver is secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SCC) a highly progressive disease for which there is no sufficient therapy except liver transplantation. Therefore it is very important to put all efforts into avoiding posttraumatic liver damage from the very beginning. A sophisticated resuscitation therapy is the most important aspect. Direct peritoneal volume resuscitation is a promising possibility to improve perfusion of the visceral organs. Other possibilities are substitution with 17 beta-estradiol as a strongly vasoactive hormone with a positive effect on liver perfusion and interleukin-10 as modulator of the immune reaction caused by the liver.

TI  - Pediatric Perioperative Life Support
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - Pediatric advanced life support training and guidelines are typically designed for first-responders and out-of-hospital resuscitation. Guidelines and scenarios that are more applicable to the perioperative environment would be beneficial for anesthesiologists. The goal of this article is to review resuscitation of pediatric patients during the perioperative period. We use a format that focuses on preresuscitation preparation, resuscitation techniques, and postresuscitation management in the perioperative period. In an effort to provide information of maximum benefit to anesthesiologists, we include common pediatric perioperative arrest scenarios with detailed description of their management. We also provide a section on postresuscitation management and review the techniques for maintaining the child's hemodynamic and metabolic stability. Finally, 3 appendices are included: an example of an intraoperative arrest record that provides feedback for interventions; a table of key medications for pediatric perioperative-esuscitation; and a review of defibrillator use and simulation exercises to promote effective-defibrillation.

TI  - What factors delay initiation of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? Results from an analysis of 200 recorded ambulance calls
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Background Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is often not initiated promptly enough in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, even when call-handlers provide instructions. Identifying the critical, potentially modifiable, barriers to CPR is essential. Our aim was to identify factors associated with delays (1) positioning patient flat and (2) initiating CPR in recordings of cardiac arrest calls and to explore potentially modifiable behavioural factors.Methods Retrospective analysis of 200 call recordings to the Scottish Ambulance Service January 2019-December 2020 during which dispatcher-assisted CPR instructions were provided. Potential barriers were coded inductively. Log rank tests were used to explore differences in 'time to position patient flat' and 'time to initiate CPR' depending on the presence/absence of potential barriers identified.Results A random sample of 200 calls were selected from 11 275 potentially eligible calls. Patients in those calls were mostly male (61%), most aged 40-80s; callers were mostly female spouses. Time to position patient flat: median 40 s (IQR: 15.5-82.0), time to initiate CPR: median 50 s (IQR: 36-92). Between 1 and 11 potential barriers were identified in calls (median=4, IQR:2-6). The most common barriers identified were communication (48%), emotion (45.5%) and physical challenges (38.5%). Various physical challenges, concern patient too heavy, concern that it was too late/futile, concern about physical ability, concern about doing harm and caller being 'upset' were significantly associated with delays to positioning the patient flat. Callers 'not knowing how' to do CPR; expressing concerns about doing harm, expressing anger and various physical challenges including concerns about ability were associated with delays in initiating CPR. Many significant barriers are potentially amenable to behavioural techniques.Results A random sample of 200 calls were selected from 11 275 potentially eligible calls.

Callers 'not knowing how' to do CPR; expressing concerns about doing harm, expressing anger and various physical challenges including concerns about ability were associated with delays in initiating CPR. Many significant barriers are potentially amenable to behavioural techniques.Conclusion Barriers to 'positioning the patient flat' and 'initiating CPR' are not the same. Concerns vary, and so identifying and addressing the specific concerns for individual callers at each stage might facilitate earlier CPR. Many of the issues delaying CPR are potentially modifiable with behavioural techniques.

TI  - Association between high and low ambient temperature and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with cardiac etiology in Japan: a case-crossover study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between high and low temperature and out-of- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with cardiac etiology.
   Methods: The study was conducted under a case-crossover design. Subjects were 97,500 patients aged 40 years or older with OHCA having a cardiac etiology in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka Prefecture from 2005 to 2012. We used national data with an Utstein-style resuscitation registration. Temperature was categorized into five categories with cut points of 5, 10, 24, and 30 degrees C. The reference category was 10-23.9 degrees C. Conditional logistic regression was used with adjustment for daily means of relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and daily amount of precipitation and hours of daylight.
   Results: Exposure to high temperature (>= 30 degrees C) increased the risk of OHCA (OR = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.18). Further, low temperature (< 5 degrees C) and relatively low temperature (5-9.9 degrees C) were also associated with OHCA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.16-1.25; OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.13, respectively). The temperature-OHCA association curves were U-shaped or J-shaped, and the association was more prominent among those aged 80 years or older.
   Conclusion: This study shows that the occurrence of OHCA with cardiac etiology is associated with low temperature. In addition, the occurrence is also associated with high temperature in those aged 80 years or older.

TI  - Urban and Suburban Hospital System Implementation of Multipoint Access Targeted Temperature Management in Postcardiac Arrest Patients
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cardiac arrest is a prominent cause of death for adults in the United States. Postcardiac arrest syndrome can have devastating consequences ranging from mild memory impairment to permanent neurologic deficits. Only 9.5% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients survive to discharge. Since 2002, scientific literature has supported the use of targeted temperature management (TTM) for improved outcomes in comatose OHCA patients. There is limited use of TTM protocols for cardiac arrest survivors in clinical practice, as translation of evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice remains a complicated task. The authors' goal was to utilize the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework prospectively to develop a TTM program for OHCA survivors in two community hospitals. A collaborative team of providers from an urban hospital and a suburban hospital joined forces to bring evidence into practice with the endpoint of initiating TTM in the emergency, cardiac catheterization, and intensive care units. TTM was successfully implemented with multiple points of access within two community hospitals. The investigative program cared for 25 OHCA patients during the first year of inception. The TTM patients who survived to discharge displayed a trend of improved neurologic outcome based on the modified Rankin scale and a slight increase in the survival to discharge rate.

TI  - Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 alleviates brain injury following cardiac arrest by promoting autophagy in brain microvascular endothelial cells
T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - IntroductionBrain injury is a common sequela following cardiac arrest (CA), with up to 70% of hospitalized patients dying from it. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) play a crucial role in post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI). However, the effects and mechanisms of targeting BMVEC energy metabolism to mitigate brain injury remain unclear.MethodsWe established a mouse model of cardiac arrest by injecting potassium chloride into the right internal jugular vein. Mass spectrometry detected targeted changes in short-chain fatty acids and energy metabolism metabolites in the CA/CPR group compared to the sham group. Mice with overexpressed ACSS2 in BMVECs were created using an AAV-BR1 vector, and ACSS2 knockout mice were generated using the CRE-LOXP system. The oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model was established to investigate the role and mechanisms of ACSS2 in endothelial cells in vitro.ResultsMetabolomics analysis revealed disrupted cerebral energy metabolism post-CA/CPR, with decreased acetyl-CoA and amino acids. Overexpression of ACSS2 in BMVECs increased acetyl-CoA levels and improved neurological function. Vascular endothelial cell-specific ACSS2 knockout mice exhibited reduced aortic sprouting in vitro. Overexpression of ACSS2 improved endothelial dysfunction following oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) and influenced autophagy by interacting with transcription factor EB (TFEB) and modulating the AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha) pathway.ConclusionOur study shows that ACSS2 modulates the biological functions of BMVECs by promoting autophagy. Enhancing energy metabolism via ACSS2 may target PCABI treatment development.

TI  - COMMENCE trial (Comparing hypOtherMic teMperaturEs duriNg hemiarCh surgEry): a randomized controlled trial of mild vs moderate hypothermia on patient outcomes in aortic hemiarch surgery with anterograde cerebral perfusion
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: Aortic arch surgery remains the only viable life-saving treatment for aortic arch disease. However, the necessity for cessation of systemic blood flow with hypothermic cardiac arrest carries substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, including poor neurological outcomes and kidney failure. While uncontrolled studies have suggested the safety of operating at warmer temperatures, significant variables remain un-investigated, supporting the need for a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to produce evidence-based guidelines for perfusion strategies in aortic surgery. This study proposes a multi-center RCT in order to compare outcomes of warmer hypothermic strategies during aortic hemiarch surgery on a composite endpoint of neurologic and acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods/design: This is a prospective multi-center, single-blind two-arm RCT comparing mild (32 degrees C) versus moderate (26 degrees C) hypothermic cardiac arrest in patients (n = 282) undergoing hemiarch surgery with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). The primary endpoint is a composite of neurological injury (incidence of transient ischemic attack and/or stroke) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 1 or higher AKI. Secondary outcomes include death, cardiopulmonary bypass time, bleeding, transfusion rates, prolonged mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, length of stay, and quality of life measures. Patients will undergo 1:1 block randomization to each treatment arm on day of surgery. Sequence of operation will be at the surgeon's discretion with mandatory guidelines for temperature and ACP administration. Perioperative management will occur as per enrolling center standard of care. Neurocognitive function will be assessed for neurological injury using validated neurological screening tests: NIHSS, MOCA, BI, and MRS throughout patient follow-up. Diagnosis and classification of AKI will be based on rising creatinine values as per the KDIGO criteria. Study duration for each patient will be 60 +/- 14 days. Discussion: It is hoped that performing hemiarch surgery using mild hypothermia (32 degrees C) and selective ACP will result in a 15% absolute risk reduction in the composite outcomes. The potential of this risk reduction will translate into improved patient outcomes, survival, and long-term financial savings to the health care system. In addition, the results of this trial will be used to create the first-ever guidelines for temperature management strategy during aortic surgery.

TI  - Are Canadians more willing to provide chest-compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)?a nation-wide public survey
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves the likelihood of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), yet it is performed in only 30% of cases. The 2010 guidelines promote chest-compression-only bystander CPRa change intended to increase willingness to provide CPR.
   Objectives 1) To determine whether the Canadian general public is more willing to perform chest-compression-only CPR compared to traditional CPR; 2) to characterize public knowledge of OHCA; and 3) to identify barriers and facilitators to bystander CPR.
   Methods A 32-item survey assessing resuscitation knowledge, and willingness to provide CPR were disseminated in five Canadian regions. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize response distribution. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess shifts in intention to provide CPR.
   Results A total of 428 completed surveys were analysed. When presented with a scenario of being a bystander in an OHCA, a greater proportion of respondents were willing to provide chest-compression-only CPR compared to traditional CPR for all victims (61.5% v. 39.7%, p<0.001), when the victim was a stranger (55.1% v. 38.8%, p<0.001), or when the victim was an unkempt individual (47.9% v. 28.5%, p<0.001). When asked to describe an OHCA, 41.4% said the heart stopped beating, and 20.8% said it was a heart attack. Identified barriers and facilitators included fear of litigation and lack of skill confidence.
   Conclusions This study identified gaps in knowledge, which may impair the ability of bystanders to act in OHCA. Most respondents expressed greater willingness to provide chest-compression-only CPR, but this was mediated by victim characteristics, skill confidence, and recognition of a cardiac arrest.
   RESUME
   Contexte Les manOEuvres de reanimation cardiopulmonaire (RCP), effectuees par les passants ameliorent les probabilites de survie en cas d'arret cardiaque survenu en milieu extrahospitalier (ACMEH); pourtant, les manOEuvres ne sont effectuees que dans 30 % des cas. Dans les lignes directrices de 2010, on favorise les manOEuvres de RCP par compressions thoraciques seules faites par les passants, un changement visant a accroitre la disposition a pratiquer la RCP.
   Objectifs L'etude visait a : 1) determiner si les Canadiens en general etaient plus disposes a pratiquer les manOEuvres de RCP par compressions thoraciques seules que selon la methode classique de RCP; 2) caracteriser les connaissances du public sur l'ACMEH; 3) cerner les obstacles a la pratique de la RCP par les passants, ainsi que les facteurs facilitants.
   Methode Un questionnaire d'enquete en 32 points, portant sur les connaissances relatives a la reanimation et sur la disposition a effectuer la RCP a ete envoye dans cinq regions du Canada. Les auteurs ont utilise des statistiques descriptives afin de caracteriser la ventilation des reponses, et ont eu recours a l'analyse de regression logistique afin d'evaluer les changements d'intention quant a la pratique de la RCP.
   Resultats Ont ete analyses 428 questionnaires d'enquete remplis. Dans les scenarios d'ACMEH soumis, dans lesquels les personnes interrogees etaient des passants, une proportion plus grande de repondants etait disposee a pratiquer la RCP par compressions thoraciques seules que selon la methode classique, et ce, chez toutes les victimes (61,5 % contre [c.] 39,7 %; p<0,001), chez les inconnus (55,1 % c. 38,8 %; p<0,001) ou chez les personnes a l'apparence negligee (47,9 % c. 28,5 %; p<0,001). On a egalement demande aux participants de decrire ce qu'etait l'ACMEH : 41,4 % ont affirme que le cOEur arretait de battre et 20,8 %, qu'il s'agissait d'une crise cardiaque. Figuraient parmi les obstacles a la pratique de la RCP la crainte de poursuite et le manque de confiance en ses capacites.
   Conclusions L'etude a permis de relever des lacunes en matiere de connaissances, ce qui peut certes faire hesiter les passants avant d'agir devant un ACMEH. La plupart des repondants ont montre une disposition accrue a pratiquer la RCP par compressions thoraciques seules, mais les caracteristiques des victimes, le manque de confiance en ses capacites et la non-reconnaissance de l'arret cardiaque en ont quelque peu attenue la portee.

TI  - Neurologic Outcomes After Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Systematic Review
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: The goal of this systematic review of the literature was to summarize neurologic outcomes following neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
   Data Sources: We conducted electronic searches of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane, and EMBASE.
   Study Selection: Inclusion criteria included publication dates 2000-2016, patient ages 0-18 years, and use of standardized measures to evaluate outcomes after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
   Data Extraction: We identified 3,497 unique citations; 60 full-text articles were included in the final review.
   Data Synthesis: Studies evaluated patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (7), cardiac disease (8), cardiac arrest (13), and mixed populations (32). Follow-up was conducted at hospital discharge in 10 studies (17%) and at a median of 26 months (interquartile range, 8-61 mo) after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 50 studies (83%). We found 55 outcome measures that assessed overall health and function (4), global cognitive ability (7), development (4), motor function (5), adaptive function (2), behavior/mood (6), hearing (2), quality of life (2), school achievement (5), speech and language (6), learning and memory (4), and attention and executive function (8). Overall, 10% to as many as 50% of children scored more than 2 sds below the population mean on cognitive testing. Behavior problems were identified in 16-46% of children tested, and severe motor impairment was reported in 12% of children. Quality of life of former extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients evaluated at school age or adolescence ranged from similar to healthy peers, to 31-53% having scores more than 1 sd below the population mean.
   Conclusions: This systematic review of the literature suggests that children who have undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation suffer from a wide range of disabilities. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity in pathologies, outcome measures, and age at follow-up, underscoring the importance of developing and employing a core set of outcomes measures in future extracorporeal membrane oxygenation studies.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia promotes cerebral blood flow recovery and brain homeostasis after resuscitation from cardiac arrest in a rat model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that therapeutic hypothermia (TH), when applied as soon as possible after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (CA), results in better neurological outcome. This study tested the hypothesis that TH would promote cerebral blood flow (CBF) restoration and its maintenance after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from CA. Twelve Wistar rats resuscitated from 7-min asphyxial CA were randomized into two groups: hypothermia group (7 H, n = 6), treated with mild TH (33-34celcius) immediately after ROSC and normothermia group (7 N, n = 6,37.0 +/- 0.5celcius). Multiple parameters including mean arterial pressure, CBF, electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. The neurological outcomes were evaluated using electrophysiological (information quantity, IQ, of EEG) methods and a comprehensive behavior examination (neurological deficit score, NDS). TH consistently promoted better CBF restoration approaching the baseline levels in the 7 H group as compared with the 7 N group. CBF during the first 5-30 min post ROSC of the two groups was 7 H:90.5% +/- 3.4% versus 7 N:76.7% +/- 3.5% (P < 0.01). Subjects in the 7 H group showed significantly better IQ scores after ROSC and better NDS scores at 4 and 24 h. Early application of TH facilitates restoration of CBF back to baseline levels after CA, which in turn results in the restoration of brain electrical activity and improved neurological outcome.

TI  - Public access programs for defibrillation: the over twenty-year experience of Progetto Vita in Piacenza, current legislative aspects and challenges for the future
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - Out -of -hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) represents a significant healthcare issue that is often underestimated. OHCA predominantly affects the general population, with staggering numbers: 400 000 cases annually in Europe and 350 000 in the United States, contributing to 50% of cardiovascular-related deaths. The vast majority of OHCA cases begin with a shockable rhythm, making effective treatment possible through early defibrillation, even by non -medical personnel using automated external defibrillators (AEDs). Despite the availability of such devices, survival from OHCA remains below 10%, with no substantial improvements over the last 25 years. Public access defibrillation programs, which reduce response times with AEDs, have demonstrated a significant increase in survival chances for OHCA victims. Particularly, the "Progetto Vita" in Piacenza is an emblematic example of early defibrillation in Europe, tripling survival rates in OHCA patients treated by laypersons compared to patients treated with the traditional system. This experience contributed to the approval of Law 116, dated August 4, 2021, in Italy, aimed at promoting the distribution and use of AEDs in sports facilities, public venues, transportation, and public services. The law also emphasizes that AEDs can be used without the need for specific training, thus promoting wider usage. In this article, we will briefly examine the epidemiology of OHCA and delve into the organizational model of the "Progetto Vita", which aligns with the principles of Law 116/2021. The goal is to provide some insights into organizational aspects that could facilitate the nationwide expansion of early defibrillation programs in the near future.

TI  - Long-Term Immunogenicity and In Vitro Prophylactic Protective Efficacy of M. tuberculosis Fusion Protein DR2 Combined with Liposomal Adjuvant DIMQ as a Boosting Vaccine for BCG
T2  - ACS INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The resuscitation of dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important cause of adult tuberculosis (TB) transmission. According to the interaction mechanism between M . tuberculosis and the host, the latency antigen Rv0572c and region of difference 9 (RD9) antigen Rv3621c were selected in this study to prepare the fusion protein DR2. Stimulating clinically diagnosed active tuberculosis infections (i.e., TB patients), latent tuberculosis infections, and healthy controls confirmed that T lymphocytes could recognize DR2 protein in the peripheral blood of TB-infected individuals more than subcomponent protein. The DR2 protein was then emulsified in the liposome adjuvant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide, and imiquimod (DIMQ) was administered to C57BL/6 mice immunized with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine to evaluate their immunogenicity. Studies have shown that DR2/DIMQ, a booster vaccine for BCG primary immunization, can elicit robust CD4+ Th1 cell immune response and predominant IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) effector memory T cells (TEM) subsets. Furthermore, the serum antibody level and the expression of related cytokines increased significantly with the extension of immunization time, with IL2(+), CD4(+), or CD8(+) central memory T cells (T-CM) subsets predominant in the long term. This immunization strategy showed matched prophylactic protective efficacy by performing in vitro challenge experiment. This result provides robust evidence that the novel subunit vaccine prepared by fusion protein DR2 combined with liposomal adjuvant DIMQis a promising TB vaccine candidate for further preclinical trials as a booster vaccine for BCG.

CP  - International Resuscitation Research Conference (IRRC 94)
AB  - Resuscitative (postinsult) hypothermia is less well studied than protective-preservative (pre and intra-arrest) hypothermia. The latter is in wide clinical use, particularly for protecting the brain during cardiac surgery. Resuscitative hypothermia was explored in the 1950s and then lay dormant until the 1980s when it was revived. This change occurred through the discoveries of brain damage mitigating effects after cardiac arrest in dogs, and after forebrain ischemia in rats, of mild (34 degrees C) hypothermia (which is safe), and of benefits derived from moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C) after traumatic brain injury or focal brain ischemia in various species. The idea that protection-preservation or resuscitation by hypothermia is mainly explained by its ability to reduce cerebral oxygen demand has been replaced by an increasingly documented synergism of many beneficial mechanisms. Deleterious chemical cascades during and after these insults are suppressed even by mild hypothermia. Prolonged moderate hypothermia carries some risks, e.g., arrhythmias, infection and coagulopathies. These side effects need further study. In global brain ischemia, protective-preservative mild hypothermia provides lasting mitigation of brain damage. Resuscitative mild hypothermia, however, may be beneficial in terms of long-term outcome or may merely delay the inevitable loss of selectively vulnerable neurons. Even if the latter is true, mild hypothermia may extend the therapeutic window for other interventions. This extension of the therapeutic window requires further documentation. After normothermic cardiac arrest of 11 mins in dogs, mild resuscitative hypothermia from 15 mins to 12 hrs after reperfusion plus cerebral blood flow promotion normalized functional recovery with the least histologic damage seen thus far. Optimal duration of, and rewarming methods from, resuscitative hypothermia need clarification. The earliest possible induction of mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest seems desirable. Head-neck surface cooling alone is too slow. Among many clinically feasible rapid cooling methods, carotid cold flush and peritoneal cooling look promising. After traumatic brain injury or focal brain ischemia, which seem to still benefit from even later cooling, surface cooling methods may be adequate. Resuscitative hypothermia after cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, or focal brain ischemia should be considered for clinical trials.

TI  - The post-resuscitation bundle
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Following restoration of pulse after the institution of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation and perhaps, the initial resuscitative drugs, there is a greater challenge of maintaining that heartbeat for at least the next 24 hours, which can better ensure a high likelihood of the patient being discharged alive from the hospital. A bundle of procedures, which may need to be administered simultaneously, is required. These include prompt identification and treatment of the cause of cardiac arrest, with early consideration for procedures such as percutaneous coronary interventions and fibrinolytics, and treatment of electrolyte abnormalities. In addition, a definitive airway and normocapnoeic ventilation without causing hyperoxaemia, together with rational management of haemodynamics with intra-arterial and central venous lines and vasoactive agents will be crucial. Additional benefit is possible with appropriate forms of early goal-directed therapy and achieving therapeutic hypothermia within the first few hours, followed by gradual rewarming and ensuring glycaemic control by maintaining blood sugars within a range of 6-10 mmol/L. All these would be important and need to be continued for at least 24 hours, together with a series of measures to control neurological reactions and monitor neurological responses for best effect. Creation of a bundle that incorporates these various aspects of care would more likely ensure that most patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation may be discharged alive from the hospital with optimal neurological function.

TI  - RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OBESE PATIENT HANDLING IN EMERGENCY PREHOSPITAL CARE
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - The number of ambulance crewmembers may affect the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in particular situations. However, few studies have investigated how the number of emergency care providers affects the quality of CPR. Nonetheless, problems in the initial handling of patients due to small ambulance crew sizes may have significant consequences. These difficulties may be more frequent in an obese population than in a non-obese population. Hence such problems may be frequently encountered because obesity is epidemic in developed countries. In this report, we illustrate the fatal consequences of initial problems in patient handling due to a small ambulance crew size in an obese patient who suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Following successful resuscitation, this patient presented humeral fractures that may have promoted a disorder of hemostasis. The patient eventually died. This case highlights the requirement for specific instructions for paramedics to manage obese patients in these emergency conditions. This case also highlights the need to take into account body mass index when deciding on appropriate pre-hospital care, especially regarding the number of ambulance crewmembers.

TI  - The Iterative Development and Testing of an Interactive Mobile Application for Skill Retention of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Among High School Students: A Pilot Study
T2  - SIMULATION & GAMING
AB  - Background Locations concentrated with High School (HS) students tend to have lower out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival rates. Mobile applications (apps) have the capability to augment cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skill retention as a low-cost, accessible training method. Methods An iterative process to develop an app to reinforce CPR skills emphasizing hand placement, compression rate, real-time feedback, and recurring tips is described. The app was tested on HS students to measure its impact on quality and comfort of CPR using Likert surveys and skills assessments before and after one month of usage. CPR Score and compression rate were measured using the Laerdal (TM) Little Anne Manikin QCPR software. Results Fourteen HS students participated in a prospective observational study. It was found that the use of the developed app was associated with improved CPR performance (80.43% v. 87.86%, p=0.01-0.02, 95% CI=2.20-12.66) after one month. Additionally, improvements were demonstrated in compression rate accuracy (21.43% v. 64.29%, p=0.041, 95% CI=0.132-0.725), increased comfort performing CPR (3.86 v. 4.79, p<0.001, 95% CI =0.99-1.00) and comfort performing CPR on strangers (2.71 v. 4.42, p<0.001, 95% CI=1.24-2.19). In addition, for every time the app was used, CPR performance increased by 0.5668% (p=0.0182). Conclusion Findings suggest that mobile apps may have promising implications as augmentative tools for CPR curriculums.

TI  - Time Dependence of Risks and Benefits in Pediatric Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Therapy
T2  - CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background-Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) used to prevent sudden cardiac arrest in children not only provide appropriate therapy in 25% of patients but also result in a significant incidence of inappropriate shocks and other device complications. ICDs placed for secondary prevention have higher rates of appropriate therapy than those placed for primary prevention. Pediatric patients with primary prevention ICDs were studied to determine time-dependent incidence of appropriate use and adverse events.
   Methods and Results-A total of 140 patients aged <21 years (median age, 15 years) at first ICD implantation at Boston Children's Hospital (2000-2009) in whom devices were placed for primary prevention were retrospectively identified. Demographics and times to first appropriate shock; adverse events (including inappropriate shock, lead failure, reintervention, and complication); generator replacement and follow-up were noted. During mean follow-up of 4 years, appropriate shock occurred in 19% patients and first adverse event (excluding death/transplant) occurred in 36%. Risk of death or transplant was approximate to 1% per year and was not related to receiving appropriate therapy. Conditional survival analysis showed rates of appropriate therapy and adverse events decrease soon after implantation, but adverse events are more frequent than appropriate therapy throughout follow-up.
   Conclusions-Primary prevention ICDs were associated with appropriate therapy in 19% and adverse event in 36% in this cohort. The incidence of both first appropriate therapy and device-related adverse events decreased during longer periods of follow-up after implantation. This suggests that indications for continued device therapy in pediatric primary prevention ICD patients might be reconsidered after a period of nonuse.

TI  - Defibrillation in rural areas
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Aim of the study: Automated external defibrillation (AED) and public access defibrillation (PAD) have become cornerstones in the chain of survival in modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Most studies of AED and PAD have been performed in urban areas, and evidence is scarce for sparsely populated rural areas. The aim of this review was to review the literature and discuss treatment strategies for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in rural areas.
   Methods: A Medline search was performed with the keywords automated external defibrillation (617 hits), public access defibrillation (256), and automated external defibrillator public (542). Of these 1415 abstracts and additional articles found by manually searching references, 92 articles were included in this nonsystematic review.
   Results: Early defibrillation is crucial for survival with good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Rapid defibrillation can be a challenge in sparsely populated and remote areas, where the incidence of cardiac arrest is low and rescuer response times can be long. The few studies performed in rural areas showed that the introduction of AED programs based on a 2-tier emergency medical system, consisting of Basic Life Support and Advanced Life Support teams, resulted in a decrease in collapse-to-defibrillation times and better survival of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions: In rural areas, introducing AED programs and a 2-tier emergency medical system may increase survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. More studies on AED and PAD in rural areas are required. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transesophageal echocardiography in cardiac arrest: why, how, when, and where in clinical practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA ANALGESIA AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has emerged as a transformative tool in the management of cardiac arrest, offering significant advantages over traditional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by enabling continuous, high-resolution cardiac imaging during resuscitation. Initially used in operating rooms before 2000, TEE expanded into emergency departments (EDs), intensive care units (ICUs), and even prehospital settings. Its superior imaging capability during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) supports rapid diagnosis, optimization of compression quality, and more accurate rhythm assessment, including the differentiation between asystole and fine ventricular fibrillation. TEE has been shown to influence intra-arrest clinical decision-making in up to 78% of cases, often revealing pathologies-such as aortic dissection or cardiac rupture-not detected by TTE. Importantly, TEE aids in identifying reversible causes of cardiac arrest, guiding high-quality CPR by assessing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and shortening the duration of pulse checks. It also may play a role in extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) and organ donation procedures, particularly in cannulation and monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). TEE use is feasible and safe during cardiac arrest, with high insertion success rates and minimal complications when performed by trained personnel. While cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and intensivists traditionally perform TEE, simplified training protocols now enable emergency physicians to safely and effectively deploy TEE in critical settings. Protocols such as "POCUS-TEE" may promote rapid acquisition of essential views, facilitating broader implementation. Despite the potential benefits, several barriers to widespread adoption remain. These include the availability of equipment, limitations in training, and concerns regarding the safety of the probe during defibrillation. Resuscitation guidelines recommend removing the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) probe, or at least insulating it, as a precaution during defibrillation. TEE is particularly valuable when TTE proves inadequate, such as in obese or mechanically ventilated patients. In conclusion, TEE might enhance the quality and precision of resuscitation in cardiac arrest and has the potential to improve survival and neurological outcomes in selected cases. Its broader adoption hinges on institutional support, streamlined protocols, operator training, and further research to validate its impact on patient-centered outcomes. As technology advances and clinical integration improves, TEE may become a cornerstone of advanced life support in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings.

TI  - Extracorporeal life support as rescue strategy for out-of-hospital and emergency department cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been utilized as a rescue strategy for patients with cardiac arrest unresponsive to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Objective: We sought to describe our institution's experience with implementation of ECLS for out-ofhospital and emergency department (ED) cardiac arrests. Our primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.
   Methods: Consecutive patients placed on ECLS in the ED or within one hour of admission after out-ofhospital or ED cardiac arrest were enrolled at two urban academic medical centers in the United States from July 2007-April 2014.
   Results: During the study period, 26 patients were included. Average age was 40 +/- 15 years, 54% were male, and 42% were white. Initial cardiac rhythms were ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 42%. The average time from initial cardiac arrest to initiation of ECLS was 77 +/- 51 min (range 12-180min). ECLS cannulation was unsuccessful in two patients. Eighteen (69%) had complications related to ECLS, most commonly bleeding and ischemic events. Four patients (15%) survived to discharge, three of whom were neurologically intact at 6 months.
   Conclusion: ECLS shows promise as a rescue strategy for refractory out-of-hospital or ED cardiac arrest but is not without challenges. Further investigations are necessary to refine the technique, patient selection, and ancillary therapeutics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Brain injury after cardiac arrest: from prognostication of comatose patients to rehabilitation
T2  - LANCET NEUROLOGY
AB  - More patients are surviving cardiac arrest than ever before; however, the burden now lies with estimating neurological prognoses in a large number of patients who were initially comatose, in whom the ultimate outcome is unclear. Neurologists, neurointensivists, and clinical neurophysiologists must accurately balance the concern that overly conservative prognostication could leave patients in a severely disabled state, with the possibility that inaccurately pessimistic prognostication could lead to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who might otherwise have a good functional outcome. Prognostic tools have improved greatly, including electrophysiological tests, neuroimaging, and chemical biomarkers. Conclusions about the prognosis should be delayed at least 72 h after arrest to allow for the clearance of sedative drugs. Cognitive impairments, emotional problems, and fatigue are common among patients who have survived cardiac arrest, and often go unrecognised despite being related to caregiver burden and a decreased participation in society. Through simple screening, these problems can be identified, and patients can be provided with adequate information and rehabilitation.

TI  - Accessory pathway unmasked by adenosine in a patient with unexplained cardiac arrest: a case report
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest require detailed diagnostic evaluation to identify reversible causes and guide therapy. Underlying mechanisms may include ischaemia or electrophysiological abnormalities. The conventional diagnostic workflow may fail to uncover occult arrhythmic substrates, highlighting the need for targeted testing strategies in selected cases.Case summary A 35-year-old man, a former endurance athlete, experienced a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest during sleep. Ventricular fibrillation was terminated with direct-current shock, achieving return of spontaneous circulation. The initial 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V3 with a coved Brugada-like pattern, but reciprocal ST-segment depression. Myocardial ischaemia was ruled out with coronary angiography, and Brugada syndrome was excluded by a negative ajmaline test. No further abnormalities were found. Persistent clinical suspicion prompted an adenosine test, which revealed a left lateral accessory pathway. Electrophysiological testing demonstrated high-risk properties of the accessory pathway, with haemodynamic collapse during pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Catheter ablation successfully eliminated the accessory pathway without changes in QRS complex morphology, and the patient remained asymptomatic at follow-up, with no arrhythmic recurrence.Discussion Unexplained cardiac arrest in patients with structurally normal hearts presents significant diagnostic challenges. In this case, adenosine testing unmasked an accessory pathway as the reversible cause of cardiac arrest. Though not routinely included in cardiac arrest evaluations, adenosine testing was crucial in this patient's diagnosis and management, preventing unnecessary implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. Comprehensive diagnostic strategies, including targeted use of adenosine testing, can reveal occult arrhythmic substrates, improving outcomes and avoiding overtreatment in selected cases.

TI  - State transition modeling of complex monitored health data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
AB  - This article considers the analysis of complex monitored health data, where often one or several signals are reflecting the current health status that can be represented by a finite number of states, in addition to a set of covariates. In particular, we consider a novel application of a non-parametric state intensity regression method in order to study time-dependent effects of covariates on the state transition intensities. The method can handle baseline, time varying as well as dynamic covariates. Because of the non-parametric nature, the method can handle different data types and challenges under minimal assumptions. If the signal that is reflecting the current health status is of continuous nature, we propose the application of a weighted median and a hysteresis filter as data pre-processing steps in order to facilitate robust analysis. In intensity regression, covariates can be aggregated by a suitable functional form over a time history window. We propose to study the estimated cumulative regression parameters for different choices of the time history window in order to investigate short- and long-term effects of the given covariates. The proposed framework is discussed and applied to resuscitation data of newborns collected in Tanzania.

TI  - Brain cooling and eligible newborns: should we extend the indications?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia (whole body or selective head cooling) is recognized as standard of care for brain injury control in term infants with perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Recent metanalyses and systematic reviews in human newborns have shown a reduction in mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental disability at 12-24 months of age, with more favourable effects in the less severe forms of HIE. HIE is most often noted in term newborns. Preterm infants can also suffer from HIE, but the clinical manifestations and pathology are different, involving subcortical gray matter injury in association with white matter damage. Several term and preterm animal experimental models showed that a reduction in brain temperature following a hypoxic-ischemic insult reduces energy expenditure and may reduce histological neuronal loss, but little is known on the safety of therapeutic hypothermia in preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Hypothermia is one of the most promising future interventions for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and seems to improve survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest in adults. Similarly, recent reviews have emphasized the possible role of therapeutic hypothermia after pediatric cardiac arrest, and a trial is ongoing to assess the benefits of induced hypothermia in pediatric traumatic brain injury. So far, there is a lack of data on other possible indications, i.e., neonates with stroke or after cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Carefully designed safety studies and large randomized trials for all the above conditions and especially for preterm infants should be planned.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning for Patients With Cardiac Arrest: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Currently, there is a lack of effective early assessment tools for predicting the onset and development of cardiac arrest (CA). With the increasing attention of clinical researchers on machine learning (ML), some researchers have developed ML models for predicting the occurrence and prognosis of CA, with certain models appearing to outperform traditional scoring tools. However, these models still lack systematic evidence to substantiate their efficacy. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the prediction value of ML in CA for occurrence, good neurological prognosis, mortality, and the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), thereby providing evidence-based support for the development and refinement of applicable clinical tools. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched from their establishment until May 17, 2024. The risk of bias in all prediction models was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Results: In total, 93 studies were selected, encompassing 5,729,721 in-hospital and out-of-hospital patients. The meta-analysis revealed that, for predicting CA, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity derived from the imbalanced validation dataset were 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93), 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.96), respectively. On the basis of the balanced validation dataset, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.90), 0.72 (95% CI 0.49-0.95), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.91), respectively. For predicting the good cerebral performance category score 1 to 2, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87), 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.81), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.88), respectively. For predicting CA mortality, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation datasetwere0.85 (95%CI 0.82-0.87), 0.83 (95%CI 0.79-0.87), and0.79 (95%CI 0.74-0.83), respectively. Forpredicting ROSC, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.77 (95% CI 0.74-0.80), 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.74), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.71-0.96), respectively. In predicting CA, the most significant modeling variables were respiratory rate, blood pressure, age, and temperature. In predicting a good cerebral performance category score 1 to 2, the most significant modeling variables in the in-hospital CA group were rhythm (shockable or nonshockable), age, medication use, and gender; the most significant modelingvariablesinthe out-of-hospital CA group were age, rhythm (shockable or nonshockable), medication use, and ROSC. Conclusions: ML represents a currently promising approach for predicting the occurrence and outcomes of CA. Therefore, in future research on CA, we may attempt to systematically update traditional scoring tools based on the superior performance of ML in specific outcomes, achieving artificial intelligence-driven enhancements.

TI  - An effort to reduce chest compression pauses during automated external defibrillator use among laypeople: A randomized partially blinded controlled trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To implement small methodological changes in basic life support (BLS) training to reduce unnecessary pauses during automated external defibrillator (AED) use.Methods: One hundred and two university students with no BLS knowledge were randomly allocated into three groups (control and 2 experimental groups). Both experimental groups received a two-hour BLS training. While the contents were identical in both groups, in one of them the reduction of no-flow time was focused on (focused no-flow group). The control group did not receive any training. Finally, all of them were evaluated in the same out-of-hospital cardiac arrest simulated scenario. The primary endpoint was the compression fraction.Results: Results from 78 participants were analysed (control group: 19; traditional group: 30; focused no-flow group: 29). The focused no-flow group achieved higher percentages of compression fraction (median: 56.0, interquartile rank (IQR): 53.5-58.5) than the traditional group (44.0, IQR: 42.0- 47.0) and control group (52.0, IQR: 43.0-58.0) in the complete scenario. Participants from the control group performed compression-only cardiopul-monary resuscitation (CPR), while the other groups performed compression-ventilation CPR. CPR fraction was calculated, showing the fraction of time in which the participants were performing resuscitation manoeuvres. In this case, the focused no-flow group reached higher percentages of CPR fraction (77.6, IQR: 74.4-82.4) than the traditional group (61.9, IQR: 59.3-68.1) and the control group (52.0, IQR: 43.0-58.0). Conclusions: Laypeople having automated external defibrillation training focused on acting in anticipation of the AED prompts contributed to a reduction in chest compression pauses during an OHCA simulated scenario.

TI  - Influence of comorbidity on the outcome of patients treated for out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background A number of factors have previously been shown to be predictive of survival from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. These include witnessed collapse, prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early application of defibrillation, and younger age. Arrests occurring away from home are also associated with improved survival. Additionally, hospital mortality after successful resuscitation has been related to a history of congestive heart failure as well as to some of the factors noted above. An association of prearrest comorbidity with outcome has not been systematically evaluated.
   Methods and Results We define here a comorbidity index, which is constructed from histories of chronic conditions as well as a number of recent symptoms in 282 victims of our-of-hospital VF. This indicator of comorbidity is strongly associated with outcome (P=.004). However, when analyzing a comprehensive set of predictors of survival after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, including the index of comorbidity, we could identify overall only about one fourth of the variation that one might hope to account for.
   Conclusions Comorbidity appears to be an important (but usually overlooked) predictor of survival from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. However, most of the statistical variability in predicting survival remains unexplained when we consider comorbidity in conjunction with previously identified predictors of survival.

TI  - Update in Mechanical Ventilation, Sedation, and Outcomes 2014
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Novel approaches to the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome include strategies to enhance alveolar liquid clearance, promote epithelial cell growth and recovery after acute lung injury, and individualize ventilator care on the basis of physiological responses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is growing rapidly, and centers providing ECMO must strive to meet stringent quality standards such as those set out by the ECMONet working group. Prognostic tools such as the RESP score can assist clinicians in predicting outcomes for patients with severe acute respiratory failure but do not predict whether ECMO will enhance survival. Evidence continues to grow that novel modes of mechanical ventilation such as neurally adjusted ventilatory assist are feasible and improve patient physiology and patient-ventilator interaction; data on clinical outcomes are limited but supportive. Critical illness causes long-term psychological and function sequelae: the risk of a new psychiatric diagnosis and severe physical impairment is significantly increased in the months after discharge from the intensive care unit. These long-term effects might be amenable to changes in sedation practice and increased early mobilization. Daily sedation discontinuation enhances the validity of routine delirium assessment. Many critically ill patients merit assessment by palliative care clinicians; the demand for palliative care services among critically ill patients is expected to grow. Future trials to test therapies for critical illness must ensure that study designs are adequately powered to detect benefit using realistic event rates. Integrating "big data" approaches into treatment decisions and trial designs offers a potential means of individualizing care to enhance outcomes for critically ill patients.

TI  - Ventricular fibrillation recorded and analysed within an area the size of a mobile phone: could it enable cardiac arrest recognition?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Recognition of out-of-hospital-cardiac arrests (OHCAs) at emergency medical communication centres is based on questions of OHCA symptoms, resulting in 50-80% accuracy rates. However, OHCAs might be recognized more promptly using 'rhythm-based' recognition, whereby a victim's cardiac rhythm is recorded with mobile phone technology that analyses and transmits recordings to emergency medical communication centres for further interpretation.
   Objective To examine whether the quality of normal cardiac rhythm and the rhythm with the best prognosis in OHCA, ventricular fibrillation (VF), is sufficient for 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition when recorded within a mobile phone-sized device.
   Patients and methods mid-sternum within an area the size of a mobile phone and analysed by automated external defibrillator (AED) software and two cardiologists. The rhythms were categorized as shockable or nonshockable. The cardiologists assessed the quality of the recordings. Results The AED software correctly analysed all normal rhythms and 15 of 22 VF rhythms. The VF duration was too short for automatic detection in seven cases. The cardiologists analysed all the normal rhythms and VF sequences correctly and graded them as high quality.
   Conclusion The recordings of normal ECG rhythm and VF within an area the size of a mobile phone are of sufficient quality and could be used in 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition. The VF period was too short for an accurate analysis by the AED software in some cases. Copyright (c) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Utilization of high-fidelity simulation for medical student and resident education of allergic-immunologic emergencies
T2  - ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Background: The advantages of clinical simulation used in medical education include the acquisition of clinical skills in a controlled setting, promoting a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, and a high degree of learner satisfaction.
   Objective: We aimed to identify knowledge gaps among Internal Medicine residents and students in the diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor-induced angioedema through their participation in a simulation course.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study involving clinical simulations with a high-fidelity, patient-simulator. The cases (antibiotic-induced anaphylaxis and ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema) were standardized and algorithmic. Participants completed a pre- and post- simulation knowledge assessment and course evaluation. A follow-up knowledge survey was sent out 6 to 12 months after the course completion.
   Results: Twelve groups comprising 45 medical students and residents completed the anaphylaxis course. All groups diagnosed anaphylaxis after more than 2-organ-system involvement had manifested, and half of the groups made the diagnosis after the patient-simulator was in anaphylactic shock. Half gave an incorrect dose of epinephrine, and most of the participants were inexperienced in epinephrine auto-injector (EAI) administration. Eight groups comprising 27 participants completed the ACE-inhibitor-angioedema course. Six of the groups correctly diagnosed the patient- simulator, but multiple incorrect treatments were given, and only 1 group successfully intubated the patient-simulator. Knowledge improved immediately after the simulation, and knowledge specific to EAI treatment seemed to be retained long-term. All participants agreed that the simulation was practical to their education.
   Conclusion: Clinical simulation improves knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis and ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema. We advocate that clinical simulation be incorporated at institutions with appropriate capabilities. (C) 2019 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Barriers to and facilitators for newborn resuscitation in Malawi, Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Newborn resuscitation is a key component of efforts to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. This article reports the findings of focus groups conducted to explore the barriers and facilitators present for obstetric nurse providers in a central urban hospital in Malawi regarding the training and provision of neonatal resuscitation. All obstetric nurse providers in this setting participated in focus groups; these groups identified 4 themes: 1) confidence in their skills in assessing newborns and recognizing the need for resuscitation, 2) a lack of resources, 3) facilitators who would enable them to introduce resuscitation, and 4) solutions to the current problems. Resource shortages and barriers to providing care included availability of staff, equipment, and supplies; labor ward geography; ethical dilemmas; and the lack of standard protocols regarding newborn resuscitation. Facilitators were professional experience and the critical load of deliveries performed. Solutions to barriers included small resource additions as well as long-term policy changes. With standard policy and protocols, experienced, confident nurses could overcome the barriers to providing newborn resuscitation. This group identified ways to change systems to decrease infant mortality, thereby improving the health and quality of life of women receiving care in Malawi.

TI  - An Updated Focused Review of Dexmedetomidine in Adults
T2  - ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate recent comparative studies regarding the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in adults.
   DATA SOURCES: Articles evaluating safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine were identified from an English-language MEDLINE search (1996-July 2009), with a a published since our previous review in 2007 to the present. MeSH terms included dexmedetomidine, medetomidine, alpha(2)-agonist, and sedation. References from selected articles were also reviewed for additional material.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Experimental and observational English-language studies that focused on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacoeconomics of dexmedetomidine in humans were selected.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Dexmedetomidine is an alpha(2)-agonist used for sedation during and in critical illness. Compared with placebo, use of dexmedetomidine during procedures was associated with decreased use of rescue midazolan and a similar degree of sedation compared with various agents used during surgery or for procedures. Use of long-term (>24 h) dexmedetomidine sedation is comparable to sedation with benzodiazepines in critically ill patients. In a Phase 4 study, dexmedetomidine was safe in dosages up to 1.4 mu g/kg/hour for greater than 24 hours and did not produce rebound tachycardia or hypertension when abruptly discontinued. One small randomized controlled trial demonstrated decreased incidence of delirium, the primary endpoint, with dexmedetomidine compared with midazolam or propofol for sedation after cardiac valve surgery. Many, but not all, studies suggest that dexmedetomidine has a promising role in prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients when delirium was studied as a secondary endpoint.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine is an an alternative for procedural sedation and can be used long-term (>24 h) in critically ill patients, in dosages up to 1.5 mu g/kg/hour. More studies are needed to better define the role of dexmedetomidine in preventing and treating delirium.

TI  - Incidence of near-death experiences in patients surviving a prolonged critical illness and their long-term impact: a prospective observational study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background So far, the few prospective studies on near-death experience (NDE) were carried out only in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with homogeneous aetiologies, such as cardiac arrest or trauma survivors. The aims of this 1-year prospective and monocentric study were to investigate the incidence of NDE in ICU survivors (all aetiologies) as well as factors that may affect its frequency, and to assess quality of life up to 1 year after enrolment.Methods We enrolled adults with a prolonged ICU stay (> 7 days). During the first 7 days after discharge, all eligible patients were assessed in a face-to-face interview for NDE using the Greyson NDE scale, dissociative experiences using the Dissociative Experience Scale, and spirituality beliefs using the WHOQOL-SRPB. Medical parameters were prospectively collected. At 1-year after inclusion, patients were contacted by phone to measure quality of life using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire.Results Out of the 126 included patients, 19 patients (15%) reported having experienced a NDE as identified by the Greyson NDE scale (i.e. cut-off score & GE; 7/32). In univariate analyses, mechanical ventilation, sedation, analgesia, reason for admission, primary organ dysfunction, dissociative and spiritual propensities were associated with the emergence of NDE. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the dissociative and spiritual propensity strongly predicted the emergence of NDE. One year later (n = 61), the NDE was not significantly associated with quality of life.Conclusions The recall of NDE is not so rare in the ICU. In our cohort, cognitive and spiritual factors outweighed medical parameters as predictors of the emergence of NDE.

TI  - Manual Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Versus CPR Including a Mechanical Chest Compression Device in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Comprehensive Meta-analysis From Randomized and Observational Studies
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: Mechanical chest compression devices have been developed to facilitate continuous delivery of high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Despite promising hemodynamic data, evidence on clinical outcomes remains inconclusive. With the completion of 3 randomized controlled trials, we conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of in-field mechanical versus manual CPR on clinical outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: With a systematic search (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries), we identified all eligible studies (randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies) that compared a CPR strategy including an automated mechanical chest compression device with a strategy of manual CPR only. Outcome variables were survival to hospital admission, survival to discharge, and favorable neurologic outcome.
   Results: Twenty studies (n=21,363) were analyzed: 5 randomized controlled trials and 15 nonrandomized studies, pooled separately. For survival to admission, the pooled estimate of the randomized controlled trials did not indicate a difference (odds ratio 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.05; P=.24) between mechanical and manual CPR. In contrast, meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies demonstrated a benefit in favor of mechanical CPR (odds ratio 1.42; 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.67; P<.001). No interaction was found between the endorsed CPR guidelines (2000 versus 2005) and the CPR strategy (P=.27). Survival to discharge and neurologic outcome did not differ between strategies.
   Conclusion: Although there are lower-quality, observational data that suggest that mechanical CPR used at the rescuer's discretion could improve survival to hospital admission, the cumulative high-quality randomized evidence does not support a routine strategy of mechanical CPR to improve survival or neurologic outcome. These findings are irrespective of the endorsed CPR guidelines during the study periods.

TI  - A "crush" course on rhabdomyolysis: risk stratification and clinical management update for the perioperative clinician
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA
AB  - Rhabdomyolysis, the release of myoglobin and other cellular breakdown products from necrotic muscle tissue, is seen in patients with crush injuries, drug overdose, malignant hyperthermia, muscular dystrophy, and with increasing frequency in obese patients undergoing routine procedures. For the perioperative clinician, managing the resultant shock, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and myoglobinuric acute kidney injury can present a significant challenge. Prompt recognition, hydration, and correction of metabolic disturbances may reduce or eliminate the need for long-term renal replacement therapy. This article reviews the pathophysiology and discusses key issues in the perioperative diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of rhabdomyolysis.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prediction and Management: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThis literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in prediction models and the deployment of AI and ML in the prediction of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) success. The objectives are to understand the role of AI and ML in healthcare, specifically in medical diagnosis, statistics, and precision medicine, and to explore their applications in predicting and managing sudden cardiac arrest outcomes, especially in the context of prehospital emergency care.Recent FindingsThe role of AI and ML in healthcare is expanding, with applications evident in medical diagnosis, statistics, and precision medicine. Deep learning is gaining prominence in radiomics and population health for disease risk prediction. There's a significant focus on the integration of AI and ML in prehospital emergency care, particularly in using ML algorithms for predicting outcomes in COVID-19 patients and enhancing the recognition of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Furthermore, the combination of AI with automated external defibrillators (AEDs) shows potential in better detecting shockable rhythms during cardiac arrest incidents.SummaryAI and ML hold immense promise in revolutionizing the prediction and management of sudden cardiac arrest, hinting at improved survival rates and more efficient healthcare interventions in the future. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) continues to be a major global cause of death, with survival rates remaining low despite advanced first responder systems. The ongoing challenge is the prediction and prevention of SCA. However, with the rise in the adoption of AI and ML tools in clinical electrophysiology in recent times, there is optimism about addressing these challenges more effectively.

TI  - Vasopressin administration in refractory cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Successful outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation remain disappointingly infrequent. In animal studies, administration of exogenous vasopressin during closed- and open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation has recently been shown to be more effective than optimal doses of epinephrine in improving vital organ blood flow.
   Objective: To describe the clinical effects and outcomes of administering vasopressin to patients in cardiac arrest refractory to current medical therapies.
   Design: Case reports.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Patients: 8 adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Interventions: After intravenous epinephrine (administered according to American Heart Association guidelines) and defibrillation efforts had failed, patients in cardiac arrest who were having cardiopulmonary resuscitation received 40 U of vasopressin intravenously and then defibrillation.
   Measurements: Return of spontaneous circulation and hospital discharge rates.
   Results: After administration of vasopressin, spontaneous circulation was promptly restored in all patients. Three patients were discharged from the hospital with intact neurologic function; the other five lived for between 30 minutes and 82 hours.
   Conclusion: In the presence of ventricular fibrillation with severe hypoxia and acidosis, vasopressin seems to be more potent and effective than adrenergic vasopressors for restoring spontaneous cardiovascular function. These results do not justify the widespread use of vasopressin for refractory cardiac arrest. However, on the basis of these cases, further studies comparing vasopressin with epinephrine are warranted in an effort to improve the currently dismal prognosis of patients after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Cognitive Deficits Following Intensive Care
T2  - DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: Illnesses that necessitate intensive care can impair cognitive function severely over the long term, leaving patients less able to cope with the demands of everyday living and markedly lowering their quality of life. There has not yet been any comprehensive study of the cognitive sequelae of critical illness among nonsurgical patients treated in intensive care. The purpose of this review is to present the available study findings on cognitive deficits in such patients, with particular attention to prevalence, types of deficit, clinical course, risk factors, prevention, and treatment.
   Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in MEDLINE.
   Results: The literature search yielded 3360 hits, among which there were 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 17-78%of patients had cognitive deficits after discharge from the intensive care unit: most had never had a cognitive deficit before. Cognitive impairment often persisted for up to several years after discharge (0.5 to 9 years) and tended to improve over time. The only definite risk factor is delirium.
   Conclusion: Cognitive dysfunction is a common sequela of the treatment of non-surgical patients in intensive care units. It is a serious problem for the affected persons and an increasingly important socio-economic problem as well. The effective management of delirium is very important. General conclusions are hard to draw from the available data because of heterogeneous study designs, varying methods of measurement, and differences among patient cohorts. Further studies are needed so that study designs and clinical testing procedures can be standardized and effective measures for prevention and treatment can be identified.

TI  - Temperature and age-gender effects on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Temperature is a key factor influencing the occurrence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, yet there is no equivalent study in Hong Kong. This study reports results involving a large-scale territory-wide investigation on the impacts of ambient temperature and age-gender differences on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcome in Hong Kong.
   Methods: This study included 25,467 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases treated by the Hong Kong Fire Services Department between December 2011 and November 2016 inclusive. Simple correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases and temperature, age and gender. Calendar charts were used to visualise temporal patterns of pre-hospital emergency medical services related to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases.
   Results: A strong negative curvilinear relationship was found between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and daily temperature (r(2) > 0.9) with prominent effects on elderly people aged >= 85 years. For each unit decrease in mean temperature in degrees C, there was a maximum of 5.6% increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases among all age groups and 7.3% increase in the >= 85 years elderly age group. Men were slightly more at risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with women. The demand for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest-related emergency medical services was highest between 06:00 and 11:00 in the wintertime.
   Conclusion: This study provides the first local evidence linking weather and demographic effects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Hong Kong. It offers empirical evidence to policymakers in support of strengthening existing emergency medical services to deal with the expected increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the wintertime and in regions with a large number of elderly population.

TI  - The Brain after Cardiac Arrest
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Cardiac arrest is common and deadly. Most patients who are treated in the hospital after achieving return of spontaneous circulation still go on to die from the sequelae of anoxic brain injury. In this review, the authors provide an overview of the mechanisms and consequences of postarrest brain injury. Special attention is paid to potentially modifiable mechanisms of secondary brain injury including seizures, hyperpyrexia, cerebral hypoxia and hypoperfusion, oxidative injury, and the development of cerebral edema. Finally, the authors discuss the outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors with a focus on commonly observed patterns of injury as well as the scales used to measure patient outcome and their limitations.

TI  - Prolonged Local Hypothermia Has No Long-Term Adverse Effect on the Spinal Cord
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Hypothermia is known to be neuroprotective and is one of the most effective and promising first-line treatments for central nervous system (CNS) trauma. At present, induction of local hypothermia, as opposed to general hypothermia, is more desired because of its ease of application and safety; fewer side effects and an absence of severe complications have been noted. Local hypothermia involves temperature reduction of a small and specific segment of the spinal cord. Our group has previously shown the neuroprotective effect of short-term, acute moderate general hypothermia through improvements in electrophysiological and motor behavioral assessments, as well as histological examination following contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We have also shown the benefit of using short-term local hypothermia versus short-term general hypothermia post-acute SCI. The overall neuroprotective benefit of hypothermia can be categorized into three main components: (1) induction modality, general versus local, (2) invasive, semi-invasive or noninvasive, and (3) duration of hypothermia induction. In this study, a series of experiments were designed to investigate the feasibility, long-term safety, as well as eventual complications and side effects of prolonged, semi-invasive, moderate local hypothermia (30 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C for 5 and 8 hours) in rats with uninjured spinal cord while maintaining their core temperature at 37 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C. The weekly somatosensory evoked potential and motor behavioral (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan) assessments of rats that underwent 5 and 8 hours of semi-invasive local hypothermia, which revealed no statistically significant changes in electrical conductivity and behavioral outcomes. In addition, 4 weeks after local hypothermia induction, histological examination showed no anatomical damages or morphological changes in their spinal cord structure and parenchyma. We concluded that this method of prolonged local hypothermia is feasible, safe, and has the potential for clinical translation.

TI  - Cognitive rehabilitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: combining metacognitive strategy and direct training to improve daily cognitive functioning
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB  - ObjectiveApproximately half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors have enduring cognitive impairment. This study investigated the effectiveness of a combined cognitive rehabilitation approach, combining metacognitive strategy training with direct computerized-training, to improve cognitive functioning in daily life after OHCA.MethodA single-case experimental design with a non-concurrent multiple baseline was used including five participants. The intervention (6-10 weeks) entailed therapist-guided metacognitive and direct training, with a randomized starting date. Participants completed daily visual analog scales on personal problems and subjective cognition (memory, attention, executive functioning). Cognitive tests and questionnaires on cognition, memory failures, societal participation, and quality of life were administered pre- and post-intervention. Statistical analysis included visual analysis, (weighted) TAU-U tests, and multilevel regression.ResultsVisual analysis showed improvements in personal daily problems for all adherent participants (n=4). Weighted TAU-U scores were small but significant for the personal problems (TAU-U=.19, p<.01) and attention (TAU-U=.18, p=.02). Three participants showed a significant decrease in personal problem severity during and after treatment. Descriptive cognitive test scores suggested an improvement. Participants reportedfewer memory failures and greater societal participation, but no statistical analyses were conducted. Subjective cognitive changes were mixed, life satisfaction remained stable.ConclusionsThe combined treatment improved daily cognitive functioning after OHCA.

A1  - Family Centred Cardiac Arrest
TI  - Caring for the invisible and forgotten: a qualitative document analysis and experience-based co-design project to improve the care of families experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - ObjectivesThe objectives of this project were to collect and analyze clinical governance documents related to family-centred care and cardiac arrest care in Canadian EMS organizations; and to improve the family-centredness of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care through experience-based co-design.MethodsWe conducted qualitative document analysis of Canadian EMS clinical governance documents related to family-centred and cardiac arrest care, combining elements of content and thematic analysis methods. We then used experience-based co-design to develop a family-centred out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care policy and procedure template.ResultsThirty-five Canadian EMS organizations responded to our requests, representing service area coverage for 80% of the Canadian population. Twenty documents were obtained for review and six overarching themes were identified: addressing family in event of in-home death, importance of family, family member escort, provider discretion and family presence discouraged. Informed by our qualitative analysis we then co-designed a policy and procedure template was created that prioritizes patient care while promotes family-centredness.ConclusionsThere were few directives to support family-centred care by Canadian EMS organizations. A family-centred out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care policy and procedure template was developed using experience-based co-design to assist EMS organizations improve the family-centredness of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care.

TI  - Clinical review: Devices and drugs for cardiopulmonary resuscitation - opportunities and restraints
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - The science and technology of CPR is only just emerging from its infancy. However, substantial improvements are anticipated, including the ability of lay rescuers to identify cardiac arrest promptly, the availability of additional measurements, and expanded intelligence provided by expanded AEDs with which to more effectively prompt the rescuer through the resuscitation procedure. Most important in our view is the ability to maintain uninterrupted precordial compression. Better timing and better waveforms for defibrillation are emerging. The recognition of the importance of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and the selection of better vasopressor agents to minimize the adverse inotropic and chronotropic actions of adrenergic drugs are also likely to improve outcomes of CPR.

TI  - Semaphorin 3F Promotes Transendothelial Migration of Leukocytes in the Inflammatory Response After Survived Cardiac Arrest
T2  - INFLAMMATION
AB  - Leukocyte transmigration through the blood vessel wall is a fundamental step of the inflammatory response and requires expression of adhesion molecule PECAM-1. Accumulating evidence implicates that semaphorin (Sema) 3F and its receptor neuropilin (NRP) 2 are central regulators in vascular biology. Herein, we assess the role of Sema3F in leukocyte migration in vitro and in vivo. To determine the impact of Sema3F on leukocyte recruitment in vivo, we used the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. After the induction of peritonitis, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected daily with recombinant Sema3F or solvent for 3days. Compared with solvent-treated controls, leukocyte count was increased in the peritoneal lavage of Sema3F-treated mice indicating that Sema3F promotes leukocyte extravasation into the peritoneal cavity. In line with this observation, stimulation of human endothelial cells with Sema3F enhanced the passage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) through the endothelial monolayer in the transwell migration assays. Conversely, silencing of endothelial Sema3F by siRNA transfection dampened diapedesis of PBMCs through the endothelium in vitro. xMechanistically, Sema3F induced upregulation of adhesion molecule PECAM-1 in endothelial cells and in murine heart tissue shown by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The inhibition of PECAM-1 by blocking antibody HEC7 blunted Sema3F-induced leukocyte migration in transwell assays. SiRNA-based NRP2 knockdown reduced PECAM-1 expression and migration of PBMCs in Sema3F-treated endothelial cells, indicating that PECAM-1 expression and leukocyte migration in response to Sema3F depend on endothelial NRP2. To assess the regulation of Sema3F in human inflammatory disease, we collected serum samples of patients from day 0 to day 7 after survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA, n=41). First, we demonstrated enhanced migration of PBMCs through endothelial cells exposed to the serum of patients after OHCA in comparison to the serum of patients with stable coronary artery disease or healthy volunteers. Remarkably, serum samples of OHCA patients contained significantly higher Sema3F protein levels compared with CAD patients (CAD, n=37) and healthy volunteers (n=11), suggesting a role of Sema3F in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response after OHCA. Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated serum Sema3F levels after ROSC are associated with decreased survival, myocardial dysfunction, and prolonged vasopressor therapy, clinical findings that determine the outcome of post-resuscitation period after OHCA. The present study provides novel evidence that endothelial Sema3F controls leukocyte recruitment through a NRP2/PECAM-1-dependent mechanism. Sema3F serum concentrations are elevated following successful resuscitation suggesting that Sema3F might be involved in the inflammatory response after survived OHCA. Targeting the Sema3F/NRP2/PECAM-1 pathway could provide a novel approach to abolish overwhelming inflammation after resuscitation.

TI  - Trapped in a disrupted normality: Survivors' and partners' experiences of life after a sudden cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: Advances in resuscitation science have resulted in a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. However, we know very little about the natural history of recovery and the unmet needs of survivors and their partners. This qualitative study sought to address this knowledge gap to improve understanding of the consequences of surviving cardiac arrest.
   Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken separately with survivors and their partners between 3 and 12-months following the cardiac arrest. An interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA) to data analysis was adopted. Developing themes were discussed between members of the research team.
   Results: 8 survivors (41 79 years; 5 male; mean time 6.3 months post-hospital discharge) and 3 partners (1 male) were interviewed. The key (super-ordinate) theme of being 'trapped in a disrupted normality' was identified within the data. Five related subordinate themes included: existential impact, physical ramifications, emotional consequences, limiting participation in social activities and altered family roles.
   Conclusion: Recovery for survivors is hindered by a wide range of physical, emotional, cognitive, social and spiritual challenges that disrupt perceptions of 'normality'. Survivors and their carers may benefit from focussing on establishing a new normal' rather than striving to achieve a precardiac social and physical position. Survivor-centred assessment should support rather than undermine this goal.

TI  - Increasing the donor pool
T2  - LUNG TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - The widespread application of lung transplantation is limited by the lack of suitable organs from brain-dead donors resulting in long waiting times for listed patients with a substantial risk of dying prior to transplantation. To overcome this critical organ shortage, many transplant programmes worldwide have begun to explore alternative pathways to increase their lung donor pool.
   Several groups have shown that lungs from donors not matching the ideal criteria for lung donation can be successfully transplanted with good long-term outcome. Nevertheless, caution needs to be exercised when transplanting less optimal lungs in recipients with an increased operative risk. Successful techniques to downsize the pulmonary graft such as peripheral (segmental) resection, lobe transplantation and pulmonary bipartitioning have been developed in order to transplant grafts from larger donors into smaller recipients. This is of specific interest for children and small women facing longer waiting times.
   The use of lobes from living donors is also an option mainly in patients with cystic fibrosis receiving the lower lobes from two different donors. Improved long-term outcome with a lower incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome has been reported. The number of teams reporting successful transplantation of lungs recovered from a donor after cardiac arrest has increased over the last few years. Most organs still come from controlled non-heart-beating donors, but lungs from donors after unexpected cardiac death can also be successfully transplanted with reported results comparable to heart-beating donors. Ex vivo reperfusion for reconditioning of initially rejected donor lungs appears to be a promising development to increase the lung donor yield.
   Finally, there is still a long gap to bridge before pulmonary xenotransplantation will become clinical reality to help all those in need waiting for new lungs to become available.

TI  - Gasping During Cardiac Arrest in Humans Is Frequent and Associated With Improved Survival
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-The incidence and significance of gasping after cardiac arrest in humans are controversial.
   Methods and Results-Two approaches were used. The first was a retrospective analysis of consecutive confirmed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests from the Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center text files to determine the presence of gasping soon after collapse. The second was a retrospective analysis of 1218 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Arizona documented by emergency medical system (EMS) first-care reports to determine the incidence of gasping after arrest in relation to the various EMS arrival times. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge. An analysis of the Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center records of witnessed and unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests with attempted resuscitation found that 44 of 113 (39%) of all arrested patients had gasping. An analysis of 1218 EMS-attended, witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests demonstrated that the presence or absence of gasping correlated with EMS arrival time. Gasping was present in 39 of 119 patients (33%) who arrested after EMS arrival, in 73 of 363 (20%) when EMS arrival was < 7 minutes, in 50 of 360 (14%) when EMS arrival time was 7 to 9 minutes, and in 25 of 338 (7%) when EMS arrival time was > 9 minutes. Survival to hospital discharge occurred in 54 of 191 patients (28%) who gasped and in 80 of 1027 (8%) who did not (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 5.2). Among the 481 patients who received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge occurred among 30 of 77 patients who gasped (39%) versus only 38 of 404 among those who did not gasp (9%) (adjusted odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 9.4).
   Conclusions-Gasping or abnormal breathing is common after cardiac arrest but decreases rapidly with time. Gasping is associated with increased survival. These results suggest that the recognition and importance of gasping should be taught to bystanders and emergency medical dispatchers so as not to dissuade them from initiating prompt resuscitation efforts when appropriate.

TI  - "Utstein style" spreadsheet and database programs based on Microsoft Excel® and Microsoft Access® software for CPR data management of in-hospital resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - In 1997, The American Heart Association in association with representatives of the International Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) published recommended guidelines for reviewing, reporting and conducting in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) outcomes using the "Utstein style". Using these guidelines, we developed two Microsoft Office(R) based database management programs that may be useful to the resuscitation community. We developed a user-friendly spreadsheet based on MS Office Excel(R). The user enters patient variables such as name, age, and diagnosis. Then, event resuscitation variables such as time of collapse and CPR team arrival are entered from a "code flow sheet". Finally, outcome variables such as patient condition at different time points are recorded. The program then makes automatic calculations of average response times, survival rates and other important outcome measurements. Also using the Utstein style, we developed a database program based on MS Office Access(R). To promote free public access to these programs, we established at http://www.cproutcomes.org a website. These programs will help hospitals track, analyze, and present their CPR outcomes data. Clinical CPR researchers might also find the programs useful because they are easily modified and have statistical functions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multidisciplinary residential home intervention to improve outcomes for frail residents
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background Residential homes provide accommodation and assistance with personal care only and are not required to have registered nurses on site. However, their residents often have a combination of comorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty and mental-health conditions with poor access to healthcare to meet these needs. Integrated healthcare for older people is a key NHS priority in the Long-Term Plan and the Five-Year Forward View. We describe development and implementation of multi-disciplinary intervention to integrate healthcare and promote interprofessional education. Methods A multi-disciplinary residential home quality improvement project in two cycles by a team comprising senior and trainee general practitioners, trainees in geriatrics, psychiatry, pharmacist and residential home senior staff. The intervention was underpinned by the framework for enhanced health in care homes including Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and mental-health review. Each intervention session included an educational presentation by a team member consideration of each resident in a pre-evaluation multi-disciplinary discussion followed by a structured clinical assessment and discussion of proposed management. Results Three residential homes participated with a total 34 residents receiving intervention. In one residential home, there was a 75% reduction in admissions for those reviewed and a reduction in overall admission costs. Polypharmacy was reduced by an average of 2 medications per resident across the three sites. There was a 63% increase in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation decisions and 76% increase in advance care planning discussions. Conclusion This was an effective model for multi-disciplinary trainees working with a perceived impact on physical and mental health, and valuable opportunities for sharing learning.

TI  - The protective effects of a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, sildenafil, on postresuscitation cardiac dysfunction of cardiac arrest: metabolic evidence from microdialysis
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Recent experimental and clinical studies have indicated the cardioprotective role of sildenafil during ischemia/reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to determine, by obtaining metabolic evidence from microdialysis, if sildenafil could reduce the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and lead to cardioprotection through beneficial effects on energy metabolism.
   Methods: Twenty-four male piglets were randomly divided into three groups: sildenafil (n = 8), saline (SA; n = 8) and sham operation (n = 8). Sildenafil pretreatment consisted of 0.5 mg/kg sildenafil administered once intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to ventricular fibrillation (VF). The myocardial interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate and glycerol were determined by microdialysis before VF. Afterward, the piglets were subjected to 8 minutes of untreated VF followed by 15 minutes of open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation. ISF was collected continuously, and the experiment was terminated 24 hours after resuscitation.
   Results: After 8 minutes of untreated VF, the sildenafil group exhibited higher glucose and pyruvate concentrations of ISF and lower lactate and glutamate levels in comparison with the SA group, and these data reached statistical significance (P < 0.05). Advanced cardiac life support was delivered to both groups, with a 24-hour survival rate showing a promising trend in the sildenafil group (7 of 8 versus 3 of 8 survivors, P < 0.05). Compared with the SA group, the sildenafil group had a better outcome in terms of hemodynamic and oxygen metabolism parameters (P < 0.05). Myocardial tissue analysis revealed a dramatic increase in the contents of ATP, ADP and phosphocreatine in the sildenafil group versus the SA group at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC; P = 0.03, P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, 24 hours after ROSC, the sildenafil group had marked elevations in activity of left ventricular Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase compared with the SA group (P = 0.03, P= 0.04, respectively).
   Conclusions: Sildenafil could reduce the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, and it produced better clearance of metabolic waste in the ISF. This work might provide insights into the development of a novel strategy to treat postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.

TI  - Postintensive Care Syndrome in Pediatric Critical Care Survivors: Therapeutic Options to Improve Outcomes After Acquired Brain Injury
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review Children surviving the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with neurologic illness or injury have long-term morbidities in physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning termed postintensive care syndrome (PICS). In this article, we review acute and longitudinal management strategies available to combat PICS in children with acquired brain injury.
   Recent findings Few intervention studies in this vulnerable population target PICS morbidities. Small studies show promise for both inpatient- and outpatient-initiated therapies, mainly focusing on a single domain of PICS and evaluating heterogeneous populations. While evaluating the effects of interventions on longitudinal PICS outcomes is in its infancy, longitudinal clinical programs targeting PICS are increasing. A multidisciplinary team with inpatient and outpatient presence is necessary to deliver the holistic integrated care required to address all domains of PICS in patients and families.
   Summary While PICS is increasingly recognized as a chronic problem in PICU survivors with acquired brain injury, few interventions have targeted PICS morbidities. Research is needed to improve physical, cognitive, emotional, and social outcomes in survivors and their families.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of acute medium- or high-risk pulmonary embolism: a single-center retrospective cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
AB  - Background: Patients with acute and high-risk pulmonary embolism have a high mortality rate, and the optimal treatment for these patients has still not been fully established. Although anticoagulation therapy is currently the preferred treatment for pulmonary embolism, for some patients with intermediate- or high-risk pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation therapy alone has a higher probability of long-term pulmonary hypertension and also seriously worsens the quality of life of patients. This paper mainly reports the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with acute medium- or high-risk pulmonary embolism in Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province so as to provide some clinical basis for the treatment of such patients in the future. Methods: This study mainly collected the clinical data of 43 patients who were admitted to Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province from May 2018 to May 2023 due to acute medium-to-high-risk pulmonary embolism and received PMT treatment. Preoperative and postoperative blood tests, vital signs, and echocardiographic parameters were compared. The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications in follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months was also recorded. Mechanical treatment included thrombus fragmentation complemented with aspiration. Results: Among the 43 patients, 22 patients were treated with thrombus fragmentation coupled with a pigtail catheter and aspiration using a 6-F multipurpose angiographic (MPA) catheter, 11 were treated by AngioJet, and 10 were treated with an AcoStream catheter. Local thrombolysis treatment with small dose of urokinase was administered in some patients according to the patient's risk of bleeding. Among the patients, 41 patients received a successful operation, representing a surgical success rate of 95.3%. There was one patient with pulmonary infection who died after discharge. There were significant differences in vital signs between the 48-hour preoperative timepoint and the 48-hour postoperative timepoint including cardiac index, pulse, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation (P<0.001). The blood test indicators of carbon dioxide partial pressure and creatinine level did not show obvious abnormalities, but differences in hemoglobin, oxygen partial pressure, and lactate level were statistically significant. In terms of cardiac ultrasound, pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial diameter change were significantly different (P<0.001). There were seven cases of local hematoma at the puncture site, three cases of infection at the puncture site, and nine cases of transient cardiac arrest during the operation. All 41 patients were followed up: one patient died after being discharged due to aggravation of pulmonary infection during hospitalization, one patient died of intracerebral hemorrhage 9 months after the operation, one patient developed recurrent pulmonary embolism, and five patients had no obvious improvement in chest tightness. Conclusions: PMT can be used as a safe and effective treatment option for acute medium-to-high-risk pulmonary embolism.

TI  - Construction by dielectrophoresis of microbial aggregates for the study of bacterial cell dormancy
T2  - BIOMICROFLUIDICS
AB  - A study of the effect of aggregate size on the resuscitation of dormant M. smegmatis was conducted by constructing cell aggregates with defined sizes and shapes using dielectrophoresis and monitoring the resuscitation process under controlled laboratorial conditions in a long-term cell feeding system. Differently sized cell aggregates were created on the surface of indium tin oxide coated microelectrodes, their heights and shapes controlled by the strength of the induced electric field and the shape of the microelectrodes. Both two-dimensional (ring-patterned) and three-dimensional cell aggregates were produced. The cell aggregates were maintained under sterile conditions at 37 degrees C for up to 14 days by continuously flushing Sauton's medium through the chamber. Resuscitation of dormant M. smegmatis was evaluated by the production of the fluorescent dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyltetrazolium chloride. The results confirm that the resuscitation of dormant M. smegmatis is triggered by the accumulation of a resuscitation promoting factor inside the aggregates by diffusion limitation.

TI  - Oxygen targets in critically ill patients: from pathophysiology to population enrichment strategies
T2  - MEDICAL GAS RESEARCH
AB  - Oxygen supplementation is widely used to enhance oxygen delivery and to treat or prevent hypoxia; however, it requires careful management to avoid the harmful effects of excessive oxygen exposure. Both hyperoxia (inspiratory oxygen fraction exceeding 0.21) and hyperoxemia (arterial oxygen tension oxygen partial pressure [PaO2] > 100 mmHg) can contribute to lung injury, promote systemic vasoconstriction, and increase the production of reactive oxygen species, which can impair macromolecular and cellular functions. Conversely, in certain situations, hyperoxemia may provide benefits, such as hemodynamic stabilization in hyperdynamic shock, immunomodulation, and bactericidal effects. The literature presents conflicting evidence regarding the impact of different oxygen targets (i.e., PaO2 and/or peripheral saturation of oxygen [SpO(2)]) on both short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute critical conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, cardiac arrest, and acute central nervous system injuries. These discrepancies may stem from the small differences between the oxygenation targets used in randomized trials, the physiological limitations of PaO2 and SpO(2) targets, which reflect blood oxygen content rather than oxygen delivery, the lack of measurements of microvascular function or oxygen delivery, and the heterogeneity in treatment response. Furthermore, advanced analytical methods (e.g., machine learning) are emerging as promising tools to implement population enrichment strategies. By refining patient sub-group identification, these approaches can significantly optimize precision medicine, enabling more personalized oxygen therapy tailored to individual patient characteristics.

TI  - Melatonin improves neurological outcomes and preserves hippocampal mitochondrial function in a rat model of cardiac arrest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Cerebral injury after cardiac arrest (CA)/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been implicated in the poor prognosis of CA survivors. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of melatonin on postresuscitation neurological outcomes and to explore the underlying mechanism. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham group, CPR group, melatonin pretreatment group (Pre-M) and posttreatment group (Post-M). For the last 2 groups, daily melatonin gavage was performed for 12 consecutive days before or 24 hours after rat survival from CA/CPR. No statistical differences were observed in heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) at baseline and after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) among groups. However, melatonin pretreatment or posttreatment significantly improved neurological deficit score and memory and spatial learning ability after CA/CPR. Further studies demonstrated that the complex I- and complex-II supported mitochondrial respiration were greatly increased under melatonin treatment. In addition, melatonin treatment preserved the mitochondrialbinding hexokinase II (HKII) and ATP levels and suppressed the upregulated protein lysine acetylation in hippocampus after CA/CPR. In conclusion, using a rat asphyxial CA model we have demonstrated that treatment with melatonin either before or after CA/CPR provides a promising neuroprotective effect, and this protection was mediated by increasing mitochondrial HKII expression, suppressing protein acetylation and improving mitochondrial function in hippocampus.

TI  - Effects of Levosimendan on Hemodynamics, Local Cerebral Blood Flow, Neuronal Injury, and Neuroinflammation After Asphyctic Cardiac Arrest in Rats
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Despite advances in cardiac arrest treatment, high mortality and morbidity rates after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation are still a major clinical relevant problem. The post cardiac arrest syndrome subsumes myocardial dysfunction, impaired microcirculation, systemic inflammatory response, and neurological impairment. The calcium-sensitizer levosimendan was able to improve myocardial function and initial resuscitation success after experimental cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We hypothesized that levosimendan exerts beneficial effects on cerebral blood flow, neuronal injury, neurological outcome, and inflammation 24 hours after experimental cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Design: Laboratory animal study.
   Setting: University animal research laboratory.
   Subjects: Sixty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Interventions: Animals underwent asphyxial cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation, randomized to groups with levosimendan treatment (bolus 12 mu g/kg and infusion for 3 hr [0.3 mu g/min/kg]) or vehicle (saline 0.9% bolus and infusion for 3 hr [equivalent fluid volume]). Cardiac index, local cerebral blood flow, and hemodynamic variables were measured for 180 minutes after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Behavioral and neurological evaluations were conducted 24 hours after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Furthermore, neuronal injury, expressed as Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells in the hippocampal formation, cortical and hippocampal inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and blood plasma interleukin-6 values were assessed.
   Measurements and Main Results: Treatment with levosimendan reduced neuronal injury and improved neurological outcome after 24 hours of reperfusion and resulted in elevated cardiac index and local cerebral blood flow compared with vehicle after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Mean arterial blood pressure was reduced during the early reperfusion period in the levosimendan group. Cortical and hippocampal inflammatory cytokine gene expression and blood plasma interleukin-6 levels were not influenced.
   Conclusions: Levosimendan increased cerebral blood flow after experimental cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This effect coincided with reduced neuronal injury and improved neurologic outcome. Findings seem to be independent of inflammatory effects because no effects by levosimendan on cerebral or systemic inflammation could be detected. In summary, levosimendan is a promising agent to improve neurological outcome after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - Quality Learning in Basic Life Support in Portuguese Basic Education School: A Cross-Sectional Study with 10th Grade Students
T2  - SOCIETIES
AB  - An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The survival rate can be influenced by the chain of survival. The school is the institution that has the opportunity to promote the education of citizens in basic life support (BLS), increasing the number of trained bystanders. This study aimed to identify the theoretical and practical knowledge and self-reported skills in BLS, in order to characterize the motivation to intervene in an emergency. A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and analytical study of the survey type was developed with a sample of 1215 students enrolled in 10th-grade secondary education in 2019-2020 in Portugal. The results point to a fragile appropriation of theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of BLS. Self-declared competences tend to rank below the theoretical knowledge manifested. Motivation to intervene is high: students are sensitive to the topic and willing to learn and highlight the importance and social relevance of the topic. We conclude that students do not feel prepared and are not empowered to intervene in an OHCA episode. It seems necessary to develop didactic proposals that align the teaching of BLS with the essential learning at the end of compulsory education in Portugal.

TI  - Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest With Full Neurologic Recovery After Approximately Nine Hours of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Management and Possible Complications
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - We describe full neurologic recovery from accidental hypothermia with cardiac arrest despite the longest reported duration of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and extracorporeal life support (8 hours, 42 minutes). Clinical data and blood samples were obtained from emergency medical services (EMS) and the intensive care department. A 31-year-old man experienced a witnessed hypothermic cardiac arrest with a core temperature of 26 degrees C (78.8 degrees F) during a summer thunderstorm; he received mechanical CPR for 3 hours and 42 minutes, followed by 5 hours of extracorporeal life support. The use of a standard operating procedure that integrates a technical mountain rescue performed by EMS, optimizes prolonged CPR to the hub hospital, and enables prompt placement of extracorporeal life support is described and discussed. Three months postaccident, the patient had recovered completely (Cerebral Performance Category score of 1) and resumed normal daily life. Neurologically intact survival from hypothermic cardiac arrest is common, suggesting that aggressive resuscitation measures are warranted. There is a need for the establishment of a clear standard operating procedure and multiteam education and training to further optimize the patient survival chain from on-site triage and treatment to inhospital extracorporeal life support and postresuscitation care.

TI  - Cardiac arrest following sugammadex administration
T2  - ANAESTHESIA REPORTS
AB  - A 68-year-old man underwent elective surgical repair of an abdominal wall hernia under general anaesthesia. The operation required muscle relaxation, for which we used rocuronium. Following completion of surgery, 180 mg sugammadex was administered intravenously. Shortly afterwards, the patient became severely bradycardic with hypotension, refractory to treatment with ephedrine. This progressed to a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest. After 4 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there was return of spontaneous circulation and, following a period of haemodynamic stability in which general anaesthesia was maintained, the patient emerged from anaesthesia without incident. He remained haemodynamically stable until discharge. Post-resuscitation investigations including the serum tryptase level were unremarkable except for a mild respiratory acidosis and slightly elevated D-dimers. Sugammadex-induced bradycardia has previously been described, but its mechanism remains unknown. We believe that sugammadex was the cause of cardiac arrest in this case because of the timing and sequence of events, the evolution to pulseless electric activity and the relatively uneventful post-arrest clinical course. We hope that our report will help to promote awareness about this potential complication of a now commonly-used drug.

TI  - An Enhanced Adaptive Filtering Method for Suppressing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Artifact
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be interrupted for reliable rhythm analysis in current automatic external defibrillators because of artifacts produced by chest compressions. However, interruptions in CPR adversely affect the restoration of spontaneous circulation and survival. Suppressing CPR artifacts by digital signal processing techniques is a promising method to enable rhythm analysis during chest compressions, which would eliminate CPR interruptions for rhythm analysis. Although numerous methods have been developed to suppress CPR artifacts, the accuracy of rhythm analysis is still inadequate due to the residual artifact components in the filtered signal. This study proposes an enhanced adaptive filtering method to suppress CPR artifacts. A total of 183 shockable and 453 nonshockable segments of ECG signal, together with CPR-related reference signal, were extracted from 233 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients. The method was optimized on a training set with 85 shockable and 211 nonshockable segments, and evaluated on a testing set with 98 shockable and 242 nonshockable segments. Compared with artifact corrupted ECG signals, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increased from -9.8 +/- 12.5 to 11.2 +/- 11.8 dB, and the accuracy was improved from 74.1% to 92.0% after filtering with the proposed method. Compared with the traditional adaptive filter, the SNR was improved by 1.7 dB and the accuracy was improved by 5.6 points. These results indicated that the proposed method could effectively suppress the chest compression related artifacts and improve the accuracy of rhythm analysis during uninterrupted CPR.

TI  - ADVANCED CARDIAC LIFE-SUPPORT - UPDATE ON RECENT GUIDELINES AND A LOOK AT THE FUTURE
T2  - CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The objectives of this article are to provide an update of the American Heart Association (AHA) 1992 National Conference guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiac care and to review the investigation and development of new methods of CPR which may be considered in future recommendations. Despite an organized approach to sudden cardiac arrest, survival in patients receiving CPR is in the range of 5-15%. The new AHA guidelines recommend standard manual CPR performed at a rate of 80-100 compressions/min and organized algorithms of advanced cardiac life support. These guidelines stress widespread community training and rapid response in the following sequence: (1) recognition of early warning signs, (2) activation of the emergency medical system (EMS), (3) basic CPR, (4) early defibrillation, (5) intubation, acid (6) intravenous medication. Several new recommendations pertain specifically to in-hospital care and are, therefore, particularly relevant to physician management of cardiac arrest. The best predictor of survival in patients requiring circulatory support after cardiac arrest is attainable coronary and cerebral perfusion. Unfortunately the minimal levels of end-organ perfusion required to sustain life are often difficult or impossible to achieve with standard manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation and several new techniques have therefore been introduced. The most promising of these techniques are (1) interposed abdominal compression, (2) pneumatic vest, and (3) active compression-decompression resuscitation. Each of these techniques offers unique advantages when compared with standard manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The 1992 National Conference recommendations provide a rational framework for the resuscitation of cardiac arrest victims. New methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are now available and investigation into these methods continues. In the future, these modalities may be incorporated in newer guidelines and be available on a widespread basis to supplement our current approach to cardiac arrest.

TI  - Relational Family Therapy in the Treatment of Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survivors and their Relatives
T2  - PERSON AND THE CHALLENGES-THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY EDUCATION CANON LAW AND SOCIAL STUDIES INSPIRED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest is the most common single cause of death in the contemporary world, but the proportion of survivors is increasing thanks to modern intensive methods of hospital treatment. However, data show that survivors experience high rates of neurological and cognitive deficits and poorer emotional well-being, which is a major challenge in treating these individuals and encouraging their integration in everyday life. These issues range from a number of emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, to lower levels of participation in social life and a low rate of return to their workplace. The need for security and support increases because of the feelings of insecurity, vulnerability and fear of the recurrence of symptoms. Relatives/caregivers who report emotional problems and a higher level of post-traumatic stress are physically and mentally burdened, too. Hence, sudden cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event which is traumatic for survivors and their close relatives. It triggers strong emotional responses that are characteristic of all types of trauma (reliving the trauma, avoidance, negative thoughts and mood, increased agitation). People who have survived trauma thus suffer long-term effects, which are reflected in various dysfunctional behaviours and activities due to inadequate regulation of affective states. Because of these issues, there is a need for effective interventions that can psychologically help patients and relatives after surviving sudden cardiac arrest. In this paper, we will present the model of Relational Family Therapy, which can enable survivors and their relatives to appropriately emotionally-affectively process this experience and thus more appropriately integrate into a new way of life. With the qualitative research method of task analysis, we will show the process of change, which is based on the establishment of a new regulation of affect and allows in-depth processing of difficult emotional states after this event.

TI  - Survival status and functional outcome of children who required prolonged intensive care after cardiac surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Background: Children who require prolonged intensive care after cardiac surgery are at risk of high mortality. The long-term survival and functional outcome of these children have not been studied in detail.
   Methods: Children who stayed in intensive care for >28 days after cardiac surgery from 1997 to 2012 were studied in a single institution. A total of 116 patients were identified; 107 (92%) were <1 year of age and 63 (54%) had univentricular physiology.
   Results: The incidence of children requiring prolonged intensive care increased from 1.01/100 undergoing cardiac surgery in 1997 to 2000 to 2.66/100 in 2009 to 2012 (P trend = .002). This increase coincided with an increase in the number of children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome having prolonged intensive care during the same period (0.13/100 in 1997-2000 to 1.0/100 in 2009-2012; P trend = .001). Survival to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) discharge was 74%(95% confidence interval [CI], 65-82) and 51%(95% CI, 41-59) at 3 years. Factors associated with mortality were univentricular repair (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.21-3.70; P = .008) and acute renal failure (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.77-5.12; P < .001), but era did not influence mortality (1997-2005 vs 2006-2012; log-rank P = .66). Among PICU survivors, 3-year survival in those who did not need early reoperation was 81% (95% CI, 66-90), compared with 58% (95% CI, 42-71) in those who required early reoperation (log-rank P = .01). Among survivors, 36% had either moderate or severe disability and 13% had poor quality of life.
   Conclusions: The incidence of children requiring prolonged intensive care after cardiac surgery has increased in our institution. Our data suggest that the long-term outcome for most of these children is poor, especially after univentricular repair.

TI  - Successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation outcome reviews
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - An implicit question in every pre-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) scenario is 'what will be the quality of life if a save is achieved?' This issue has implications for doctrine, policy, training and post-CPR counselling of both resuscitator and victim. Post-salvage neurological syndromes in surviving victims include amnesia, personality change, cognitive loss, depression, Parkinsonian syndromes, decorticate and decerebrate states and permanent brain damage with vegetative existence. Children who are salvaged by CPR rarely have pre-existing co-morbidities: but 75% of adults have pre-existing cardiac disease, cancer or diabetes. Such, of course, continue after a successful resuscitation. In the case of children who are resuscitated from acute hypoxic insults, the quality of life is generally good and, in the specific instance of survivors from near-drowning, some 95% will lead lives relatively unmodified. Although successful CPR resuscitation rates remain low in adults, the quality of life of those who leave hospital remains generally high. CPR involves two feature subjects, the resuscitator and the victim. Just as for the victim, so too the resuscitator's life is modified by CPR and its aftermath, whether immediate salvage has been achieved or not. This review addresses these issues, as a successful CPR (dramatic as it is) is not a conclusion but the beginning of a new phase of life for both resuscitator and victim.

TI  - Comparison of Emergency Medical Dispatch Systems for Performance of Telecommunicator-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Among 9-1-1 Callers With Limited English Proficiency
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - IMPORTANCE Increasing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among racial/ethnic minority groups and culturally underserved populations is a key strategy in improving health care disparities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   OBJECTIVE To ascertain whether implementation of the Los Angeles Tiered Dispatch System (LA-TDS) was associated with improved performance of telecommunicator-assisted CPR (T-CPR) among 9-1-1 callers with limited English proficiency in the City of Los Angeles.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study compared emergency medical services-treated, nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls using the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) from January 1 to March 31, 2014, with calls using LA-TDS from January 1 to March 31, 2015. Trained data abstractors evaluated all 9-1-1 audio recordings for the initiation of T-CPR and the elapsed time to predefined events. Data were analyzed between January and December 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the prevalence of T-CPR among 9-1-1 callers with limited English proficiency for field-confirmed nontraumatic cardiac arrests. Additional outcomes included T-CPR among callers with English proficiency and the elapsed time until key events in the call.
   RESULTS Of the 1027 emergency medical services calls during the study periods, 597 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 289 calls (48%) were made using MPDS (263 callers with English proficiency, and 26 callers with limited English proficiency), and 308 calls (52%) were made using LA-TDS (273 callers with English proficiency, and 35 callers with limited English proficiency). No differences between MPDS and LA-TDS cohorts were found in age, sex, known comorbidities, arrest location (private vs public), or witnessed status. The prevalence of T-CPR among callers with limited English proficiency was significantly greater using LA-TDS (69%) vs MPDS (28%) (odds ratio [OR], 5.66; 95% CI, 1.79-17.85; P = .003). For callers with English proficiency, the prevalence of T-CPR improved from 55% using MPDS to 67% using LA-TDS (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.15-2.41; P = .007). With LA-TDS, callers with limited English proficiency had a significant decrease in time to recognition of cardiac arrest (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.84; P = .005) and dispatch of resources (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94; P = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The LA-TDS compared with MPDS was associated with increased performance of T-CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests involving 9-1-1 callers with limited English proficiency. Further studies are needed in communities with a predominance of people with limited English proficiency to characterize bystander response, promote activation of the chain of survival, and clarify the precise elements of LA-TDS that can improve T-CPR performance.

TI  - Delaying shock for cardiopulmonary resuscitation: does it save lives?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review Out-of-hospital cardiac, arrest claims more than 450 000 lives annually in North America. Many communities have dedicated significant resources to provide rapid defibrillator response for patients in ventricular fibrillation. In spite of these efforts, mortality from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has not improved significantly. Emerging evidence some patients in ventricular fibrillation arrest may be harmed by immediate defibrillation.
   Recent findings Recent laboratory studies have shown benefit in performing a period of chest compressions (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) prior to defibrillation in models with more than 4 minutes of induced ventricular fibrillation. During the initial 4 minutes the heart is more amenable to electrical defibrillation. Between 4-10 minutes, chest compressions create some coronary perfusion and fill the left ventricle to prepare the heart for electric shock. These findings, in conjunction with most emergency medical service response times reported to be 5-8 minutes, have prompted human investigation into a strategy of chest compression first. A recent randomized controlled trial reported a fivefold increase in survival for patients with more than 5 minutes of VF who received 3 minutes of chest compressions prior to defibrillation compared with those who had not.
   Summary Current guidelines call for rapid defibrillation as the most important 'link' in the 'chain of survival'. For most ventricular fibrillation patients who have professional rescuers arrive after 5-8 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, however, immediate defibrillation is likely to be ineffective. Counterintuitively, these patients may benefit from a period of chest compressions prior to being shocked.

TI  - Resting for viability: Gordonia polyisoprenivorans ZM27, a robust generalist for petroleum bioremediation under hypersaline stress
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - The intrinsic issue associated with the application of microbes for practical pollution remediation involves maintaining the expected activity of engaged strains or consortiums as effectively as that noted under laboratory conditions. Faced with various stress factors, degraders with dormancy ability are more likely to survive and exhibit degradation activity. In this study, a hydrocarbonoclastic and halotolerant strain, Gordonia polyisoprenivorans ZM27, was isolated via stimulation with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf). Long-term exposure to dual stresses of 10% NaCl and starvation induced ZM27 to enter a viable but nonculturable (VBNC)-like state, and ZM27 cells could be resuscitated upon Rpf stimulation. Notable changes in both morphological and physiological characteristics between VBNC-like ZM27 cells and resuscitated cells confirmed the response to Rpf and their robust resistance against harsh environments. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis indicated ZM27 could be a generalist degrader with dormancy ability. Subsequently, VBNC-like ZM27 was applied in a soil microcosm experiment to investigate the practical application potential under harsh conditions. VBNC-like ZM27 combined with Rpf stimulation exhibited the most effective biodegradation performance, and the initial nhexadecane content (1000 mg kg(-1)) decreased by 63.29% after 14-day incubation. Based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis, Gordonia exhibited a positive response to Rpf stimulation. The relative abundance of genus Gordonia was negatively correlated with that of Alcanivorax, a genus of obligate hydrocarbon degrader with the greatest abundance during soil incubation. Based on the degradation profile and community analysis, generalist Gordonia may be more efficient in hydrocarbon degradation than specialist Alcanivorax under harsh conditions. The characteristics of ZM27, including its sustainable culturability under long-term stress, response to Rpf and robust performance in soil microcosms, are valuable for the remediation of petroleum pollution under stressful conditions. Our work validated the importance of dormancy and highlighted the underestimated role of low-activity degraders in petroleum remediation.

TI  - Protocol of a Multicenter International Randomized Controlled Manikin Study on Different Protocols of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for laypeople (MANI-CPR)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in industrialised countries. Survival depends on prompt identification of cardiac arrest and on the quality and timing of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. For laypeople, there has been a growing interest on hands-only CPR, meaning continuous chest compression without interruption to perform ventilations. It has been demonstrated that intentional interruptions in hands-only CPR can increase its quality. The aim of this randomised trial is to compare three CPR protocols performed with different intentional interruptions with hands-only CPR.
   Methods and analysis This is a prospective randomised trial performed in eight training centres. Laypeople who passed a basic life support course will be randomised to one of the four CPR protocols in an 8 min simulated cardiac arrest scenario on a manikin: (1) 30 compressions and 2 s pause; (2) 50 compressions and 5 s pause; (3) 100 compressions and 10 s pause; (4) hands-only. The calculated sample size is 552 people. The primary outcome is the percentage of chest compression performed with correct depth evaluated by a computerised feedback system (Laerdal QCPR).
   Ethics and dissemination. Due to the nature of the study, we obtained a waiver from the Ethics Committee (IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy). All participants will sign an informed consent form before randomisation. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journal. The data collected will also be made available in a public data repository.

TI  - The effects of endogenous and exogenous vasopressin during experimental cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
CP  - 73rd Annual Scientific Sessions of the American-Heart-Association
AB  - Exogenous vasopressin is a promising vasopressor when blood pressure is critically threatened, but the role of endogenous vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is unknown. We assessed the role of endogenous versus exogenous vasopressin in a porcine open chest CPR model. Seven minutes before induction of cardiac arrest, seven pigs received 10 mug/kg of a selective vasopressin V(1)-receptor-antagonist (Blocked Vasopressin group); another 12 pigs in two groups received saline administration only. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 3 min of basic life support CPR, six animals received 0.8 U/kg vasopressin (Exogenous Vasopressin group), whereas the blocked vasopressin group (n = 7), and the remaining six animals received saline placebo only (Endogenous Vasopressin group). Defibrillation was attempted after 14 min of CPR. During basic life support CPR, left ventricular myocardial blood flow was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the Blocked Vasopressin group compared with the Exogenous Vasopressin group and Endogenous Vasopressin group (42 +/- 5 compared with 64 +/- 6 and 66 +/- 6 mL . min(-1) 100g(-1)). Left ventricular myocardial blood flow was significantly decreased in the Blocked Vasopressin group versus Exogenous Vasopressin group versus Endogenous Vasopressin group 90 s and 5 min after drug administration, respectively (38 +/- 4 and 27 +/- 3 vs 145 +/- 32 and 110 +/- 12 vs 62 +/- 4 and 56 +/- 6 mL . min(-1) 100g(-1), respectively). None of seven Blocked Vasopressin animals, six of six Exogenous Vasopressin pigs, and six of six Endogenous Vasopressin swine had return of spontaneous circulation after 14 min of cardiac arrest including 10 min of CPR (P < 0.05). In conclusion, pigs with blocked endogenous vasopressin had poor coronary perfusion pressure and left ventricular myocardial blood flow during open chest CPR, and could not be successfully resuscitated. All pigs with effective endogenous vasopressin or pigs with effective endogenous vasopressin and additional exogenous vasopressin had good left ventricular myocardial blood flow during experimental CPR, and survived the l-h postresuscitation phase. We conclude that endogenous vasopressin is an adjunct vasopressor to epinephrine and may serve as a back-up regulator to maintain cardiocirculatory homeostasis.

TI  - Xenon: An Emerging Neuroprotectant With Potential Application for Cardiac Arrest Care
T2  - CARDIOLOGY IN REVIEW
AB  - Xenon is an inert, highly polarizable noble gas with demonstrated safety and application in general anesthesia for over 50 years. A potent inhibitor of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors, xenon has a well-documented ameliorating effect on excitotoxic neuronal injury in numerous cellular and animal models of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The most important determinant of overall survival and morbidity in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is the severity of neurological injury. The only approved neuroprotective strategy in this setting is mild therapeutic hypothermia, which has demonstrated significant, albeit modest, improvements in mortality. The combination therapy of therapeutic hypothermia and xenon in porcine models of cardiac arrest has shown a greater improvement in functional outcomes than either intervention alone, thereby prompting the study of combination therapy in randomized clinical trials. The treatment of postarrest patients with xenon and mild hypothermia is safe and demonstrates favorable cardiovascular features, including a reduced heart rate, a reduction in troponin elevations, and a decreased need for vasopressors. Combination therapy is superior in protecting white matter integrity than hypothermia alone, but did not significantly impact neurological outcomes at 6-month follow-up. Despite an abundance of preclinical evidence supporting xenon's neuroprotective properties, its translational potential in postcardiac arrest care is indeterminate due to a lack of adequately-powered studies.

TI  - Predicting Changes in Preferences for Life-Sustaining Treatment Among Patients With Advanced Chronic Organ Failure
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Background: For physicians discussing advance care planning with patients with life-limiting illness, it is important to understand the stability of the patients' preferences for life-sustaining treatments and the factors that predict a change in preferences. Our objectives were to investigate 1-year stability of preferences regarding CPR and mechanical ventilation (MV) for outpatients with advanced COPD, chronic heart failure (CHF), or chronic renal failure (CRF) and to identify predictors of changes in preferences.
   Methods: In this study, 265 clinically stable outpatients with advanced COPD, CHF, or CRF were visited at baseline and every 4 months for 1 year to assess preferences regarding CPR and MV in their current health status. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between change in life-sustaining treatment preferences and several potential predictors, including changes in comorbidities, hospital admissions, genetic health status, care dependency, mobility, and symptoms of anxiety or depression.
   Results: The 1-year follow-up period was completed by 77.7% of the patients. Preferences regarding CPR or MV changed in 38.3% of the patients during the follow-up period. Changes over time in generic health status, mobility, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and marital status were associated with changes in life-sustaining treatment preferences.
   Conclusions: More than one-third of outpatients with advanced COPD, CHF, or CRF change their preferences regarding CPR and/or nv at least once during 1 year. Regular reevaluation of advance care planning is necessary, in particular when patients experience a change in health status, mobility, symptoms of anxiety or depression, or marital status.

TI  - HEMODYNAMIC MONITORING DURING CPR
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Real-time hemodynamic monitoring provides useful information that can be used to assess and optimize mechanical and pharmacological interventions during CPR. The standard algorithms should always be the initial approach to resuscitation, because they offer a rapid, logical, coordinated series of treatments with proven success. Pressure and flow measurements during conventional, closed-chest CPR in humans indicate that the technique typically produces a hemodynamic state resembling profound cardiogenic shock, with a low systemic arterial pressure, markedly reduced cardiac output, and high intravascular filling pressures. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring provides useful, noninvasive information during clinical resuscitation. A low end-tidal carbon dioxide value during resuscitation should alert the rescuers that something is wrong with ventilation, perfusion, and/or carbon dioxide production and should prompt a search for correctable causes. If one or more hemodynamic parameters are being monitored at the time the patient develops cardiac arrest (eg, an intensive care unit patient who has an arterial line and a pulmonary artery catheter in place), it is appropriate for the resuscitation team to pay attention to the data that are generated during the resuscitation, particularly if the initial algorithm approach is not successful. For patients who are not being monitored at the time of their arrest, end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements provide noninvasive, semiquantitative information that can help the team detect and troubleshoot problems during resuscitation. Further research and better, more affordable technologies are needed to provide in- and out-of-hospital resuscitation teams feedback on the hemodynamic effectiveness of their resuscitative efforts.

TI  - Evolution of a community-wide early defibrillation programme - Experience over 13 years using police/fire personnel and paramedics as responders
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: In November 1990, a 2-year trial period was initiated in which police officers in the city of Rochester, Minnesota, were trained in the operation of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). Following the trial, the program was expanded as the city grew in population and area. In 1998 firefighters also were equipped with AEDs, bringing to a total 18 AEDs with police and fire personnel, in addition to paramedic capability.
   Methods: From November 1990 to December 2003, all adult patients with atraumatic cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the presenting rhythm were included for analysis. Call-to-shock time intervals, restoration of spontaneous circulation after defibrillation shocks only (without need for vasoactive or inotropic drug administration), and neurologically intact survival (overall performance category (OPC) 1 or 2) were study end-points.
   Results: One hundred and ninety-three patients presented in VF Of these, 80 (41%) were discharged neurologically intact. Of the 159 VF patients whose arrest was bystander-witnessed 73 (46%) were discharged. Survival from non-VF arrest was very low (5%). Assessment of VF survivors demonstrated a quality of life, adjusted for age, gender, and disease, similar to that of the general population.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate that a relatively high survival can be obtained in a city of this size and area employing a non-tiered community-wide approach within the emergency medical services (EMS) system. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - MEDICINA INTENSIVA
AB  - Objective: Compare prevalence and profile of post-intensive care patient (P-PICS) and family/caregiver (F-PICS) syndrome in two cohorts (COVID and non-COVID) and analyse risk factors for P-PICS. Design: Prospective, observational cohort (March 2018- 2023), follow-up at three months and one year. Setting: 14-bed polyvalent Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Level II Hospital. Patients or participants: 265 patients and 209 relatives. Inclusion criteria patients: age > 18 years, mechanical ventilation > 48 hours, ICU stay > 5 days, delirium, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest. Inclusion criteria family: those who attended. Interventions: Follow-up 3 months and 1 year after hospital discharge. Main variables of interest: Patients; sociodemographic, clinical, evolutive, physical, psychological and cognitive alterations, dependency degree and quality of life. Main caregivers: mental state and physical overload. Results: 64.9% PICS-P, no differences between groups. COVID patients more physical alterations than non-COVID (p = 0.028). These more functional deterioration (p = 0.005), poorer quality of life (p = 0.003), higher nutritional alterations (p = 0.004) and cognitive deterioration (p< 0.001). 19.1% PICS-F, more frequent in relatives of non-COVID patients (17.6% vs. 5.5%; p = 0.013). Independent predictors of PICS-P: first years of the study (OR: 0.484), higher comorbidity (OR: 1.158), delirium (OR: 2.935), several reasons for being included (OR: 3.171) and midazolam (OR: 4.265). Conclusions: Prevalence PICS-P and PICS-F between both cohorts was similar. Main factors associated with the development of SPCI-P were: higher comorbidity, delirium, midazolam, inclusion for more than one reason and during the first years.

TI  - Perioperative Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is an acute neurologic emergency. Prompt definitive treatment of the aneurysm by craniotomy and clipping or endovascular intervention with coils and/or stents is needed to prevent rebleeding. Extracranial manifestations of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage include cardiac dysfunction, neurogenic pulmonary edema, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and hyperglycemia. Data on the impact of anesthesia on long-term neurologic outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage do not exist. Perioperative management should therefore focus on optimizing systemic physiology, facilitating timely definitive treatment, and selecting an anesthetic technique based on patient characteristics, severity of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the planned intervention and monitoring. Anesthesiologists should be familiar with evoked potential monitoring, electroencephalographic burst suppression, temporary clipping, management of external ventricular drains, adenosine-induced cardiac standstill, and rapid ventricular pacing to effectively care for these patients.

TI  - P-COSCA (Pediatric Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Children: An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Studies of pediatric cardiac arrest use inconsistent outcomes, including return of spontaneous circulation and short-term survival, and basic assessments of functional and neurological status. In 2018, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation sponsored the COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set After Cardiac Arrest) to improve consistency in reported outcomes of clinical trials of adult cardiac arrest survivors and supported this P-COSCA initiative (Pediatric COSCA). The P-COSCA Steering Committee generated a list of potential survival, life impact, and economic impact outcomes and assessment time points that were prioritized by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare providers, researchers, and parents/caregivers of children who survived cardiac arrest. Then expert panel discussions achieved consensus on the core outcomes, the methods to measure those core outcomes, and the timing of the measurements. The P-COSCA includes assessment of survival, brain function, cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills. Survival and brain function are assessed at discharge or 30 days (or both if possible) and between 6 and 12 months after arrest. Cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills are assessed between 6 and 12 months after cardiac arrest. Because many children have prearrest comorbidities, the P-COSCA also includes documentation of baseline (ie, prearrest) brain function and calculation of changes after cardiac arrest. Supplementary outcomes of survival, brain function, cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills are assessed at 3 months and beyond 1 year after cardiac arrest if resources are available.

TI  - How best to train kids in basic life support: a literature review
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundBystander intervention is known to be the most important factor in the survival chain for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rates remain low-mainly due to a lack of training. Implementing basic life support (BLS) training in schools is a key aspect of increasing bystander intervention.We reviewed the literature on BLS training methods for schoolchildren and sought to identify the methodological elements that appeared to be the most effective in terms of the acquisition and retention of knowledge, practical skills, and attitudinal skills.BackgroundBystander intervention is known to be the most important factor in the survival chain for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Implementing basic life support (BLS) training in schools is a key aspect of increasing bystander intervention.We reviewed the literature on BLS training methods for schoolchildren and sought to identify the methodological elements that appeared to be the most effective in terms of the acquisition and retention of knowledge, practical skills, and attitudinal skills.MethodsWe searched the MEDLINE database (via PubMed) for relevant articles published between from January 2015 to January 2022. Articles on BLS training in children were selected if the primary objective was determine the effectiveness of the training method(s) used.ResultsOf the 1,098 publications identified, 28 were selected and reviewed. Half of the studies had a randomized, controlled design, the study sample size ranged from 57 to 1,917. Hands-on practice was included in 26 of the 28 studies, and the main training session lasted for 75 to 120 min. Hands-on practice gave better results than no practice. Learning tools promoted acquisition, and refresher training sessions appeared to be of value.ConclusionsThe results of our literature review showed that the conventional training pattern used with adults (i.e. theory, demonstration, and practice) is applicable to children if all the components are adapted for this population. Further studies of the development and evaluation of BLS training for young children are required.

TI  - Return to work after acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock: a Danish nationwide cohort study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Background Physical and mental well-being after critical illness may be objectified by the ability to work. We examined return to work among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) by cardiogenic shock (CS) status. Methods Danish nationwide registries were used to identify patients with first-time MI by CS status between 2005 and 2015, aged 18-63 years, working before hospitalization and discharged alive. Multiple logistic regression models were used to compare groups. Results We identified 19 799 patients with MI of whom 653 had CS (3%). The median age was similar for patients with and without CS (53 years, interquartile range 47-58). One-year outcomes in patients with and without CS were as follows: 52% vs. 83% returned to work, 41% vs. 16% did not and 6% vs. 1% died. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of returning to work was 0.53 [95% confidence limit (CI): 0.42-0.66]. In patients with CS, males and patients surviving OHCA were more likely to return to work (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.15-2.92 and 1.55, 95% CI: 1.00-2.40, respectively), whereas prolonged hospitalization (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22-0.65) and anoxic brain damage (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.18-0.72) were associated with lower likelihood of returning to work. Conclusion In patients with MI discharged alive, approximately 80% of those without CS returned to work at 1-year follow-up in contrast to 50% of those with CS. Among patients with CS, male sex and OHCA survivors were markers positively related to return to work, whereas prolonged hospitalization and anoxic brain damage were negatively related markers.

TI  - narrative inquiry of survivors' experiences of the time just before and after a cardiac arrest
T2  - COLLEGIAN
AB  - Background: There is extensive research on factors influencing cardiac arrest, however, there is limited understanding of survivors' experiences of cardiac arrest.
   Aim: To explore survivors' experiences of surviving cardiac arrest in the immediate time before and just after the event.
   Methods: Using a narrative inquiry approach individual face-to-face interviews were held from November 2016 to June 2017. A convenience sample of four females and thirteen males were recruited from the community using a newspaper article and snowball sampling techniques. Participants were aged between 48 and 92 years and experienced a cardiac arrest between 3 months and 36 years ago. Collected field text were analysed adhering to Clandinin and Connelly's narrative inquiry exploring how physical, social and cultural environment, and time impact and shape individual experiences.
   Findings: Narrative exploration of the experiences of cardiac arrest revealed survivors were unprepared and confused as a result of the event. Survivors found themselves in a liminal space, of betwixt and between involving 'what was' and 'what will be'. Seven threads were identified: Ordinary to extraordinary, Cardiac pain, Waking up in chaos, Resuscitation pain, Drawing on spirituality, Luck, and Surviving death.
   Discussion: The experiences of surviving a cardiac arrest influence follow-up care needed. Nurses and other clinicians need to have a holistic view of the survivor, as the experience of cardiac arrest is an extraordinary time in an individual's life, especially in the immediate period following the arrest.
   Conclusion: A cardiac arrest transforms the ordinary to the extraordinary. Surviving a cardiac arrest is confusing, and survivors have to adapt to a new reality resulting in a liminal transition that is complex. Existential questions about luck, spirituality and survival are intense. (C) 2020 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Early noncardiovascular organ failure and mortality in the cardiac intensive care unit
T2  - CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Noncardiac organ failure has been associated with worse outcomes among a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) population.
   Hypothesis: We hypothesized that early organ failure based on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score would be associated with mortality in CICU patients.
   Methods: Adult CICU patients from 2007 to 2015 were reviewed. Organ failure was defined as any SOFA organ subscore >= 3 on the first CICU day. Organ failure was evaluated as a predictor of hospital mortality and postdischarge survival after adjustment for illness severity and comorbidities.
   Results: We included 10 004 patients with a mean age of 67 +/- 15 years (37% female). Admission diagnoses included acute coronary syndrome in 43%, heart failure in 46%, cardiac arrest in 12%, and cardiogenic shock in 11%. Organ failure was present in 31%, including multiorgan failure in 12%. Hospital mortality was higher in patients with organ failure (22% vs 3%, adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5-3.7, P < .001). After adjustment, each failing organ system predicted twofold higher odds of hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-2.1, P < .001). Mortality risk was highest with cardiovascular, coagulation and liver failure. Among hospital survivors, organ failure was associated with higher adjusted postdischarge mortality risk (P < .001); multiorgan failure did not confer added long-term mortality risk.
   Conclusions: Early noncardiovascular organ failure, especially multiorgan failure, is associated with increased hospital mortality in CICU patients, and this risk continues after hospital discharge, emphasizing the need to promote early recognition of organ failure in CICU patients.

TI  - Frailty and Outcomes Following Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Perioperative Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - IMPORTANCE Frailty is associated with mortality following surgery and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for in-hospital cardiac arrest. Despite the growing focus on frailty as a basis for preoperative risk stratification and concern that CPR in patients with frailty may border on futility, the association between frailty and outcomes following perioperative CPR is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the association between frailty and outcomes following perioperative CPR.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study of patients used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, including more than 700 participating hospitals in the US, from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2020. Follow-up duration was 30 days. Patients 50 years or older undergoing noncardiac surgery who received CPR on postoperative day 0 were included; patients were excluded if data required to determine frailty, establish outcome, or perform multivariable analyses were missing. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2022, through January 30, 2023.
   EXPOSURES Frailty defined as Risk Analysis Index (RAI) of 40 or greater vs less than 40.
   OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day mortality and nonhome discharge.
   RESULTS Among the 3149 patients included in the analysis, the median age was 71 (IQR, 63-79) years, 1709 (55.9%) were men, and 2117 (69.2%) were White. Mean (SD) RAI was 37.73 (6.18), and 792 patients (25.9%) had an RAI of 40 or greater, of whom 534 (67.4%) died within 30 days of surgery. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for race, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, sepsis, and emergency surgery demonstrated a positive association between frailty and mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.11-1.65]; P =.003). Spline regression analysis demonstrated steadily increasing probability of mortality and nonhome discharge with increasing RAI above 37 and 36, respectively. Association between frailty and mortality following CPR varied by procedure urgency (AOR for nonemergent procedures, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.23-1.97]; AOR for emergent procedures, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.68-1.37]; P =.03 for interaction). An RAI of 40 or greater was associated with increased odds of nonhome discharge compared with an RAI of less than 40 (AOR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.31-2.62]; P <.001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study suggest that although roughly 1 in 3 patients with an RAI of 40 or greater survived at least 30 days following perioperative CPR, higher frailty burden was associated with increased mortality and greater risk of nonhome discharge among survivors. Identifying patients who are undergoing surgery and have frailtymay inform primary prevention strategies, guide shared decision-making regarding perioperative CPR, and promote goal-concordant surgical care.

TI  - Intra-Arrest Therapeutic Hypothermia and Neurologic Outcome in Patients Admitted after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Princess Trial
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Despite promising results, the role of intra-arrest hypothermia in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of trans-nasal evaporative cooling (TNEC) during resuscitation on neurological recovery in OHCA patients admitted alive to the hospital. Methods: A post hoc analysis of the PRINCESS trial, including only patients admitted alive to the hospital, either assigned to TNEC or standard of care during resuscitation. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome (FO) defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1-2 at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were overall survival at 90 days and CPC 1 at 90 days. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the initial cardiac rhythm. Results: A total of 149 patients in the TNEC and 142 in the control group were included. The number of patients with CPC 1-2 at 90 days was 56/149 (37.6%) in the intervention group and 45/142 (31.7%) in the control group (p = 0.29). Survival and CPC 1 at 90 days was observed in 60/149 patients (40.3%) vs. 52/142 (36.6%; p = 0.09) and 50/149 (33.6%) vs. 35/142 (24.6%; p = 0.11) in the two groups. In the subgroup of patients with an initial shockable rhythm, the number of patients with CPC 1 at 90 days was 45/83 (54.2%) in the intervention group and 27/78 (34.6%) in the control group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis of admitted OHCA patients, no statistically significant benefits of TNEC on neurological outcome at 90 days was found. In patients with initial shockable rhythm, TNEC was associated with increased full neurological recovery.

TI  - Public attitudes towards automated external defibrillators: results of a survey in the Australian general population
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundSwift defibrillation by lay responders using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) increases survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study evaluated newly designed yellow-red vs. commonly used green-white signage for AEDs and cabinets and assessed public attitudes to using AEDs during OHCA. MethodsNew yellow-red signage was designed to enable easy identification of AEDs and cabinets. A prospective, cross-sectional study of the Australian public was conducted using an electronic, anonymised questionnaire between November 2021 and June 2022. The validated net promoter score investigated public engagement with the signage. Likert scales and binary comparisons evaluated preference, comfort and likelihood of using AEDs for OHCA. ResultsThe yellow-red signage for AED and cabinet was preferred by 73.0% and 88%, respectively, over the green-white counterparts. Only 32% were uncomfortable with using AEDs, and only 19% indicated a low likelihood of using AEDs in OHCA. ConclusionThe majority of the Australian public surveyed preferred yellow-red over green-white signage for AED and cabinet and indicated comfort and likelihood of using AEDs in OHCA. Steps are necessary to standardise yellow-red signage of AED and cabinet and enable widespread availability of AEDs for public access defibrillation.

TI  - Shared decision making for infants born at the threshold of viability: a prognosis-based guideline
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Making prenatal decisions regarding resuscitation of extremely premature infants, based on gestational age alone is inadequate. We developed a prognosis-based guideline.
   STUDY DESIGN: We followed a five step approach and used the AGREE II framework: (1) systematic review and critical appraisal of published guidelines; (2) identification of key medical factors for decision making; (3) systematic reviews; (4) creation of a multi-disciplinary working group and (5) external consultation and appraisal.
   RESULT: No published guideline met high-quality appraisal criteria. Survival, neurodevelopmental disability, quality of life of child and parents, and maternal mortality and risk of long-term morbidity were identified as key for quality decision-making. Eighteen stakeholders (including parents) advocated for the incorporation of parents' values and preferences in the process.
   CONCLUSION: A novel framework, based on prognosis, was generated to guide when early intensive and palliative care may both be offered to expectant parents. Pre-implementation assessment is underway to identify barriers and facilitators to putting in practice.

TI  - Factors associated with pneumonia in post-cardiac arrest patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate risk factors associated with the development of pneumonia during the first 7 days of admission in survivors of cardiac arrest receiving therapeutic hypothermia.
   Methods: A total of 123 patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between January 2008 and December 2010 were enrolled. Study populations were categorized as "pneumonia present" [P (+)] and "pneumonia absent" [P (-)] contingent upon the development of pneumonia during the first 7 days of admission. Risk factors and outcomes related to development of pneumonia were determined.
   Results: Fifty-nine patients (48.0 %) developed pneumonia, and P (+) patients had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (22 vs 26); longer durations of central venous catheter (8.9 vs 5.1 days), nasogastric tube (11.1 vs 3.8 days), mechanical ventilation (MV) (9.3 vs 3.7 days), and intensive care unit stay (10.0 vs 5.0 days); and higher rates of nasogastric feeding (66.1% vs 35.9 %), tracheostomy (52.5% vs 17.2 %), and postanoxic seizure (62.7% vs 39.1 %). In multivariate analyses, the occurrence of postanoxic seizure (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-7.14; P = .04) and the length ofMV (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.52; P < .001) were independently associated with the development of pneumonia. The development of pneumonia had no significant association with survival (log-rank test, P = .15).
   Conclusion: Postanoxic seizure and prolonged duration ofMV are independently associatedwith development of pneumonia. It may be helpful that we give more attention to the development of pneumonia in patients with postanoxic seizure and provide prompt diagnosis and treatment of postanoxic seizure.

TI  - Levosimendan improves postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction after β-adrenergic blockade
T2  - JOURNAL OF LABORATORY AND CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - In earlier studies, we found that a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, facilitated cardiac resuscitation, reduced postresuscitation myocardial ectopy, and improved postresuscitation survival. However, the potential adverse effects and specifically the negative inotropic actions of propranolol prompted our further investigation of the potential value of a non-p-adrenergic inotropic drug, levosimendan, in conjunction with propranolol, for minimizing postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and untreated for 7 minutes in 15 domestic pigs, which were divided into propranolol, propranolol plus levosimendan, and control groups. Propranolol was administered as a bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg during cardiac arrest. Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 12 minutes of cardiac arrest including 5 minutes of precordial compression. Levosimendan was administered at 10 minutes after successful resuscitation in a dose of 20 mu g/kg and followed by infusion of 0.4 mu g/kg/min over the ensuing 220 minutes. Propranolol reduced energies or numbers of defibrillatory shocks and postresuscitation myocardial ectopy, and it improved postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. When levosimendan was added, postresuscitation myocardial contractile function was improved even more.

TI  - Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation: Where are we?
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - While remaining prominent in paramedic care and beneficial to some patients, out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation has not clearly improved survival or reduced morbidity from critical illness or injury when studied more broadly. Recent studies identify equivocal or unfavorable clinical effects, adverse events and errors, interaction with other important resuscitation interventions, and challenges in providing and maintaining procedural skill. We provide an overview of current data evaluating the overall effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of paramedic out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation. These studies highlight our limited understanding of out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation and the need for new strategies to improve airway support in the out-of-hospital setting.

TI  - Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome: Clinical characteristics, electrocardiographic parameters, and auxiliary testing
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome remains a clinical challenge because the event rate is low but the presenting symptom is often cardiac arrest (CA). We review the data on risk stratification. A history of CA or malignant syncope is a strong predictor of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), whereas the prognostic value of a history of familial sudden death and the presence of a SCN5A mutation are less well defined. On the electrocardiogram, the presence of spontaneous type I electrocardiogram increases the risk for VF in all studies, whereas the presence of fragmented QRS complexes and early repolarization correlates with increased risk in several studies. Signakaveraged techniques using late potentials and microscopic 1-wave alternans show some promising results in small studies that need to be confirmed. The value of electrophysiologic studies for predicting spontaneous VF remains controversial, and this includes programmed stimulation protocols that avoid a third extrastimuli or stimulation from the right ventricular outflow. Risk prediction is particularly challenging in children and women.

A1  - Therapeutic Hypothermia Pediat
TI  - Family Burden After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Children
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To describe family burden among caregivers of children who survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and who were at high risk for neurologic disability and examine relationships between family burden, child functioning, and other factors during the first year post arrest.
   Design: Secondary analysis of data from the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Out-of-Hospital trial.
   Setting: Thirty-six PICUs in the United States and Canada.
   Patients: Seventy-seven children recruited to the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Out-of-Hospital trial who had normal prearrest neurologic functioning and were alive 1 year post arrest.
   Interventions: Family burden was assessed using the Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire for children less than 5 years old and the Child Health Questionnaire for children 5 years old or older at baseline (reflecting prearrest status), 3 months, and 12 months post arrest. Child functioning was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II, the Pediatric Overall Performance Category, and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scales and caregiver perception of global functioning.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-six children (72.7%) were boys, 48 (62.3%) were whites, and 50 (64.9%) were less than 5 years old prior to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Family burden at baseline was not significantly different from reference values. Family burden was increased at 3 and 12 months post arrest compared with reference values (p < 0.001). Worse Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category, lower adaptive behavior, lower global functioning, and higher family burden all measured 3 months post arrest were associated with higher family burden 12 months post arrest (p < 0.05). Sociodemographics and prearrest child functioning were not associated with family burden 12 months post arrest.
   Conclusions: Families of children who survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and have high risk for neurologic disability often experience substantial burden during the first year post arrest. The extent of child dysfunction 3 months post arrest is associated with family burden at 12 months.

TI  - Aggravation of left ventricular remodeling by a novel specific endothelin ETA antagonist EMD94246 in rats with experimental myocardial infarction
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - An endothelin (ETA) antagonist reduced mortality and an ETA + ETB antagonist prevented left ventricular dilatation in rats with large myocardial infarction. This study tested the hypothesis that long-term blockade of the ETA receptor would have beneficial effects on left ventricular function and remodeling. Three hours after coronary artery ligation or sham operation in rats, EMD94246 (100 mg/kg/day, n = 62) or placebo (n = 62) was given by gavage. Eight weeks later, left ventricular hemodynamic measurements were performed and left ventricular volume determined with a double-lumen catheter after KCl-induced cardiac arrest. EMD94246 treatment had no effects on mortality or hemodynamic parameters. In rats with large infarcts, EMD94246 significantly increased left ventricular volume (2.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.1 ml/kg; p < 0.05). The nonpeptide ETA-selective antagonist EMD94246 promoted chronic left ventricular dilatation in rats with large myocardial infarction.

TI  - Ethical considerations behind the limitation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Hungary - the role of education and training
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Although the long term success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is still less than hoped for, its value cannot be questioned when carried out appropriately in selected cases. Resuscitation frequently brings only short-term success, and several patients suffer severe consequences also causing an economic, medical and ethical burden to society. The issue of limitation of resuscitation, including Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) and the termination of resuscitation has been surveyed in many European countries using a structured questionnaire. In Hungary no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. The goal of this investigation was to recognise the ethical factors limiting resuscitation in Hungary.
   Methods: We contacted 72 doctors personally during 2003, who were working actively at an intensive care unit (ICU) and asked them to answer a structured questionnaire in strict anonymity. We investigated the role of different ethical issues in beginning and suspending resuscitation efforts in conjunction with medical experience, sex, ideology, and education using a five point visual analogue scale. The answers given were categorised to autonomy, futility, obtainable quality of life, resource utilization, and to "another" category detailed later on. The questionnaire and the plan of this investigation was approved by the Semmelweis Medical University's Ethical Commitee (SE-TUKEB 109/2003).
   Results: The decision not to attempt resuscitation was mostly dictated by the opinion of the head of department and the doctor in charge of the patient (3.53 +/- 1.30), and after this the presumed obtainable quality of life (3.13 +/- 1.40), objective futility (3.11 +/- 0.94), and patient autonomy (2.02 +/- 1.63). The other objective (0.57 +/- 1.59), and subjective (1.04 +/- 1.21) factors, as well as resource utilization (0.29 +/- 0.66) played a less important role. The decision to terminate resuscitation efforts was mostly dictated by the objective futility criteria (3.39 +/- 0.88), obtainable quality of life (3.31 +/- 1.50), subjective futility (3.19 +/- 1.47), and autonomy (1.57 +/- 1.67) to a smaller extent. Among the doctors who participated in an appropriate-an internationally accredited (ERC/RC(UK)/AHA)-Advanced Life Support (ALS) training-the frequency of the appearance of the principle of modem bioethics-such as autonomy-was significantly higher and the same tendency could be observed in those who completed their studies at the medical university in the last 5 years.
   Conclusions: The results underline the original presumtion that the Hungarian resuscitation practice is at first influenced by professional (or "thought to be professional") standpoints. The quality of life, and patient autonomy plays an important role in the decision making about limitation of resuscitation efforts. Current CPR education emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations, and this could be observed clearly in the answers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - PROGNOSIS AND RISK STRATIFICATION AFTER MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
CP  - Satellite Symposium on Advancement in Diagnosis and Treatment of Arrhythmias - Where are we Heading, What is the Future, at XIIth World Congress of Cardiology/XVIth Congress of the European-Society-of-Cardiology
AB  - In order to assess prognosis after myocardial infarction, various methods have been used: estimation of ejection fraction, Holter monitoring, detection of ventricular late potentials using signal-averaging techniques, programmed ventricular stimulation of the heart to test the inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and parameters that assess heart rate variability.
   Left ventricular dysfunction is the major determinant for prognosis after myocardial infarction,but left ventricular end-systolic volume maya be better than overall ejection fraction. The presence of an 'arrhythmogenic substrate' may be detected by recording low-amplitude, fractionated activity or by artificially introducing premature ventricular extrasystoles using programmed ventricular stimulation.
   The signal-averaged ECG represents an independent tool for risk assessment. In some studies, signal-averaging and programmed ventricular stimulation proved to be more sensitive for the prediction of sustained ventricular tachycardia than for sudden death. The risk of an arrhythmic event in patients with an abnormal signal-averaged ECG or an abnormal result of programmed ventricular stimulation is increased,although the majority of these patients still do not experience a fatal or life-threatening arrhythmia. This high number of false-positive results limits the practical applicability of the signal-averaged ECG but also of other techniques such as long term ECG recording.
   Recent interest has focussed on heart rate variability,which is considered an index of sympatho-vagal interaction ater acute myocardial infarction. Patients with decreased heart rate variability have a poorer prognosis than those with normal parameters. Patency of the infarct-related artery is a major factor that governs the potentially beneficial effects of thrombolyic therapy. Many, but not all, studies have shown a reduced prevalence of late potentials after successfull thrombolysis or in the presence of an open infarct-related artery. Effective thrombolytic therapy may prevent the development of an abnormal electrophysiological milieu after myocardial infarction. Finally, neurological factors such as depression have been shown to be independent risk factors for mortality after acute myocardial infarction. The role of psycho-social factors and their mechanisms of action need further attention since they open the door for behavioural modification.
   In conclusion, there are several promising new techniques for identification of patients at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. These techniques seem to be superior to more conventional methods such as long-term ECG monitoring as well as exercise testing. Methods which determine the arrhythmogenic substrate might be combined with a parameter of left ventricular ejection fraction because of the paramount importance of left ventricular pump function. However, due to the large proportion of false-positive results obtained with any of these methods, it seems unlikely that they will clearly surpass the others and be sufficiently accurate for risk assessment in the individual patient.

TI  - Outcome after implantation of cardioverter defribrillator in patients with Brugada syndrome: A multicenter Israeli study (ISRABRU)
T2  - ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Many electrophysiologists recommend implantable cardioverter defibrillators for patients with Brugada syndrome who are cardiac arrest survivors or presumed at high risk of sudden death (patients with syncope or a familial history of sudden death or those with inducible ventricular fibrillation at electrophysiologic study).
   Objectives: To assess the efficacy and complications of ICD therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome.
   Methods: The indications, efficacy and complications of ICD therapy in all patients with Brugada syndrome who underwent ICD implantation in 12 Israeli centers between 1994 and 2007 were analyzed.
   Results: There were 59 patients (53 males, 89.8%) with a mean age of 44.1 years. At diagnosis 42 patients (71.2%) were symptomatic while 17 (28.8%) were asymptomatic. The indications for ICD implantation were: a history of cardiac arrest (n=11, 18.6%), syncope (n=31, 52.5%), inducible VF in asymptomatic patients (n=14, 23.7%), and a family history of sudden death (n=3, 0.5%). The overall inducibility rates of VF were 89.2% and 93.3% among the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively (P= NS). During a follow-up of 4-160 (45 +/- 35) months, all patients (except one who died from cancer) are alive. Five patients (8.4%), all with a history of cardiac arrest, had appropriate ICD discharge. Conversely, none of the patients without prior cardiac arrest had appropriate device therapy during a 39 +/- 30 month follow-up. Complications were encountered in 19 patients (32%). Inappropriate shocks occurred in 16 (27.1%) due to lead failure/dislodgment (n=5), T wave oversensing (n=2), device failure (n=1), sinus tachycardia (n=4), and supraventricular tachycardia (n=4). One patient suffered a pneumothorax and another a brachial plexus injury during the implant procedure. One patient suffered a late (2 months) perforation of the right ventricle by the implanted lead. Eleven patients (18.6%) required a reintervention either for infection (n=l) or lead problems (n=10). Eight patients (13.5%) required psychiatric assistance due to complications related to the ICD (mostly inappropriate shocks in 7 patients).
   Conclusions: In this Israeli population with Brugada syndrome treated with ICD, appropriate device therapy was limited to cardiac arrest survivors while none of the other patients including those with syncope and/or inducible VF suffered an arrhythmic event. The overall complication rate was high.

TI  - Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death: does it work in children?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of reviewOver half of young sudden cardiac arrest victims show no prior warning signs or symptoms and survival depends on secondary prevention, notably prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), for out-of-hospital arrests. There is increasing public interest in and uptake of public access defibrillation programs in communities and schools. Our purpose was to review recent data on sudden cardiac arrest in children and its outcome to identify ways to improve the current low survival rate of youth who experience sudden cardiac arrest.Recent findingsIncreases in bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Norway to 73% have occurred alongside increasing survival from sudden cardiac arrest from shockable rhythms to 52%. Studies in Denmark and the US show that survival of 69-74% is possible when a shockable rhythm is present and an automated external defibrillator is immediately applied. Up to 70-80% of US schools have automated external defibrillators, but not all have effective emergency action plans to maximize the impact of the presence of the AED.SummaryStudies suggest that education to increase bystander CPR and implementation of school AEDs and other public access defibrillation programs improve the survival of youth experiencing sudden cardiac arrest to 74% when optimal programs are in place. Methods to enhance such programs are presented. All involved with the health and education of youth are urged to implement best practices to protect youth and improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest.

TI  - Increase in regional cerebral saturation after elective electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation is only transient and without beneficial effects on neuropsychological functioning: cerebral saturation during electrical cardioversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
AB  - We aimed to confirm the positive association between a successful electrical cardioversion (ECV) and increase in SctO(2)and investigated whether this increase is persisting or not. Secondary, the influence of a successful ECV on the neuropsychological function and the association with SctO(2)was assessed as well. SctO(2)was measured continuously during elective ECV using near-infrared spectroscopy. Measurements started before induction of sedation and ended 15 min after awakening. A second measurement took place 4 to 6 weeks after ECV. To assess neuropsychological functioning, patients performed standardized neuropsychological tests before ECV and at follow-up and were compared to healthy volunteers as control group. SctO(2)was measured in 60 patients during elective ECV. ECV was successful in 50 AF patients, while in ten patients sinus rhythm was not obtained. SctO(2)increased immediately after successful ECV in 50 patients (1% (- 5 to 4); p = 0.031), but not after unsuccessful ECV in 10 patients (- 1% (- 5;3); p = 0.481). This SctO(2)change was positively correlated with the instant change in blood pressure (R-2 = 0.391; p = 0.004). At follow-up, SctO(2)values were no longer increased. Nevertheless, successful ECV improved the patient's quality of life but did not influence neuropsychological functioning at follow-up. A transient, instant SctO(2)increase was observed after successful ECV. This temporary increase in SctO(2)did not influence the neuropsychological functioning of the patients. Though, the quality of life of patients with a successful ECV improved.

TI  - Pulmonary complications associated with veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation: a comprehensive review
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a life-saving technology that provides transient respiratory and circulatory support for patients with profound cardiogenic shock or refractory cardiac arrest. Among its potential complications, VA-ECMO may adversely affect lung function through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction. This review presents the mechanisms of lung damage and dysfunction under VA-ECMO and discusses potential strategies to prevent and treat such alterations.

TI  - Prognostic Performance of Diffusion-Weighted MRI Combined with NSE in Comatose Cardiac Arrest Survivors Treated with Mild Hypothermia
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background MRI-based prognostication of comatose cardiac arrest survivors has shown promising results. However, the technique has not been validated in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia and it is unknown how it might add to NSE-based prognostication. We sought to evaluate the prognostic performance of regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with mild hypothermia and its added value to NSE-based prognostication.
   Methods An OHCA registry was analyzed to identify OHCA patients older than 15 who were treated with therapeutic hypothermia and underwent brain MRI between 2008 and 2011. Quantitative measurement of regional ADCs was performed by a radiologist blinded to the clinical outcome.
   Results Of the 43 eligible patients, 11 (18.6 %) achieved a good outcome (6-month CPC of 1 or 2). The regional ADC of the occipital cortex showed the highest discriminatory power with an area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.943 (95 % CI, 0.872-1.000) and predicted poor outcomes with a sensitivity of 90.6 % and a specificity of 100 %. The AUROC for NSE levels (48-h) was 0.911 (95 % CI, 0.801-1.000) which was significantly correlated with the regional ADC (Pearson's r = -0.674, p < .001). The ADC-based predictions identified an additional 5 (35.7 %) poor outcome patients out of 14 with 48-h NSE levels less than 78.9 ng/mL, which is the cutoff point suggested in a previous study. However, additional prognostic information was not provided when the 48-h NSE levels were > 78.9 ng/mL.
   Conclusions Regional ADC-based prognostication was accurate in OHCA patients who were treated with mild hypothermia. However, it only provided additional prognostic information when the 48-h NSE levels indicated a good prognosis (48-h NSE < 78.9 ng/mL).

TI  - Impact of Early Interventions by a Cardiac Rehabilitation Team on the Social Rehabilitation of Patients Resuscitated from Cardiogenic Out-of-hospital Cardiopulmonary Arrest
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective We examined the effects of intervention performed by a multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation (CR) team on the social rehabilitation of patients with cardiogenic out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (OHCA) in the acute phase.
   Methods This study included 122 patients who were resuscitated after cardiogenic OHCA during a 10-year period. They were divided into two groups: including a non-CR group of patients (n=58) who were admitted before the CR team started performing systematic intervention and a CR group (n=64) who were admitted after the intervention was initiated. The following items were examined for each group: treatment condition at onset, contents of treatment, primary disease, presence or absence of underlying disease, presence or absence of complications, general physical and neurological outcome, duration of hospital stay, and status of social rehabilitation.
   Results Although the number of patients with cardiogenic OHCA did not markedly change, the number of bystanders participating in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was significantly higher in the CR group versus the non-CR group (p<0.01). The effect of bystanders participating in CPR also significantly reduced the mortality outcome (p<0.05 versus the group without CPR), and patients in the CR group were more likely to achieve social rehabilitation (p<0.05 versus the group without CPR). Moreover, the number of patients who returned to society one year later was increased in the CR group versus the non-CR group (p<0.05). The incidence of respiratory complications was also significantly lower in the CR group versus the non-CR group (p<0.05).
   Conclusion Along with the usefulness of rapid pre-hospital aid, our results suggest that systemic intervention performed by the CR team administered while the patient was in the acute phase may have promoted social rehabilitation of patients resuscitated after cardiogenic OHCA.

TI  - Systematic review of percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock states
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest are common, lethal, debilitating and costly. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass is an innovative strategy for treating these disorders that consists of rapid initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal maintenance of circulation until restoration of an effective cardiac output. Multiple case reports suggest that percutaneous bypass is efficacious in patients with these disorders but these experiences have not been collated. Therefore, we have reviewed systematically the published experience with percutaneous bypass in patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
   Objectives: The objectives were to describe the proportion of patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest who achieved restoration of spontaneous circulation or survival to discharge with percutaneous bypass. A secondary objective was to describe adverse effects associated with percutaneous bypass, if feasible. Design: Articles were identified by using a comprehensive search of English-language MEDLINE from 1966 to September 2005.
   Patients: Individuals in cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Interventions: Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Analysis: Effects were summarized as inverse-variance weighted means, standard errors, median and interquartile range.
   Results: Included were 85 studies of 1494 patients with cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest or both. Studies were case reports, case-series or case-control studies of heterogeneous interventions in heterogeneous patients. The proportion of patients weaned was mean, 76.8 +/- 4.2%, and median, 66.0% (IQR 50%, 100%). The proportion of patients who survived to discharge was mean, 47.4 +/- 4.5%, and median 40.0% (IQR 20%, 75%). Fifty-two studies included 533 patients in cardiogenic shock. The proportion of patients who survived to discharge was mean, 51.6 +/- 6.5%, and median 38.5% (IQR 23.4%, 76.3%). Fifty-four studies included 675 patients in cardiac arrest. The proportion of patients who survived to discharge was mean, 44.9 +/- 6.7%, and median, 42.3% (IQR 15.4%, 75%). Five studies with 286 subjects had both patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
   Conclusions: Percutaneous bypass is an efficacious intervention in patients with cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. Adequately-powered experimental studies of current percutaneous bypass technologies are required to demonstrate whether it is safe, effective and cost-effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Prognosis and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the end of life
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases with age. As people are living longer, nephrologists are responsible for a progressively older cohort of patients with substantial comorbidities. Patients with CKD have a significant symptom burden and can benefit from intervention and symptom control from an early stage in the illness. It is also increasingly recognised that renal replacement therapy may not always offer an improvement in symptoms or a survival advantage to older patients with high levels of comorbidity. For these reasons, non-dialytic (conservative) management and end-of-life care is becoming part of routine nephrology practice. Such patients will also frequently be encountered in other specialities, requiring generalists to have some renal-specific skills and knowledge. Although there have been significant advances in this field in recent years, the optimum model of care and some of the care preferences of patients remain challenges that need to be addressed.

TI  - Research priorities for nursing and midwifery in Southern Ireland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW
AB  - Aim: To identify research priorities for nursing and midwifery in the Southern Health Board area in Ireland for the immediate and long term.
   Method: Ten focus groups were conducted over a 2-month period with 70 nurses and midwives working in clinical, managerial and educational roles participating. Based on focus group findings and a literature review a multi-item Likert type questionnaire was constructed and administered to 520 nurses and midwives (response rate 95% n = 494).
   Results: Research priorities were identified as: (1) impact of staff shortages on retention of RNs/RM's (80%); (2) quality of life of chronically ill patients (76%); (3) stress and bullying in the workplace (76%); (4) assessment and management of pain (75%); (5) skill mix and staff burnout (73%); (6) cardio-pulmonary resuscitation decision making (72%); (7) coordination of care between hospital and primary care settings (69%); (8) medication errors (67%); and (9) promoting healthy lifestyles (64%). Respondents also indicated that these priorities warranted immediate attention. Implications for practice include the need for: (1) emphasis on quality pain control; (2) recognition and exploration of the ethical issues relating to resuscitation; and (3) management of the context within which clinical care is given.

TI  - Effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on pulmonary arterial hypertension: A prospective, randomized study
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION
AB  - Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) on cardiopulmonary function, quality of life, depression, and hemodynamic parameters in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and to compare the efficacy of hospital- and home-based exercise programs.
   Patients and methods: Between December 2014 to May 2016, a total of 30 patients with PAH were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to either a hospital-based (n=15) or home-based exercise program (n=15). The hospital group was assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation (three days/week, 1 hour/week 50 to 70% maximal oxygen uptake [PvO(2)]) program for eight weeks. The home-based exercise group received home exercises alone. Before and after eight weeks of rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated for their functional status (PvO(2)), pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1), mL, forced vital capacity (FVC), mL and FEV1/FVC%, quality of life using Short Form-36 (SF-36), depression severity using Beck Depression Inventory, and hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure.
   Results: Of the patients, 12 completed the study in each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional status, quality of life, depression severity, and hemodynamic parameters after the rehabilitation compared baseline between the groups.
   Conclusion: Based on our study results, short-term CPR seems not to be beneficial in patients with PAH. We recommend long-term rehabilitation programs to achieve more benefits from aerobic exercise training in this patient population.

TI  - Automatic external defibrillator: Key link in the chain of survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
CP  - International Symposium on Tuning Cardiac Activation for a Better Pulse
AB  - Introduction: Sudden cardiac death is a major health problem. Worldwide success of resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is modest, with 5% to 10% survival to hospital discharge.
   Methods and Results: In the chain of survival, early defibrillation (goal <5 min after collapse) is a major determinant of successful outcome of resuscitation. This goal is rarely achieved, but the automatic external defibrillator (AED) is a promising tool for lay defibrillation. The AED is a safe and effective device with nearly 100% accurate detection of ventricular fibrillation and nearly 100% accurate detection of a nonshockable rhythm. A large uncontrolled experience suggests improved outcome in nontraditional responders such as police. Controlled studies of community application of the AED are under way.
   Conclusion: The AED is a promising tool in the fight against sudden cardiac death and should be studied and supported by all scientists involved, including electrophysiologists.

TI  - THE USE OF RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY IN PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The use of radiofrequency energy for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia in pediatric patients has gained widespread acceptance, especially for tachyarrhythmias associated with palpitations, dizziness, presyncope or syncope, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest. Ablation of the substrate supporting atrioventricular reentry, atrioventricular node reentry, and automatic atrial tachycardia yields a 90%-98% success rate with low incidence (<1%) of complications and adverse side-effects. Ablation of intra-atrial reentry, including atrial flutter and fibrillation, appears to be promising and would be a significant advance in the management of patients following extensive atrial surgery for congenital heart disease. Radiofrequency energy is also used to treat various forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. Finally, radiofrequency energy has been extended to control the ventricular rate associated with malignant atrial tachycardia by either modification or ablation of the atrioventricular node, and subsequent pacemaker implant. Long-term outcome of radiofrequency ablation is unknown, but the short-to-intermediate (1-5 yrs) outcome is excellent, with low recurrence rate of the tachycardia, no proarrhythmic effect, and excellent clinical state.

TI  - Prenatal consultation practices at the border of viability: A regional survey
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Objective. We undertook a survey of all practicing neonatologists in New England to determine their attitudes and practices regarding prenatal consultations for infants at the border of viability.
   Methods. A self-administered anonymous survey, mailed to every practicing neonatologist in the 6 Northeast states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, explored respondent attitudes and practices with respect to a hypothetical clinical scenario of a prenatal consultation for an infant at the border of viability.
   Results. Our final sample included 149 surveys from 175 eligible neonatologists, giving a response rate of 85%. Seventy-seven percent of respondents indicated that they thought neonatologists and parents should make the decision jointly to withhold resuscitation. Only 40% indicated that the decision actually is made by both parties. A majority of neonatologists (58%) saw their primary role during the prenatal consultation as providing factual information to the parents. Far fewer (27%) thought that their main role was to assist the parents in weighing the risks and benefits of various management options. A majority of respondents indicated that parental understanding of the mother's current medical situation (96%), desired parental role (77%), and parental prior experience with premature or handicapped children (64%) were frequently or always discussed. However, far fewer respondents reported frequently or always asking about parental interpretations of a "good quality of life" (42%), parental prior experiences with death or dying (30%), and parental religious or spiritual beliefs (25%). Short-term outcomes and complications such as the need for surfactant/respiratory distress syndrome (89%) and the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (81%) were discussed more extensively than long-term outcomes such as motor delays or cerebral palsy (68%), cognitive delays or learning disabilities (63%), and chronic lung disease (61%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed 2 characteristics that were significant predictors of shared decision-making for the final decision regarding resuscitation in the delivery room for extremely premature infants, prenatal consultations is to help parents weigh the risks and benefits of each resuscitation option ( odds ratio: 4.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.6-10.9) and having > 10 years of clinical experience (odds ratio: 3.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-8.8).
   Conclusions. Overall, our results showed that neonatologists are quite consistent in discussing clinical issues but quite varied in discussing social and ethical issues. If neonatologists are to perform complete prenatal consultations for infants at the border of viability as described by the latest American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, then they will be expected to address quality-of-life values more robustly, to explain long-term outcomes, and to incorporate parental preferences during their conversations. Potential barriers to shared decision-making have yet to be outlined.

TI  - Artificial intelligence versus human expertise: ECG-based detection of occlusive myocardial infarction after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background/aim: Accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation after cardiac arrest is essential for identifying occlusive myocardial infarction (OMI), but post-resuscitation artifacts make this challenging. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising support, its diagnostic performance in this critical setting remains uncertain. Methods: This single-centre study included 97 adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA). Post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) ECG were evaluated by four methods: human experts (HE), a validated deep neural network [Queen of Hearts (QoH)], and two large language model (LLM)-based AI Chatbots (AI-CB)-ChatGPT and EKG Analyst. Primary outcome was AUROC for presence and probability of OMI and acute coronary occlusion (ACO), determined by coronary angiography. Results: For ACO (TIMI 0), QoH yielded highest AUROC (0.846 [0.752-0.939]), followed by HE (0.735 [0.622-0.848]). Both AI-CB resulted in lowest AUROC (ChatGPT: 0.456 [0.319-0.592]; EKG Analyst: 0.474 [0.346-0.603]). For OMI (TIMI 0-2 or TIMI 3 + peak-troponin), QoH again achieved highest AUROC (0.745 [0.647-0.843]), followed by HE (0.635 [0.515-0.755]), AI-CB were lowest again (ChatGPT: 0.495 [0.376-0.614]; EKG Analyst: 0.626 [0.508-0.743]). Threshold-dependent performance metrics revealed high sensitivity (ACO: 100 %; OMI: 98.36 %) for both AI-CB, at the cost of minimal specificity. QoH and HE showed more even distributions of sensitivity/specificity. Conclusion: QoH, despite operating without awareness of the CA-setting and thus likely at a relative disadvantage, and HE showed robust diagnostic accuracy. Due to undifferentiated overdiagnosis, general LLMs remain unsuitable for ECG interpretation. Domain-specific tools like QoH may offer complementary value.

TI  - Factors associated with poor survival in women experiencing cardiac arrest in a rural setting
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine whether gender differences exist in the characteristics and outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur-ring in a rural setting.
   BACKGROUND In urban settings, women have a lower incidence of OHCA than men but otherwise a comparable survival for ventricular fibrillation (VF) OHCA. Whether OHCA gender differences exist in rural settings is not clear.
   METHODS The study consisted of a prospective collection and analysis of nontraumatic, adult OHCA prompting a 911 call in six rural Indiana counties.
   RESULTS Over an average period of 2.2 years, 138 women and 250 men experienced OHCA (annual incidence rate: 56.4 per 100,000 men and 29.3 per 100,000 women). Women were older, less likely to experience OHCA in a public setting, more likely to be in an extended care facility, and less likely to have a witnessed arrest than were men. Women were less likely to present with an initial rhythm of VF than men (33.3% vs 53.6%, P < 001). Women in VF had a longer time interval from 911 call to first shock compared with men. Women had poorer survival to hospital discharge for all OHCA (2.2% vs 7.2%, P =.04) and VF OHCA (2.2% vs 13.4%, P =.05) compared with men. After age adjustment, female gender remained associated with a poorer OHCA survival outcome. With adjustment for all significant arrest characteristics, female gender was no longer associated with survival.
   CONCLUSIONS In a rural population, women suffering OHCA have a dismal survival rate likely because Of Multiple unfavorable arrest characteristics.

TI  - Drones delivering automated external defibrillators for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A scoping review
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a critical health concern, where prompt access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs) significantly improves survival. This scoping review broadly investigates the feasibility and impact of dronedelivered AEDs for OHCA response. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception to August 6, 2024, with eligibility broadly including empirical data. The charting process involved iterative data extraction for thematic analysis. Results: We identified 306 titles and, after duplicate removal, title/abstract screening, and full text review, included 39 studies. These were divided into three categories: 1) Real-world observational studies (n = 3), 2) Test flights/simulation studies and qualitative analyses (n = 15), and 3) Computer/prediction models (n = 21). Real-world studies demonstrated the feasibility of drone AED delivery, with a time advantage of 01:52 - 03:14 min over ambulances observed in 64-67 % of cases. Test flight/simulation and qualitative studies consistently reported feasibility and positive bystander experiences. Computer/prediction models exhibited considerable heterogeneity, yet all indicated significant time savings for AED delivery compared to traditional EMS methods. Moreover, seven studies estimated improved survival rates, with five assessing cost-effectiveness and favouring drone systems. Regional factors such as EMS response times, volunteer responder programmes, terrain, weather, and budget constraints influenced the system's effectiveness. Conclusion: Across all categories, studies confirmed the feasibility of drone-delivered AED systems, with significant potential for reducing time to AED arrival compared to EMS arrival. Prediction models suggested enhanced survival alongside costeffectiveness. Further research, including more extensive real-world studies and regulatory advancements, is imperative to integrate drones effectively into OHCA response systems.

TI  - Goals of Care Conversations in Long-Term Care during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Goals of care discussions typically focus on decision maker preference and underemphasize prognosis and outcomes related to frailty, resulting in poorly informed decisions. Our objective was to determine whether navigated care planning with nursing home residents or their decision makers changed care plans during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MED-LTC virtual consultation service, led by internal medicine specialists, conducted care planning conversations that balanced information-giving/physician guidance with resident autonomy. Consultation included (1) the assessment of co-morbidities, frailty, health trajectory, and capacity; (2) in-depth discussion with decision makers about health status and expected outcomes; and (3) co-development of a care plan. Non-parametric tests and logistic regression determined the significance and factors associated with a change in care plan. Sixty-three residents received virtual consultations to review care goals. Consultation resulted in less aggressive care decisions for 52 residents (83%), while 10 (16%) remained the same. One resident escalated their care plan after a mistaken diagnosis of dementia was corrected. Pre-consultation, 50 residents would have accepted intubation compared to 9 post-consultation. The de-escalation of care plans was associated with dementia, COVID-19 positive status, and advanced frailty. We conclude that during the COVID-19 pandemic, a specialist-led consultation service for frail nursing home residents significantly influenced decisions towards less aggressive care.

TI  - Excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrests due to ambient temperatures in South Korea from 2008 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a notable public health issue with negative outcomes, such as high mortality and aftereffects. Additionally, the adverse effects of extreme temperatures on health have become more important under climate change; however, few studies have investigated the relationship between temperature and OHCA. In this study, we examined the association between temperature and OHCA and its underlying risk factors. We conducted a two-stage time-series analysis using a Poisson regression model with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) and meta-analysis, based on a nationwide dataset from South Korea (2008-2018). We found that 17.4% of excess OHCA was attributed to cold, while 0.9% was attributed to heat. Based on central estimates, excess OHCA attributed to cold were more prominent in the population with hypertension comorbidity (31.0%) than the populations with diabetes (24.3%) and heart disease (17.4%). Excess OHCA attributed to heat were larger in the populations with diabetes (2.7%) and heart disease comorbidity (2.7%) than the population with hypertension (1.2%) based on central estimates. Furthermore, the time-varying excess OHCA attributed to cold have decreased over time, and although those of heat did not show a certain pattern during the study period, there was a weak increasing tendency since 2011. In conclusion, we found that OHCAs were associated with temperature, and cold temperatures showed a greater impact than that of hot temperatures. The effects of cold and hot temperatures on OHCA were more evident in the populations with hypertension, diabetes, and heart diseases, compared to the general population. In addition, the impacts of heat on OHCA increased in recent years, while those of cold temperatures decreased. Our results provide scientific evidence for policymakers to mitigate the OHCA burden attributed to temperature.

TI  - Evaluating the potential impact of an emergency department extracorporeal resuscitation (ECPR) program: a health records review
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in refractory cardiac arrest (ECPR) is an emerging resuscitative therapy that has shown promising results for selected patients who may not otherwise survive. We sought to identify the characteristics of cardiac arrest patients presenting to our institution to begin assessing the feasibility of an ECPR program. Methods This retrospective health records review included patients aged 18-75 years old presenting to our academic teaching hospital campuses with refractory nontraumatic out-of-hospital or in-emergency department (ED) cardiac arrest over a 2-year period. Based on a scoping review of the literature, both "liberal" and "restrictive" ECPR criteria were defined and applied to our cohort. Results A total of 179 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 years, and patients were predominantly male (72.6%). The initial rhythm was ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in 49.2%. The majority of arrests were witnessed (69.3%), with immediate bystander CPR performed on 53.1% and an additional 12% receiving CPR within 10 minutes of collapse. Median prehospital time was 40 minutes (interquartile range, 31-53.3). Two-thirds of patients (65.9%) were identified as having a reversible cause of arrest and favorable premorbid status was identified in nearly three quarters (74.3%). Our two sets of ECPR inclusion criteria revealed that 33 and 5 patients (liberal and restrictive criteria, respectively), would have been candidates for ECPR. Conclusion At our institution, we estimate between 6% and 40% of ED refractory cardiac arrest patients would be candidates for ECPR. These findings suggest that the implementation of an ECPR program should be explored.

TI  - Headache, cardiac arrest, and intracranial hemorrhage
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEADACHE AND PAIN
AB  - Headache is one of the most common manifestations of non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, which is an uncommon, but not rare, cause of cardiac arrest in adults. History of a sudden headache preceding collapse may be a helpful clue to estimate the cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Medical records of witnessed OHCA patients were reviewed to identify those who complained of a sudden headache preceding collapse, and the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage among them as well as their clinical characteristics was investigated retrospectively. During the 12-month period, 124 patients who sustained a witnessed OHCA were treated. Among them, 74 (60%) collapsed without any pain complaint, and only 6 (5%) complained of a sudden headache preceding collapse. All of the six patients were resuscitated: four had a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), while the other two had a massive cerebellar hemorrhage. By contrast, 39 of the 74 patients who collapsed without any pain were resuscitated. Among them, another six patients were found to harbor an SAH. Thus, a total of 12 among the 124 witnessed OHCA (10%) sustained a fatal intracranial hemorrhage. While OHCA patients who collapse complaining of a sudden headache are uncommonly seen in the emergency room, they have a high likelihood of harboring a severe intracranial hemorrhage. It should also be reminded that approximately half of patients whose cardiac arrest is due to an intracranial hemorrhage may collapse without complaining of a headache. The prognosis of those with cerebral origin of OHCA is invariably poor, although they may relatively easily be resuscitated temporarily. Focus needs to be directed to avoid sudden death from a potentially treatable cerebral lesion, and public education to promote the awareness for the symptoms of potentially lethal hemorrhagic stroke is warranted.

TI  - Differences in Basic Life Support Knowledge Between Junior Medical Students and Lay People: Web-Based Questionnaire Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation markedly increase the survival rate in the event of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). As future health care professionals, medical students should be trained to efficiently manage an unexpectedly encountered OHCA.
   Objective: Our aim was to assess basic life support (BLS) knowledge in junior medical students at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine (UGFM) and to compare it with that of the general population.
   Methods: Junior UGFM students and lay people who had registered for BLS classes given by a Red Cross-affiliated center were sent invitation links to complete a web-based questionnaire The primary outcome was the between-group difference in a 10-question score regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge. Secondary outcomes were the differences in the rate of correct answers for each individual question, the level of self-assessed confidence in the ability to perform resuscitation, and a 6-question score, "essential BLS knowledge," which only contains key elements of the chain of survival. Continuous variables were first analyzed using the Student t test, then by multivariable linear regression. Fisher exact test was used for between-groups comparison of binary variables.
   Results: The mean score was higher in medical students than in lay people for both the 10-question score (mean 5.8, SD 1.7 vs mean 4.2, SD 1.7; P<.001) and 6-question score (mean 3.0, SD 1.1 vs mean 2.0, SD 1.0; P<.001). Participants who were younger or already trained scored consistently better. Although the phone number of the emergency medical dispatch center was well known in both groups (medical students, 75/80, 94% vs lay people, 51/62, 82%; P=.06), most participants were unable to identify the criteria used to recognize OHCA, and almost none were able to correctly reorganize the BLS sequence. Medical students felt more confident than lay people in their ability to perform resuscitation (mean 4.7, SD 2.2 vs mean 3.1, SD 2.1; P<.001). Female gender and older age were associated with lower confidence, while participants who had already attended a BLS course prior to taking the questionnaire felt more confident.
   Conclusions: Although junior medical students were more knowledgeable than lay people regarding BLS procedures, the proportion of correct answers was low in both groups, and changes in BLS education policy should be considered.

TI  - IL-2/IL-2Ab complexes expand regulatory T cells in vivo and provide neuroprotection after cardiac arrest
T2  - IMMUNOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) results in global ischemia/reperfusion injury and severe neurological dysfunction, for which effective therapeutic interventions remain limited. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in modulating post-ischemic inflammation and promoting neuroprotection. In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo expansion of Tregs using the interleukin-2/interleukin-2 antibody (IL-2/IL-2Ab) complex significantly increased Treg numbers in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. Mice pretreated with the IL-2/IL-2Ab complex before cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) exhibited improved neurological recovery, reduced ischemic brain injury, and enhanced survival rates. These findings highlight a potential immunomodulatory strategy for improving outcomes after cardiac arrest. The IL-2/IL-2Ab complex may represent a promising adjunctive therapy to attenuate post-resuscitation brain injury through the selective expansion of protective Tregs.

TI  - Lessons Learnt from Case Series of Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest and Unexpected Death after COVID-19 Vaccination
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Vaccination against COVID-19 has raised concerns about myocarditis in young men, as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) or sudden death after vaccination has been reported sporadically. Common features of these cases are occurrence in young men, within a few weeks after vaccination, in patients with no structural heart diseases. Cases of unexplained nocturnal death showed fibrotic or hypertrophied myocardium, and one case of OHCA presented ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by a prominent J wave on an automated external defibrillator and histopathologic findings compatible with myocarditis. Both myocarditis and J waves are prevalent in young men, and these cases imply that myocarditis augments J waves, which trigger VFs, and primary electrical disorders are a leading cause of death. To prevent such issues, artificial intelligence (AI) -assisted interpretation of historical electrocardiogram findings may help predict future J wave formation lead-ing to VF, as digital electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are well suited for AI interpretation.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a single centre's experience
T2  - ESC HEART FAILURE
AB  - Aims The aims of this study were to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQL) among patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in northern Norway over a period of 27 years (1988-2015) and to identify variables related to HRQL. Methods and results A retrospective inquiry of the ECMO registry at the University Hospital of North Norway identified 74 ECMO-treated patients (mean age 49 years, 65% males). Acute cardiac failure was the dominant indication (58%), and venoarterial ECMO was the dominant mode of treatment (87%). Mortality for discharged patients was recorded on 20 September 2016. Thirty (41%) survivors were identified. Twenty-three survivors were eligible for the survey and received a set of questionnaires at home. The main outcome measure was HRQL as measured with the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36) (RAND Short Form-36 v1.2). Other questionnaires covered demographic information, problems with functioning in usual daily activities (such as hobbies, household chores, family, or work), employment status, and psychological distress. The survey was completed by 20 (87%) survivors (mean age = 49 years, 12 men). Indications for ECMO treatment (VA = 90%) had been respiratory failure (25%), cardiac failure (60%), and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (15%). The average time since ECMO treatment was 6.5 years. Seventy-five percent reported mental HRQL (SF-36 Mental Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 5) or physical HRQL (SF-36 Physical Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 4.5) within the normal range (T = 50 +/- 10) in comparison with age-matched population data from national norms. Half of the responders reported problems on the SF-36 subscales general health and role physical. Seventy percent reported problems on the SF-36 subscale role emotional. All but one responder lived independently without any organized care, and 90% reported no problems related to basic self-care. Half of those in working age had returned to work after ECMO treatment. Forty percent of the responders reported some degree of restrictions in usual daily activities, problems with mobility (35%), anxiety/depression (35%), or pain/discomfort (55%). Significant univariate associations were observed for poorer HRQL and higher reports of psychological distress, pain, and experiencing restrictions in usual everyday activities. Improved HRQL was significantly related to an extended time since ECMO treatment. Conclusions Our survey indicates an overall positive long-term HRQL outcome for our ECMO survivors. A subset reported problems with functioning and HRQL. Future research should focus on identification of the survivors at risk for poor recovery who may benefit from rehabilitation interventions.

TI  - P-COSCA (Pediatric Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Children An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Studies of pediatric cardiac arrest use inconsistent outcomes, including return of spontaneous circulation and short-term survival, and basic assessments of functional and neurological status. In 2018, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation sponsored the COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set After Cardiac Arrest) to improve consistency in reported outcomes of clinical trials of adult cardiac arrest survivors and supported this PCOSCA initiative (Pediatric COSCA). The P-COSCA Steering Committee generated a list of potential survival, life impact, and economic impact outcomes and assessment time points that were prioritized by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare providers, researchers, and parents/caregivers of children who survived cardiac arrest. Then expert panel discussions achieved consensus on the core outcomes, the methods to measure those core outcomes, and the timing of the measurements. The P-COSCA includes assessment of survival, brain function, cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills. Survival and brain function are assessed at discharge or 30 days (or both if possible) and between 6 and 12 months after arrest. Cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills are assessed between 6 and 12 months after cardiac arrest. Because many children have prearrest comorbidities, the P-COSCA also includes documentation of baseline (ie, prearrest) brain function and calculation of changes after cardiac arrest. Supplementary outcomes of survival, brain function, cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills are assessed at 3 months and beyond 1 year after cardiac arrest if resources are available.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation by law enforcement agents in Spain: lessons from a mixed methods case study
T2  - EMERGENCY CARE JOURNAL
AB  - Much of the law enforcement work takes place close to the pub-lic, often arriving at the scene before medical services in the case of victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. If properly trained, these early care procedures can be powerful mechanisms to improve sur-vival. This paper describes a case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest assisted by law enforcement officers on the public highway in Asturias-Spain. In addition, a qualitative study was carried out to learn about the experience of the officers during the intervention, their willingness to act in similar emergencies, as well as to gather information about their training and knowledge of basic life sup-port. The case was successfully resolved; however, some errors in the spontaneous execution of the chain of survival and the officers' statements prompted some recommendations for the mobilization, training and staffing of law enforcement agencies in Spain.

TI  - Low apparent diffusion coefficient cluster-based analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI for prognostication of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: Recent studies suggested quantitative analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging as a promising tool for early prognostication of cardiac arrest patients. However, most of their methods involve significant manual image handling often subjective and difficult to reproduce. Therefore developing a computerized analysis method using easy-to-define characteristics would be useful.
   Methods: Comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients who underwent brain MRI between January 2008 and July 2012 were identified from an OHCA registry. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) axial images were analyzed using a program to detect and characterize clusters of low ADC pixels from six brain regions including frontal, occipital, parietal, rolandic and temporal and basal ganglia region. Identified clusters were ranked according to size, mean ADC and minimum ADC to assess the regional maximum cluster size (MCS), lowest mean ADC (LMEAN) and lowest minimum ADC (LMIN). Their power to predict poor outcome, defined as 6-month CPC 3 or higher, was assessed by contingency table analyses.
   Results: 51 OHCA patients were eligible during the study period. The sensitivities of MCS, LMEAN and LMIN to detect poor outcome varied according to brain region from 62.5 to 90.0%, 50.0 to 72.5% and 42.5 to 82.5% with their specificities set to 100%, respectively. The MCS of occipital region showed most favorable test profile (sensitivity 90%, specificity 100%; AUROC 0.940, 95% confidence interval 0.874-1.000).
   Conclusion: The cluster-based computerized image analysis might be a simple but useful method for prediction of poor neurologic outcome. Future studies validating its prognostic performance are required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Valproic Acid and Neural Apoptosis, Inflammation, and Degeneration 30 Days after Traumatic Brain Injury, Hemorrhagic Shock, and Polytrauma in a Swine Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single-dose (150 mg/kg) of valproic acid (VPA) has been shown to decrease brain lesion size and improve neurologic recovery in preclinical models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the longer-term (30 days) impact of single-dose VPA treatment after TBI has not been well evaluated.
   STUDY DESIGN: Yorkshire swine were subjected to TBI (cortical impact), hemorrhagic shock, and polytrauma. Animals remained in hypovolemic shock for 2 hours before resuscitation with normal saline (NS; volume = 3 x hemorrhaged volume) or NS thorn VPA (150 mg/kg) (n = 5/cohort). Brain samples were harvested 30 days after injuries. The cerebral cortex adjacent to the site of cortical impact was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. Neural apoptosis, inflammation, degeneration, plasticity, and signaling pathways were evaluated.
   RESULTS: For apoptosis, VPA treatment significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the number of TUNEL (thorn) cells and expression of cleaved-caspase 3. For inflammation and degeneration, expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1, glial fibrillary acid protein, amyloid-beta, and phosphorylated-Tau protein were significantly attenuated (p < 0.05) in the VPA-treated animals compared with the NS group. For, plasticity, VPA treatment also increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor significantly (p < 0.05) compared with the NS group. For signaling pathways, nuclear factor-kappa B was decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and cytosolic I kappa B alpha expression was increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the VPA-treated animals compared with the NS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a single dose of VPA (150 mg/kg) can decrease neural apoptosis, inflammation, and degenerative changes, and promote neural plasticity at 30 days after TBI. In addition, VPA acts, in part, via regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B and I kappa B alpha pathways. (C) 2019 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Total liquid ventilation in a porcine model of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome using a new generation of liquid ventilator
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE EXPERIMENTAL
AB  - Background Total liquid ventilation (TLV) has been experimentally proposed as an alternative treatment for the management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Recent technological advances have led to the evaluation of a TLV prototype in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest. Here, our goal was to determine whether a derived version of this prototype, so-called LV4B (liquid ventilation for breathing), could be used for normothermic TLV in a swine model of severe ARDS. Methods Swine were anesthetized and instrumented for respiratory and hemodynamic evaluation. ARDS was induced by one or two administrations of oleic acid (0.1 mg/kg), until reaching a PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100 mmHg. After ARDS induction, animals were allocated to undergo 60 min of either gas ventilation continuation (Control group) or TLV using a prototype that continuously controls respiratory rate (RR), liquid tidal volume (LqVt) and end-expiratory liquid volume (EELqV, respectively). Perfluorooctyl bromide was used as breathable liquid. Results After ARDS induction and group allocation, 2/5 animals (40%) survived in the Control groups versus 5/5 in the TLV group (100%). In the Control group, premature deaths were related to sustained hypoxemia (PaO2 < 50 mmHg) with hemodynamic failure. Surviving animals presented a trend toward better oxygenation in TLV versus Control, without achieving statistical significance due to the low number of survivors in the Control group. PaCO2, blood pH, lactate levels, or pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics were not different between groups in survivors. In the TLV group, the average LqVt, EELqV, and respiratory rate (RR) were 12.6 +/- 0.4 mL/kg, 22.9 +/- 2.9 mL/kg, and 5.3 +/- 0.5 breath/min (mean +/- SEM) at the end of the procedure, respectively. In all animals, pulmonary debris were washed out from the lung and collected by the TLV device throughout the procedure. After necropsy, histopathological examination demonstrated a significantly lower extent of inflammatory and congestion lesions in TLV versus Control. Conclusions TLV with a liquid ventilator controlling EELqV, RR and LqVt is feasible and safe in large animals in a severe model of ARDS. This opens promising perspectives and warrants further investigation, including prolonged treatment durations and long-term follow-up.

TI  - Development of an intervention to facilitate dissemination of community-based training to respond to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: FirstCPR
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background and aimOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue with low survival rates. Prompt bystander action can more than double survival odds. OHCA response training is primarily pursued due to work-related mandates, with few programs targeting communities with lower training levels. The aim of this research was to describe the development process of a targeted multicomponent intervention package designed to enhance confidence and training among laypeople in responding to an OHCA. MethodsAn iterative, three-phase program development process was employed using a mixed methods approach. The initial phase involved establishment of a multidisciplinary panel that informed decisions on key messages, program content, format, and delivery modes. These decisions were based on scientific evidence and guided by behavioural theories. The second phase comprised the development of the intervention package, identifying existing information and developing new material to fill identified gaps. The third phase involved refining and finalising the material via feedback from panel members, stakeholders, and community members. ResultsThrough this approach, we collaboratively developed a comprehensive evidence-based education and training package consisting of a digital intervention supplemented with free access to in-person education and training. The package was designed to teach community members the specific steps in recognising and responding to a cardiac arrest, while addressing commonly known barriers and fears related to bystander response. The tailored program and delivery format addressed the needs of individuals of diverse ages, cultural backgrounds, and varied training needs and preferences. ConclusionThe study highlights the importance of community engagement in intervention development and demonstrates the need of evidence-based and collaborative approaches in creating a comprehensive, localised, relatively low-cost intervention package to improve bystander response to OHCA.

TI  - Pancreas-kidney transplantation in Japan: Impact of cyclosporine on the development of immunosuppressive therapy
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
AB  - The number of pancreas transplants reached 16,043 worldwide in October 2001, with 1800 performed in 2000. Since the introduction of cyclosporine (CyA) in 1979, a regimen consisting of CyA, azathioprine, and steroids has been shown to improve long-term survival of clinical transplants. In Japan, the first simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation was performed, in 1984, using organs from a brain-dead donor. This procedure was followed by 14 pancreas transplantations from cardiac arrest donors. All cases utilized a CyA-based regimen with antilymphocyte globulin or OKT3 induction. Six of the 15 recipients required less insulin postoperatively. Under a new transplant law enforced in 1997, 10 pancreas/pancreas- kidney transplantations were performed in patients diagnosed with end-stage renal failure due to diabetes mellitus type 1. In 1 patient, the graft failed due to venous thrombosis, but the other 9 recipients achieved an increased quality of life without the need for insulin or for dialysis. Pancreas transplantation represents an effective treatment worldwide and in Japan, due to the availability of CyA or tacrolimus in combination with other agents such as antilymphocyte globulin, OKT3, or mycophenolate mofetil. This investigation presents the results of pancreas-kidney transplantation in Japan, in comparison with those worldwide, and describes a recent case in Japan.

TI  - Trends and Outcomes in Cardiac Arrest Among Heart Failure Admissions
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - There is limited large, national data investigating the prevalence, characteristics, and out-comes of cardiac arrest (CA) in patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF). The goal of this study was to examine the characteristics, trends, and outcomes of HF hospitalizations complicated by in-hospital CA. We used the National Inpatient Sample to identify all pri-mary HF admissions from 2016 to 2019. Cohorts were built based on the presence of a codiagnosis of CA. Diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Associations with CA were then analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. We identified a total of 4,905,564 HF admissions, 56,170 (1.1%) of which had CA. Hospitalizations complicated by CA were significantly more likely to be male, to have coronary artery disease, renal disease, and less likely to be White (p <0.001, all). Age <65 (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, p <0.001), renal disease (OR 2.41, p <0.001), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.26, p <0.001) had higher odds of CA while female gender (OR 0.84, confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 0.86, p <0.001) or HFpEF (OR 0.49, CI 0.48 to 0.50, p <0.001) had lower odds of CA. Patients with CA had higher inpatient mortality (CA 54.2% vs no CA 2.1%, p <0.001), which persisted after multivari-ate adjustment (OR 64.8, CI 63.5 to 66.0, p <0.001). CA occurs in >1 in 1,000 HF hospital-izations and remains a prominent and serious event associated with a high mortality. Further research is needed to examine long-term outcomes and mechanical circulatory support utilization with more granularity in HF patients with in-hospital CA.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Associations between initial heart rhythm and self-reported health among cardiac arrest survivors- A nationwide registry study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background : Non -shockable initial rhythm is a known risk factor for high mortality at cardiac arrest (CA). However, knowledge on its association with self -reported health in CA survivors is still incomplete. Aim : To examine the associations between initial rhythm and self -reported health in CA survivors. Methods : This nationwide study used data from the Swedish Register for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 3-6 months post CA. Health status was measured using EQ-5D-5L and psychological distress by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences in self -reported health between groups of different initial rhythms. To control for potential confounders, age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, witnessed status, time to CPR, time to defibrillation, and neurological function were included as covariates in multiple regression analyses for continuous and categorical outcomes. Results : The study included 1783 adult CA survivors. Overall, the CA survivors reported good health status and symptoms of anxiety or depression were uncommon (13.7% and 13.9% respectively). Survivors with PEA and asystole reported significantly more problems in all dimensions of health status ( p = 0.037 to p < 0.001), anxiety ( p = 0.034), and depression ( p = 0.017) compared to VT/VF. Overall, these differences did not remain in the adjusted regression analyses. Conclusions : Initial rhythm is not associated with self -reported health when potential confounders are controlled. Initial rhythm seems to be an indicator of unfavourable factors causing the arrest, or factors related to characteristics and treatment. Therefore, initial rhythm may be used as a proxy for identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes such as worse health status and psychological distress.

TI  - Surgical pulmonary embolectomy: mid-term outcomes
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Background Despite the widespread use of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized patients, pulmonary embolism continues to occur. Massive pulmonary embolism is associated with a high mortality. Surgical embolectomy has traditionally been reserved for cases with haemodynamic collapse or where thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed.
   Methods Data on 10 patients who underwent surgical embolectomy (40% male, mean age 49 years (range 2572)) from January 2003 to February 2010 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed.
   Results Diagnosis was made using computed tomography pulmonary angiography in eight patients and echocardiography in two. Syncope was the most common presenting symptom (7 out of 10, 70%) and relative immobilization was the most common risk factor (7 out of 10, 70%). Four patients (40%) suffered preoperative cardiac arrest, with a further two on induction of anaesthesia. Thirty-day mortality was 4 out of 10 (40%), with one late death. Mean follow-up of five survivors was 39 months and included clinic review or telephone interview, SF-36 questionnaire for quality of life, transthoracic echocardiography for right ventricular (RV) function and respiratory function testing. All survivors received an inferior vena cava filter and 6 months of anticoagulation with no cases of recurrent thromboembolism. RV systolic dysfunction was severe in all cases prior to surgery, but improved to near normal at follow-up.
   Conclusions Survivors had good quality of life, were functionally NYHA class III with normal respiratory function.

TI  - Witnessed resuscitation by relatives
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Witnessed resuscitation is the process of active 'medical' resuscitation in the presence of family members. Witnessed resuscitation though not as yet wide spread in practice is becoming established. Early reports of programs designed to promote such a process first appeared in the early 1980s More recent work appears to show both public support and a desire for inclusion in the resuscitation process. Some research has been produced that indicates both satisfaction and psychological benefit for those relatives enabled to witness. Limited work only, exists pertaining to the effects on health care providers and these reports currently do not show any significant deleterious effects. Approval of witnessed resuscitation programs is not universal amongst all groups of health care workers. Concerns about the ethics of witnessed resuscitation and its medico-legal implications have been raised. The quality of the initial witnessed resuscitation reports is however variable and there is a great need for further work to validate the initial findings particularly in the areas of psychological stressors in staff and risk management implications.

TI  - Sustainable biodegradation of phenol by immobilized Bacillus sp SAS19 with porous carbonaceous gels as carriers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this study, high-efficient phenol-degrading bacterium Bacillus sp. SAS19 which was isolated from activated sludge by resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) addition, were immobilized on porous carbonaceous gels (CGs) for phenol degradation. The phenol-degrading capabilities of free and immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19 were evaluated under various initial phenol concentrations. The obtained results showed that phenol could be removed effectively by both free and immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19. Furthermore, for degradation of phenol at high concentrations, long-term utilization and recycling were more readily achieved for immobilized bacteria as compared to free bacteria. Immobilized bacteria exhibited significant increase in phenol-degrading capabilities in the third cycle of recycling and reuse, which demonstrated 87.2% and 100% of phenol (1600 mg/L) degradation efficiency at 12 and 24 h, respectively, The present study revealed that immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19 can be potentially used for enhanced treatment of synthetic phenol-laden wastewater.

TI  - DEMOGRAPHICS OF CARDIAC-ARREST - ASSOCIATION WITH RESIDENCE IN A LOW-INCOME AREA
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To report cardiac arrest demographics and assess whether arrest rate is associated with differences in intracity regional population densities, incomes, or race distributions.
   Methods: One-year retrospective review of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a city with a two-tier emergency medical service (EMS) system. Associations of population density, median income, and race data with age- and gender-adjusted cardiac arrest rates for seven city regions and groupings of high- and low-income census tracts were made.
   Results: Median income, but not race or population density, was associated with sex- and age-adjusted intracity regional cardiac arrest rates (p = 0.034). This association of cardiac arrest rate with income status was magnified when the 20 lowest and the 20 highest income census tracts were compared. Cardiac arrest victims in these two income groups did not differ in regard to rate of witnessed arrest, bystander-administered CPR, or previous cardiac disease. Rates of survival to hospital discharge were not significantly different between the two groups.
   Conclusion: The association of lower income with cardiac arrest suggests that cardiac health promotion and EMS intervention measures, including CPR instruction, should be targeted to lower-income neighborhoods. These findings may help explain previous studies suggesting a racial or population density association with cardiac arrest rates.

TI  - Utilizing the Modified T-Maze to Assess Functional Memory Outcomes After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB  - Background: Evaluating mild to moderate cognitive impairment in a global cerebral ischemia (i.e. cardiac arrest) model can be difficult due to poor locomotion after surgery. For example, rats who undergo surgical procedures and are subjected to the Morris water maze may not be able to swim, thus voiding the experiment.
   New Method: We established a modified behavioral spontaneous alternation T-maze test. The major advantage of the modified T-maze protocol is its relatively simple design that is powerful enough to assess functional learning/memory after ischemia. Additionally, the data analysis is simple and straightforward. We used the T-maze to determine the rats' learning/memory deficits both in the presence or absence of mild to moderate (6 min) asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA). Rats have a natural tendency for exploration and will explore the alternate arms in the T-maze, whereas hippocampal-lesioned rats tend to adopt a side-preference resulting in decreased spontaneous alternation ratios, revealing the hippocampal-related functional learning/memory in the presence or absence of ACA.
   Results: ACA groups have higher side-preference ratios and lower alternations as compared to control.
   Comparison with Existing Method(s): The Morris water and Barnes maze are more prominent for assessing learning/memory function. However, the Morris water maze is more stressful than other mazes. The Barnes maze is widely used to measure reference (long-term) memory, while ACA-induced neurocognitive deficits are more closely related to working (short-term) memory.
   Conclusions: We have developed a simple, yet effective strategy to delineate working (short-term) memory via the T-maze in our global cerebral ischemia model (ACA).

TI  - Differences in self-reported health between cardiac arrest survivors with good cerebral performance and survivors with moderate cerebral disability: a nationwide register study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective The aim was to compare self-reported health between cardiac arrest survivors with good cerebral performance (CPC 1) and survivors with moderate cerebral disability (CPC 2). Methods This comparative register study was based on nationwide data from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. The study included 2058 in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with good cerebral performance or survivors with moderate cerebral disability, 3-6 months postcardiac arrest. Survivors completed a questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and EQ-5D five-levels (EQ-5D-5L). Data were analysed using ordinal and linear regression models. Results For all survivors, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms measured by the HADS was 14% and 13%, respectively. Using the EQ-5D-5L, the cardiac arrest survivors reported most health problems relating to pain/discomfort (57%), followed by anxiety/depression (47%), usual activities (46%), mobility (40%) and self-care (18%). Compared with the survivors with good cerebral performance, survivors with moderate cerebral disability reported significantly higher symptom levels of anxiety and depression measured with HADS, and poorer health in all dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L after adjusting for age, sex, place of cardiac arrest, aetiology and initial rhythm (p<0.001). Conclusions These findings stress the importance of screening for health problems in all cardiac arrest survivors to identify those in need of professional support and rehabilitation, independent on neurological outcome.

TI  - The threatened stomach: management of the acute gastric volvulus
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Society-of-American-Gastrointestinal-and-Endoscopic-Surgeons (SAGES)
AB  - Acute presentation of gastric volvulus is a rare condition with a high mortality for acute ischaemia. This study was undertaken to investigate the acute management, diagnosis, and long-term outcomes of patients presenting with acute gastric volvulus.
   Cases were reviewed retrospectively from 2004 to 2014. Patients presenting as an emergency admission with acute gastric volvulus were included.
   Thirty-six patients were included, five of whom had previous surgery. The mean age was 71 years old. All patients presented with vomiting and chest/epigastric pain. CT was diagnostic in all 26 patients. Barium swallow was diagnostic in two/four patients. OGD was diagnostic in 9 of 20 patients. All patients had an NG tube placed, and eight patients were treated conservatively and made a full recovery. Twenty-nine patients proceeded to surgery. Nine had a laparoscopic repair with two open conversions. Four patients had gastric necrosis, and all had open surgery with resection. Three patients had a mediastinal perforation, and one patient required an additional thoracotomy. All patients with viable stomach had a hiatal repair (where appropriate), 11 had a gastropexy, and 11 had a fundoplication. Mortality for gastric necrosis/perforation was 30 %. Mean postoperative stay was 4 days for laparoscopic repair and 8 days for uncomplicated open surgery. Nine of twenty-nine had transient dysphagia postoperatively. Three of eight patients treated conservatively had an elective procedure subsequently.
   Acute paraoesophageal hiatus hernia requires early resuscitation and diagnosis. CT should be favoured in assessment, and an NG tube placed promptly. A conservative management may be considered safely in stable patients. Surgical management should be prompt for unstable patients. Gastric ischaemia or perforation has a mortality of 30 %. Laparoscopic repair has a shorter postoperative stay, but has a higher recurrence rate. Surgery for patients without gastric ischaemia has good long-term outcomes with minimal morbidity.

TI  - Cerebrovascular autoregulation following cardiac arrest: Protocol for a post hoc analysis of the randomised COMACARE pilot trial
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background Approximately two-thirds of the mortality following out of hospital cardiac arrest is related to devastating neurological injury. Previous small cohort studies have reported an impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation following cardiac arrest, but no studies have assessed the impact of differences in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in addition to mean arterial pressure management. Methods This is a protocol and statistical analysis plan to assess the correlation between changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation and arterial pressure as measure of cerebrovascular autoregulation, the tissue oxygenation index, in patients following out of hospital cardiac arrest and in healthy volunteers. The COMACARE study included 120 comatose survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest admitted to ICU and managed with low-normal or high-normal targets for mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures. In addition, 102 healthy volunteers have been investigated as a reference group for the tissue oxygenation index. In both cohorts, the cerebral tissue oxygenation was measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Conclusions Cerebrovascular autoregulation is critical to maintain homoeostatic brain perfusion. This study of changes in autoregulation following out of hospital cardiac arrest over the first 48 hours, as compared to data from healthy volunteers, will generate important physiological information that may guide the rationale and design of interventional studies.

TI  - Autologous Fat Graft by Needle Analysis of Complications After 1000 Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
AB  - Autologous fat graft is becoming a widely used procedure in plastic surgery. Its indications are progressively increasing, ranging from functional to aesthetic surgery. The procedure has now entered in the field of regenerative medicine. Although many have commented on the long-term safety implications of fat grafting, especially to the breast, there is no body of information in the literature that analyzes near-term complications associated with this procedure. We performed a retrospective study of 1000 consecutive fat transplantation cases in our hospital since 2005. Complications were divided between donor-site complications and recipient-site complications. Of 1000 procedures, there were 2 donor-site hematomas and 83 local deformities caused by liposuction. In treated patients, the recipient site, there were 4 infections. One patient reported implant rupture at 1 month after fat graft. There was no skin necrosis in the grafted areas and no systemic complications such as pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, or deep venous thrombosis. The complications in fat transplantation are dominated by complications of the liposuction-the donor harvesting phase of the procedure. The relatively low complication rates in the recipient site suggest that fat transplantation, especially considering the recipient, is characterized by a high safety level and our device is simple to use.

TI  - The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a valid cognitive screening tool for cardiac arrest survivors
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients has increased over the past decades. This gives rise to a growing number of patients with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and cognitive impairment. Currently, cognitive impairment is underdiagnosed in OHCA patients. There is a need for a validated cognitive screening instrument to identify patients with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to examine the diagnostic value of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients after OHCA.
   Methods: Survivors (age >= 18 years) of OHCA completed the MoCA and a gold standard neuropsychological test battery, including tests for memory, attention, perception, language, reasoning, and executive functioning, at around one year after OHCA. Results of the MoCA are related to the results of the neuropsychological test battery. Analyses of diagnostic accuracy included receiver operating characteristics and calculation of predictive values.
   Results: We included 54 OHCA survivors (mean age = 57.3, 74% male). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.8, 95% CI [0.67, 0.93]. The MoCA showed excellent sensitivity of 86%, 95% CI [57, 98] and adequate specificity of 70.0%, 95% CI [53, 83] to detect cognitive impairment at the regular cut-o score of 26. The positive predictive value of the MoCA was 50%, 95% CI [30, 70] and the negative predictive value was 93%, 95% CI [76, 99].
   Conclusion: This study shows that the MoCA may be a valid cognitive screening instrument for use in the OHCA patient population.

TI  - Do donor characteristics really matter? Short- and long-term impact of donor characteristics on recipient survival, 1995-1999
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEART AND LUNG TRANSPLANTATION
CP  - 20th Annual Meeting for the International-Society-of-Heart-and-Lung-Transplantation
AB  - We reviewed the impact of multiple donor characteristics on recipient mortality by univariate and multivariate analyses in a cohort of heart donors from 1995 to 1999. A sub-cohort of donors was also selected who met "marginal" criteria, and the early and late survival of these patients was then compared. Surrogates of donor size (donor weight, donor body mass index [BMI], BMI mismatch >20%), under-resuscitation (hematocrit, 24-hour fluid intake) and age >56 years were significantly associated with peri-operative mortality in the univariate analysis; in the multivariate analysis, only average donor heart rate at procurement (p = .001), donor hematocrit (p = .02) and donor weight (p = .05) were significantly associated. Few donor characteristics actually impact significantly on recipient outcome, and thus recipient characteristics may figure more prominently than those of the donor toward the risk of death after transplantation.

TI  - THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF THE ELDERLY IN THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES, QUALITY AND LENGTH OF LIFE
T2  - STRATEGIC APPROACH TO AGING POPULATION: Experiences and Challenges
AB  - Physical activity is beneficial to people of all ages and is associated with reducing morbidity and prolonging life expectancy. Exercise has been linked to several beneficial health outcomes, including improved bone and muscle health, reduced risk of obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, certain types of cancer, and overall mortality. It can also improve cognitive functions, reduce the risk of falls and fall-related injuries in older adults, and reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The most common risks of exercise are injuries to the musculoskeletal system. More severe but less common risks include arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, and myocardial infarction. The benefits of exercise outweigh the potential risks. By exercising the elderly improve mobility, strength, flexibility, and stability. It can improve daily functioning, reduce the risk of falls and consequent injuries, and help maintain independence. It is never too late for physical activity, and every physical activity has health benefits.
   Group exercise programs have the added benefit of social inclusion. Before starting physical activity, it is necessary to assess the current activity, determine the presence of symptoms and signs of known chronic diseases, and the desired intensity of exercise. Four categories of exercise are recommended for older adults: aerobic exercise, strength exercises, flexibility, and balance. It usually starts with moderate-intensity aerobic activities for 30 minutes five days a week or vigorous activities three days a week. Flexibility is significant for performing daily life activities; flexibility exercises should be performed twice a week for 10 minutes. Balance exercises like tai chi improve stability and can prevent falls and reduce injuries associated with falls. Health service is the most critical source of health information, but networks and other community-based resources can promote the importance of physical activity. Before starting the planned physical activity, it is necessary to conduct motivational support and focus it on immediate and personally significant benefits and long-term benefits that include overall health and lower health care costs.

TI  - Alzheimer Disease Blood Biomarkers in Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - JAMA NEUROLOGY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-13 peptides (A13) are promising peripheral biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. However, their potential alterations due to alternative mechanisms, such as hypoxia in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, are not known. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the levels and trajectories of blood p-tau, A1342, and A1340 following cardiac arrest, in comparison with neural injury markers neurofilament light (NfL) and total tau (t-tau), can be used for neurological prognostication following cardiac arrest.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective clinical biobank study used data from the randomized Target Temperature Management After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM) trial. Unconscious patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were included between November 11, 2010, and January 10, 2013, from 29 international sites. Serum analysis for serum NfL and t-tau were performed between August 1 and August 23, 2017. Serum p-tau, A1342, and A1340 were analyzed between July 1 and July 15, 2021, and between May 13 and May 25, 2022. A total of 717 participants from the TTM cohort were examined: an initial discovery subset (n = 80) and a validation subset. Both subsets were evenly distributed for good and poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.EXPOSURES Serum p-tau, A1342, and A1340 concentrations using single molecule array technology. Serum levels of NfL and t-tau were included as comparators.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Blood biomarker levels at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Poor neurologic outcome at 6-month follow-up, defined according to the cerebral performance category scale as category 3 (severe cerebral disability), 4 (coma), or 5 (brain death).RESULTS This study included 717 participants (137 [19.1%] female and 580 male [80.9%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [13.5] years) who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Significantly elevated serum p-tau levels were observed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours in cardiac arrest patients with poor neurological outcome. The magnitude and prognostication of the change was greater at 24 hours (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), which was similar to NfL (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96). However, at later time points, p-tau levels decreased and were weakly associated with neurological outcome. In contrast, NfL and t-tau maintained high diagnostic accuracies, even 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Serum A1342 and A1340 concentrations increased over time in most patients but were only weakly associated with neurological outcome.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this case-control study, blood biomarkers indicative of AD pathology demonstrated different dynamics of change after cardiac arrest. The increase of p-tau at 24 hours after cardiac arrest suggests a rapid secretion from the interstitial fluid following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury rather than ongoing neuronal injury like NfL or t-tau. In contrast, delayed increases of A13 peptides after cardiac arrest indicate activation of amyloidogenic processing in response to ischemia.

TI  - Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia After Cardiac Arrest and Prevention Strategies: A Narrative Review
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) poses a significant threat to the clinical outcomes and hospital stays of mechanically ventilated patients, particularly those recovering from cardiac arrest. Given the already elevated mortality rates in cardiac arrest cases, the addition of VAP further diminishes the chances of survival. Consequently, a paramount focus on VAP prevention becomes imperative. This review endeavors to comprehensively delve into the nuances of VAP, specifically in patients requiring mechanical ventilation in post-cardiac arrest care. The overarching objectives encompass (I) exploring the etiology, risk factors, and pathophysiology of VAP, (II) delving into available diagnostic modalities, and (III) providing insights into the management options and recent treatment guidelines. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for articles about VAP and Cardiac arrest. We used the MeSH terms "VAP", "Cardiac arrest", "postcardiac arrest syndrome", and "postcardiac arrest syndrome". The clinical presentation, diagnostic, and management strategies of VAP were summarized, and all authors reviewed the selection and decided which studies to include. Key Content and Findings: The incidence and mortality rates of VAP exhibit significant variability, yet a recurring pattern emerges, marked by prolonged hospitalization and exacerbated clinical outcomes. This pattern is attributed to the elevated incidence of drug-resistant infections and the delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment. This review focuses on VAP, aiming to offer valuable insights into the efficient identification and management of this fatal complication in post-cardiac arrest patients. Conclusion: The prognosis for survival after cardiac arrest is already challenging, and the outlook becomes even more daunting when complicated by VAP. The timely diagnosis of VAP and initiation of antibiotics pose considerable challenges, primarily due to the invasive nature of obtaining high-quality samples and the time required for speciation and identification of antimicrobial sensitivity. The controversy surrounding prophylactic antibiotics persists, but promising new strategies have been proposed; however, they are still awaiting well-designed clinical trials.

TI  - Intravenous antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the resuscitation from refractory ventricular arrhythmias
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
CP  - 71st Scientific Session of the American-Heart-Association
AB  - Prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation significantly improve the likelihood of successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest and are the key components in the American Heart Association's "chain of survival." Although representing current clinical practice in the United States, there is limited evidence supporting the benefit of acute administration of such antiarrhythmic medications as lidocaine, bretylium, magnesium, and procainamide to a victim of cardiac arrest. There has been only 1 published case-controlled clinical trial in which shock-refractory victims of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation were stratified into those who received lidocaine and chose who did not, In this trial, no significant differences were observed between treatment groups in the return of an organized rhythm, admission to the hospital, or survival to hospital discharge. In the recently published ARREST trial, a significant improvement in admission alive to the hospital was observed in recipients of intravenous amiodarone, compared with placebo (44% vs 34%, respectively, p = 0.03), With the possible exception of intravenous amiodarone, available evidence of definitive benefit from antiarrhythmic drugs in cardiac arrest is inconclusive, Due to regulatory issues, clinical trials in cardiac arrest are extremely difficult to design and perform.

TI  - Gender, Socioeconomic Status, Race, and Ethnic Disparities in Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Education-A Scoping Review
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Background: Social determinants are associated with survival from out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Because prompt delivery of bystander CPR (B-CPR) doubles survival and B-CPR rates are low, we sought to assess whether gender, socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity are associated with lower rates of B-CPR and CPR training. Methods: This scoping review was conducted as part of the continuous evidence evaluation process for the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care as part of the Resuscitation Education Science section. We searched PubMed and excluded citations that were abstracts only, letters or editorials, and pediatric studies. Results: We reviewed 762 manuscripts and identified 24 as relevant; 4 explored gender disparities; 12 explored SES; 11 explored race and ethnicity; and 3 had overlapping themes, all of which examined B-CPR or CPR training. Females were less likely to receive B-CPR than males in public locations. Observed gender disparities in B-CPR may be associated with individuals fearing accusations of inappropriate touching or injuring female victims. Studies demonstrated that low-SES neighborhoods were associated with lower rates of B-CPR and CPR training. In the US, predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods were associated with lower rates of B-CPR and CPR training. Language barriers were associated with lack of CPR training. Conclusion: Gender, SES, race, and ethnicity impact receiving B-CPR and obtaining CPR training. The impact of this is that these populations are less likely to receive B-CPR, which decreases their odds of surviving SCA. These health disparities must be addressed. Our work can inform future research, education, and public health initiatives to promote equity in B-CPR knowledge and provision. As an immediate next step, organizations that develop and deliver CPR curricula to potential bystanders should engage affected communities to determine how best to improve training and delivery of B-CPR.

TI  - An Algorithm Used for Ventricular Fibrillation Detection Without Interrupting Chest Compression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the primary arrhythmic event in the majority of patients suffering from sudden cardiac arrest. Attention has been focused on this particular rhythm since it is recognized that prompt therapy, especially electrical defibrillation, may lead to a successful outcome. However, current versions of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) mandate repetitive interruptions of chest compression for rhythm analyses since artifacts produced by chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preclude reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm analysis. Yet, repetitive interruptions in chest compression are detrimental to the success of defibrillation. The capability for rhythm analysis without requiring "hands-off" intervals will allow for more effective resuscitation. In this paper, a novel continuous-wavelet-transformation-based morphology consistency evaluation algorithm was developed for the detection of disorganized VF from organized sinus rhythm (SR) without interrupting the ongoing chest compression. The performance of this method was evaluated on both uncorrupted and corrupted ECG signals recorded from AEDs obtained from out-of-hospital victims of cardiac arrest. A total of 232 patients and 31 092 episodes of either VF or SR were accessed, in which 8195 episodes were corrupted by artifacts produced by chest compressions. We also compared the performance of this method with three other established algorithms, including VF filter, spectrum analysis, and complexity measurement. Even though there was a modest decrease in specificity and accuracy when chest compression artifact was present, the performance of this method was still superior to other reported methods for VF detection during uninterrupted CPR.

TI  - Outcomes of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest in the setting of drug overdose
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: To compare the attributes and clinical outcomes of patients with cardiac arrest in the setting of drug overdose (OD) to patients with cardiac arrest from non-drug related etiologies. Methods: We utilized a US inpatient cardiac arrest registry used to study targeted temperature management (TTM) to identify patients with cardiac arrest in the setting of drug overdose between 2005 and 2013. Data regarding the cardiac arrest, resuscitation interventions, use of post-arrest TTM, urine drug screen, survival, and neurologic outcome were examined. These results were compared to patients suffering cardiac arrest from other causes during the same time period using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests on categorical variables. Results: Approximately 2.5% (64/2584) of cardiac arrests occurred in the setting of drug overdose. Patients in the OD cohort were younger, more likely to be male, and more likely to have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that was unwitnessed with no bystander CPR and from a non-shockable rhythm. However, the patients in the OD cohort had similar rates of survival and good neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2) compared to non-OD patients. A fraction of initially resuscitated patients in each group (8% in OD cohort vs. 15% in non-OD cohort, p = ns) did not receive post-arrest TTM due to prompt awakening following resuscitation. Conclusions: Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest in the setting of drug OD have neurologic and survival outcomes comparable to non-OD patients despite lower rates of bystander CPR, shockable rhythms, and witnessed arrest.

TI  - The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in sudden cardiac arrest survivors: A 5-year nationwide inpatient analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major public health challenge in the United States (US). At present, the existence of limited literature on psychological sequelae post-cardiac arrest is a challenge in providing optimal care to survivors.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of various psychiatric comorbidities in survivors of SCA.
   Methods: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset was queried to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders with gender-based differences and inpatient mortality among adult patients hospitalized with a previous history of SCA using ICD-9 CM codes from 2010 to 2014.
   Results: Mood disorder (16.4%) was the most prevalent psychiatric comorbidity (including depression; 12.6%) followed by anxiety (10%). Cardiac arrest survivors with psychiatric disorder (CAPD) were often younger (mean 60 +/- 16 vs. 64 +/- 16 years; p < 0.001), female (53.7% vs. 38.0%; p < 0.001), white patients (75.9% vs. 68.7%; p < 0.001) and the majority were admitted non-electively (85.1% vs. 82.8%, p < 0.001) as compared to cardiac arrest survivors without psychiatric disorder (CANPD). Among the CAPD group, females had a significantly higher frequency of mood disorders (21.8% vs. 12.6%), depression (16.8% vs. 9.5%) and anxiety (14.2% vs. 8.0%) compared to males. The CAPD cohort had a lower all-cause in-hospital mortality (5.7% vs. 9.8%; p < 0.001) as compared to the CANPD group.
   Conclusions: Comorbid psychiatric disorders are prevalent in SCA survivors, especially younger, white, female patients. However, CAPD did not have higher all-cause mortality as compared to CANPD. It is imperative to identify, assess, treat, and monitor high-risk SCA patients for associated psychiatric comorbidities.

TI  - Angiogenic factors and their soluble receptors predict organ dysfunction and mortality in post-cardiac arrest syndrome
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) often leads to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with a poor prognosis. Endothelial and leukocyte activation after whole-body ischemia/reperfusion following resuscitation from cardiac arrest is a critical step in endothelial injury and related organ damage. Angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang), and their receptors play crucial roles in endothelial growth, survival signals, pathological angiogenesis and microvascular permeability. The aim of this study was to confirm the efficacy of angiogenic factors and their soluble receptors in predicting organ dysfunction and mortality in patients with PCAS.
   Methods: A total of 52 resuscitated patients were divided into two subgroups: 23 survivors and 29 non-survivors. The serum levels of VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor (sVEGFR) 1, sVEGFR2, Ang1, Ang2 and soluble Tie2 (sTie2) were measured at the time of admission (Day 1) and on Day 3 and Day 5. The ratio of Ang2 to Ang1 (Ang2/Ang1) was also calculated. This study compared the levels of angiogenic factors and their soluble receptors between survivors and non-survivors, and evaluated the predictive value of these factors for organ dysfunction and 28-day mortality.
   Results: The non-survivors demonstrated more severe degrees of organ dysfunction and a higher prevalence of MODS. Non-survivors showed significant increases in the Ang2 levels and the Ang2/Ang1 ratios compared to survivors. A stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the Ang2 levels or the Ang2/Ang1 ratios on Day 1 independently predicted the 28-day mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curves of the Ang2 levels, and the Ang2/Ang1 ratios on Day 1 were good predictors of 28-day mortality. The Ang2 levels also independently predicted increases in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.
   Conclusions: We observed a marked imbalance between Ang1 and Ang2 in favor of Ang2 in PCAS patients, and the effect was more prominent in non-survivors. Angiogenic factors and their soluble receptors, particularly Ang2 and Ang2/Ang1, are considered to be valuable predictive biomarkers in the development of organ dysfunction and poor outcomes in PCAS patients.

TI  - Prevalence and patterns of foot injuries following motorcycle trauma
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA
AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence and patterns of foot injuries following motorcycle trauma.
   Design: Prospective.
   Setting: Yorkshire Region Trauma Units (Level 1 trauma centers with trauma research).
   Patients: Individuals injured in motorcycle road traffic accidents between January 1993 and December 1999.
   Outcome Measurements: Patient demographics, protective devices (helmet) use, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), clinical details, therapeutic interventions, resuscitation requirements, duration of hospital stay, mortality, and type of foot injuries sustained.
   Results: The parent population of 1239 contained 53 (4.3%) foot-injured motorcyclists (49 men) with a mean age of 31.7 years (range 18-79 years). Fifty-two were drivers and one was a rear-seat passenger. Mean ISS was 6.9 (range 4-33), significantly lower than the parent population mean of 34.98 (range 9-75) (P = 0.001). Mean GCS was 14.7 (range 13-15). The motorcyclists' injuries included 26 metatarsal fractures (49.1%), 14 talar fractures (26.4%), 7 os calcis fractures (13.2%), and 6 toe fractures (11.3%). Associated foot injuries included three partial foot amputations, four Lisfranc dislocations, three cases of foot compartment syndrome (two crush injuries with no fracture, one open fourth metatarsal fracture with associated Lisfranc dislocation). Forty-six motorcyclists had more than one foot injury. Associated injuries included 22 ankle fractures (41.5%), 15 tibial fractures (28.3%), 6 femoral fractures (11.3%), 5 pelvic ring fractures (9.4%), 23 upper limb injuries (43.4%), and 3 cases of chest trauma (5.7%). No one sustained abdominal trauma or head injury compared with the parent population. All patients required operative stabilization of foot fractures, including their associated injuries. Mean hospital stay was 10.9 days (range 1-35 days). In the parent population, there were 71 deaths (6.0%), whereas there was only 1 death (1.9%) in the foot-injured group (with fractures including open book pelvic, T6-8, unilateral open femur, tibial, ankle, and metatarsal) with an ISS 33, who died of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. At final follow-up, all patients underwent radiologic and clinical assessment of foot injuries. Forty-three patients returned to their previous occupation and level of mobility. Ten of the more significantly injured patients had to modify their occupation from manual to sedentary-type jobs due to their foot injuries. We noted a pattern of complex ipsilateral foot and limb injury in nine patients, which we postulate was due to the actual mechanism of contact with the road surface.
   Conclusion: Motorcycle accidents continue to be a source of severe injury, especially to the foot. The most common foot injury is a metatarsal fracture; however, there must be a high index of suspicion for associated injuries. Although these injuries are associated with a low mortality rate, they require prompt assessment and treatment to limit long-term morbidity and disability. The difference in foot injury pattern and mortality between the parent population and our series, among other factors, potentially may be influenced by the actual mechanism of contact with the road surface and the modifying action of the foot during the accident.

TI  - Therapeutic Hypothermia for Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Arrest
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - This report focuses on cardioprotection and describes the advantages and disadvantages of various methods of inducing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) with regard to neuroprotection and cardioprotection for patients with cardiac arrest and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). TH is recommended in cardiac arrest guidelines. For patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, improvements in survival and neurologic outcomes were observed with relatively slow induction of TH. More rapid induction of TH in patients with cardiac arrest might have a mild to modest incremental impact on neurologic outcomes. TH drastically reduces infarct size in animal models, but achievement of target temperature before reperfusion is essential. Rapid initiation of TH in patients with STEMI is challenging but attainable, and marked infarct size reductions are possible. To induce TH, a variety of devices have recently been developed that require additional study. Of particular interest is transcoronary induction of TH using a catheter or wire lumen, which enables hypothermic reperfusion in the absence of total-body hypothermia. At present, the main methods of inducing and maintaining TH are surface cooling, endovascular heat-exchange catheters, and intravenous infusion of cold fluids. Surface cooling or endovascular catheters may be sufficient for induction of TH in patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For patients with STEW, intravenous infusion of cold fluids achieves target temperature very rapidly but might worsen left ventricular function. More widespread use of TH would improve survival and quality of life for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; larger studies with more rapid induction of TH are needed in the STEMI population.

TI  - Sudden cardiac death: The clinical and public health challenges
T2  - HEART DISEASE: PATHOGENESIS, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
CP  - 3rd World Congress on Heart Disease
AB  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and the broader category of unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac deaths (OHCD) remain major clinical and public health problems. In the US, an estimated 400,000-450,000 OHCDs occur each year, of which approximately 250,000 deaths result directly from cardiac arrest. Although recent advances in clinical and population science research coupled with technological innovations in device therapy have provided a wealth of evidence from which to manage SCD survivors, daunting clinical and public health challenges persist. In this paper, we summarize recent trends in SCD and OHCD in the United States, and explore public health strategies in the prevention of SCD and OHCD.
   Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and the broader category of unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac deaths (OHCD) remain major clinical and public health problems, despite recent advances in clinical and population science research, as well as technological innovations in device therapy [1). Important ambiguities in case definition and ascertainment remain unresolved. Lack of a national registry hampers reliable national-level estimation of incidence and trends. Public awareness of the symptoms and signs of heart attack and cardiac arrest is relatively low and knowledge of action by bystanders is limited when encountering a sudden cardiac arrest. Low public awareness and inadequate response may contribute in part to the low success rate (less than 10%) of resuscitation of cardiac arrest.
   Clinically SCD is defined as an unexpected natural death from a cardiac etiology within a short time period (usually one hour or less) lifestyle modification, smoking cessation, blood pressure and cholesterol control, diabetes and weight control, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and aspirin use;
   (5) Support public health infrastructure to address definitions, surveillance, health education, policy development and assurance;
   (6) Promote policies on universal 9-1-1 coverage and accessibility of AED in home, public places and in rural communities;
   (7) Support health-related quality of life and outcomes research in SCD survivors, and economic analyses from a societal perspective for the use of innovative device therapy, especially in primary prevention of SCD.

TI  - Guidelines for Neuroprognostication in Comatose Adult Survivors of Cardiac Arrest
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundAmong cardiac arrest survivors, about half remain comatose 72 h following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Prognostication of poor neurological outcome in this population may result in withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and death. The objective of this article is to provide recommendations on the reliability of select clinical predictors that serve as the basis of neuroprognostication and provide guidance to clinicians counseling surrogates of comatose cardiac arrest survivors.MethodsA narrative systematic review was completed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Candidate predictors, which included clinical variables and prediction models, were selected based on clinical relevance and the presence of an appropriate body of evidence. The Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Timing, Setting (PICOTS) question was framed as follows: "When counseling surrogates of comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest, should [predictor, with time of assessment if appropriate] be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 3 months or later?" Additional full-text screening criteria were used to exclude small and lower-quality studies. Following construction of the evidence profile and summary of findings, recommendations were based on four GRADE criteria: quality of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, good practice recommendations addressed essential principles of neuroprognostication that could not be framed in PICOTS format.ResultsEleven candidate clinical variables and three prediction models were selected based on clinical relevance and the presence of an appropriate body of literature. A total of 72 articles met our eligibility criteria to guide recommendations. Good practice recommendations include waiting 72 h following ROSC/rewarming prior to neuroprognostication, avoiding sedation or other confounders, the use of multimodal assessment, and an extended period of observation for awakening in patients with an indeterminate prognosis, if consistent with goals of care. The bilateral absence of pupillary light response > 72 h from ROSC and the bilateral absence of N20 response on somatosensory evoked potential testing were identified as reliable predictors. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain > 48 h from ROSC and electroencephalography > 72 h from ROSC were identified as moderately reliable predictors.ConclusionsThese guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of predictors of poor outcome in the context of counseling surrogates of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and suggest broad principles of neuroprognostication. Few predictors were considered reliable or moderately reliable based on the available body of evidence.

TI  - Skill decay following Basic Life Support training: a systematic review protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Survival from out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is lower in the UK than in several developed nations. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with increased rates of survival to hospital discharge following OHCA, prompting the introduction of several initiatives by the UK government to increase rates of bystander CPR, including the inclusion of Basic Life Support (BLS) teaching within the English national curriculum. While there is clear benefit in this, increasing evidence suggests poor retention of skills following BLS teaching. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the literature regarding skill decay following BLS training, reporting particularly the time period over which this occurs, and which components of would-be rescuers' performance of the BLS algorithm are most affected. Methods and analysis A search will be conducted to identify studies in which individuals have received BLS training and received subsequent assessment of their skills at a later date. A search strategy comprising relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords has been devised with assistance from an experienced librarian. Relevant databases will be searched with titles, abstract and full-text review conducted independently by two reviewers. Data will be extracted from included studies by two reviewers, with meta-analysis conducted if the appropriate preconditions (such as limited heterogeneity) are met. Ethic and dissemination No formal ethical approval is required for this systematic review. Results will be disseminated in the form of manuscript submission to a relevant journal and presentation at relevant meetings. To maximise the public's access to this review's findings, any scientific report will be accompanied by a lay summary posted via social media channels, and a press release disseminated to national and international news agencies.

TI  - Impaired Mental Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundIdiopathic ventricular fibrillation (iVF) is diagnosed in cardiac arrest survivors without an identifiable cause. Data regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in iVF patients are lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the HRQoL of iVF patients and to compare it to patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) diagnosed with an underlying disease and healthy subjects.
   MethodsIn 61 iVF patients with an ICD (iVF-ICD) and 59 ICD patients with a diagnosis (diagnosis-ICD), HRQoL was assessed using the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the ICD Patient Concerns (ICDC) Questionnaire. In addition, 860 healthy subjects completed the SF-12.
   ResultsIVF-ICD showed similar SF-12 physical summary scores compared with diagnosis-ICD patients (50.8 [interquartile range (IQR) = 42.1-53.9] vs 54.1 [IQR = 46.5-58.3]; P = 0.080) and healthy subjects (51.8 [IQR = 45.9-54.1]; P = 0.691). The mental summary score was impaired in iVF-ICD patients compared with diagnosis-ICD patients (45.9 [IQR = 40.7-49.4] vs 54.6 [IQR = 46.0-57.9]; P < 0.001) and healthy subjects (47.7 [IQR = 43.0-50.4]; P = 0.027). Scores on all five EQ-5D domains were similar between iVF-ICD patients and diagnosis-ICD patients, as well as symptoms of severe depression (19% vs 12%; P = 0.101). ICD concerns were similar between iVF-ICD and diagnosis-ICD patients (ICDC-scores 2vs 2; P = 0.494).
   ConclusionsData suggest that there is a reduced mental HRQoL in patients with iVF compared to other cardiac arrest survivors. Screening and treatment of psychological distress should therefore be considered in iVF patients.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE ON ETHICAL ATTITUDES IN NEONATAL INTENSIVE-CARE
T2  - MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - A cross-sectional survey of medical students, pediatrics residents, and neonatologists attempted to identify the combined influence of education and experience on ethical attitudes regarding the management of infants weighing less than 750 g at birth. Of the 120 people surveyed, 94 (78%) returned usable surveys. All groups rated quality of life the most important criterion in treatment decisions. Conversely, cost was rated least important by each group. In addition, cost was rated relatively more important by the clinical medical students than by the preclinical students, residents, or neonatologists. The neonatologist was rated the most important decision maker by the neonatologists and the residents. The parents were rated most important by both groups of students. Severe mental retardation was regarded as an unacceptable quality of life by 82% of the neonatologists, 63% of the residents, 61% of the clinical students, and 48% of the preclinical students. Severe cerebral palsy was considered an unacceptable quality of life by 73% of the neonatologists, 63% of the residents, 50% of the clinical students, and only 32% of the preclinical students. Finally, the anticipated long-term outcome of extremely-low-birth-weight infants was viewed more positively by the neonatologists than by the other groups surveyed.

TI  - Factors analysis of lower probability of receiving bystander CPR in females: a web-based survey
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - BackgroundWomen are less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) compared to men. This study aims to identify the factors influencing the willingness to perform CPR on women, providing insights to improve training and public awareness.MethodsA cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among medical and non-medical populations in southeastern China. The questionnaire assessed demographics, CPR training experience, and attitudes toward gender-related CPR concerns. A total of 450 responses were collected, with 433 valid responses included after quality control. Statistical analyses were performed using R4.3.2 to evaluate the impact of gender, age, occupation, and education on CPR willingness.ResultsWomen exhibited a higher willingness to perform CPR on female victims compared to men. Many male respondents hesitated due to concerns about physical contact, particularly regarding removing clothing during resuscitation. Younger individuals (18-35 and 36-50 years) showed greater willingness to provide CPR than older respondents (51-75 years), who were more cautious due to privacy concerns and traditional beliefs. Healthcare professionals and non-medical workers were more likely to perform CPR than medical students, who, despite receiving CPR training, expressed hesitation due to a lack of confidence and practical experience. Higher education levels were associated with increased willingness to perform CPR on women, with postgraduate respondents being the most willing. Additionally, most participants had never practiced on female CPR mannequins, despite widespread support-especially among women-for incorporating female models into training.ConclusionThe lower likelihood of women receiving CPR is influenced by gender bias, societal norms, and training limitations. Addressing this issue requires public education to eliminate gender-based hesitation, improvements in CPR training programs to include female mannequins, and enhanced legal protections to reduce rescuer concerns. These measures can be combined with other key factors such as community-wide CPR training programs and increasing the availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to help promote equity in access to life-saving interventions. Targeted interventions can promote gender equity in emergency response, ultimately improving survival outcomes for women.

TI  - Non-Cardiac Depolarization-Blocking Drugs Are Associated with Increased Risk of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the Community
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Depolarization-blocking drugs (DB drugs) used for cardiac disease increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation [VT/VF]) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in specific patient groups. However, it is unknown whether drugs for non-cardiac disease that block cardiac depolarization as the off-target effect increase the risk of OHCA on a population level. Therefore, we aimed to investigate OHCA risk of non-cardiac, DB drugs in the community. We conducted a population-based case-control study. We included OHCA cases from an emergency-medical-services-attended OHCA registry in the Netherlands (ARREST:2009-2018), and age/sex/OHCA-date matched non-OHCA controls. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) of use of non-cardiac DB drugs for OHCA using conditional logistic regression. Stratified analyses were performed according to first-registered rhythm (VT/VF or non-VT/VF), sex, and age (<= 50, 50-70, or >= 70 years). We included 5473 OHCA cases of whom 427 (7.8%) used non-cardiac, DB drugs and 21,866 non-OHCA controls of whom 835 (3.8%) used non-cardiac, DB drugs and found that non-cardiac, DB-drug use was associated with increased OHCA-risk when compared to no use (OR(adj)1.6[95%-CI:1.4-1.9]). Stratification by first-recorded rhythm revealed that this applied to OHCA with non-VT/VF (asystole) (OR(adj)2.5[95%-CI:2.1-3.0]) but not with VT/VF (OR(adj)1.0[95%-CI:0.8-1.2]; p-value interaction < 0.001). The risk was higher in women (OR(adj)1.8[95%-CI:1.5-2.2] than in men (OR(adj)1.5[95%-CI:1.2-1.8]; p-value interaction = 0.030) and at younger ages (OR(adj >= 70yrs)1.4[95%-CI:1.2-1.7]; OR(adj50-70yrs)1.7[95%-CI:1.4-2.1]; OR(adj <= 50yrs)3.2[95%-CI:2.1-5.0]; p-value interaction < 0.001). Use of non-cardiac, DB drugs is associated with increased OHCA risk. This increased risk occurred in patients in whom non-VT/VF was the first-registered rhythm, and it occurred in both sexes but more prominently among women and more strongly in younger patients (<= 50 years).

TI  - Perioperative Blood Pressure Management Recommendations in Pediatric Pheochromocytoma: A 10-Year Narrative Review
T2  - KIDNEY & BLOOD PRESSURE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare chromaffin cell-derived tumors characterized by catecholamine-secreting activity. Pheochromocytomas account for 1.7% of pediatric hypertension cases. Surgical resection, the definitive pheochromocytoma treatment, carries risks of hemodynamic instability and cardiovascular complications. Nevertheless, mortality rates decreased significantly in the latter half of the 20th century due to effective perioperative blood pressure (BP) management. The literature on BP management tailored to pediatric pheochromocytoma is limited, while the sustained hypertension rate in this population is high (up to 90%) and related to a high risk of intraoperative complications. In this narrative review, we provide up-to-date recommendations regarding BP management to minimize perioperative comorbidities in children with pheochromocytoma. Summary: Antihypertensive agents, primarily alpha (alpha)-blockers, should be promptly administered for suspected pheochromocytoma. Beta ((3)-blockers may be introduced thereafter to counteract reflex tachycardia. The patient must be salt- and water-replete preoperation. Intraoperatively, stable hemodynamics should be ensured during anesthesia and surgery, and short-acting intravenous medications and resuscitation fl uid should be supplied. Postoperatively, patients should be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for close monitoring for at least 24-48 h. Genetic testing is recommended for all pheochromocytoma patients. Identifying underlying mutations, like in succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, which is linked to a higher risk of multifocality and metastasis, is imperative for tailoring treatment strategies and prognostication. Key Messages: Achieving optimal outcomes in pediatric pheochromocytoma relies on preoperative BP optimization with appropriate antihypertensive agents, intraoperative hemodynamic stability, and postoperative routine long-term follow-up to monitor for complications, recurrence, and metastasis. Future research should prioritize well-designed prospective multicenter studies with adequate sample sizes and, where feasible, randomized controlled trials with standardized protocols and appropriate endpoints. These studies should focus on the efficacy and safety of preoperative nonselective versus selective alpha-blockers, whether as monotherapy or combined with other medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers and/ or beta-blockers), or treatment without preoperative anti- hypertensives.

TI  - Quality of life in the antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators trial - Impact of therapy and influence of adverse symptoms and defibrillator shocks
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) use reduces mortality in patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias compared with antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) use. However, the relative impact of these therapies on self-perceived quality of life (QoL) is unknown.
   Methods and Results-Three self-administered instruments were used to measure generic and disease-specific QoL in Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators trial participants. Generalized linear models were used to assess the relationships between self-perceived QoL and treatment (AAD versus ICD) and adverse symptoms and ICD shocks. To minimize the impact of missing data, only patients surviving 1 year were included in the primary analyses. Baseline characteristics among QoL participants (n=905) and nonparticipants (n=111) were similar, but participants who survived 1 year (n=800) were healthier at baseline than nonsurvivors (n=105). Of the 800 patients in the primary analysis, characteristics of those randomized to AAD (n=384) versus ICD (n=416) were similar. Overall, ICD and AAD use were associated with similar alterations in QoL. The development of sporadic shocks and adverse symptoms were each associated with reduced physical functioning and mental well-being and increased concerns among ICD recipients, whereas development of adverse symptoms was associated with reduced physical functioning and increased concerns among AAD recipients.
   Conclusions-ICD and AAD therapy are associated with similar alterations in self-perceived QoL over 1-year follow-up. Adverse symptoms were associated with reduced self-perceived QoL in both groups, and sporadic shocks were associated with reduced QoL in ICD recipients.

TI  - Developing and evaluating a brief, socially primed video intervention to enable bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A randomised control trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background Over 30,000 people experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom annually, with only 7-8% of patients surviving. One of the most effective methods of improving survival outcomes is bystander intervention in the form of calling the emergency services and initiating chest compressions. Additionally, the public must feel empowered to act and use this knowledge in an emergency. This study aimed to evaluate an ultra-brief CPR familiarisation video that uses empowering social priming language to frame CPR as a norm in Scotland.Methods In a randomised control trial, participants (n = 86) were assigned to view an ultra-brief CPR video intervention or a traditional long-form CPR video intervention. Following completion of a pre-intervention questionnaire examining demographic variables and prior CPR knowledge, participants completed an emergency services-led resuscitation simulation in a portable simulation suite using a CPR manikin that measures resuscitation quality. Participants then completed questionnaires examining social identity and attitudes towards performing CPR.Results During the simulated resuscitation, the ultra-brief intervention group's cumulative time spent performing chest compressions was significantly higher than that observed in the long-form intervention group. The long-form intervention group's average compressions per minute rate was significantly higher than the ultra-brief intervention group, however both scores fell within a clinically acceptable range. No other differences were observed in CPR quality. Regarding the social identity measures, participants in the ultra-brief condition had greater feelings of expected emergency support from other Scottish people when compared to long-form intervention participants. There were no significant group differences in attitudes towards performing CPR.Conclusions Socially primed, ultra-brief CPR interventions hold promise as a method of equipping the public with basic resuscitation skills and empowering the viewer to intervene in an emergency. These interventions may be an effective avenue for equipping at-risk groups with resuscitation skills and for supplementing traditional resuscitation training.

TI  - Multi-Drug Cocktail Therapy Improves Survival and Neurological Function after Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest in Rodents
T2  - CELLS
AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest (CA) can lead to neuronal degeneration and death through various pathways, including oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress. However, current neuroprotective drug therapies will typically target only one of these pathways, and most single drug attempts to correct the multiple dysregulated metabolic pathways elicited following cardiac arrest have failed to demonstrate clear benefit. Many scientists have opined on the need for novel, multidimensional approaches to the multiple metabolic disturbances after cardiac arrest. In the current study, we have developed a therapeutic cocktail that includes ten drugs capable of targeting multiple pathways of ischemia-reperfusion injury after CA. We then evaluated its effectiveness in improving neurologically favorable survival through a randomized, blind, and placebo-controlled study in rats subjected to 12 min of asphyxial CA, a severe injury model. Results: 14 rats were given the cocktail and 14 received the vehicle after resuscitation. At 72 h post-resuscitation, the survival rate was 78.6% among cocktail-treated rats, which was significantly higher than the 28.6% survival rate among vehicle-treated rats (log-rank test; p = 0.006). Moreover, in cocktail-treated rats, neurological deficit scores were also improved. These survival and neurological function data suggest that our multi-drug cocktail may be a potential post-CA therapy that deserves clinical translation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that, with its ability to target multiple damaging pathways, a multi-drug therapeutic cocktail offers promise both as a conceptual advance and as a specific multi-drug formulation capable of combatting neuronal degeneration and death following cardiac arrest. Clinical implementation of this therapy may improve neurologically favorable survival rates and neurological deficits in patients suffering from cardiac arrest.

TI  - Rates of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training in the United States
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - IMPORTANCE Prompt bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves the likelihood of surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Large regional variations in survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have been noted.
   OBJECTIVES To determine whether regional variations in county-level rates of CPR training exist across the United States and the factors associated with low rates in US counties.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a cross-sectional ecologic study design to analyze county-level rates of CPR training in all US counties from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011. We used CPR training data from the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, and the Health & Safety Institute. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we examined the association of annual rates of adult CPR training of citizens by these 3 organizations (categorized as tertiles) with a county's geographic, population, and health care characteristics.
   EXPOSURE Completion of CPR training.
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Rate of CPR training measured as CPR course completion cards distributed and CPR training products sold by the American Heart Association, persons trained in CPR by the American Red Cross, and product sales data from the Health & Safety Institute.
   RESULTS During the study period, 13.1 million persons in 3143 US counties received CPR training. Rates of county training ranged from 0.00% to less than 1.29% (median, 0.51%) in the lower tertile, 1.29% to 4.07% (median, 2.39%) in the middle tertile, and greater than 4.07% or greater (median, 6.81%) in the upper tertile. Counties with rates of CPR training in the lower tertile were more likely to have a higher proportion of rural areas (adjusted odds ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.10-1.15] per 5-percentage point [PP] change), higher proportions of black (1.09 [1.06-1.13] per 5-PP change) and Hispanic (1.06 [1.02-1.11] per 5-PP change) residents, a lower median household income (1.18 [1.04-1.34] per $ 10 000 decrease), and a higher median age (1.28 [1.04-1.58] per 10-year change). Counties in the South, Midwest, and West were more likely to have rates of CPR training in the lower tertile compared with the Northeast (adjusted odds ratios, 7.78 [95% CI, 3.66-16.53], 5.56 [2.63-11.75], and 5.39 [2.48-11.72], respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Annual rates of US CPR training are low and vary widely across communities. Counties located in the South, those with higher proportions of rural areas and of black and Hispanic residents, and those with lower median household incomes have lower rates of CPR training than their counterparts. These data contribute to known geographic disparities in survival of cardiac arrest and offer opportunities for future community interventions.

TI  - Prognostic factors for mortality in out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest
T2  - MEDICINA CLINICA
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the prognostic factors of mortality among patients with cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) assisted by 061 emergency teams in Andalusia.
   PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study from January 1998 to December 1999 of 1950 cases of out-of-hospital CRA (OH-CRA) assisted by Andalusian 061 emergency teams (ETs). Independent (predictor) variables considered in the study were those defined in the Utstein style, after categorization. The dependent (outcome) variable was out-of-hospital mortality. A multivariate model was constructed using logistic regression to define the factors that, when considered together, predict mortality. The model was calibrated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. For the discrimination of the model, we calculated the area under the ROC curve.
   RESULTS: The incidence of OH-CRA was 27/100,000. Among our population of 1950 patients, 24.95% (483) were admitted alive to hospital and 75.05% (1444) died in the out-of hospital setting; 1393 patients were male and 552 were female. The mean age was 61.3 +/- 28.4 years. The model revealed the following mortality prognostic factors: personnel performing cadio-pulmonary resuscitation before ET arrival (healthcare/non-healthcare), presence of defibrillation, number of defibrillations, CRA site, general function categories before CRA, and cardiac massage within the first minute by ET.
   CONCLUSIONS: In order to reduce the CRA-induced mortality in our setting, defibrillation and cardiac massage by ETs must be done without delay. It is fundamental to achieve greater health awareness and education among both the general population and the healthcare workers involved in the survival chain.

TI  - Effect of a grace period on false alarm rates of smartwatch-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest detection systems: a pilot study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality, and rapid treatment is life-saving. Early detection is crucial to promptly start the chain of survival, leading to increasing interest in smartwatch-based OHCA detection. Introducing a grace period, during which the wearer can cancel a false alarm before emergency medical services (EMS) are notified, may improve system reliability. This study evaluates how this grace period affects false alarm rates. Methods: In this study, 26 participants wore smartwatches that produced auditory, tactile or audiotactile alarms at random times during daytime, while instructed to cancel these alarms as quickly as possible. Response times were registered by the smartwatch, alongside demographic and time-of-day data. Bayesian time-to-event analysis assessed the effects of alarm type, time of day, and demographic variables. Results: (Audio)tactile alarms significantly shortened response times compared to auditory-only alarms (HR 0.475, 95% CI: 0.38-0.59). Grace periods of 10 and 20 s would result in 98.3% (95% CI: 97.1-99.0%) and 99.6% (95% CI: 99.2-99.9%) of the (audio)tactile alarms being canceled, respectively. No clear evidence was found for meaningful effects of time of day, age or sex. Conclusion: The findings in this study suggest that the application of a grace period to smartwatch-based OHCA detection systems may potentially reduce false alarms reaching EMS with only minor delays. Further research is warranted in a larger implementation set-up.

TI  - δ-Opioid-induced pharmacologic myocardial hibernation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 8th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - Objectives. Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an event of global myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, which is associated with severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and fatal outcome. Evidence has demonstrated that mammalian hibernation is triggered by cyclic variation of a delta-opiate-like compound in endogenous serum, during which the myocardial metabolism is dramatically reduced and the myocardium tolerates the stress of ischemia and reperfusion without overt ischemic and reperfusion injury. Previous investigations also proved that the delta-opioid agonist elicited the cardioprotection in a model of regional ischemic intact heart or myocyte. Accordingly, we were prompted to search for an alternative intervention of pharmacologically induced myocardial hibernation that would result in rapid reductions of myocardial metabolism and therefore minimize the myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Design: Prospective, controlled laboratory study.
   Setting. University-affiliated research laboratory.
   Interventions, In the series of Studies performed in the established rat and pig model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the delta-opioid receptor agonist, pentazocine, was administered during ventricular fibrillation.
   Measurements and Main Results. The myocardial metabolism reflected by the concentration of lactate, or myocardial tissue PCO2 and PO2, is dramatically reduced during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These are associated with less severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and longer duration of postresuscitation survival.
   Conclusions. delta-Opioid-induced pharmacologic myocardial hibernation is an option to minimize the myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - A new method to detect ventricular fibrillation from CPR artifact-corrupted ECG based on the ECG alone
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB  - During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, chest compressions (CCs) introduce mechanical activity in the ECG and thus preclude a reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm diagnosis. To achieve a reliable rhythm analysis, chest compression must therefore be interrupted, and therefore, the probability of the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is adversely affected. In recent years, a number of algorithms have been developed to distinguish ventricular fibrillation (VF) rhythm from normal sinus rhythm (SR) without chest compression (CC) interruptions. However, the implementation of most of these algorithms relies on the acquisition of reference signals that are strongly correlated with CC artifacts and makes additional hardware alteration inevitable. In the present work, a novel method (the enhanced LMS method) that effectively suppresses CPR artifacts and can easily use the corrupted ECG signal alone is developed for the reliable detection of the VF rhythm during uninterrupted CCs. The enhanced LMS method was tested using mixtures of CC artifacts and real out-of-hospital ECG recordings for different corruption levels, and it was compared with other established algorithms that use the corrupted ECG signal alone, including the morphology consistency evaluation algorithm and the adaptive stop-band filtering algorithm. The validation results indicate that the enhanced LMS method has superior performance in VF/SR rhythm classification under different artifact interference levels. It is shown that the VF rhythm can be reliably detected using only the corrupted ECG alone. The novel method proposed in this study is promising for identification VF from SR with no hardware alterations for clinical cardiopulmonary resuscitation practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo fitness costs associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis RpoB mutation H526D
T2  - FUTURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aim: There is controversy regarding the potential fitness costs of rifampicin (RIF) resistance-conferring mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) rpoB gene. We characterized the pathogenicity of an Mtb RpoB H526D mutant. Materials & methods: A mutant containing the RpoB H526D mutation was isolated from wild-type Mtb grown on RIF-containing plates and complemented for determination of in vitro and in vivo fitness costs. Results: The RpoB H526D mutant showed reduced survival relative to control strains during progressive hypoxia and delayed growth following resuscitation from nutrient starvation (p < 0.05), which was associated with reduced expression of the resuscitation-promoting factor genes rpfB, rpfC and rpfE. Relative to the isogenic wild-type strain, the mutant showed significantly attenuated growth and long-term survival as well as reduced inflammation in mouse lungs. Conclusion & future perspective: Our data suggest that RpoB H526D mutation confers a fitness cost during growth-limiting conditions in vitro and in mouse lungs.

TI  - Future directions for resuscitation research .2. External cardiopulmonary resuscitation basic life support
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - In sudden cardiac deaths outside hospitals, the present performance of external cardiopulmonary resuscitation-basic life support (CPR-BLS), as a bridge to advanced life support (ALS) attempts for restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), still yields suboptimal results. Therefore, future education research should develop more effective, simpler and quicker ways to enable everyone to acquire the necessary BLS skills. Individualized self-training by lay persons is being revived. Although airway control and direct mouth-to-mouth ventilation skills are difficult to acquire, they must continue to be taught to the lay public and health professionals, primarily for use on relatives and friends where infection risk is not a problem, In children and trauma victims, steps A and B alone may be lifesavers, The best way to ventilate and oxygenate during the initiation of brief external CPR-BLS should be re-evaluated. There is a great difference between animals and humans in the behavior of the airway and thorax during coma, and thus in the need for added positive pressure ventilation, During chest compressions in humans, steps A and B are needed. Details deserve re-evaluation. The low perfusion pressures (borderline blood flows) produced by standard external CPR remain the most serious limitation of this method. In spite of extensive efforts so far, novel laboratory research to remedy this limitation is important for the development of more effective emergency artificial circulation. The results of such studies are greatly influenced by different details in animal models. Active compression-decompression (ACD) external CPR, also called 'push-pull' CPR, with a plunger-type device used by hand or a machine, and intermittent abdominal compression (IAC) external CPR are both promising modifications of standard external CPR. Both need further experimental and clinical clarification. For BLS, developing a more effective purely manual CPR-BLS method for help in rapid ROSC should be given high priority. Portable external CPR machines need improvements. They will serve for bridging ROSC-resistant cases through transport and ALS attempts, primarily by freeing the hands of health professionals for more effective sophisticated ALS measures.

TI  - The experiences of male sudden cardiac arrest survivors and their partners: a gender analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim. To explore how masculinities shape the experiences of men and their partners after survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Background. Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest report depression, dependence on others for daily functioning, decreased participation in society and significant decreases in quality of life. There is growing evidence that masculine gender identities play a central role in the recovery experiences of men and their families following other major cardiac events. However, to date, there has been no examination of how masculinities shape men's experiences of recovery following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Design. Interview study guided by an interpretive description approach. Data were subjected to thematic analysis.
   Method. A purposive sample of seven male sudden cardiac arrest survivors and 6 female partners was recruited in 2010 from a secondary care centre in British Columbia, Canada.
   Results. Three themes were prominent in the experiences of the participants: (1) Support and self-reliance; (2) Dealing with emotional (in) vulnerability; and (3) No longer a 'He-man'.
   Conclusion. Masculinities played a role in men's experiences of recovery and adaptation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Hegemonic masculinity partly explained men's experiences, notably their reluctance to seek professional support and reactions to changes in lifestyle. However, the study also suggests that the popular stereotype of men being 'strong and silent' in the face of ill-health may only be a part of a more complex story. Nurses would benefit from taking into consideration the potential influence of male gender identities on men's recovery postcardiac arrest.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of 6% hydroxyethyl starch in patients undergoing major surgery The randomised controlled PHOENICS trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is often used for maintaining vascular volume during major surgery. Long-term high-dose HES in septic patients promotes renal injury, whereas meta-analyses of current HES products in surgical patients do not show such effects. OBJECTIVE We studied if the peri-operative use of HES is noninferior to crystalloids in terms of acute kidney injury. Secondary outcome was the noninferiority of HES on worsening of renal injury and/or the incidence of a composite endpoint of major complications and mortality until postoperative day 90. DESIGN Randomised double-blind trial in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery with expected blood loss at least 500 ml. SETTING Multicentre trial at 53 study sites in 10 European countries. PATIENTS One thousand nine hundred and eighty-five (HES 977, crystalloid-only 981) patients aged 40 to 85 years with ASA status II-III. INTERVENTION Either 6% HES 130/0.4 or a crystalloid solution. Dosing was guided by mean arterial pressure and/or routine haemodynamic variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Change from pre-operative to lowest cystatin C-based eGFR during the first 3 postoperative days. Key secondary outcome was a composite endpoint of mortality and major postoperative complications after 90 days. RESULTS Mean change in eGFR from baseline to minimum was -3.4 +/- 17.7 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 in HES patients and -1.0 +/- 17.1 ml min-11.73 m-2 in crystalloid-only patients (P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The key secondary endpoint occurred in 35% of patients in each group. There were no clinically relevant differences in any safety endpoint including 90-day renal function. Any cause mortality-difference until the end of 1-year follow-up was not significantly different (8.6% in HES and 10.1% in crystalloid patients). CONCLUSION Peri-operative use of HES was noninferior to crystalloids in short-term renal function or a composite of mortality and major complications at 90 days. PHOENICS provides robust evidence that peri-operative in-label use of HES is well tolerated.

TI  - Septic shock: Past, present, and perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Septic shock remains one of the most severe complications of infection, defined by circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction and associated with persistently high mortality. The concept has evolved markedly, from early descriptions of "blood poisoning" to the recognition of sepsis as a systemic syndrome in the late 20th century. Consensus definitions and large clinical trials, including early goal-directed therapy, led to structured treatment bundles and the launch of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which have contributed to gradual improvements in survival. Current management emphasizes rapid recognition, timely antimicrobials, source control, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support, with norepinephrine as the first-line agent. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity among patients complicates decision-making, and debate continues around fluid thresholds, timing of vasopressor initiation, and the use of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids or immunomodulators. Looking ahead, precision medicine and emerging technologies promise to refine sepsis care. Machine learning and multi-omic approaches are improving risk prediction, enabling identification of sepsis subphenotypes, and guiding individualized treatment strategies. Bedside tools assessing microcirculatory function and rapid biomarker assays may further enhance prognostication and resuscitation. Effective implementation science and rigorous validation of these tools will be critical for translating innovation into improved outcomes. Septic shock management has advanced substantially, yet further progress requires not only personalization and innovation but also concerted efforts to reduce global disparities in access to timely diagnosis, evidencebased treatment, and long-term survivorship care.

TI  - Impact of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation of Donors on Days Alive and Out of Hospital after Orthotopic Heart Transplantation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTX) is increasing. Optimizing the use of all available donor hearts is crucial. While mortality seems not to be affected by donor cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the impact of donor CPR on days alive and out of hospital (DAOH) is unclear. Methods: This retrospective study included adults who underwent HTX at the University Hospital Duesseldorf, Germany from 2010-2020. Main exposure was donor-CPR. Secondary exposure was the length of CPR. The primary endpoint was DAOH at one year. Results: A total of 187 patients were screened and 171 patients remained for statistical analysis. One-year mortality was 18.7%. The median DAOH at one year was 295 days (interquartile range 206-322 days). Forty-two patients (24.6%) received donor-CPR hearts. The median length of CPR was 15 (9-21) minutes. There was no significant difference in DAOH between patients with donor-CPR hearts versus patients with no-CPR hearts (CPR: 291 days (211-318 days) vs. no-CPR: 295 days (215-324 days); p = 0.619). Multivariate linear regression revealed that there was no association between length of CPR and DAOH (unstandardized coefficients B: -0.06, standard error: 0.81, 95% CI -1.65-1.53, p = 0.943). Conclusions: Donor CPR status and length of CPR are not associated with reduced DAOH at one year after HTX.

TI  - The Sapienza University of Rome network of automated external defibrillators: a prototype webMap developed to speed access to community defibrillators and increase survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Italy, only around 10% of people who experience out-of -hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survive. A large portion of OHCA events in public settings are characterized by an initial shockable rhythm, which requires prompt defibrillation. We aimed to create a system to quickly locate nearby public access automated external defibrillators (AEDs) on the campus of Sapienza University of Rome, the largest public university in Europe.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the AED webMap through a 6-step process involving the: 1) collection of information and geo-graphical coordinates for each AED from the university management system; 2) development of a new geolocation database; 3) integration of information contained in the new database with data provided by university departments; 4) geo-location of AEDs in the Google MyMaps environment; 5) graphic representation of all AEDs on digital map templates using specific symbols, with pop-ups containing additional information for each AED; and 6) publication of the webMap on the university website.RESULTS: The AED webMap was published on the university website (https://www.uniro-ma1.it/it/pagina/defibrillatori-sapienza-in-rete) and facilitates prompt identification of nearby AEDs by providing: 1) detailed AED geolocalization with interactive pop-up information for each AED, including whether the AED is located internally or externally; 2) the option to use different base maps (e.g., digital street map); 3) calculation and display of the route to reach the chosen AED; and 4) the possibility to migrate towards multiple platforms.CONCLUSIONS: The webMap can help by-standers quickly identify, locate, and reach nearby AEDs present on the campus of the largest public university in Europe, a measure that could help speed defibrillation and maximize the life-saving potential of AEDs in the event of OHCA.

TI  - Functional mitral stenosis, atrial fibrillation and heart failure secondary to left atrial compression by the formation of a localised periatrial haematoma after cardiac resuscitation
T2  - KARDIOLOGIA POLSKA
AB  - A 53-year-old male patient was diagnosed with progressive dyspnoea after primary coronary intervention of circumflex lesion. Resuscitation was performed in the follow-up period due to the development of asystole. Control angiography showed patent stent without perforation signs and echocardiography revealed prominent compression of the left atrium by a periatrial mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for differential diagnosis. The MRI revealed an isolated periatrial haematoma compressing the left atrium and obliterating the mitral valve orifice. Haematoma formation had most probably occurred after resuscitation, since the initial echocardiogram was normal. After a one week follow-up, there had been no decrease in the size of the haematoma, and surgery was proposed. Left atrial compression by the formation of a periatrial haematoma related to resuscitation has not been reported before. It can cause atrial fibrillation and rapidly progressive heart failure. A more accurate diagnosis could be made using an MRI study.

TI  - Identification of jellyfish from Continuous Plankton Recorder samples
T2  - JELLYFISH BLOOMS: NEW PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
AB  - Previous analysis of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) long-term data set for the presence of 'coelenterate' tissue revealed changes in the frequency of jellyfish occurrence in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea; however, the identities of the jellyfish were unknown, causing uncertainty in interpreting these findings. To improve the utility of the 'coelenterate' data from the CPR, 62 CPR samples were selected for re-analysis from an area where the widespread occurrence of the holoplanktonic scyphomedusan, Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskal, 1775), was previously documented from net tows to test if the CPR sampled P. noctiluca. Examination of the samples revealed smears (<1 mm) of golden gelatinous tissue on the sampling mesh. Subsequent microscopic examination and measurement of nematocysts identified most of the smears as P. noctiluca. Indeed, P. noctiluca was identified on 53% of the CPR samples from the area that best coincided with the documented bloom area. Although hydrozoans were also identified in the samples, the characteristic golden colour of P. noctiluca and its distinct suite of nematocysts allowed identification to species level. The identification of other jellyfish may be more complicated due to the labour-intensive examination of samples and unclear delineation of nematocyst types when multiple similar species are present. Nevertheless, re-analysis of CPR samples holds great promise for identifying the underlying reason for increases in jellyfish occurrence in the CPR records.

TI  - Survival After Application of Automatic External Defibrillators Before Arrival of the Emergency Medical System Evaluation in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Population of 21 Million
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of contemporary automatic external defibrillator (AED) use.
   Background In the PAD (Public Access Defibrillation) trial, survival was doubled by focused training of lay volunteers to use an AED in high-risk public settings.
   Methods We performed a population-based cohort study of persons with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest before emergency medical system (EMS) arrival at Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) sites between December 2005 and May 2007. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between AED application and survival to hospital discharge.
   Results Of 13,769 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 4,403 (32.0%) received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation but had no AED applied before EMS arrival, and 289 (2.1%) had an AED applied before EMS arrival. The AED was applied by health care workers (32%), lay volunteers (35%), police (26%), or unknown (7%). Overall survival to hospital discharge was 7%. Survival was 9% (382 of 4,403) with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation but no AED, 24% (69 of 289) with AED application, and 38% (64 of 170) with AED shock delivered. In multivariable analyses adjusting for: 1) age and sex; 2) bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed; 3) location of arrest (public or private); 4) EMS response interval; 5) arrest witnessed; 6) initial shockable or not shockable rhythm; and 7) study site, AED application was associated with greater likelihood of survival (odds ratio: 1.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.23 to 2.50; p < 0.002). Extrapolating this greater survival from the ROC EMS population base (21 million) to the population of the U. S. and Canada (330 million), AED application by bystanders seems to save 474 lives/year.
   Conclusions Application of an AED in communities is associated with nearly a doubling of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These results reinforce the importance of strategically expanding community-based AED programs. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2010;55:1713-20) (C) 2010 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation

TI  - Cardiac arrest outcomes at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Shrine of Remembrance using a tiered response strategy - a forerunner to public access defibrillation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The provision of medical, paramedical and first aid services at major public events is an important concern for pre-hospital emergency medical care providers. Patient outcomes of a cardiac arrest :response strategy employed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and the Shrine of Remembrance by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers are reported. Twenty-eight consecutive events occurring between December 1989 and December 1997 have been analysed. Included are three cardiac arrests managed at ANZAC day parades utilising the same response strategy by the same unit. The incidence of cardiac arrest at the MCG was 1:500000 attendances. Of the 28 patients, 24 (86%) left the venue alive and 20 (71%) were discharged home from hospital. In all cases the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF). All 26 patients (93%) who were defibrillated by St John teams had this intervention within 5 min from the documented time of collapse. One patient in VF spontaneously reverted during CPR. Of the eight fatalities, four died at the scene. At major public venues and events, a co-ordinated emergency life support provision strategy, tailor made for the venue, is necessary for the delivery of prompt CPR, timely defibrillation and advanced life support.

AB  - Background Cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality, and outcomes after prolonged conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) are often poor. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), involving veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), offers a rescue strategy for refractory cardiac arrest by providing cardiopulmonary support to allow treatment of underlying causes. This case report illustrates the potential of ECPR in an unusually prolonged cardiac arrest.Case description We report a case of a 44-year-old man who experienced sudden prolonged cardiac arrest secondary to acute myocardial infarction and was successfully rescued with ECPR and VA-ECMO. The patient presented with 8 h of chest pain and went into ventricular fibrillation (VF) out of hospital; despite aggressive CCPR for approximately 155 min, return of spontaneous circulation was not achieved until ECPR was initiated. At 12:17 on the day of presentation, VA-ECMO was initiated in the emergency department after continuous CCPR. Subsequent coronary angiography revealed severe multivessel disease with critical proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis, which was successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) while the patient remained on ECMO support. The patient's post-arrest care included mechanical ventilation, targeted temperature management, inotropic and vasopressor support, antithrombotic therapy and aggressive neuroprotective measures. A large infarct in the left occipitotemporal lobe was identified on CT, but intensive care with hypothermia and sedation allowed the patient to survive with intact neurological function. ECMO was weaned off on day 9 of admission, and the patient was extubated on day 12. He subsequently made a full neurological recovery and was transferred out of the intensive care unit in stable condition.Conclusion This case illustrates that even extremely prolonged cardiac arrest can result in good outcomes when managed promptly with ECPR and comprehensive critical care. It highlights the potential of ECPR to improve survival and neurological outcomes after refractory cardiac arrest and underscores the importance of rapid ECMO deployment in selected patients.

TI  - Predictors of Survival and Favorable Functional Outcomes After an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients Systematically Brought to a Dedicated Heart Attack Center (from the Harefield Cardiac Arrest Study)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Despite advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), survival remains low after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). Acute coronary ischemia is the predominating precipitant, and prompt delivery of patients to dedicated facilities may improve outcomes. Since 2011, all patients experiencing OOHCA in London, where a cardiac etiology is suspected, are systematically brought to heart attack centers (HACs). We determined the predictors for survival and favorable functional outcomes in this setting. We analyzed 174 consecutive patients experiencing OOHCA from 2011 to 2013 brought to Harefield Hospital-a designated HAC in London. We analyzed (1) all-cause mortality and (2) functional status using a modified Rankin scale (mRS 0 to 6, where mRS0-3(+) = favorable functional status). The overall survival rates were 66.7% (30 days) and 62.1% (1 year); and 54.5% had mRS0-3(+) at discharge. Patients with mRS0-3(+) had reduced mortality compared to mRS0-3(-) : 30 days (1.2% vs 72.2%, p<0.001) and 1 year (5.3% vs 77.2%, p<0.001). Multivariate analyses identified lower patient comorbidity, absence of cardiogenic shock, bystander CPR, ventricular tachycardia/ventricullar fibrillation as initial rhythm, shorter duration of resuscitation, prehospital advanced airway, absence of adrenaline and inotrope use, and intra-aortic balloon pump use as predictors of mRS0-3(+). Consistent predictors of increased mortality were the presence of cardiogenic shock, advanced airway use, increased duration of resuscitation, and absence of therapeutic hypothermia. A streamlined delivery of patients experiencing OOHCA to dedicated facilities is associated with improved functional status and survival. Our study supports the standardization of care for such patients with the widespread adoption of HACs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism and the development of chronic critical illness after surgery
T2  - SURGERY
AB  - As early as the 1990s, chronic critical illness, a distinct syndrome of persistent high-acuity illness requiring management in the ICU, was reported under a variety of descriptive terms including the "neuropathy of critical illness," "myopathy of critical illness," "ICU-acquired weakness," and most recently "post-intensive care unit syndrome." The widespread implementation of targeted shock resuscitation, improved organ support modalities, and evidence-based protocolized ICU care has resulted in significantly decreased in-hospital mortality within surgical ICUs, specifically by reducing early multiple organ failure deaths. However, a new phenotype of multiple organ failure has now emerged with persistent but manageable organ dysfunction, high resource utilization, and discharge to prolonged care facilities. This new multiple organ failure phenotype is now clinically associated with the rapidly increasing incidence of chronic critical illness in critically ill surgery patients. Although the underlying pathophysiology driving chronic critical illness remains incompletely described, the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome has been proposed as a mechanistic framework in which to explain the increased incidence of chronic critical illness in surgical ICUs. The purpose of this review is to provide a historic perspective of the epidemiologic evolution of multiple organ failure into persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome; describe the mechanism that drives and sustains chronic critical illness, and review the long-term outcomes of surgical patients who develop chronic critical illness.

TI  - MEDICAL-TREATMENT PREFERENCES OF NURSING-HOME RESIDENTS - RELATIONSHIP TO FUNCTION AND CONCORDANCE WITH SURROGATE DECISION-MAKERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To describe treatment preferences of nursing home residents, concordance with decisions by self-selected proxies and to establish the relationship of sociodemographic and functional measures to decisions.
   Setting and Subjects: 52 patient-proxy pairs at a Veterans Affairs nursing home.
   Methods: Treatment preferences were elicited from residents and proxies regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit care. Hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluid administration, and tube feeding were presented in three separate health scenarios. Concordance was determined for the entire interview and separately for each scenario. Treatment-seeking intensity and decision-making consistency were scored and used to explore associations with sociodemographic variables and function.
   Results: Subjects were predominantly male (97%) and non-Hispanic white (74%); average age was 70 +/- 12 years, with 4 +/- 2.9 diagnoses. Residents accepted 70% of all treatments. The proportion of subjects accepting interventions declined parallel to health status in each scenario. Only 7/52 (13%) subjects made inconsistent decisions. Resident treatment acceptance was inversely associated with GDS scores but not associated with any other sociodemographic or functional measure. Concordance with proxies was no greater than chance. Proxies' decisions were not systematically biased against resident preferences or influenced by patient characteristics.
   Conclusions: Veterans desired most treatments, but adjusted preferences according to health status and were not inconsistent. Depressive symptoms should be addressed prior to advance directive selection. The patient remains the best source of information, but proxies' decisions exhibit no bias and are not affected by patient status.

TI  - Improving Survival From Cardiac Arrest: A Review of Contemporary Practice and Challenges
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiac arrest is a common and lethal condition frequently encountered by emergency medicine providers. Resuscitation of persons after cardiac arrest remains challenging, and outcomes remain poor overall. Successful resuscitation hinges on timely, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The optimal method of providing chest compressions and ventilator support during cardiac arrest remains uncertain. Prompt and effective defibrillation of ventricular arrhythmias is one of the few effective therapies available for treatment of cardiac arrest. Despite numerous studies during several decades, no specific drug delivered during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact survival after cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal circulation can rescue a minority of highly selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest. Current management of pulseless electrical activity is associated with poor outcomes, but it is hoped that a more targeted diagnostic approach based on electrocardiography and bedside cardiac ultrasonography may improve survival. The evolution of postresuscitation care appears to have improved cardiac arrest outcomes in patients who are successfully resuscitated. The initial approach to early stabilization includes standard measures, such as support of pulmonary function, hemodynamic stabilization, and rapid diagnostic assessment. Coronary angiography is often indicated because of the high frequency of unstable coronary artery disease in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and should be performed early after resuscitation. Optimizing and standardizing our current approach to cardiac arrest resuscitation and postresuscitation care will be essential for developing strategies for improving survival after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Antenatal counselling for parents facing an extremely preterm birth: limitations of the medical evidence
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - When physicians are asked for a consult for women in premature labour, they face a complex set of challenges. Policy statements recommend that women be given detailed information about the risks of various outcomes, including death, long-term disability and various specific neonatal problems. Both personal narratives and studies suggest that parents also base their decisions on factors other than the probabilistic facts about expected outcomes. Statistics are difficult to understand at any time. Rational decision-making may be difficult when taking life-and-death decisions. Furthermore, the role of emotions is not discussed in peri-viability guidelines. Conclusion: We argue against trying to tell parents every fact that we think might be relevant to their decision. This may be overwhelming for many parents. Instead, doctors should try to discern, on a case-by-case basis, what particular parents want and need. Information and delivery of information should be personalized. Unfortunately, evidence in this area is limited.

TI  - Saving a Life After Discharge: CPR Training for Parents of High-Risk Children
T2  - JOURNAL FOR HEALTHCARE QUALITY
AB  - Pediatric patients with chronic disease are at risk for cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Outcomes of CPA are improved if prompt quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is performed. This study examined the efficacy of the CPR Anytime (TM) Kit as a standardized method of CPR discharge training to families of high-risk children. The kit was provided to parents of 117 high-risk pediatric patients prior to hospital discharge. A telephone survey was used at 1, 3, and 6 months to assess retention of CPR knowledge and skills, parental comfort levels with CPR, and kit dissemination to family members. A second survey was used 1 year after implementation of program to assess nursing satisfaction. CPR comfort levels were reported as confident, knowledge and skills were reported as moderate on follow-up telephone surveys. A total of 82% of subjects reviewed the video at least once after discharge, and 79% of subjects shared the kit with at least two other family members or friends. A total of 72 of 74 nurses (97%) surveyed were either "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the program. Provision of the CPR Anytime Kit (TM) to families of high-risk pediatric patients prior to discharge leads to sustained levels of CPR knowledge and confidence.

TI  - Post-resuscitation haemodynamics in a novel acute myocardial infarction cardiac arrest model in the pig
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Background and objectives: Although a considerable amount of promising experimental research has been performed on cardiopulmonary resuscitation, clinical data indicate an ongoing limited outcome in human beings. One reason for this discrepancy could be that experimental studies use healthy animals whereas most human beings undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation suffer from acute or chronic myocardial dysfunction. To overcome this problem, we sought to develop a new model of myocardial infarction, that is easy to perform in all kind of laboratories and compromises on the myocardial function significantly.
   Methods: Following approval by the local authorities, 14 domestic pigs were instrumented for measurement of arterial, central venous, left atrial and left ventricular pressures. Myocardial infarction was induced in eight pigs by clipping the circumflex artery close to its origin from the left coronary artery (infarction group; n = 8). Six animals (no infarction group, n = 6) served as no-Infarct controls. Following a 4-min period of cardiac arrest, internal cardiac massage was performed in these two groups, and haemodynamics were recorded during the first 30 min of reperfusion.
   Results: All animals were resuscitated successfully. Compared to the no-infarction group, the infarction group showed significantly decreased myocardial contractility, coronary perfusion pressure and cardiac index (30 min after restoration of spontaneous circulation: infarction group: 57 +/- 7 and 89 +/- 19 mLmin (-1) kg(-1) in the no-infarction group; mean +/- SD; P < 0.05) during reperfusion. Two animals from the infarction group (25%), but none of the animals in the no-infarction group, died during the reperfusion period.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrate that clipping of the circumflex artery leads to a reduced myocardial performance after successful resuscitation, whereas the rate of restoration of spontaneous circulation is not reduced. Therefore, this set-up provides a reproducible model for future studies of post-resuscitation haemodynamics and treatment.

T2  - ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - Objectives: To analyze the incidence and causes of ICD therapies in children and young adults and verify their impact on the quality of life (QoL).
   Methods: From March/1977 to February/2006, 29 patients (15.7 +/- 5.4 years old) were submitted to ICD implants. Aborted cardiac arrest (41.5%), sustained ventricular tachycardia (27.6%) and primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death (30.9%) indicated device therapy The number of therapies was evaluated by interviewing patients and by ICD diagnostic data. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure the QoL and the results were compared to healthy population. The expectative of freedom from ICD therapies were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results: After 2.6 +/- 1.8 years follow-up, 8 (27.6%) patients received 741 appropriate ICD shocks due to ventricular tachycardia (6) or ventricular fibrillation (2), and 11 (37.9%) patients received 152 inappropriate ICD shocks due to supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (8) or oversensing (3). Expectative of freedom from appropriate shocks was 74.2 +/- 9.0% and 66.7 +/- 10.7% after one and three years, respectively. Compared to healthy population, QoL decreased in physical function (61.7 +/- 28.7), vitality (64.7 +/- 19.1), mental health (65.9 +/- 22.7) and role-emotional domains (66.7 +/- 38.5). All patients referred fear and concern related to ICD use.
   Conclusion: Despite the efficacy of ICD therapies, the high incidence of appropriate and inappropriate shocks interfered in patients' QoL and adaptation to the device.

T2  - ACTA PEDIATRICA DE MEXICO
AB  - Burns in children and adults exhibit pathophysiological differences derived from the anatomical and physiological characteristics of each age group, which is why burns are serious and require immediate medical attention. Calculating accurate total burned area is crucial, however, current methods such as the Lund and Browder table, the rule of nine, or two-dimensional plots are subject to inter-rater variation and severely overestimate the burned area. An inaccurate estimate of the extent of the burn generates unnecessary transfers to burn centers, fluid overload, increased hospital stays, and medium and long-term sequelae. To address these challenges, a series of applications for mobile phones and artificial intelligence have been evaluated, as well as the implementation of virtual reality, the use of skin substitutes and bioactive therapies that allow reducing costs in the hospital area. The development and implementation of therapeutic tools exemplifies how medicine is evolving; however, it is important to highlight the need to extend research in this field to optimize prognosis and quality of life.

TI  - Low-energy biphasic waveform defibrillation reduces the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 5th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - Both clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated substantial impairment of ventricular function after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Indeed, postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction has been implicated as a potentially important mechanism, accounting for fatal outcomes after successful resuscitation in 70% of victims within the first 72 hrs, Recent experimental studies implicated the total electrical energy delivered during defibrillation as an important correlate with the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and postresuscitation survival. This prompted us to investigate the option of using lower electrical energy biphasic waveform defibrillation. We compared the effects of low-energy biphasic waveform defibrillation with conventional monophasic waveform defibrillation after a short (4 mins), intermediate (7 mins), or prolonged (10 mins) interval of untreated ventricular fibrillation, Biphasic waveform defibrillation with a fixed energy of 150 joules proved to be as effective as conventional monophasic damped sine waveform defibrillation for restoration of spontaneous circulation, with significantly lower delivered energy. This was associated with significantly less severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, The low-energy biphasic waveform defibrillation is, therefore, likely to be the future direction of transthoracic defibrillation in settings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - Modern surgical treatment of massive pulmonary embolism: Results in 47 consecutive patients after rapid diagnosis and aggressive surgical approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
CP  - 30th Annual Meeting of the Western-Thoracic-Surgical-Association
AB  - Objectives: This study retrospectively reviews an aggressive multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism, centering on rapid diagnosis with contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest to define the location and degree of clot burden and transthoracic echocardiography to document right ventricular strain followed by immediate surgical intervention when appropriate.
   Methods: Between October 1999 through February 2004, 47 patients (30 men and 17 women; median age, 58 years; age range, 24-86 years) underwent emergency surgical embolectomy for massive central pulmonary embolism. The indications for surgical intervention were (1) contraindications to thrombolysis (21/47 [45%]), (2) failed medical treatment (5/47 [10%]), and (3) right ventricular dysfunction (15/47 [32%]). Preoperatively, 12 (26%) of 47 patients were in cardiogenic shock, and 6 (11%) of 47 were in cardiac arrest.
   Results: There were 3 (6%) operative deaths, 2 with preoperative cardiac arrest; 2 of these 3 patients required a right ventricular assist device. In 38 (81%) patients a caval filter was placed intraoperatively. Median length of stay was 11 days (range, 3-75 days). Median follow-up was 27 months (range, 2-50 months); follow-up was 100% complete in surviving patients. There were 6 (12%) late deaths, 5 of which were from metastatic cancer. Actuarial survival at 1 and 3 years' follow-up was 86% and 83%, respectively.
   Conclusion: An aggressive approach to large pulmonary embolus, including rapid diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention, has improved results with surgical embolectomy. We now perform surgical pulmonary embolectomy not only in patients with large central clot burden and hemodynamic compromise but also in hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction documented by means of echocardiography.

TI  - The first year after successful cardiac resuscitation: Function, activity, participation and quality of life
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To assess cognitive function, activities of daily living (ADL) and living situation longitudinally up to 1 year after cardiac arrest. Setting: University hospital.
   Materials: The study continued for 3 years and consecutive patients (18-75 years of age) who survived resuscitation were included.
   Method: A longitudinal study with examinations using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale for assessing brain damage, along with the Mini Mental State Examination. To assess ADL, we used the Functional Independence Measure and the Instrumental Activity Measure. Life satisfaction was assessed, together with health-related quality of life. Social status and vocational status were recorded.
   Results: Mortality was high during the first 90 days (31%). After discharge, not much improvement was seen in cognitive function. This was reflected in reduced dependency in ADL. Work capacity at I year was only 13%. The health related quality of life showed great improvement during the first year, being almost the same as for Swedish reference values.
   Conclusions: Most of the improvement resulting in the independence of ADL occurred during the first 45 days. It is important to give the next of kin information about the patient's progress and need for assistance in order to enable them to plan for the future before discharge.

TI  - Cardiac critical care: what really makes a difference
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe sustained decline in mortality following congenital heart surgery, while important, also has resulted in an emerging focus upon the use of processes and technological developments to reduce early postoperative morbidity. We summarize here recent efforts within the field of pediatric cardiac intensive care to optimize outcomes associated with the perioperative management of the child with congenital heart disease.
   Recent findingsGoal-directed and protocol-driven therapy targeting optimization of oxygen delivery improves outcomes in the management of many populations of critically ill patients, and is now increasingly used following congenital heart surgery with a low associated incidence of organ failure and favorable early survival. Restrictive blood product transfusion practices following congenital heart surgery are showing promise in reducing donor exposures and transfusion-associated morbidities without a resulting increase in end organ dysfunction. Technological developments are affording noninvasive opportunities for earlier recognition and intervention in the deteriorating child, while also providing means for support of the failing myocardium, both in an acute setting during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and among patients with end-stage heart failure requiring longer-term mechanical circulatory support.
   SummaryMulti-institutional, prospective evaluation of perioperative management practices, along with patient-specific, integrated electronic health information, provides unique opportunities for investigators to identify and test both processes and technological tools in confronting the most challenging aspects of early postoperative management following congenital heart surgery.

TI  - Ethical issues for parents of extremely premature infants
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
AB  - Evidence suggests that NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) parents with an baby born at the threshold of viability do not always receive sufficient counselling during an emergency admission and as a consequence, are not well-informed to accept withdrawal of treatment or quality of life decisions. As prospective parents are not educated earlier in pregnancy about extreme premature delivery, crucial information and counselling explaining neonatal issues is only offered to labouring women during their emergency admission. As a result, most have difficulty understanding the risks and benefits of baby's treatment and therefore rely heavily on the perinatal physician to take responsibility for the initial treatment. However, this lack of understanding often leaves parents disadvantaged, as many are left unprepared to participate objectively in quality of life decisions. According to recent research, morbidity figures remain relatively high with one in five survivors at risk of a long-term disability. This shows that some parents will still be confronted by ethical decision of whether or not to continue treatment, and this may not be apparent until days after treatment has been established. As recent research has shown, parents do, in fact, want increased involvement in the decision-making process regarding their child's treatment. Therefore, it has been argued, that parents should be provided with information earlier in pregnancy to familiarise themselves with quality of life issues which they may encounter as the NICU parents of an extremely premature infant.

TI  - Protective positive psychology factors and emotional distress after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: There is a critical need to identify factors that can prevent emotional distress post-cardiac arrest (CA). CA survivors have previously described benefitting from utilizing positive psychology constructs (mindfulness, existential well-being, resilient coping, social support) to cope with distress. Here, we explored associations between positive psychology factors and emotional distress post-CA.Methods: We recruited CA survivors treated from 4/2021-9/2022 at a single academic medical center. We assessed positive psychology factors (mindfulness [Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised], existential well-being [Meaning in Life Questionnaire Presence of Meaning sub -scale], resilient coping [Brief Resilient Coping Scale], perceived social support [ENRICHD Social Support Inventory]) and emotional distress (post -traumatic stress [Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-5], anxiety and depression symptoms [PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a]) just before discharge from the index hospitalization. We selected covariates for inclusion in our multivariable models based on an asso-ciation with any emotional distress factor (p < 0.10). For our final, multivariable regression models, we individually tested the independent association of each positive psychology factor and emotional distress factor.Results: We included 110 survivors (mean age 59 years, 64% male, 88% non-Hispanic White, 48% low income); 36.4% of survivors scored above the cut-off for at least one measure of emotional distress. In separate adjusted models, each positive psychology factor was independently asso-ciated with emotional distress (b:-0.20 to-0.42, all p < 0.05).Conclusions: Higher levels of mindfulness, existential well-being, resilient coping, and perceived social support were each associated with less emotional distress. Future intervention development studies should consider these factors as potential treatment targets.

TI  - Automated cardiac arrest detection and emergency service alerting using device-independent smartwatch technology: proof-of-principle
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality. Automated detection could improve survival by reducing delays in first responder activation. This study provides proof-of-principle for a device-independent technology that can (A) distinguish presence versus absence of spontaneous circulation, and (B) reliably alert emergency medical services (EMS). Methods: Circulatory arrest data were collected from three groups: (1) volunteers undergoing temporarily restricted blood flow to the arm using a cuff, (2) patients undergoing cardioplegic cardiac arrest for heart surgery, and (3) domestic swine, slaughtered in food industry. Data were collected using Samsung Watch5 and Watch5 Pro. An algorithm was developed to analyze photoplethysmography signals and detect circulatory arrest. Emergency response was tested via the Dutch community first responder network HartslagNu, using their test environment to activate test responResults: Nineteen participants were analyzed. Across all three groups, 28 of 31 circulatory arrests were correctly identified, sensitivity 90.3% (95% CI: 74.2%-98.0%), and hour-level specificity was 94.1% (95% CI: 71.3%-99.9%). Triggering a circulatory arrest consistently resulted in an audiovisual smartwatch alarm and an instantaneous alert to the virtual EMS at the HartslagNu test server. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting circulatory arrest using commercially available smartwatch sensors, achieving high sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, we integrated an automated alerting system with emergency networks to notify first responders. While this technology shows promise to improve survival, higher specificity is needed to prevent overburdening EMS. Future research should focus on real-world validation using actual cardiac arrest data.

TI  - Epinephrine and vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Epinephrine (adrenaline) and vasopressin have been by far the most commonly studied vasopressors in experimental cardiac arrest. Despite animal experimental studies suggesting improved outcomes in experimental cardiac arrest, clinical trials of pressor agents have failed to show clear cut benefit from either vasopressin or epinephrine, although few, if any, trials compared pressor agents to a placebo. The action of vasopressors in the heart, particularly beta(1)-Adrenergic stimulation, is associated with adverse cardiac effects including post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, worsening ventricular arrhythmias, and increasing myocardial oxygen consumption- alpha(2)-Adrenergic agonists, in experimental studies, show great promise in improving outcomes in experimental cardiac arrest, but have not been studied in humans. The combination of epinephrine and vasopressin may be effective, but has been incompletely studied. Clinical trials of vasopressor agents, which minimize direct myocardial effects are needed.

TI  - Different resuscitation strategies and novel pharmacologic treatment with valproic acid in traumatic brain injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in young adults, and effective treatment strategies have the potential to save many lives. TBI results in coagulopathy, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, cell death, and impaired epigenetic homeostasis, ultimately leading to morbidity and/or mortality. Commonly used resuscitation fluids such as crystalloids or colloids have several disadvantages and might even be harmful when administered in large quantities. There is a need for next-generation treatment strategies (especially in the prehospital setting) that minimize cellular damage, improve survival, and enhance neurological recovery. Pharmacologic treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid, has shown promising results in animal studies of TBI and may therefore be an excellent example of next-generation therapy. This review briefly describes traditional resuscitation strategies for TBI combined with hemorrhagic shock and describes preclinical studies on valproic acid as a new pharmacologic agent in the treatment of TBI. It finally discusses limitations and future directions on the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors for the treatment of TBI.

TI  - Trauma-induced coagulopathy
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS DISEASE PRIMERS
AB  - Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a major preventable cause of death in patients with traumatic injury. Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) describes abnormal coagulation processes that are attributable to trauma. In the early hours of TIC development, hypocoagulability is typically present, resulting in bleeding, whereas later TIC is characterized by a hypercoagulable state associated with venous thromboembolism and multiple organ failure. Several pathophysiological mechanisms underlie TIC; tissue injury and shock synergistically provoke endothelial, immune system, platelet and clotting activation, which are accentuated by the 'lethal triad' (coagulopathy, hypothermia and acidosis). Traumatic brain injury also has a distinct role in TIC. Haemostatic abnormalities include fibrinogen depletion, inadequate thrombin generation, impaired platelet function and dysregulated fibrinolysis. Laboratory diagnosis is based on coagulation abnormalities detected by conventional or viscoelastic haemostatic assays; however, it does not always match the clinical condition. Management priorities are stopping blood loss and reversing shock by restoring circulating blood volume, to prevent or reduce the risk of worsening TIC. Various blood products can be used in resuscitation; however, there is no international agreement on the optimal composition of transfusion components. Tranexamic acid is used in pre-hospital settings selectively in the USA and more widely in Europe and other locations. Survivors of TIC experience high rates of morbidity, which affects short-term and long-term quality of life and functional outcome.
   Trauma-induced coagulopathy describes alterations in haemostasis (such as fibrinogen depletion, inadequate thrombin generation, impaired platelet function and dysregulated fibrinolysis) that can result in both uncontrolled bleeding and hypercoagulation, leading to venous thromboembolism and multiple organ failure.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF ARRHYTHMIAS IN HEART-FAILURE
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Vasodilator therapy is prolonging life in patients with dilated heart failure, but 20% to 80% of deaths are sudden and unexpected. Sudden death may be due to myocardial ischemia, primary ventricular arrhythmias, primary bradyarrhythmias, drug- or electrolyte-induced arrhythmias, or arterial emboli. Cardiac arrest survivors require careful evaluation and therapy. Patients with cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischemia should be considered for coronary artery bypass surgery. Automatic implantable defibrillators should be considered for survivors of cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.  However, the long-term mortality and risk for sudden death in cardiac arrest survivors with heart failure is substantially worse than in those with well-preserved ventricular function. For patients who have not suffered spontaneous arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is generally avoided because of the risks of proarrhythmias and negative inotropic effects. Programmed electric stimulation and signal-averaged electrocardiography may identify postinfarction patients at greater risk for ventricular tachycardia, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy is beneficial or deleterious to these patients is unknown.  In post-myocardial infarction patients who require antiarrhythmic therapy, amiodarone or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs appear safe, although they have not been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced heart failure. Electrophysiologic testing is not useful for screening nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients and the impact of antiarrhythmic drug therapy on these patients has not been established. Atrial fibrillation is common in heart failure and is associated with an increased risk of emboli. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates can aggravate heart failure, and better rate control may be followed by improvement in ventricular function. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs may increase mortality in heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation, but the use of amiodarone appears promising.

TI  - Review What are the care needs of families experiencing cardiac arrest?: A survivor and family led scoping review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest of a family member can be a grief-filled and life-altering event. Every year many hundreds of thousands of families experience the cardiac arrest of a family member. However, care of the family during the cardiac arrest and afteris poorly understood and incompletely described. This review has been performed with persons with lived experience of cardiac arrest to describe, "What are the needs of families experiencing cardiac arrest?" from the moment of collapse until the outcome is known. Methods: This review was guided by specific methodological framework and reporting items (PRISMA-ScR) as well as best practices in patient and public involvement in research and reporting (GRIPP2). A search strategy was developed for eight online databases and a grey literature review. Two reviewers independently assessed all articles for inclusion and extracted relevant study information. Results: We included 47 articles examining the experience and care needs of families experiencing cardiac arrest of a family member. Forty one articles were analysed as six represented duplicate data. Ten family care need themes were identified across five domains. The domains and themes transcended cardiac arrest setting, aetiology, family-member age and family composition. The five domains were i) focus on the family member in cardiac arrest, ii) collaboration of the resuscitation team and family, iii) consideration of family context, iv) family post-resuscitation needs, and v) dedicated policies and procedures. We propose a conceptual model of family centred cardiac arrest. Conclusion: Our review provides a comprehensive mapping and description of the experience of families and their care needs during the cardiac arrest of a family-member. Furthermore, our review was conducted with co-investigators and collaborators with lived experience of cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and non-survivors alike). The conceptual framework of family centred cardiac arrest care presented may aid resuscitation scientists and providers in adopting greater family centeredness to their work.

TI  - External Validation of Deep Learning-Based Cardiac Arrest Risk Management System for Predicting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients Admitted to General Wards Based on Rapid Response System Operating and Nonoperating Periods: A Single-Center Study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES:The limitations of current early warning scores have prompted the development of deep learning-based systems, such as deep learning-based cardiac arrest risk management systems (DeepCARS). Unfortunately, in South Korea, only two institutions operate 24-hour Rapid Response System (RRS), whereas most hospitals have part-time or no RRS coverage at all. This study validated the predictive performance of DeepCARS during RRS operation and nonoperation periods and explored its potential beyond RRS operating hours.DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study.SETTING:In this 1-year retrospective study conducted at Yonsei University Health System Severance Hospital in South Korea, DeepCARS was compared with conventional early warning systems for predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). The study focused on adult patients admitted to the general ward, with the primary outcome being IHCA-prediction performance within 24 hours of the alarm.PATIENTS:We analyzed the data records of adult patients admitted to a general ward from September 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020.INTERVENTIONS:None.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:Performance evaluation was conducted separately for the operational and nonoperational periods of the RRS, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as the metric. DeepCARS demonstrated a superior AUROC as compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), both during RRS operating and nonoperating hours. Although the MEWS and NEWS exhibited varying performance across the two periods, DeepCARS showed consistent performance.CONCLUSIONS:The accuracy and efficiency for predicting IHCA of DeepCARS were superior to that of conventional methods, regardless of whether the RRS was in operation. These findings emphasize that DeepCARS is an effective screening tool suitable for hospitals with full-time RRS, part-time RRS, and even those without any RRS.

TI  - Vigorous Exercise in Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
T2  - CURRENT SPORTS MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Recent evidence displaying relative safety with participation in higher levels of exercise in young HCM patients has begun to shift the clinical framework for exercise recommendations in this population to favor a shared decision-making approach, allowing patients to participate in long-term health-promoting exercise activities.
   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic heart condition occurring in up to 1 in 200 patients in the United States, many of whom are young and otherwise healthy. This condition puts those affected at increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes, including sudden cardiac arrest and death, with particular concern for this to occur during exercise and other forms of exertion. Recent studies aimed at evaluating the risk of exercise in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients have suggested that moderate and even vigorous exercise may be safe for certain patients. Clinical guidelines are changing to reflect this recent information and to encourage a shared decision-making approach, which can allow more hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients to participate in health-promoting exercise activities.

TI  - Parent-reported health outcomes at preschool age in preterm survivors: a population-based cohort study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD-FETAL AND NEONATAL EDITION
AB  - Objective Literature on health status (HS) and health-related quality of life of preterm survivors at preschool age is sparse. Further, little is known about the relationship between parent-reported HS outcomes and standardised neurodevelopmental outcomes measured in preterm survivors at preschool age. Our objective was to evaluate parent-reported child HS outcomes and their relationship to neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months of age in very preterm survivors.Design Prospective population-based cohort study.Setting Perinatal follow-up programme.Patients Infants <31 weeks' gestational age born from 2014 to 2016.Outcome measures Parents completed the Health Status Classification System for Pre-School Children questionnaire at 36 months. At the same age, neurodevelopmental assessments were completed to determine neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). NDI was categorised as none, 'mild' or 'significant' (moderate or severe cerebral palsy, Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition <70, blind or required hearing aid).Results Of 118 children, 87 (73.7%) parents reported their child had an HS concern (mild: 61 (51%); moderate: 16 (13.6%); and severe: 10 (8.5%)). Mild and significant NDIs were observed in 17 (14.4%) and 14 (11.9%) children, respectively. For the 14 (12%) children with significant NDI, 7 (50.0%) parents reported severe and 4 (28.6%) reported moderate concerns. Conversely, for 26 (22%) children with parent-reported moderate to severe concerns, 11 (42.3%) met the criteria for significant NDI. There was a moderate positive correlation between parental concern and NDI status (Spearman correlation=0.46, p<0.0001).Conclusions Parental HS concerns only moderately correlated with the NDI status. Of the 12% of children with significant NDI, only half of the parents reported severe HS concerns.

TI  - MicroRNA-9-3p: a novel predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest 
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Aims Resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients who remain comatose after hospital arrival are at high risk of mortality due to anoxic brain injury. MicroRNA are small-non-coding RNA molecules ultimately involved in gene-silencing. They show promise as biomarkers, as they are stable in body fluids. The microRNA 9-3p (miR-9-3p) is associated with neurological injury in trauma and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Methods and results This post hoc analysis considered all 171 comatose OHCA patients from a single centre in the target temperature management (TTM) trial. Patients were randomized to TTM at either 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C for 24 h. MicroRNA-9-3p (miR-9-3p) was measured in plasma sampled at admission and at 28, 48, and 72 h. There were no significant differences in age, gender, and pre-hospital data, including lactate level at admission, between miR-9-3p level quartiles. miR-9-3p levels changed markedly following OHCA with a peak at 48 h. Median miR-9-3p levels between TTM 33 degrees C vs. 36 degrees C were not different at any of the four time points. Elevated miR-9-3p levels at 48 h were strongly associated with an unfavourable neurological outcome [OR: 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64-3.15, P < 0.0001). MiR-9-3p was inferior to neuron-specific enolase in predicting functional neurological outcome [area under the curve: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.87) vs. 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97)]. Conclusion MiR-9-3p is strongly associated with neurological outcome following OHCA, and the levels of miR-9-3p are peaking 48 hours following cardiac arrest.

TI  - Use of High-Fidelity Simulation as an Adjunct to Basic Life Support Training To Promote Team-Based Resuscitation Skills: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction The 2020 American Heart Association's (AHA) Basic Life Support (BLS) curriculum focuses on cardiac arrest resuscitation with one or two rescuers, providing only limited opportunities to develop higher-level skills such as leadership, communication, and debriefing. This mixed-methods pilot study evaluated whether supplementing the traditional Heartcode BLS course with a high-fidelity teamwork simulation session improved mastery of these higher-level skills. Methods Twenty-four first-year medical students completed the pilot training during sessions offered in February and May of 2023. The program included the traditional AHA Heartcode BLS course, which ranges from two to four hours, and includes both online and in -person skills components. This was followed by a 90 -minute high-fidelity simulation session consisting of two simulated resuscitations separated by a student -led plus/delta debriefing. Facilitators then debriefed the entire activity. Students completed an anonymous online survey that used a 0-10 slider scale to attribute their perceived proficiency for specific skills to the initial BLS course or the teamwork simulations and provided qualitative feedback. Results Twenty-one students (87.5%) completed the follow-up survey. Students credited their proficiency in technical skills (e.g., "Chest Compressions") to both sessions equally, but proficiency in higher-level skills, such as leadership, communication, and teamwork, was predominantly credited to the simulation. Additionally, students reported that the teamwork simulation promoted realism and increased self-efficacy. Conclusion Team -based resuscitation simulations using high-fidelity equipment augmented the AHA BLS course by promoting perceived competence in team dynamics domains and increasing students' self-efficacy for participating in real hospital -based resuscitations. Studies with larger sample sizes and objective data should be performed, and the use of similar resuscitation simulations or the development of a formal teambased BLS certification course should be considered.

CP  - 38th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Behavior-Therapy
AB  - Epidemiological data from treatment and community samples of individuals with substance use disorders indicate that the rates of co-occurring psychiatric disorders are high and that these disorders are associated with poor treatment adherence and outcomes. A growing body of research indicates that continuing care adherence interventions positively impact treatment outcome. However, it is unclear whether these interventions are effective for individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders. This paper explores this question with data from 150 participants who were randomized to receive a behavioral continuing care adherence intervention involving contracting, prompting and reinforcing attendance (CPR), or standard treatment. Fifty-one percent of the participants had one or more co-occurring Axis I or Axis II psychiatric disorders in addition to a SUD diagnosis. Among individuals with co-occurring disorders, those who received the CPR intervention show increased duration of treatment and improved 1-year abstinence rates compared to those who received STX. Additionally, effects of the CPR intervention were generally more pronounced among persons with co-occurring Axis I and/or Axis II disorders than those without these disorders. Treatment implications are discussed. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Photobiomodulation for Global Cerebral Ischemia: Targeting Mitochondrial Dynamics and Functions
T2  - MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Hypothermia is currently the only approved therapy for global cerebral ischemia (GCI) after cardiac arrest; however, it unfortunately has multiple adverse effects. As a noninvasive procedure, photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy has emerged as a potential novel treatment for brain injury. PBM involves the use of low-level laser light therapy to influence cell behavior. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of PBM treatment with an 808-nm diode laser initiated 6h after GCI. It was noted that PBM dose-dependently protected against GCI-induced neuronal death in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 subregion. Functional assessments demonstrated that PBM markedly preserved both short-term (a week) and long-term (6months) spatial learning and memory function following GCI. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PBM post-treatment (a) preserved healthy mitochondrial dynamics and suppressed substantial mitochondrial fragmentation of CA1 neurons, by reducing the detrimental Drp1 GTPase activity and its interactions with adaptor proteins Mff and Fis1 and by balancing mitochondrial targeting fission and fusion protein levels; (b) reduced mitochondrial oxidative damage and excessive mitophagy and restored mitochondrial overall health status and preserved mitochondrial function; and (c) suppressed mitochondria-dependent apoptosome formation/caspase-3/9 apoptosis-processing activities. Additionally, we validated, in an in vitro ischemia model, that cytochrome c oxidase served as a key PBM target for mitochondrial function preservation and neuroprotection. Our findings suggest that PBM serves as a promising therapeutic strategy for the functional recovery after GCI, with mechanisms involving PBM's preservation on mitochondrial dynamics and functions and the inhibition of delayed apoptotic neuronal death in GCI.

TI  - Effect of delayed transport on clinical outcomes among patients with cardiac arrest during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted many changes. Revised cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) recommendations were issued including increased requirement for personal protective equipment (PPE) during CPR and isolation rooms. We hypothesized that these changes might have affected transport times and distance. Accordingly, we investigated any differences in transport time and distance and their effect on patient neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge.Methods: This retrospective study was conducted among patients who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest and were admitted to an emergency department during specific periods - pre-COVID-19 (January 1 to December 31, 2019) and COVID-19 (March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021).Result: The mean transport distance was 3.5 +/- 2.1 km and 3.7 +/- 2.3 km during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively (p = 0.664). The mean total transport time was 30.3 +/- 6.9 min and 35.6 +/- 9.3 min during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean acti-vation time was 1.5 +/- 2.2 min and 2.9 +/- 4.5 min during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, re-spectively (p = 0.003). The mean transport time was 9.3 +/- 3.5 min and 11.5 +/- 6 min during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively (p = 0.001).Conclusion: Total transport time, including activation time for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, in-creased owing to increased PPE requirements. However, there was no significant difference in the neuro-logical outcome at hospital discharge.(c) 2021 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of naive sixth-grade children with trained professionals in the use of an automated external defibrillator
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is strongly influenced by time to defibrillation, Wider availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) may decrease response times but only with increased lay use. Consequently, this study endeavored to improve our understanding of AED use in naive users by measuring times to shock and appropriateness of pad location. We chose sixth-grade students to simulate an extreme circumstance of unfamiliarity with the problem of OHCA and defibrillation. The children's AED use was then compared with that of professionals.
   Methods and Results-With the use of a mock cardiac arrest scenario, AED use by 15 children was compared with that of 22 emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or paramedics. The primary end point was time from entry onto the cardiac arrest scene to delivery of the shock into simulated ventricular fibrillation, The secondary end point was appropriateness of pad placement. All subject performances were videotaped to assess safety of use and compliance with AED prompts to remain clear of the mannequin during shock delivery. Mean time to defibrillation was 90+/-14 seconds (range, 69 to 111 seconds) for the children and 67+/-10 seconds (range, 50 to 87 seconds) for the EMTs/paramedics (P<0.0001). Electrode pad placement was appropriate for all subjects. All remained clear of the "patient" during shock delivery,
   Conclusions-During mock cardiac arrest, the speed of AED use by untrained children is only modestly slower than that of professionals. The difference between the groups is surprisingly small, considering the naivete of the children as untutored first-time users. These findings suggest that widespread use of AEDs will require only modest training.

TI  - Hypothermia and cardiac arrest: the promise of intra-arrest cooling
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Over the past several years, the implementation of therapeutic hypothermia has provided an exciting opportunity toward improving survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. There are compelling data to support the prompt use of therapeutic hypothermia for initial survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but animal data have suggested that initiation of therapeutic hypothermia during the intra-arrest period may significantly improve outcomes even further. In the first feasibility study in humans, Bruel and colleagues report on the implementation of this intra-arrest approach among patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, an exciting prospect that is discussed in the present commentary.

TI  - Complex airway reconstruction in children with tracheobronchial injuries: a case series
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Paediatric airway surgery in the setting of complex tracheobronchial defects is challenging. This report describes the surgical management and outcomes of pericardial flap repair in three children. The first patient was a 4-month-old boy with a history of tracheoesophageal fistula repair who presented after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. He was treated by re-do tracheobronchial reconstruction of the carina using a pedicled pericardial flap. The second patient was an 11-month-old boy who presented following aspiration of a button battery. Bronchoscopy showed erosion of the battery through both main bronchi and the oesophagus. The patient underwent emergency reconstruction of the extensive tracheobronchial defect with pedicled right and left pericardial patches. The third patient was a 5-year-old girl who fell from a swing, resulting in avulsion of the right main bronchus. Pedicled pericardium was used to reconstruct the damaged posterior tracheal wall and the right and left main bronchi. All three patients underwent successful repair of complex tracheobronchial defects with good outcomes in terms of survival and quality of life during 6 to 21 months of follow-up. Pedicled pericardial flap repair may be a viable option for achieving improved results in children with severe tracheobronchial defects.

TI  - LncRNA ENSSSCG00000035331 Alleviates Hippocampal Neuronal Ferroptosis and Brain Injury Following Porcine Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Regulating the miR-let7a/GPX4 Axis
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - BackgroundFollowing successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, those survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) often suffer from severe brain injury, and the latter can result in significant mortality and morbidity. Emerging evidence implicates that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of post-resuscitation brain injury, and its regulatory mechanisms remain to be investigated. Recently, some studies manifested that long noncoding RNAs could be critical regulators of cell ferroptosis in diverse ischemia-reperfusion injuries of vital organs. This study was designed to explore the role and mechanism of a newly screened long noncoding RNA ENSSSCG00000035331 in alleviating post-resuscitation hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and further investigate its potential regulation by a novel antioxidant sulforaphane.Methods and ResultsHealthy male pigs and mice were used to establish the models of CA and resuscitation in vivo. A hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model using primary porcine hippocampal neurons was constructed to replicate post-resuscitation brain injury in vitro. We found that the expression of ENSSSCG00000035331 was significantly decreased in the post-resuscitation impaired hippocampus using RNA sequencing analysis and verification. Subsequently, ENSSSCG00000035331 overexpression significantly reduced ferroptosis-related ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species production while markedly increased glutathione and further alleviated post-resuscitation brain injury. Mechanistically, ENSSSCG00000035331 interacted with miR-let7a, then inhibited its binding with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA and finally promoted the recovery of the latter's translation after H/R stimulation. In addition, sulforaphane treatment significantly increased ENSSSCG00000035331 and GPX4 expression while markedly decreased miR-let7a expression and hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and finally alleviated post-resuscitation brain injury.ConclusionsOur findings highlighted that ENSSSCG00000035331 was a critical regulator of hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis after CA and resuscitation by targeting the miR-let7a/GPX4 axis, and additionally, sulforaphane might be a promising therapeutic agent for alleviating post-resuscitation brain injury by regulating the signaling axis mentioned above.

TI  - Effect of an Educational Presentation about Extremely Preterm Infants on Knowledge and Attitudes of Health Care Providers
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective To determine healthcare providers' knowledge (HCP) about survival rates of extremely preterm infants (EPI) and attitudes toward resuscitation before and after an educational presentation and, to examine the relationship between knowledge and attitudes toward resuscitation.
   Study Design Participants completed a survey before and after attending a presentation detailing evidence-based estimates of survival rates and surrounding ethical issues. Respondents included neonatologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, trainees in pediatrics, obstetrics, neonatal-perinatal medicine and neonatal and obstetrical nurses.
   Results In total, 166 participants attended an educational presentation and 130 participants completed both pre-and postsurveys (response rate 78%). Prepresentation, for all gestations, <= 50% of respondents correctly identified survival/ intact survival rates. Post-presentation, correct responses regarding survival/intact survival rates ranged from 49 to 86%(p < 0.001) andattitudes shifted toward being more likely to resuscitate at all gestations regardless of parental wishes. There was a weak-to-modest relationship (Spearman's coefficient 0.24-0.40, p < 0.001-0.004) between knowledge responses and attitudes.
   Conclusion Attendance at an educational presentation did improve HCP knowledge about survival and long term outcomes for EPI, but HCP still underestimated survival and were not always willing to resuscitate in accordance with parental wishes. These findings may represent barriers to some experts' recommendation to use shared decision-making with parents when considering the resuscitation options for their EPI.

TI  - Rationale and Design of the Prospective German Registry of Outcome in Patients With Severe Disorders of Consciousness After Acute Brain Injury
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION
AB  - Objective: To describe the rationale and design of a new patient registry (Koma Outcome von Patienten der Fruhrehabilitation-Register [KOPF-R; Registry for Coma Outcome in Patients Undergoing Acute Rehabilitation]) that has the scope to examine determinants of long-term outcome and functioning of patients with severe disorders of consciousness (DOC).
   Design: Prospective multicenter neurologic rehabilitation registry.
   Setting: Five specialized neurologic rehabilitation facilities.
   Participants: Patients (N=42) with DOC in vegetative state or minimally conscious state (MCS) as defined by the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) after brain injury. Patients are being continuously enrolled. The data presented here cover the enrollment period from August 2011 to January 2012.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: CRS-R, FIM, and emergence from MCS.
   Results: The registry was set up in 5 facilities across the state of Bavaria/Germany with a special expertise in the rehabilitation of acquired brain injury. Inclusion of patients started in August 2011. Measures include sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, course of acute therapy, electrophysiologic measures (evoked potentials, electroencephalogram), neuron-specific enolase, current medication, functioning, cognition, participation, quality of life, quantity and characteristics of rehabilitation therapy, caregiver burden, and attitudes toward end-of-life decisions. Main diagnoses were traumatic brain injury (24%), intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (31%), and anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (45%). Mean CRS-R score +/- SD at admission to rehabilitation was 5.9 +/- 3.3, and mean FIM score +/- SD at admission was 18 +/- 0.4.
   Conclusions: The KOPF-R aspires to contribute prospective data on prognosis in severe DOC. (c) 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

TI  - Safety management within the scope of teaching practical clinical skills: framing errors for cardiopulmonary resuscitation training - a multi-arm randomized controlled equivalence trial
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE
AB  - IntroductionCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is among the most important skills in clinical practice. Errors can happen here, just like everywhere, and potentially have severe consequences. Two common error handling strategies known from practice are Error Management (EM) and Error Avoidance (EA). However, its effects on medical performance outcomes remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the role of error framing in basic life support (BLS) training for future healthcare professionals.Materials and MethodsIn an equivalence trial (N = 430), first-year medical, dentistry, physiotherapy, and midwifery students underwent BLS training. In the three study arms, participants received either (1) instructions framing errors positively (EM), (2) instructions framing errors to be avoided (EA), or (3) no further instructions (Control). CPR performance was assessed using a resuscitation manikin measuring compression depth (CD) and compression rate (CR). The self-confidence ratings were assessed using a questionnaire. Equivalence margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculations were based on previous standard BLS studies, using two-sided 95% confidence intervals to determine significance of equivalence.ResultsThe results regarding CD revealed equivalence with a trend toward superiority of EM over EA (proportional difference 23.3%-points; 95% CI 11.4%-34.2%) and EM over control (proportional difference 23.4%-points; 95% CI 11.5%-34.2%.) and significant equivalence of EA and control (proportional difference 0.1%-points; 95% CI -11.6%-11.7%). Significant equivalence was determined for all study arms with respect to CR and self-confidence.ConclusionOur study revealed that EM was not detrimental to learners' CPR performance. Given existing research on long-term beneficial effects of EM on patient safety, coupled with the proven equivalence of EM and EA concerning short-term performance, we argue that EM is a promising approach for future medical education purposes. Raising awareness of error framing and teaching error-handling strategies is expected to benefit ongoing safety management efforts in medical education and beyond.

TI  - 2-iminobiotin, a selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, improves memory and learning in a rat model after four vessel occlusion, mimicking cardiac arrest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) experience between 30% and 50% cognitive deficits several years post-discharge. Especially spatial memory is affected due to ischemia-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Aim of this study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of 2-iminobiotin (2-IB), a biotin analogue, on memory and learning in a four-vessel occlusion model of global ischemia using the Water Maze test. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham operation (n = 6), vehicle treatment (n = 20), 1.1 (n = 15), 3.3 (n = 14), 10 (n = 14), or 30 mg/kg/dose 2-IB treatment (n = 15). Treatment was subcutaneously (s.c.) administered immediately upon reperfusion, at 12h, and at 24h after reperfusion. Memory function on day 32 was significantly preserved in all doses of 2-IB rats compared to vehicle, as was the learning curve in the 1.1, 3.3 and 30 mg/kg dose group. Adult rats treated s.c. with 3 gifts of 2-IB every 12 h in a dose range of 1.1-30 mg/kg/dose directly upon reperfusion showed significant improved memory and learning after four vessel occlusion compared to vehicle-treated rats. Since 2-IB has already shown to be safe in a phase 1 clinical trial in adult human volunteers, it is a suitable candidate for translation to a human phase 2 study after OHCA.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of virtual reality simulation in cpr training for nursing students: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE
AB  - Aim: To compare the effectiveness of VR based training and traditional simulation in improving the knowledge, psychomotor skills, attitudes, learning styles and self-directed learning skills of nursing students participating in CPR training. Design: Randomized controlled trial with a pre-test/post-test control group design. Method: Study was conducted with 144 s-year nursing students at an accredited state university in Turkey. Participants were randomly assigned to either a VR group or a traditional simulation group. Both groups received theoretical instruction in CPR followed by VR-based training using Oculus Quest 2 headsets or a traditional simulation-based exercise. Data were collected using the CPR Knowledge Test, the Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, the Simulation Design Scale and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for CPR skills. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in CPR skills after the intervention, with no significant difference between groups. The traditional simulation group showed a significant increase in self-directed learning skills, while no significant change was observed in the VR group. The VR group showed a supportive effect on abstract conceptualization in learning styles, but had no significant effect on learning preferences. Students in the VR group outperformed the control group on several critical psychomotor CPR skills measured by OSCE. Both groups rated their simulation experiences favorably. Conclusions: VR-based CPR training is an effective, scalable, and engaging teaching method that enhances psychomotor skill acquisition and promotes cognitive engagement. Future research should explore hybrid models and long-term outcomes to optimize the use of VR in CPR education.

TI  - Post-anesthetic cortical blindness in cats: Twenty cases
T2  - VETERINARY JOURNAL
AB  - The medical records of 20 cats with post-anesthetic cortical blindness were reviewed. Information collected included signalment and health status, reason for anesthesia, anesthetic protocols and adverse events, post-anesthetic visual and neurological abnormalities, clinical outcome, and risk factors. The vascular anatomy of the cat brain was reviewed by cadaver dissections.
   Thirteen cats were anaesthetised for dentistry, four for endoscopy, two for neutering procedures and one for urethral obstruction. A mouth gag was used in 16/20 cats. Three cats had had cardiac arrest, whereas in the remaining 17 cases, no specific cause of blindness was identified. Seventeen cats (85%) had neurological deficits in addition to blindness. Fourteen of 20 cats (70%) had documented recovery of vision, whereas four (20%) remained blind. Two cats (10%) were lost to follow up while still blind. Ten of 17 cats (59%) with neurological deficits had full recovery from neurological disease, two (12%) had mild persistent deficits and one (6%) was euthanased as it failed to recover. Four cats (23%) without documented resolution of neurological signs were lost to follow up. Mouth gags were identified as a potential risk factor for cerebral ischemia and blindness in cats.

TI  - Haemodynamic-directed cardiopulmonary resuscitation promotes mitochondrial fusion and preservation of mitochondrial mass after successful resuscitation in a pediatric porcine model
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Objective: Cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction is a key mediator of neurologic injury following cardiac arrest (CA) and is regulated by the balance of fusion and fission (mitochondrial dynamics). Under stress, fission can decrease mitochondrial mass and signal apoptosis, while fusion promotes oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. This study evaluates mitochondrial dynamics and content in brain tissue 24h after CA between two cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) strategies.
   Interventions: Piglets (1 month), previously randomized to three groups: (1) Std-CPR (n=5); (2) HD-CPR (n=5; goal systolic blood pressure 90mmHg, goal coronary perfusion pressure 20mmHg); (3) Shams (n= 7). Std-CPR and HD-CPR groups underwent 7min of asphyxia, 10min of CPR, and standardized post-resuscitation care. Primary outcomes: (1) cerebral cortical mitochondrial protein expression for fusion (OPA1, OPA1 long to short chain ratio, MFN2) and fission (DRP1, FIS1), and (2) mitochondrial mass by citrate synthase activity. Secondary outcomes: (1) intra-arrest haemodynamics and (2) cerebral performance category (CPC) at 24h.
   Results: HD-CPR subjects had higher total OPA1 expression compared to Std-CPR (1.52; IQR 1.02-1.69 vs 0.67; IQR 0.54-0.88, p=0.001) and higher OPA1 long to short chain ratio than both Std-CPR (0.63; IQR 0.46-0.92 vs 0.26; IQR 0.26-0.31, p=0.016) and shams. Citrate synthase activity was lower in Std-CPR than sham (11.0; IQR 10.15-12.29 vs 13.4; IQR 12.28-15.66, p= 0.047), but preserved in HD-CPR. HD-CPR subjects had improved intra-arrest haemodynamics and CPC scores at 24h compared to Std-CPR.
   Conclusions: Following asphyxia-associated CA, HD-CPR exhibits increased pro-mitochondrial fusion protein expression, preservation of mitochondrial mass, improved haemodynamics and superior neurologic scoring compared to Std-CPR.

TI  - Predicting the Mortality and Readmission of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients With Electronic Health Records: A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is associated with high mortality and health care costs in the recovery phase. Predicting adverse outcome events, including readmission, improves the chance for appropriate interventions and reduces health care costs. However, studies related to the early prediction of adverse events of IHCA survivors are rare. Therefore, we used a deep learning model for prediction in this study.
   Objective: This study aimed to demonstrate that with the proper data set and learning strategies, we can predict the 30-day mortality and readmission of IHCA survivors based on their historical claims.
   Methods: National Health Insurance Research Database claims data, including 168,693 patients who had experienced IHCA at least once and 1,569,478 clinical records, were obtained to generate a data set for outcome prediction. We predicted the 30-day mortality/readmission after each current record (ALL-mortality/ALL-readmission) and 30-day mortality/readmission after IHCA (cardiac arrest [CA]-mortality/CA-readmission). We developed a hierarchical vectorizer (HVec) deep learning model to extract patients' information and predict mortality and readmission. To embed the textual medical concepts of the clinical records into our deep learning model, we used Text2Node to compute the distributed representations of all medical concept codes as a 128-dimensional vector. Along with the patient's demographic information, our novel HVec model generated embedding vectors to hierarchically describe the health status at the record-level and patient-level. Multitask learning involving two main tasks and auxiliary tasks was proposed. As CA-mortality and CA-readmission were rare, person upsampling of patients with CA and weighting of CA records were used to improve prediction performance.
   Results: With the multitask learning setting in the model learning process, we achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.752 for CA-mortality, 0.711 for ALL-mortality, 0.852 for CA-readmission, and 0.889 for ALL-readmission. The area under the receiver operating characteristic was improved to 0.808 for CA-mortality and 0.862 for CA-readmission after solving the extremely imbalanced issue for CA-mortality/CA-readmission by upsampling and weighting.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potential of predicting future outcomes for IHCA survivors by machine learning. The results showed that our proposed approach could effectively alleviate data imbalance problems and train a better model for outcome prediction.

TI  - Enhanced resuscitation of anammox granular sludge by adding folate: A perspective from the growth factor
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - Quick resuscitation of preserved anammox granular sludge (AnGS) is crucial for its engineering applications. In this study, the stimulation effect and its mechanism of folate addition on resuscitation of AnGS after the long-term cryopreservation were investigated. The folate addition was found to enhance the recovery of AnGS activity to 76.4% of the original level on the 8th day, which was 28.1% higher than the folate-free group (CK). The folate addition could also promote the community recovery of AnGS, in which the live cells and abundance of anammox bacteria (AnAOB) were 10.2% and 14.0% higher than those in the CK in the early phase of resuscitation. Besides, the folate addition was revealed to stimulate the AnAOB recovery of AnGS, with higher activity and cell number by 58.7% and 40.9% than those in the CK. Furthermore, the mechanism of folate stimulation was proposed on the resuscitation of preserved AnGS. The exogenous folate addition could enhance the CO2 fixation capacity of AnAOB, which further accelerated both activity and cell number recovery of AnAOB, leading to the strong stimulation effect on the resuscitation of AnGS. These findings could offer valuable insights for optimizing and innovating the preservation technology of AnGS.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: unmet needs and perspectives
T2  - RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has become an essential lifesaving intervention for individuals with severe cardiovascular and respiratory failure. Its application is expanding across several therapeutic contexts, surpassing conventional indications. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed worldwide health systems to manage acute respiratory failure. ECMO has been employed as a vital intervention, particularly for patients with severe COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ECMO is applicable throughout pregnancy. The principal indications for ECMO in pregnant women align with those in the general population. However, pregnancy complicates issues, necessitating consideration of both mother's and infant's well-being. Patients with systemic rheumatic diseases are prone to experience life-threatening complications. While a majority of these patients respond to immunosuppressive drugs, a small percentage suffer organ failure and may benefit from ECMO as a bridge to recovery. The article addresses coagulation therapies, highlighting the necessity of precise anticoagulation to avert both bleeding and thrombosis, particularly in patients requiring extended ECMO support. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in ECMO patients are summarized, including the influence of the ECMO circuit on drug metabolism. Survey-based research offers valuable insights into ECMO use, procedures, and challenges. The paper evaluates current survey-based research and ECMO guidelines, highlighting clinical practice, training, and resource availability discrepancies across ECMO centers globally. Particular focus is placed on the rehabilitation requirements of ECMO survivors, acknowledging the importance of early mobilization and post-discharge care in improving long-term outcomes and quality of life.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review Many efforts have been made in the last decades to improve outcome in patients who are successfully resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest. Despite some advances, postanoxic encephalopathy remains the most common cause of death among those patients and several investigations have focused on early neuroprotection in this setting. Recent findings Therapeutic hypothermia is the only strategy able to provide effective neuroprotection in clinical practice. Experimental studies showed that therapeutic hypothermia was even more effective when it was started immediately after the ischemic event. In human studies, the use of prehospital hypothermia was able to reduce the time to target temperature but did not result in higher survival rate or neurological recovery in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when compared with standard in-hospital therapeutic hypothermia. Thus, intra-arrest hypothermia (i.e., initiated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation) may be a valid alternative to improve the effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia in this setting; however, more clinical data are needed to demonstrate any potential benefit of such intervention on neurological outcome. Together with cooling, early hemodynamic optimization should be considered to improve cerebral perfusion in cardiac arrest patients and minimize any secondary brain injury. Nevertheless, only scarce data are available on the impact of early hemodynamic optimization on the development of organ dysfunction and neurological recovery in such patients. Some new protective strategies, including inhaled gases (i.e., xenon, argon, nitric oxide) and intravenous drugs (i.e., erythropoietin) are emerging in experimental studies as promising tools to improve neuroprotection, especially when combined with therapeutic hypothermia. Early cooling may contribute to enhance neuroprotection after cardiac arrest. Hemodynamic optimization is mandatory to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion in this setting. The combination of such interventions with other promising neuroprotective strategies should be evaluated in future large clinical studies.

TI  - A case of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to fulminant myocarditis requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - SIGNA VITAE
AB  - A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of fever and chest pain that led her to collapse, prompting her father to call the emergency medical services (EMS). Both an EMS ambulance and a physician-staffed ambulance were dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, the EMS crew discovered that the patient was in cardiac arrest, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the initial heart rhythm. Due to the patient's refractory VF, the physician requested the receiving hospital to prepare for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), which was successfully initiated 105 minutes after the patient's collapse. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, where her cardiac function gradually improved. On the eighth day, she was successfully weaned off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and discharged from the hospital on the thirty-third day without any neurological complications. The presumed cause of the cardiac arrest was fulminant myocarditis, based on the patient's clinical history and findings from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, early mechanical cardiopulmonary support is crucial for patients with fulminant myocarditis. However, cases resulting in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest generally have poor outcomes, even with ECPR. This particular case demonstrated that optimal resuscitation, spanning from the prehospital phase to the intensive care unit, utilizing ECPR, played a vital role in achieving a favorable neurological outcome.

TI  - Patients, intimate partners and family experiences of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: qualitative systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim. This paper is a report of an interpretive review of qualitative research on how an implantable cardioverter defibrillator affects adult recipients and their significant others. Background. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator detects pathological cardiac rhythms and automatically converts the rhythm with electrical counter shocks. Data sources. A systematic literature search was conducted for qualitative research papers published between January 1999 and January 2009. PubMed, Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge and CINAHL databases were searched with the following key words: internal defibrillator, implantable defibrillator and qualitative research. Review Methods. Twenty-two papers were included. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and Prompts were used to appraise studies. Thematic analysis and synthesis approaches were used to interpret evidence. Findings. People with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator were found to experience physical, psychological and social changes. Shocks produce fear and anxiety, affecting relationships and sexual relations. The use of support groups and the use of the Internet are important in helping adjustment to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Womens responses to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator appear different than mens responses and include concerns about physical appearance and relationship issues. Postdischarge follow-up and educational programmes are still underdeveloped. Conclusion. Patients need additional education, support and follow-up care after hospital discharge. Patients and significant others benefit from collaboration between patient associations and healthcare professional societies. Future research is needed to identify the specific challenges that women recipients face.

TI  - Video Emergency Calls in Medical Dispatching: A Scoping Review
T2  - PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Video emergency calls (VCs) represent a feasible future trend in medical dispatching. Acceptance among callers and dispatchers seems to be good. Indications, potential problems, limitations, and directions of research of adding a live video from smartphones to an emergency call have not been reviewed outside the context of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Objective: The main objective of this study is to examine the scope and nature of research publications on the topic of VC. The secondary goal is to identify research gaps and discuss the potential directions of research efforts of VC. Design: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, online bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and gray literature were searched from the period of January 1, 2012 through March 1, 2022 in English. Only studies focusing on video transfer via mobile phone to emergency medical dispatch centers (EMDCs) were included. Results: Twelve articles were included in the qualitative synthesis and six main themes were identified: (1) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guided by VC; (2) indications of VCs; (3) dispatchers' feedback and perception; (4) technical aspects of VCs; (5) callers' acceptance; and (6) confidentiality and legal issues. Conclusion: Video emergency calls are feasible and seem to be a well-accepted auxiliary method among dispatchers and callers. Some promising clinical results exist, especially for video-assisted CPR. On the other hand, there are still enormous knowledge gaps in the vast majority of implementation aspects of VC into practice.

TI  - Alternative Arterial Access in Veno-Arterial ECMO: The Role of the Axillary Artery
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) is increasingly used to support patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. While femoral artery cannulation remains the most common arterial access, axillary artery cannulation has emerged as a valuable alternative in selected cases. Objective: This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence and expert opinion on axillary artery cannulation in V-A ECMO, focusing on its technical feasibility, physiologic implications, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus using relevant keywords related to ECMO, axillary artery, cannulation techniques, and outcomes. Emphasis was placed on prospective and retrospective clinical studies, expert consensus statements, and technical reports published over the past two decades. Results: Axillary cannulation provides antegrade aortic flow, potentially reducing the risk of differential hypoxia and improving upper body perfusion. However, the technique presents unique technical challenges and may carry risks such as hyperperfusion syndrome or arterial complications. Emerging data suggest favorable outcomes in selected patient populations when performed in experienced centers. Conclusions: Axillary cannulation represents a promising arterial access route in V-A ECMO, particularly in cases with contraindications to femoral cannulation or when upper-body perfusion is a concern. Further prospective studies are needed to better define patient selection criteria and long-term outcomes.

TI  - Hemodynamic and biochemical changes in therapeutic hypothermia treatment applied after cardiac arrest
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia has been introduced as a critical intervention in patients with circulatory return after cardiac arrest. The main goal of this treatment modality is to preserve patients' neurological function without deficits and improve survival rates and quality of life. Our aim in this study was to further clarify the biochemical outcomes (changes) after therapeutic hypothermia, contributing to the improvement of treatment strategies and clinical outcomes. This study retrospectively included 174 patients aged 18 to 85 years who were exposed to therapeutic hypothermia for 24 hours or longer. Gender, age, diagnosis, day of discharge, neurologic sequelae, day of death if mortality was present, and whether vasopressor drugs were used during treatment were recorded in the intensive care unit. Biochemical parameters (glucose, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], albumin, calcium, sodium, potassium, pH, SPO2, C-reactive protein, Hb, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) values before (T1) and after 24 hours (T2) treatment were recorded. T1 GCS value measured in the intensive care unit was compared with the T2 GCS values, a significant difference (P < .05) was found between T1 and T2. Statistically significant decreases (P < .05) were observed in T2 (glucose, ALT, AST, albumin, calcium, potassium, and troponin) levels. In contrast, T2 (creatinine, urea, and sodium) levels increased (P < .05). In conclusion, in our study, statistically significant decreases were observed in glucose, ALT, AST, albumin, calcium, potassium, and troponin levels in patients treated with hypothermia. Increases in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio suggest potential suppression of the immune response, which may increase susceptibility to infection. In contrast, creatinine, urea and sodium levels increased. In addition, pH values tended to increase towards normal limits. Large-scale and long-term studies are needed to better understand the effects of theropathic hypothermia on biochemical processes and clinical outcomes.

TI  - Hospital-wide first-responder automated external defibrillator programme: 1 year experience
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The first year experience with a hospital-wide first-responder automated external defibrillator (AED) programme implemented in a 683-bed University Hospital is reported. Throughout the hospital, 14 "AED access spots" were identified which could be easily reached from all wards and diagnostic rooms within 30s. AEDs were installed (Lifepak 500; Medtronik PhysioControl Corp., Redmond, USA, equipped with a Biolog 3000i portable ECG monitor; Micromedical Industries Ltd., Labrador, Australia). Within 3 months, 120 medical officers, 750 nurses, and 50 administrative or technical staff underwent a 2 h training programme. An AED was applied and activated by nurses/medical staff before the cardiac arrest team arrived in 27 of 33 cases (81.8%) of witnessed cardiac arrest. The median time from onset of the emergency call to the activation of the AED (record of ECG) was on average 2.1 min (range 1.0-4.5 min). In 18 of 27 cases in which the AED was installed promptly, the primary arrest rhythm was either VT or VF, and the AED delivered a shock. For this subgroup, the rate of return of spontaneous circulation and the rate of discharge at home were 88.9 and 55.6%, respectively. This encourages us to extend the concept of first-responder AED-defibrillation throughout our hospital. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Moving to human trials for argon neuroprotection in neurological injury: a narrative review
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
AB  - Despite the global burden of brain injury, neuroprotective agents remain elusive. There are no clinically effective therapies which reduce mortality or improve long-term cognitive outcome. Ventilation could be an easily modifiable variable in resuscitation; gases are relatively simple to administer. Xenon is the prototypic agent of a new generation of experimental treatments which show promise. However, use is hindered by its prohibitive cost and anaesthetic properties. Argon is an attractive option, being cheaper, easy to transport, non-sedating, and mechanistically distinct from xenon. In vitro and in vivo models provide evidence of argon reducing brain injury, with improvements in neurocognitive, histological, and biomarker metrics, as well as improved survival. Current data suggest that the effect of argon is mediated via the toll-like receptors 2 and 4, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI-3K)-AKT pathways. Ventilation with argon appears to be safe in pigs and preliminary human trials. Given recent evidence that arterial hyperoxia may be harmful, the supplementation of high-concentration argon may not necessitate changes to clinical practice. Given the logistic benefits, and the evidence for argon neuroprotection summarized in this manuscript, we believe that the time has come to consider developing Phase II clinical trials to assess its benefit in acute neurological injury.

TI  - Chronic pelvic pain: aetiology and therapy
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH IN CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common condition in women and rates of consultation for CPP in general practice are similar to those for asthma and migraine. US and UK population-based studies, together with data from UK hospital settings demonstrate a substantial impact of CPP on health-related quality of life. In this review, we will examine the current evidence on the aetiology and management of CPP, focussing on the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that are available to date.
   CPP is a heterogeneous condition and causation is often unclear. There are associations with specific pathological processes but a barrier to understanding is that many studies have data that are not comparable. In the community setting, as many as 60% of women with CPP have not received a specific diagnosis and up to 20% have not undergone any investigation. The factor most commonly associated with CPP in the community is irritable bowel syndrome, although in a tertiary setting with laparoscopy, pathology associated with CPP in ascending order of frequency is endometriosis (33%), adhesions (24%) and 'no pathology' (35%).
   Current RCT evidence provides some support for the use of ultrasound scanning as an aid to counselling and reassurance, progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate) or goserelin for pelvic congestion and a multidisciplinary approach to assessment and treatment. Adhesiolysis is not shown to be of benefit other than in women with extensive adhesions. While studied in relation to dysmenorrhoea rather than CPP, the short term results for presacral neurectomy (PSN) and laparoscopic utero-sacral nerve ablation (LUNA) seem to be similar, although PSN has better results in the long term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants have not been shown to be of benefit in CPR Most of these conclusions are based on the outcome of single randomised trials and therefore need replication.

TI  - THE 1ST SUCCESSFUL SURGICAL-TREATMENT OF MITRAL-STENOSIS - THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF CUTLER,ELLIOT MITRAL COMMISSUROTOMY
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - In 1923 Elliot Carr Cutler, in conjunction with his cardiology colleague, Samuel Levine, performed a closed transventricular mitral commissurotomy with a tenotomy knife on a 12-year-old patient dying of rheumatic mitral stenosis at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. This operation was carried out after several years of experimentation regarding resuscitation of the heart, appropriate incisions, and the pathophysiology of mitral stenosis. The interest in mitral stenosis was rampant at the time because of the huge number of patients suffering from this public health problem. The patient survived and went on to die of pneumonia 4 years postoperatively. Subsequent to this, Cutler performed seven more operations using his new cardiovalvulotome, which was to create controlled mitral regurgitation. Unfortunately, this concept did not promote long-term success and a moratorium for these operations was called in 1929. Nevertheless, this pioneering effort in 1923 was the first successful operation to treat valvular heart disease by a surgical technique.

TI  - Protocol paper A protocol for the Heart Matters stepped wedge cluster randomised trial: The effectiveness of heart attack education in regions at highest-risk
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To describe the Heart Matters (HM) trial which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a community heart attack education intervention in high -risk areas in Victoria, Australia. These local government areas (LGAs) have high rates of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), cardiovascular risk factors, and low rates of emergency medical service (EMS) use for ACS.Methods: The trial follows a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design, with eight clusters (high-risk LGAs) randomly assigned to transition from control to intervention every four months. Two pairs of LGAs will transition simultaneously due to their proximity. The intervention consists of a heart attack education program delivered by trained HM Coordinators, with additional support from opportunistic media and a geo-targeted social media campaign. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of residents from the eight LGAs who present to emergency departments by EMS during an ACS event. Secondary outcomes include prehospital delay time, rates of OHCA and heart attack awareness. The primary and secondary out-comes will be analysed at the patient/participant level using mixed-effects logistic regression models. A detailed program evaluation is also being conducted. The trial was registered on August 9, 2021 (NCT04995900).Results: The intervention was implemented between February 2022 and March 2023, and outcome data will be collected from administrative data -bases, registries, and surveys. Primary trial data is expected to be locked for analysis by October 31st 2023, with a follow-up planned until March 31st 2024. Conclusion: The results from this trial will provide high-level evidence the effectiveness of a community education intervention targeting regions at highest-risk of ACS and low EMS use.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative cooling strategies following cardiac arrest
T2  - SPRINGERPLUS
AB  - Objectives: Using survival and neurologic outcome as endpoints, this study explored the incremental cost effectiveness of three mutually exclusive cooling strategies employed after resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.
   Design: Economic analysis based on retrospective data collection and Markov modeling.
   Setting: Modeling based on patients housed in a tertiary ICU setting.
   Patients: Patients > 18 years following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Interventions: Therapeutic cooling vs. conventional care.
   Measurements and main results: Using societal-based analytic decision modeling with a lifetime study horizon, incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for blanket, peritoneal lavage, and V-V ECMO cooling strategies were compared with conventional care. Comprehensive cost data were obtained from available literature, national and local databases; health utility data were abstracted from previous publications and converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/person and stratified by neurologic outcome state. Future costs were discounted using a standard 3% discount rate. Cooling blankets produced better overall health outcomes at a lower cost than conventional care and V-V ECMO. Peritoneal lavage added an additional 0.67 QALYs at an ICER of $58,329/QALY. Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating uncertainty in all parameters showed that peritoneal lavage was 70% likely to be the preferred, cost-effective therapy if one were willing to pay (WTP) $100,000/QALY.
   Conclusions: This analysis suggests that blankets are the most cost effective cooling strategy for post-ROSC therapeutic hypothermia, with peritoneal lavage as an acceptable alternative at higher WTP thresholds. Though uncertainty about the optimal therapy could be reduced with additional research, these results can inform policy-makers and healthcare providers about cost effectiveness of alternative cooling modalities designed to improve neurologic outcome for this expanding patient population. This may be particularly relevant as societal-based cost effectiveness analyses become more widely incorporated into studies evaluating treatment for frequently encountered diseases.

TI  - Fast track to cricket: occupational therapists in hospital palliative medicine
T2  - BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE
AB  - The role of occupational therapy in palliative care has been described and unique contributions have been highlighted. This case report describes the support provided by specialist palliative care occupational therapists (OTs) for a patient in an emergency department in a large teaching hospital. This support enabled the patient to return home to die and enabled him to achieve his most important goal, watching 'The Ashes' on television.Having specialist palliative care OTs in an acute setting has not been described. Their presence as part of the team helps mitigate the risk of urgent discharge as the specialist OTs provide continuity of care from the hospital setting to follow-up in the community. They help support families in providing care for their dying relative. Communication skills training is vital for the specialist OTs enabling honest and timely conversations including the documentation of do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation discussions.

TI  - Epicardial ablation in high-risk Brugada syndrome to prevent ventricular fibrillation: results from a randomized clinical trial
T2  - EUROPACE
AB  - Aims Epicardial ablation for Brugada syndrome (BrS) has shown promise in reducing ventricular fibrillation (VF), but its role remains controversial due to the lack of randomized trials. This study evaluates the efficacy of catheter ablation in high-risk BrS patients. Methods and results This prospective, single-centre, randomized (2:1) study enrolled BrS patients with cardiac arrest (CA) or appropriate ICD therapies. All patients had an ICD and were randomized to undergo epicardial ablation (ablation group) or no ablation (control group). Enrolment began in September 2017 and prematurely terminated in February 2024. The primary endpoint was freedom from VF recurrences. Secondary endpoints included procedure safety, ICD-related complications, and quality-of-life assessment. Forty patients (83% male, mean age 43.7 +/- 12.1) were randomized: 26 in the ablation group and 14 in the control group. Thirty-six patients received appropriate ICD therapies before enrolment: 24 (92%) in the ablation group and 12 (86%) in the control group. One patient in the ablation group experienced a post-procedural pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis. Thirteen patients (33%) had major ICD-related complications. After a mean follow-up of 4.0 +/- 1.7 years, freedom from VF recurrence was 96% (25/26) in the ablation group and 50% (7/14) in the control group (P < 0.001). No unexplained or arrhythmic deaths occurred during follow-up. Conclusion Epicardial catheter ablation was associated with a reduction in VF recurrence compared with ICD therapy alone. These findings support the use of epicardial ablation in high-risk BrS patients. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03294278

TI  - Inducing hypothermia to decrease neurological deficit: literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim. This paper reports a literature review to examine the effectiveness of inducing hypothermia to decrease neurological deficit after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Background. After cardiac arrest, severe neurological impairment is a major problem. Outcome after anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest varies from normal function to brain death. However, a large proportion of these patients are left with severe disability and completely dependent on others for basic needs. Since the 1950s, several studies have shown how hypothermia can be neuroprotective. Recently, these studies have been taken to human trials in populations experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods. A literature search was conducted using the Ovid and MDConsult data-bases for the years 1966-2004 and the keywords included hypothermia, therapeutic hypothermia, and cardiac arrest. Only English language papers were retrieved. Six human trials were found. Results. All six studies showed improved neurological outcomes and four of these showed a decrease in mortality. Minimal complications exist from inducing mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest, and include decreased heart rate, increased systemic vascular resistance, transient electrolyte abnormalities ( increased serum potassium and glucose), possible increase in pneumonia or other infectious processes, possible rebound hyperthermia, possible hypotension, and possible arrhythmias.
   Conclusions. Based on the review of these studies and the recommendations from the Advanced Life Support Task Force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, advanced practice nurses should promote this practice, but look for further research on specific treatment recommendations.

TI  - PROACTIVE SCREENING ALGORITHM FOR EARLY-ONSET PNEUMONIA IN PATIENTS WITH OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST: A BEFORE-AFTER IMPLEMENTATION STUDY
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Introduction: Early-onset pneumonia (EOP) occurs in around 50% of critically ill patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and is associated with increased morbidity. Prompt diagnosis of EOP in these patients is difficult because of targeted temperature management and the postcardiac arrest syndrome. We hypothesized that an algorithm for proactive screening of EOP would improve patient outcomes. Methods: We conducted a single-center observational study comparing the outcomes of mechanically ventilated adult patients with OHCA, before (study period 1) and after (study period 2) implementation of an algorithm for proactive diagnosis of EOP, including an early distal pulmonary specimen. An inverse probability treatment weighted multivariable regression was performed to identify independent parameters associated with duration of mechanical ventilation. A subgroup analysis was conducted in patients alive on day 5 after intensive care unit admission. Results: Over the 4-year study period, 190 patients (99 and 91 for study periods 1 and 2, respectively) were enrolled. The overall incidence of EOP was 57.4% and was similar between both study periods. Although there was no difference in the time interval to antibiotic initiation, study period 2 was independently associated with higher SpO2/FiO2 ratios on days 3 and 4. We also observed a decrease in mechanical ventilation time in study period 2 (4.5 [1-11.3] vs. 3 [2-5.8] days; P = 0.07), and this reached statistical significance in the subgroup analysis of patients alive at day 5 (10 [5-17] vs. 5 [3-9] days, P = 0.01). Conclusion: In critically ill patients with OHCA, proactive diagnosis of EOP was not associated with a significant change in the time to antibiotic initiation. Further research is warranted to better define optimal diagnosis and management of EOP in this setting.

TI  - Management of Acute Kidney Injury: Core Curriculum 2018
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short-and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

TI  - COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR - EFFECT OF IMPROVED BATTERY LIFE AND COMPARISON WITH AMIODARONE THERAPY
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) greatly reduces the incidence of sudden cardiac death among patients with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation who do not respond to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed, comparing the ICD, amiodarone and conventional agents. Actual variable costs of hospitalization and follow-up care were used for 21 ICD- and 43 amiodarone-treated patients. Life expectancy and total variable costs were predicted with use of a Markov decision analytic model. Clinical event rates and probabilities were based on published reports or expert opinion.
   Life expectancy with an ICD (6.1 years) was 50% greater than that associated with treatment with amiodarone (3.9 years) and 2.5 times that associated with conventional treatment (2.5 years). Assuming replacement every 24 months, ICD lifetime treatment costs (in 1989 dollars) for a 55-year old patient are expected to be $89,600 compared with $24,800 for amiodarone and $16,100 for conventional therapy, yielding a marginal cost/effectiveness ratio for ICD versus amiodarone therapy of $29,200/year of life saved, which is comparable to that of other accepted medical treatments. If technologic improvements extend average battery life to 36 months, the marginal cost/effectiveness ratio would be $21,800/year of life saved, and at 96 months it would be $13,800/year of life saved. Patient age at implantation did not significantly affect these results,
   If quality of life on amiodarone therapy is 30% lower than that with the ICD, the marginal cost/effectiveness ratio decreases by 35%. If the quality of life for patients receiving drugs is 40% lower than that of patients treated with an ICD, use of the defibrillator becomes the dominant strategy.

TI  - Near-infrared spectroscopy: a tool to monitor cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic changes after cardiac arrest in rats
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Cardiac arrest (CA) is associated with poor neurological outcome and is associated with a poor understanding of the cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic changes. The objective of this study was to determine the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), to observe the changes in cerebral total hemoglobin (T-Hb) reflecting cerebral blood volume, oxygenation state of Hb, oxidized cytochrome oxidase (Cyto-C). and brain water content following CA. Methods: Fourteen rats were subjected to normothermic (37.5 degreesC) or hypothermic (34 degreesC) CA induced by 8 min of asphyxiation. Animals were resuscitated with ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Hypothermia was induced before CA. NIRS was applied to the animal head to measure T-Hb with a wavelength of 808 mu (11 = 10) and oxygenated/deoxygenated Hb, Cyto-C, and brain water content with wavelengths of 620-1120 nm (n = 4). Results: There were no technical difficulties in applying NIRS to the animal, and the signals were strong and consistent. Normothermic CA caused post-resuscitation hyperemia followed by hypoperfusion determined by the level of T-Hb. Hypothermic CA blunted post-resuscitation hyperemia and resulted in more prominent post-resuscitation hypoperfusion. Both, normothermic and hypothermic CA resulted in a sharp decrease in oxygenated Hb and Cyto-C. and the level of oxygenated Hb was higher in hypothermic CA after resuscitation. There was a rapid increase in brain water signals following CA. Hypothermic CA attenuated increased water signals in normothermic CA following resuscitation. Conclusion: MRS can be applied to monitor cerebral blood volume, oxygenation state of Hb, Cyto-C, and water content following CA in rats. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lower versus higher oxygenation targets in hypoxaemic ICU patients after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: To investigate the effects of lower versus higher oxygenation targets in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure after cardiac arrest.Methods: Subgroup analysis of the international Handling Oxygenation Targets in the ICU (HOT-ICU) trial which randomised 2928 adults with acute hypoxaemia to targets of arterial oxygenation of 8 kPa or 12 kPa in the ICU for up to 90 days. Here, we report all outcomes up to one year in the subgroup of patients enrolled after cardiac arrest.Results: The HOT-ICU trial included 335 patients after cardiac arrest: 149 in the lower-oxygenation group and 186 in the higher-oxygenation group. At 90 days, 96/147 patients (65.3%) in the lower-oxygenation group and 111/185 patients (60.0%) in the higher-oxygenation group had died (adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.28, p = 0.32); similar results were found at one year (adjusted RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.21, p = 0.53). Serious adverse events (SAEs) in the ICU occurred in 23% of patients in the lower-oxygenation group and 38% in the higher-oxygenation group (adjusted RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86, p = 0.005); the difference was mainly due to more new episodes of shock in the higher-oxygenation group. No statistically significant differences were observed in other secondary outcomes.Conclusion: A lower oxygenation target in adult ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure after cardiac arrest did not result in lower mortality, but fewer SAEs occurred in this group compared to the higher-oxygenation group.

TI  - Extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation in poisoning: A scoping review article
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) represents last-line salvage therapy for poisoning-induced cardiac arrest but no review has focused on this specific area. Objective: This scoping review sought to evaluate the survival outcomes and characteristics of published cases of ECPR for toxicological arrest, with the aim of highlighting the potential and limitations of ECPR in toxicology. Eligibility Criteria. We searched PubMed and Cochrane for eligible papers from database inception to October 1, 2022 using the keywords "toxicology", "ECLS" and "CPR". References of included publications were searched to identify additional relevant articles. Qualitative synthesis was used to summarize the evidence. Results: 85 articles were chosen: 15 case series, 58 individual cases and 12 other publications that were analyzed separately due to ambiguity. ECPR may improve survival outcomes in selected poisoned patients, although the extent of benefit is unclear. As ECPR for poisoning-induced arrest may have better prognosis compared to from other aetiologies, it is likely reasonable to apply ELSO ECPR consensus guideline recommendations to toxicological arrest. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest alone may not be sufficient grounds to deny ECPR if effective resuscitation had been promptly instituted. Poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agents and cardio-depressive drugs, and cardiac arrests with shockable rhythms appear to have better outcomes. ECPR may permit excellent neurologically-intact recovery despite prolonged low-flow time of up to four hours. Early ECLS activation and pre-emptive catheter placement can significantly shorten time-to-ECPR and possibly improve survival. Conclusion: As effects of poisoning may be reversible, ECPR can potentially support poisoned patients through the critical peri-arrest state.

TI  - Prompt prediction of successful defibrillation from 1-s ventricular fibrillation waveform in patients with out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA
AB  - Purpose Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a common cardiac arrest rhythm that can be terminated by electrical defibrillation. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there is a strong need for a prompt and reliable predictor of successful defibrillation because myocardial damage can result from repeated futile defibrillation attempts. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) provides excellent time and frequency resolution of signals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether features based on CWT could predict successful defibrillation.
   Methods VF electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms stored in ambulance-located defibrillators were collected. Pre-defibrillation waveforms were divided into 1.0- or 5.12-s VF waveforms. Indices in frequency domain or nonlinear analysis were calculated on the 5.12-s waveform. Simultaneously, CWT was performed on the 1.0-s waveform, and total low-band (1-3 Hz), mid-band (3-10 Hz), and high-band (10-32 Hz) energy were calculated.
   Results In 152 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a total of 233 ECG predefibrillation recordings, consisting of 164 unsuccessful and 69 successful episodes, were analyzed. Indices of frequency domain analysis (peak frequency, centroid frequency, and amplitude spectral area), nonlinear analysis (approximate entropy and Hurst exponent, detrended fluctuation analysis), and CWT analysis (mid-band and high-band energy) were significantly different between unsuccessful and successful episodes (P < 0.01 for all). However, logistic regression analysis showed that centroid frequency and total mid-band energy were effective predictors (P < 0.01 for both).
   Conclusions Energy spectrum analysis based on CWT as short as a 1.0-s VF ECG waveform enables prompt and reliable prediction of successful defibrillation.

TI  - A 12-month quality of life assessment of cardiac arrest survivors treated with or without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
T2  - EUROPACE
AB  - Background Previous studies indicate that the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has a large impact on the quality of life of patients. The effects of having an ICD over longer periods of times has been less studied.
   Objective To assess the quality of life and well-being of cardiac arrest survivors who have received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or other treatment.
   Methods 168 patients were monitored for 1 year and completed four questionnaires.
   Results No differences were found between the two treatments regarding quality of life (except for pain, ICD patients perceived less pain) and well-being. A significant improvement in physical and social function, and in mental health was found in the first 6 months. Older patients (60 years or older) perceived less improvement in their health than younger patients. Women reported having poorer social function. The prevalence of anxiety and probable depression was high irrespective of the treatment received: anxiety and depressive symptoms did not change significantly between 1 and 12 months after discharge. Patients with higher anxiety scores experienced less improvement in health and patients with more depressive symptoms experienced poorer social function.
   Conclusions The prevalence of anxiety and probable depression was high in cardiac arrest survivors. Probable depression affected social function. Those patients who felt anxious experienced less health improvement. Quality of life and well-being were not affected by the type of treatment. We conclude that surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has a greater impact on patients than the treatment received (C) 2002 The European Society of Cardiology.

TI  - Brain Ischemia Activates β- and γ-Secretase Cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein: Significance in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Amyloid precursor protein cleavage through beta- and gamma-secretases produces beta-amyloid peptide, which is believed to be responsible for death of neurons and dementia in Alzheimer's disease. Levels of beta- and gamma-secretase are increased in sensitive areas of the Alzheimer's disease brain, but the mechanism of this process is unknown. In this review, we prove that brain ischemia generates expression and activity of both beta and gamma-secretases. These secretases are induced in association with oxidative stress following brain ischemia. Data suggest that ischemia promotes overproduction and aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide in brain, which is toxic for ischemic neuronal cells. In our review, we demonstrated the role of brain ischemia as a molecular link between the beta- and the gamma-secretase activities and provided a molecular explanation of the possible neuropathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Metformin-mediated mitochondrial protection post-cardiac arrest improves EEG activity and confers neuroprotection and survival benefit
T2  - FASEB JOURNAL
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) produces global ischemia/reperfusion injury resulting in substantial multiorgan damage. There are limited efficacious therapies to save lives despite CA being such a lethal disease process. The small population of surviving patients suffer extensive brain damage that results in substantial morbidity. Mitochondrial dysfunction in most organs after CA has been implicated as a major source of injury. Metformin, a first-line treatment for diabetes, has shown promising results in the treatment for other diseases and is known to interact with the mitochondria. For the treatment of CA, prior studies have utilized metformin in a preconditioning manner such that animals are given metformin well before undergoing CA. As the timing of CA is quite difficult to predict, the present study, in a clinically relevant manner, sought to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of metformin administration immediately after resuscitation using a 10 min asphxyial-CA rat model. This is the first study to show that metformin treatment post-CA (a) improves 72 h survival and neurologic function, (b) protects mitochondrial function with a reduction in apoptotic brain injury without activating AMPK, and (c) potentiates earlier normalization of brain electrophysiologic activity. Overall, as an effective and safe drug, metformin has the potential to be an easily translatable intervention for improving survival and preventing brain damage after CA.

TI  - Bedside interpretation of simplified continuous EEG after cardiac arrest
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background Continuous EEG-monitoring (cEEG) in the ICU is recommended to assess prognosis and detect seizures after cardiac arrest but implementation is often limited by the lack of EEG-technicians and experts. The aim of the study was to assess ICU physicians ability to perform preliminary interpretations of a simplified cEEG in the post cardiac arrest setting. Methods Five ICU physicians received training in interpretation of simplified cEEG - total training duration 1 day. The ICU physicians then interpreted 71 simplified cEEG recordings from 37 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The cEEG included amplitude-integrated EEG trends and two channels with original EEG-signals. Basic EEG background patterns and presence of epileptiform discharges or seizure activity were assessed on 5-grade rank-ordered scales based on standardized EEG terminology. An EEG-expert was used as reference. Results There was substantial agreement (kappa 0.69) for EEG background patterns and moderate agreement (kappa 0.43) for epileptiform discharges between ICU physicians and the EEG-expert. Sensitivity for detecting seizure activity by ICU physicians was limited (50%), but with high specificity (87%). Conclusions After cardiac arrest, preliminary bedside interpretations of simplified cEEGs by trained ICU physicians may allow earlier detection of clinically relevant cEEG changes, prompting changes in patient management as well as additional evaluation by an EEG-expert. This strategy requires awareness of limitations of both the simplified electrode montage and the cEEG interpretations performed by ICU physicians. cEEG evaluation by an expert should not be delayed.

TI  - Neuroprotection Is in the Air-Inhaled Gases on Their Way to the Neurons
T2  - CELLS
AB  - Cerebral injury is a leading cause of long-term disability and mortality. Common causes include major cardiovascular events, such as cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative as well as neuroinflammatory disorders. Despite improvements in pharmacological and interventional treatment options, due to the brain's limited regeneration potential, survival is often associated with the impairment of crucial functions that lead to occupational inability and enormous economic burden. For decades, researchers have therefore been investigating adjuvant therapeutic options to alleviate neuronal cell death. Although promising in preclinical studies, a huge variety of drugs thought to provide neuroprotective effects failed in clinical trials. However, utilizing medical gases, noble gases, and gaseous molecules as supportive treatment options may offer new perspectives for patients suffering neuronal damage. This review provides an overview of current research, potentials and mechanisms of these substances as a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of cerebral injury.

TI  - Recurrent cardiac arrest and complete atrioventricular block due to idiopathic coronary vasospasm: A case report
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Recurrent complete atrioventricular block induced by coronary spasm is rare. We present a case of a 47-year-old woman who suffered from two episodes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within one year due to complete atrioventricular block caused by coronary vasospasm. No implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted after her first episode. As for the second episode, permanent brain injury was left behind despite successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She underwent a challenging rehabilitation process and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted before discharge. We captured the dynamic changes of the electrocardiogram during the episode with high temporal resolution. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing coronary spasm as a potential cause of complete atrioventricular block and highlights the need for implantable cardioverter defibrillator in such patients to improve survival and quality of life.

TI  - Application of Phosphorylated Tau for Predicting Outcomes Among Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survivors
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - BackgroundPhosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), an early biomarker of neuronal damage, has emerged as a promising candidate for predicting neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors. Despite its potential, the correlation of p-Tau with other clinical indicators remains underexplored. This study assesses the predictive capability of p-Tau and its effectiveness when used in conjunction with other predictors.MethodsIn this single-center retrospective study, 230 CA survivors had plasma and brain computed tomography scans collected within 24 h after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from January 2016 to June 2023. The patients with prearrest Cerebral Performance Category scores >= 3 were excluded (n = 33). The neurological outcomes at discharge with Cerebral Performance Category scores 1-2 indicated favorable outcomes. Plasma p-Tau levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was recorded after ROSC, and the gray-to-white matter ratio (GWR) was calculated from brain computed tomography scans within 24 h after ROSC.ResultsOf 197 patients enrolled in the study, 54 (27.4%) had favorable outcomes. Regression analysis showed that higher p-Tau levels correlated with unfavorable neurological outcomes. The levels of p-Tau were significantly correlated with DBP and GWR. For p-Tau to differentiate between neurological outcomes, an optimal cutoff of 456 pg/mL yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. Combining p-Tau, GWR, and DBP improved predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.80 vs. 0.71, p = 0.008).ConclusionsPlasma p-Tau levels measured within 24 h following ROSC, particularly when combined with GWR and DBP, may serve as a promising biomarker of neurological outcomes in CA survivors, with higher levels predicting unfavorable outcomes.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and risk stratification in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome: Multicenter study in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Risk Stratification in Brugada Syndrome. Background: Neither the clinical characteristics nor risk stratification in Brugada syndrome have been clearly determined. We compared the clinical and ECG characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome to identify new markers for high-risk patients.
   Methods: A total of 188 consecutive individuals with Brugada syndrome (mean age 53 +/- 14 years, 178 males) were enrolled in the Japan Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation Study (J-IVFS). Clinical and ECG characteristics were evaluated in three groups of patients: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) group: patients with documented VF (N = 33); Syncope (Sy) group: patients with syncope without documented VF (N = 57); and asymptomatic (As) group: subjects without symptoms (N = 98). Their prognostic parameters were evaluated over a 3-year follow-up period.
   Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: incidence of past history of atrial fibrillation (AF) was significantly higher in the VF and Sy groups than in the AS group (P = 0.04). (2) On 12-lead ECG, r-J interval in lead V2 and QRS duration in lead V6 were longest in the VF group (P = 0.001, 0.002, respectively). (3) Clinical follow-up: during a mean follow-up period of 37 +/- 16 months, incidences of cardiac events (sudden death and/or VF) were higher in the symptomatic (VF/Sy) groups than in the As group (P < 0.0001). The r-J interval in lead V2 >= 90 ms and QRS duration in lead V6 >= 90 ms were found to be possible predictors of recurrence of cardiac events in symptomatic patients.
   Conclusions: Prolonged QRS duration in precordial leads was prominent in symptomatic patients. This ECG marker may be useful for distinguishing high- from low-risk patients with Brugada syndrome.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Telemetry for Hospitalized Patients With Low-risk Chest Pain
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - P>Background:
   The majority of chest pain admissions originate in the emergency department (ED). Despite a low incidence of cardiac events, limited telemetry availability, and its questionable benefit, these patients are routinely admitted to a monitored setting.
   Objectives:
   The objectives were to analyze the cost-effectiveness of admission to telemetry versus admission to an unmonitored hospital bed in low-risk chest pain patients and explore when the use of telemetry may be cost-effective.
   Methods:
   The authors constructed a decision analytic model to evaluate the scenario of an ED admission of an otherwise healthy 55-year-old patient with low-risk chest pain defined as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) probability of 2%. Costs were estimated from 2009 Medicare data for hospital reimbursement and physician services, as well as published data on disability costs. Published studies were used to estimate the risk of ACS, cardiac arrest, time to defibrillation, survival, long-term disability, and quality of life.
   Results:
   In the base case, telemetry was more effective (0.0044 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) but more costly ($299.67) than a floor bed, resulting in a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (mCER) of $67,484.55 per QALY. In comprehensive sensitivity analyses, the mCER crossed below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY when the following scenarios were met: the probability of ACS exceeds 3%, the probability of cardiac arrest is greater than 0.4%, the probability of shockable dysrhythmia is above 83%, the probability of delay in telemetry bed availability is below 52%, and the opportunity cost of delay to telemetry bed placement is below $119.
   Conclusions:
   Telemetry may be a "cost-effective" use of health care resources for chest pain patients when patients have a probability of ACS above 3% or for patients with a minimal delay and cost associated with obtaining a monitored bed. Further research is needed to better stratify low-risk chest pain patients to the appropriate inpatient setting and to understand the frequency and costs associated with delays in obtaining monitored beds.

TI  - Tailoring nutrition therapy to illness and recovery
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Without doubt, in medicine as in life, one size does not fit all. We do not administer the same drug or dose to every patient at all times, so why then would we live under the illusion that we should give the same nutrition at all times in the continuum of critical illness? We have long lived under the assumption that critical illness and trauma lead to a consistent early increase in metabolic/caloric need, the so-called "hypermetabolism" of critical illness. What if this is incorrect? Recent data indicate that early underfeeding of calories (trophic feeding) may have benefits and may require consideration in well-nourished patients. However, we must confront the reality that currently ICU nutrition delivery worldwide is actually leading to "starvation" of our patients and is likely a major contributor to poor long-term quality of life outcomes. To begin to ascertain the actual calorie and protein delivery required for optimal ICU recovery, an understanding of "starvation" and recovery from starvation and lean body mass (LBM) loss is needed. To begin to answer this question, we must look to the landmark Minnesota Starvation Study from 1945. This trial defines much of the world's knowledge about starvation, and most importantly what is required for recovery from starvation and massive LBM loss as occurs in the ICU. Recent and historic data indicate that critical illness is characterized by early massive catabolism, LBM loss, and escalating hypermetabolism that can persist for months or years. Early enteral nutrition during the acute phase should attempt to correct micronutrient/vitamin deficiencies, deliver adequate protein, and moderate nonprotein calories in well-nourished patients, as in the acute phase they are capable of generating significant endogenous energy. Post resuscitation, increasing protein (1.5-2.0 g/kg/day) and calories are needed to attenuate LBM loss and promote recovery. Malnutrition screening is essential and parenteral nutrition can be safely added following resuscitation when enteral nutrition is failing based on pre-illness malnutrition and LBM status. Following the ICU stay, significant protein/calorie delivery for months or years is required to facilitate functional and LBM recovery, with high-protein oral supplements being essential to achieve adequate nutrition.

TI  - Low frequency power in cerebral blood flow is a biomarker of neurologic injury in the acute period after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: Cardiac arrest often results in severe neurologic injury. Improving care for these patients is difficult as few noninvasive biomarkers exist that allow physicians to monitor neurologic health. The amount of low-frequency power (LFP, 0.01-0.1 Hz) in cerebral haemodynamics has been used in functional magnetic resonance imaging as a marker of neuronal activity. Our hypothesis was that increased LFP in cerebral blood flow (CBF) would be correlated with improvements in invasive measures of neurologic health.
   Methods: We adapted the use of LFP for to monitoring of CBF with diffuse correlation spectroscopy. We asked whether LFP (or other optical biomarkers) correlated with invasive microdialysis biomarkers (lactate-pyruvate ratio - LPR - and glycerol concentration) of neuronal injury in the 4 h after return of spontaneous circulation in a swine model of paediatric cardiac arrest (Sus scrofa domestica, 8-11 kg, 51% female). Associations were tested using a mixed linear effects model.
   Results: We found that higher LFP was associated with higher LPR and higher glycerol concentration. No other biomarkers were associated with LPR; cerebral haemoglobin concentration, oxygen extraction fraction, and one EEG metric were associated with glycerol concentration.
   Conclusion: Contrary to expectations, higher LFP in CBF was correlated with worse invasive biomarkers. Higher LFP may represent higher neurologic activity, or disruptions in neurovascular coupling. Either effect may be harmful in the acute period after cardiac arrest. Thus, these results suggest our methodology holds promise for development of new, clinically relevant biomarkers than can guide resuscitation and postresuscitation care.

AB  - To assess possible age-related differences in the time of occurrence (hour of the day, day of the week, month of the year) of cardiopulmonary collapses of presumed cardiac etiology, 3,305 out-of-hospital patients registered by the Belgian Cardiopulmonary-Cerebral Resuscitation Study Group between 1983 and 1990 were studied. Occurrence of call-time was separately tabulated for patients less than Versus above 60 years of age and tested for differences with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test, Only the circadian patterns of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of presumed cardiac etiology showed a significant difference between the two age-groups; the prominent morning peak (6 a.m.-10 a.m.) in incidence was less pronounced in the younger age-group. The overall incidence is lower in the summer and during mid-week, These trends are similar for both age-groups.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Technology-Based Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training on the Skills and Knowledge of Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for adolescents is a prominent strategy to increase the number of community first responders who can recognize cardiac arrest and initiate CPR. More schools are adopting technology-based CPR training modalities to reduce class time and reliance on instructor availability and increase their capacity for wider training dissemination. However, it remains unclear whether these technology-based modalities are comparable with standard training.
   Objective: This study aimed to systematically review and perform meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based CPR training on adolescents' CPR skills and knowledge.
   Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and Scopus from inception to June 25, 2021. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared technology-based training with standard training for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Studies were appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (The Cochrane Collaboration). Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Overall certainty of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.
   Results: Seventeen RCTs involving 5578 adolescents were included. Most of the studies had unclear risks of selection bias (9/17, 53%) and high risks of performance bias (16/17, 94%). Interventions that included instructor guidance increased the likelihood of adolescents checking the responsiveness of the person experiencing cardiac arrest (risk ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.19-1.63) and calling the emergency medical services (risk ratio 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.24). Self-directed technology-based CPR training without instructor guidance was associated with poorer overall skill performance (Cohen d=-0.74, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.45). Training without hands-on practice increased mean compression rates (mean difference 9.38, 95% CI 5.75-13.01), whereas real-time feedback potentially yielded slower compression rates. Instructor-guided training with hands-on practice (Cohen d=0.45, 95% CI 0.13-0.78) and the use of computer programs or mobile apps (Cohen d=0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.86) improved knowledge scores. However, certainty of evidence was very low.
   Conclusions: Instructor-guided technology-based CPR training that includes hands-on practice and real-time feedback is noninferior to standard training in CPR skills and knowledge among adolescents. Our findings supported the use of technology-based components such as videos, computer programs, or mobile apps for self-directed theoretical instruction. However, instructor guidance, hands-on practice, and real-time feedback are still necessary components of training to achieve better learning outcomes for adolescents. Such a blended learning approach may reduce class time and reliance on instructor availability. Because of the high heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution. More high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes and follow-up data are needed. Finally, technology-based training can be considered a routine refresher training modality in schools for future research.

TI  - Impact of perceived inappropiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation on emergency clinicians' intention to leave the job: Results from a cross-sectional survey in 288 centres across 24 countries
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients with a poor prognosis increases the risk of perception of inappropriate care leading to moral distress in clinicians. We evaluated whether perception of inappropriate CPR is associated with intention to leave the job among emergency clinicians.
   Methods: A cross-sectional multi-centre survey was conducted in 24 countries. Factors associated with intention to leave the job were analysed by conditional logistic regression models.
   Results are expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of 5099 surveyed emergency clinicians, 1836 (36.0%) were physicians, 1313 (25.7%) nurses, 1950 (38.2%) emergency medical technicians. Intention to leave the job was expressed by 1721 (33.8%) clinicians, 3403 (66.7%) often wondered about the appropriateness of a resuscitation attempt, 2955 (58.0%) reported moral distress caused by inappropriate CPR. After adjustment for other covariates, the risk of intention to leave the job was higher in clinicians often wondering about the appropriateness of a resuscitation attempt (1.43 [1.23-1.67]), experiencing associated moral distress (1.44 [1.24 -1.66]) and who were between 30-44 years old (1.53 [1.21-1.92] compared to <30 years). The risk was lower when the clinician felt valued by the team (0.53 [0.42-0.66]), when the team leader acknowledged the efforts delivered by the team (0.61 [0.49-0.75]) and in teams that took time for debriefing (0.70 [0.60-0.80]).
   Conclusion: Resuscitation attempts perceived as inappropriate by clinicians, and the accompanying moral distress, were associated with an increased likelihood of intention to leave the job. Interprofessional collaboration, teamwork, and regular interdisciplinary debriefing were associated with a lower risk of intention to leave the job.

TI  - Differential placental DNA methylation of VEGFA and LEP in small-for-gestational age fetuses with an abnormal cerebroplacental ratio
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   In Fetal Growth Restriction 'fetal programming' may take place via DNA methylation, which has implications for short-term and long-term health outcomes. Small-for-gestational age fetuses are considered fetal growth restricted, characterized by brain-sparing when fetal Doppler hemodynamics are abnormal, expressed as a cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) < 1. We aimed to determine whether brain-sparing is associated with altered DNA methylation of selected genes.
   Methods
   We compared DNA methylation of six genes in 41 small-for-gestational age placentas with a normal or abnormal CPR. We selected EPO, HIF1A, VEGFA, LEP, PHLDA2, and DHCR24 for their role in angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and placental and fetal growth. DNA methylation was analyzed by pyrosequencing.
   Results
   Growth restricted fetuses with an abnormal CPR showed hypermethylation of the VEGFA gene at one CpG (VEGFA-309, p =.001) and an overall hypomethylation of the LEP gene, being significant at two CpGs (LEP-123, p =.049; LEP-51, p =.020). No differences in methylation were observed for the other genes.
   Conclusions
   VEGFA and LEP genes are differentially methylated in placentas of small-for-gestational age fetuses with brain-sparing. Hypermethylation of VEGFA-309 in abnormal CPR-placentas could indicate successful compensatory mechanisms. Methylation of LEP-51 is known to suppress LEP expression. Hypomethylation in small-for-gestational age placentas with abnormal CPR may result in hyperleptinemia and predispose to leptin-resistance later in life.

TI  - The need for improving access to emergency care through community involvement in low- and middle-income countries: A case study of cardiac arrest in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients require immediate interventions by bystanders and emergency medical services (EMS). However, in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), bystanders witnessing a cardiac arrest rarely perform chest compressions and contact EMS. This paper attempts to draw lessons from a case of a patient with a cardiac arrest who could have survived with immediate interventions. A 40 year old man collapsed following electrocution at a construction site. His colleagues immediately transferred him to hospital via taxi, without performing chest compressions. At the hospital he showed ventricular fibrillation; resuscitation attempts failed and he died. Ventricular fibrillation due to electrocution is a benign type of cardiac arrest. The chance of survival increases with immediate chest compressions and prompt defibrillation. We discuss the reasons why the bystanders did not perform resuscitation or contact EMS and identify approaches for the improvement of pre-hospital care in LMICs.

TI  - Anesthetics and intensive therapeutic aspects of liver transplantation
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - One of the most prominent results of our age is organ transplantation, the single treatment option for patients with end-stage organ failure. The success of transplants depends on the donor care, the patient preoperative preassessment, the perioperative care of organ transplantation and aftercare. Successful transplantation therefore requires a prominent level of continuous collaboration between the surgeon, anaesthesiologist, radiologist, internal medicine and hepatologist, laboratory physician and almost all their associates. The complex interdisciplinary approach based on the research results can be used to improve the patient's condition through pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy and psychotherapy during the time spent on waiting lists. The emergence of more active, targeted therapeutic options in perioperative graft resuscitation may help the currently inferior quality transplantable grafts or resuscitation out (machine perfusion) or in the recipient, thereby increasing the number of liver transplants. Deeper knowledge of hemostatic processes, along with the development of surgical techniques, would increase the number of blood transplant free transplants, thus improving the long-term survival of grafts. The present study aims at presenting the anaesthesia and early intensive therapy aspects of liver transplantation from aptitude assessment, through anaesthesia to early intensive therapeutic treatment.

TI  - Lipidomics Detection of Brain Cardiolipins in Plasma Is Associated With Outcome After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Brain mitochondrial dysfunction limits neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest. Brain polyunsaturated cardiolipins, mitochondria-unique and functionally essential phospholipids, have unprecedented diversification. Since brain cardiolipins are not present in plasma normally, we hypothesized their appearance would correlate with brain injury severity early after cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation.
   Design: Observational case-control study.
   Setting: Two medical centers within one city. Participants (Subjects): We enrolled 41 adult cardiac arrest patients in whom blood could be obtained within 6 hours of re-suscitation. Two subjects were excluded following outlier analysis. Ten healthy subjects were controls. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in asphyxial cardiac arrest studies.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: We developed a high-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method and determined cardiolipins speciation in human brain, heart, and plasma within 6 hours of (return of spontaneous circulation) from 39 patients with cardiac arrest, 5 with myocardial infarction, and 10 healthy controls. Cerebral score was derived from brain-specific cardiolipins identified in plasma of patients with varying neurologic injury and outcome. Using a rat model of cardiac arrest, cardiolipins were quantified in plasma, brain, and heart. Human brain exhibited a highly diverse cardiolipinome compared with heart that allowed the identification of brainspecific cardiolipins. Nine of 26 brain-specific cardiolipins were detected in plasma and correlated with brain injury. The cerebral score correlated with early neurologic injury and predicted discharge neurologic/functional outcome. Cardiolipin (70: 5) emerged as a potential point-of-care marker predicting injury severity and outcome. In rat cardiac arrest, a significant reduction in hippocampal cardiolipins corresponded to their release from the brain into systemic circulation. Cerebral score was significantly increased in 10 minutes versus 5 minutes no-flow cardiac arrest and naive controls.
   Conclusions: Brain-specific cardiolipins accumulate in plasma early after return of spontaneous circulation and proportional to neurologic injury representing a promising novel biomarker.

TI  - Parental Knowledge of Cardiovascular Screening and Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Youth Athletes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in youth athletes. Survival from out- of-hospital SCA depends on prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). This study evaluated parental knowledge, experience, and attitudes related to cardiovascular screening, SCA, and CPR/AED use in youth athletes and made comparisons between parents who are employed in healthcare and parents who are not employed in healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to evaluate knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of 91 parents of youth athletes who attended a community-based cardiovascular screening event. Although cardiovascular screening can reduce the risk of SCA, we found that 36% of parents incorrectly thought cardiovascular screening could prevent SCA and there was no difference in knowledge between the two groups of parents. This initial evaluation of parental knowledge of cardiovascular screening issues in youth athletes should guide educational efforts to prevent and respond to SCA in youth athletes.

TI  - Cost-utility of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE
AB  - Background:
   The use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cardiogenic shock keeps increasing, but its cost-utility is unknown.
   Methods:
   We studied retrospectively the cost-utility of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a five-year cohort of consequent patients treated due to refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest in a transplant centre in 2013-2017. In our centre, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is considered for all cardiogenic shock patients potentially eligible for heart transplantation, and for selected postcardiotomy patients. We assessed the costs of the index hospitalization and of the one-year hospital costs, and the patients' health-related quality of life (response rate 71.7%). Based on the data and the population-based life expectancies, we calculated the amount and the costs of quality-adjusted life years gained both without discount and with an annual discount of 3.5%.
   Results:
   The cohort included 102 patients (78 cardiogenic shock; 24 cardiac arrest) of whom 67 (65.7%) survived to discharge and 66 (64.7%) to one year. The effective costs per one hospital survivor were 242,303euro. Median in-hospital costs of the index hospitalization per patient were 129,967euro (interquartile range 150,340euro). Mean predicted number of quality-adjusted life years gained by the treatment was 20.9 (standard deviation 9.7) without discount, and the median cost per quality-adjusted life year was 7474euro (interquartile range 10,973euro). With the annual discount of 3.5%, 13.0 (standard deviation 4.8) quality-adjusted life years were gained with the cost of 12,642euro per quality-adjusted life year (interquartile range 15,059euro).
   Conclusions:
   We found the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest justified from the cost-utility point of view in a transplant centre setting.

TI  - Rapidly progressive obstructive bioprosthetic valve thrombosis after surgical aortic valve replacement: a case report
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis (BPVT) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication following aortic valve replacement. The optimal management approach, whether surgical intervention or thrombolytic therapy, is controversial.Case summary A 65-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnoea, and echocardiography confirmed severe aortic valve stenosis. Following minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, the patient was discharged on postoperative Day 7 without complications. However, he returned on post-operative Day 113 with acute chest pain and dyspnoea, resulting in cardiac arrest that required extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Subsequent transoesophageal echocardiography revealed significant thrombus formation on the bioprosthetic valve, leading to reoperation and implantation of a new bioprosthetic valve.Discussion This case illustrates the rapid progression to obstructive BPVT following discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. It underscores the potential risk of BPVT despite appropriate anticoagulation. The incidence of BPVT may be underestimated, highlighting the necessity for further investigation into associated risk factors and preventive strategies. Acknowledging the unusual occurrence of BPVT, prompt diagnosis with echocardiographic screening and vigilant follow-up are essential to prevent severe complications such as rapid clinical deterioration and cardiac arrest.

TI  - Higher bilirubin on admission predicts better outcome in refractory cardiac arrest: A Prague OHCA trial analysis focused on the antioxidant effect of bilirubin
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Although bilirubin is a proven antioxidant substance and a protective factor against the development of various diseases, in emergency medicine, its increased concentration is considered solely a marker of organ damage and negative prognosis. However, clinical data on the role of bilirubin in cardiac arrest (CA) and reperfusion injury, are sparse. The presented study investigates the protective effects of increased serum bilirubin concentrations and genetic determinants (UGT1A1 promoter variations) on the outcomes of patients with refractory out-of-hospital CA (r-OHCA) in a randomized population. Methods: Between March 1, 2013, and October 25, 2020, 256 randomized Prague OHCA patients with r-OHCA were evaluated for inclusion and categorized as having increased (>10 mmol/l) or low/normal serum bilirubin concentrations on hospital arrival and present or absent genetic variations for mild hyperbilirubinemia. The primary outcome was survival with a good neurological outcome (defined as cerebral performance category 1-2) 180 days after randomization. Results: Finally, 164 patients were included in the bilirubin concentration analysis. Favorable neurological survival after 180 days occurred in 50 of 99 patients (50.5 %) in the group with higher initial serum bilirubin concentrations and 18 of 65 patients (27.7 %) in the low-bilirubin group (absolute difference 22.8 [8.1-37.5]; P = 0.006). The effect persisted also in multivariable analysis (OR for favorable outcome = 3.02 [95 % CI = 1.16-7.84]; P = 0.023). Genetic predisposition for mild hyperbilirubinemia was not associated with any patient outcomes. Conclusions: A higher initial serum bilirubin concentration predicts better outcomes in patients with refractory OHCA regardless of the treatment used. UGT1A1 gene promotor variations are not associated with refractory OHCA patient outcomes.

TI  - Beyond Standard Shocks: A Critical Review of Alternative Defibrillation Strategies in Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Refractory ventricular fibrillation (RVF) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the persistence of ventricular fibrillation despite multiple defibrillation attempts. It represents a critical challenge in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest management, with poor survival outcomes and limited guidance from current resuscitation guidelines. In recent years, alternative defibrillation strategies (ADSs), including dual sequential external defibrillation (DSED) and vector change defibrillation (VCD), have emerged as potential interventions to improve defibrillation success and patient outcomes. However, their clinical utility remains debated due to heterogeneous evidence and limited high-quality data. Methods: This narrative review explores the current landscape of ADSs in patients with RVF. MEDLINE, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization, LitCovid NLM, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library were examined from their inception to April 2025. Results: The available literature is dominated by retrospective studies and case series, with only one randomized controlled trial (DOSE-VF). This trial demonstrated improved survival to hospital discharge with ADSs compared to standard defibrillation. DSED was associated with higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurological outcomes. However, subsequent meta-analyses have produced inconsistent results, largely due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. The absence of sex-, gender-, and ethnicity-specific analyses further limits the generalizability of the findings. In addition, practical barriers, such as equipment availability, pose significant challenges to implementation. Conclusions: ADSs represent a promising yet still-evolving approach to the management of RVF, with DSED showing the most consistent signal of benefit. Further high-quality research is required to enhance generalizability and generate more definitive, high-level evidence.

TI  - Preparation, attitudes and behaviour in nonhospital cardiac emergencies: Evaluating a community's readiness to act
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
CP  - HSFO Annual Education Conference
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how people in a moderately sized Ontario city believe they will react ii they witness someone collapsing.
   DESIGN: Telephone survey.
   SETTING: The cities of Kitchener and Waterloo, pare of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, with a combined population of 378,000.
   PARTICIPANTS: Households were randomly contacted and a questionnaire was administered, provided the respondent was over 44 years of age and agreed to be interviewed. Of 2479 households with eligible respondents, 811 (33%) completed the questionnaire.
   OUTCOMES: Age, sex, educational level, cardiac risk factors and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training of respondents were determined, as well as actions they would cake if cardiac arrest occurred in a family member at home or in stranger in the street, and associated emotions and barriers to implementing actions.
   RESULTS: Among the first three actions that respondents who were not prompted with possible responses said they would take, 311 (72%) witnessing a collapse at home, compared with 166 (44%) witnessing a collapse on the street, would call 911, the police or an ambulance. Other 'first three actions' in home collapse were checking for breathing (120 [28%]), checking for pulse (91 [21%]) and administering CPR (34 [8%]); these actions were less commonly selected in response to a strangers collapse and when respondents were not prompted. Respondents felt they would be more likely to perform CPR on a friend than on a stranger (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58). When asked how likely they would be to perform specific acts when witnessing a collapse, 254 (69%) of respondents thought they would call their family doctor and 179 (48%) thought they were likely to begin chest compressions. Barriers to performing CPR centred around legalities and disease transmission.
   CONCLUSION: Older people do not know how to act effectively in a cardiac emergency. Traditional CPR and public awareness programs have been ineffective in reaching this population; alternative means are required to help the public respond more effectively to cardiac emergencies.

TI  - The train the trainer model for the propagation of resuscitation knowledge in limited resource settings: A systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: The Train the Trainer (TTT) model is increasingly used in limited resource settings as a mechanism to disseminate resuscitation knowledge and skills among providers. Anecdotally, however, many resuscitation programs that use this model fail to achieve sustainability.
   Objective: We aim to systematically review the literature to describe the evidence for the TTT method of knowledge dissemination for resuscitation courses in limited resource settings. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature in accordance with PRISMA guidelines of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLARS online (MEDLINE), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases.
   Results: Eleven manuscripts met inclusion criteria, the majority (7/11) focused on neonatal resuscitation. We found strong evidence for the TTT model for imparting knowledge and skills on providers, however, little evidence exists for the impact of these programs on patient outcomes or long term sustainability. Facilitators associated with successful programming include the use of language and resource appropriate materials, support from the Ministry of Health of the country, and economic support for supplies and salaries.
   Conclusion: While the TTT model of programming for the dissemination of resuscitation education is promising, further research is necessary especially relating to sustainability and impact on patient outcomes. Familiarity with the local environment, language, culture, resources and economic realities prior to the initiation of programming is key to success.

TI  - The association of chronic health status and survival following ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest: Investigation of a primary myocardial mechanism
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Quantitative waveform measures are a surrogate of the acute physiological status of the myocardium and predict survival following ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We investigated whether the amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) waveform measure mediates the adverse relationship between increasing burden of chronic health conditions and lower likelihood of survival.
   Methods: We performed a cohort investigation of persons = 18 years who suffered ventricular fibrillation OHCA between 2008-2015 in a metropolitan emergency medical service (EMS) system. The count of chronic health conditions was determined using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). AMSA was calculated just prior to the initial shock. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between CCI and survival-to-discharge in models first without and then with AMSA to determine the extent to which AMSA attenuated the CCI-survival association.
   Results: Of the 716 eligible patients, 422/716 (59%) had at least one chronic health condition; 21.8% with one, 19.6% with two, 10.3% with 3, and 7.3% with >= 4. Survival-to-discharge was 45% (324/716). In the multivariable model adjusted for traditional Utstein characteristics, increasing CCI was associated with lower odds of survival (Odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval] = 0.82 [0.72, 0.93] for each additional chronic health condition). The addition of AMSA to the model only modestly attenuated the CCI-survival association (OR = 0.85 [0.74,0.98]).
   Conclusion: The waveform measure AMSA- a surrogate for the physiological status of the myocardium- mediated only a modest portion of the association between increasing burden of chronic health conditions and lower likelihood of survival following ventricular fibrillation OHCA.

TI  - Comparison of the impact of longitudinal body mass index changes on cardiac arrest risk between normal and overweight populations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CACHEXIA SARCOPENIA AND MUSCLE
AB  - Background Being overweight is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the impact of longitudinal changes in body mass index (BMI) on the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) remains unclear, especially among overweight populations. Methods This nested case-control study utilized data from the Korean National Health Information Database between 2009 and 2018. A total of 23 453 OHCA patients, who underwent national health check-ups within 1 and 2-4 years before OHCA occurrence, and 31 686 controls, who underwent similar national health check-ups, were included. The study population was matched for sex, age and survival status. Conditional logistic regression was employed to analyse the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each BMI per cent change in assessing the risk of OHCA occurrence within 1 year. Results A reverse J-shaped association between BMI per cent change and OHCA risk was observed, even among overweight populations. Among the overweight populations, weight loss significantly increased OHCA risk, with ORs (95% CI) of 4.10 (3.23-5.20) for severe weight loss (BMI decrease > 15%), 2.72 (2.33-3.17) for moderate weight loss (BMI decrease 10-15%) and 1.46 (1.35-1.59) for mild weight loss (BMI decrease 5-10%). Conversely, mild weight gain (BMI increase 5-10%) did not significantly increase OHCA risk. The impact of weight changes on the occurrence of OHCA differed by sex, being more prominent in males. Conclusions Significant weight changes within a 4-year period increase the risk of OHCA with a reverse J-shaped association, even among overweight and obese individuals. Maintaining a stable weight could be a reliable public health strategy irrespective of the weight status, particularly for males.

TI  - Pleth Variability Index or Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index? Prospective Observational Study in Volume Control and Follow-Up Acute Kidney Injury
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objective: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious condition requiring prompt fluid resuscitation, yet both under- and over-treatment carry risks. Accurate volume assessment is essential, especially in emergency settings. The Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index (IVCCI) is commonly used but has limitations. The Pleth Variability Index (PVI) offers a non-invasive alternative, though its role in AKI remains unclear. To compare the efficacy of the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) and Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index (IVCCI) in assessing fluid responsiveness and predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 50 adult AKI patients presenting to a tertiary emergency department. All patients received sequential fluid resuscitation with 1000 mL and 2000 mL of isotonic saline. PVI, IVCCI, mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2), perfusion index (PI), and shock index (SI) were recorded at baseline and after each fluid bolus. Changes in these parameters were analyzed to assess their utility in fluid responsiveness. Additionally, the prognostic value of baseline PVI for in-hospital mortality was investigated. Results: PVI demonstrated a significant and dose-responsive decrease following fluid administration, outperforming IVCCI, MAP, PI, SpO(2), and SI in sensitivity (p < 0.001). Baseline PVI values were significantly associated with mortality (AUC: 0.821, p < 0.001), whereas post-resuscitation PVI values showed no prognostic significance. IVCCI and PI showed comparable reliability but were less sensitive to incremental volume changes. Conclusions: PVI is a sensitive, non-invasive marker of fluid responsiveness in non-intubated AKI patients and may also serve as an early prognostic indicator. Its use in emergency departments could support fluid management decisions, but further large-scale, multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings.

TI  - Gaps in Public Access Defibrillation Analysis of International Legislation
T2  - JACC-ADVANCES
AB  - BACKGROUND Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health issue, for which rapid public access defibrillation (PAD) increases survival. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate international legislation relating to PAD and develop legal recommendations to improve PAD in OHCA. METHODS Searches covering 5 domains (automated external defibrillator [AED] provision, funding, identification, maintenance, lay responder training) were conducted in 99 jurisdictions worldwide: United States (50) and Canada (13) analyzed at state/province level; 36 other countries analyzed at national level. Forty-nine legislation sources were searched from September 27, 2021, to May 5, 2022. Legislative data were classified: Enabling Legislation (facilitating PAD) or Disabling Legislation (hindering PAD). Based on retrieved data, recommendations for international AED laws were developed. RESULTS Searches identified 419,248 legal records. Enabling Legislation regarding AED provision in public areas was present in 60% U.S. states, 8% Canadian provinces, and 22% of nations studied from the rest of world. Disabling Legislation regarding registration of AEDs, that could potentially discourage AED ownership, was found in 37 North American jurisdictions. Enabling Legislation regarding AED signage was found in 66% U.S. states and 39% of all jurisdictions worldwide. Overall, 48% of worldwide jurisdictions studied had legislative requirements for AED maintenance, including 80% of all U.S. states. Internationally, 49.5% of jurisdictions studied had Enabling Legislation mandating AED training, and 66% United States had this for schools. Only 4 jurisdictions worldwide gave implicit authorization to laypersons for AED use in emergencies. CONCLUSIONS There is significant variability in international legislation relating to PAD. All countries should consider Enabling Legislation that could decrease delays to PAD. Similarly, Disabling Legislation potentially hindering prompt PAD during OHCA should be withdrawn.

TI  - Acetate- versus lactate-buffered crystalloid solutions: A systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Objective There is a widespread use of buffered crystalloid solutions in clinical practice. However, guidelines do not distinguish between specific types of buffered solutions and clinical equipoise exists. We aimed to assess the desirable and undesirable effects of acetate- versus lactate-buffered solutions in hospitalised patients. Methods We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised clinical trials assessing the use of acetate- versus lactate-buffered solutions for intravenous administration in hospitalised adults and children. The primary outcome was all-cause short-term mortality. We adhered to our published protocol, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, the Cochrane Handbook and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results We included five RCTs enrolling 390 patients. We found no statistically significant difference in short-term mortality (random effects, risk ratio [RR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-1.51, p = .14, I-2 = 0%) or hospital length of stay (LOS) (random effects, mean difference [MD]-1.31, 95% CI -3.66 to 1.05, p = .28, I-2 = 0%) between acetate- versus lactate-buffered solutions. The quality of evidence was very low. Data regarding intensive care unit LOS were reported by three trials and duration of vasopressor treatment by one trial; none of these data allowed for pooling in meta-analyses. No trials reported data on long-term mortality, health-related quality of life, adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy. Conclusion In this systematic review, we found very low quantity and quality of evidence on the use of acetate- versus lactate-buffered solutions in hospitalised patients.

TI  - A selective α2-adrenergic agonist for cardiac resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF LABORATORY AND CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The effects of selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist alpha-methylnorepinephrine on the initial success of resuscitation and postresuscitation myocardial function were compared with nonselective alpha- and beta-adrenergic epinephrine in a swine model of cardiac arrest. Epinephrine, the primary pharmacological intervention in the treatment of cardiac arrest, improves immediate outcome. However, epinephrine increases the severity of myocardial dysfunction after cardiac resuscitation. Both inotropic and chronotropic actions provoke disproportionate increases in myocardial oxygen consumption by the ischemic heart, prompting this study, in which we hypothesized that a selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, alpha-methylnorepinephrine (alpha-MNE), would moderate these adverse effects of epinephrine and minimize postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. After 7 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 14 anesthetized male domestic pigs, precordial compression at a fixed rate of 80 compressions/min was begun, along with mechanical ventilation. Either alpha-MNE (100 mug/kg) or epinephrine (20 mug/kg) was administered as a bogus after 2 minutes of precordial compression. After an additional 4 minutes of precordial compression, defibrillation was attempted. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was quantitated with the use of transesophageal echo-Doppler imaging. Comparable increases in coronary perfusion pressure to 15 mm Hg were observed after the administration of both drugs. All animals were successfully resuscitated; epinephrine and alpha-MNE were equally quick in restoring spontaneous circulation after 7 minutes of untreated VF. Ejection fraction was reduced by 35% and 14% by epinephrine and alpha-MNE, respectively, after resuscitation. Epinephrine and alpha-MNE increased postresuscitation heart rate by 38% and 15%, respectively. Accordingly, significantly less postresuscitation impairment followed the administration of alpha-MNE. alpha-MNE, a selective alpha-adrenergic agonist, was as effective as epinephrine in restoring spontaneous circulation after 7 minutes of untreated VF in a porcine model for CPR and demonstrated lesser postresuscitation myocardial injury.

TI  - Epidemiology of Arrhythmias and Sudden Cardiac Death in Asia
T2  - CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB  - Cardiac arrhythmias are cardiac rhythm disorders that comprise an important epidemiological and public health problem. Cardiac arrhythmias are significantly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular complications and sudden death, consequently leading to decreased quality of life, disability, high mortality, and healthcare expense. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, and has been further increasing with the aging of society. Although the prevalence is relatively lower in Asians than in Westerners, the prognostic impacts on stroke and mortality in Asians are comparable. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in approximately 40 cases per 100,000 persons annually in each country of Asia. Most cases are caused by myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, but the proportion of myocardial infarction is lower in Asia than in Western countries. The primary electrophysiological disorders related to channelopathies, such as long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are estimated to be responsible for 10% of SCDs. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation has become established as an effective secondary prevention for SCD, and numbers have been increasing annually worldwide. New insights into arrhythmic diseases have been emerging from epidemiological, clinical, and genetic research, and contribute to improvements in diagnosis and prognosis.

TI  - The use of mice and rats as animal models for cardiopulmonary resuscitation research
T2  - LABORATORY ANIMALS
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after the induction of cardiac arrest (CA) has been studied in mice and rats. The anatomical and physiological parameters of the cardiopulmonary system of these two species have been defined during experimental studies and are comparable with those of humans. Moreover, these animal models are more ethical to establish and are easier to manipulate, when compared with larger experimental animals. Accordingly, the effects of successful CPR on the function of vital organs, such as the brain, have been investigated because damage to these vital organs is of concern in CA survivors. Furthermore, the efficacy of several drugs, such as adrenaline (epinephrine), vasopressin and nitroglycerin, has been evaluated for use in CA in these small animal models. The purpose of these studies is not only to increase the rate of survival of CA victims, but also to improve their quality of life by reducing damage to their vital organs after CA and during CPR.

TI  - Influence of physical strain at high altitude on the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background High quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a key factor in survival with good overall quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Current evidence is predominantly based on studies conducted at low altitude, and do not take into account the special circumstances of alpine rescue missions. We therefore aimed to investigate the influence of physical strain at high altitude on the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods Alpine field study. Twenty experienced mountaineers of the Austrian Mountain Rescue Service trained in Basic Life Support (BLS) performed BLS on a manikin in groups of two for 16 min. The scenario was executed at baseline altitude and immediately after a quick ascent over an altitude difference of 1200 m at 3454 m above sea level. The sequence of scenarios was randomised for a cross over analysis. Quality of CPR and exhaustion of participants (vital signs, Borg-Scale, Nine hole peg test) were measured and compared between high altitude and baseline using random-effects linear regression models. Results The primary outcome of chest compression depth significantly decreased at high altitude compared to baseline by 1 cm (95% CI 0.5 to 1.3 cm, p < 0.01). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of chest compressions in the target depth (at least 5 cm pressure depth) by 55% (95% CI 29 to 82%, p < 0.01) and in the duration of the release phase by 75 ms (95% CI 48 to 101 ms, p < 0.01). No significant difference was found regarding hands-off times, compression frequency or exhaustion. Conclusion Physical strain during a realistic alpine rescue mission scenario at high altitude led to a significant reduction in quality of resuscitation. Resuscitation guidelines developed at sea level are not directly applicable in the mountain terrain.

TI  - The importance of the viable but non-culturable state in human bacterial pathogens
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Many bacterial species have been found to exist in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state since its discovery in 1982. VBNC cells are characterized by a loss of culturability on routine agar, which impairs their detection by conventional plate count techniques. This leads to an underestimation of total viable cells in environmental or clinical samples, and thus poses a risk to public health. In this review, we present recent findings on the VBNC state of human bacterial pathogens. The characteristics of VBNC cells, including the similarities and differences to viable, culturable cells and dead cells, and different detection methods are discussed. Exposure to various stresses can induce the VBNC state, and VBNC cells may be resuscitated back to culturable cells under suitable stimuli. The conditions that trigger the induction of the VBNC state and resuscitation from it are summarized and the mechanisms underlying these two processes are discussed. Last but not least, the significance of VBNC cells and their potential influence on human health are also reviewed.

AB  - It is well documented that transplants save lives and improve quality of life for patients suffering from kidney, liver, and heart failure. Uncontrolled donation after cardiac death (UDCD) is an effective and ethical alternative to existing efforts towards increasing the available pool of organs. However, people who die from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are currently being denied the opportunity to be organ donors except in those few locations where out-of-hospital UDCD programs are active, such as in Paris, Madrid, and Barcelona. Societies have the medical and moral obligation to develop UDCD programs.

TI  - Erythropoietin: Powerful protection of ischemic and post-ischemic brain
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Ischemic brain injury inflicted by stroke and cardiac arrest ranks among the leading causes of death and long-term disability in the United States. The brain consumes large amounts of metabolic substrates and oxygen to sustain its energy requirements. Consequently, the brain is exquisitely sensitive to interruptions in its blood supply, and suffers irreversible damage after 10-15 min of severe ischemia. Effective treatments to protect the brain from stroke and cardiac arrest have proven elusive, due to the complexities of the injury cascades ignited by ischemia and reperfusion. Although recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and therapeutic hypothermia have proven efficacious for stroke and cardiac arrest, respectively, these treatments are constrained by narrow therapeutic windows, potentially detrimental side-effects and the limited availability of hypothermia equipment. Mounting evidence demonstrates the cytokine hormone erythropoietin (EPO) to be a powerful neuroprotective agent and a potential adjuvant to established therapies. Classically, EPO originating primarily in the kidneys promotes erythrocyte production by suppressing apoptosis of proerythroid progenitors in bone marrow. However, the brain is capable of producing EPO, and EPO's membrane receptors and signaling components also are expressed in neurons and astrocytes. EPO activates signaling cascades that increase the brain's resistance to ischemia-reperfusion stress by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, limiting formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil infiltration. Collectively, these mechanisms preserve functional brain tissue and, thus, improve neurocognitive recovery from brain ischemia. This article reviews the mechanisms mediating EPO-induced brain protection, critiques the clinical utility of exogenous EPO to preserve brain threatened by ischemic stroke and cardiac arrest, and discusses the prospects for induction of EPO production within the brain by the intermediary metabolite, pyruvate.

TI  - ISCHEMIA trial: Is there enough evidence to drive a change in clinical practice? A critical appraisal
T2  - HELLENIC JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Recently, ISCHEMIA trial was published in order to determine the effect of adding cardiac catheterization and revascularization when feasible to medical therapy in patients with stable CAD and moderate or severe ischemia. Over a median of 3.2 years of follow-up, among patients with stable CAD who had moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing, an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, did not reduce the rates of the primary or key secondary composite outcomes. The primary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The key secondary outcomes were the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or MI and angina-related quality of life. Patients in the invasive-strategy group had more procedural myocardial MIs, and they had fewer spontaneous infarctions during follow-up. The incidence of death from any cause was low and similar in the two groups. However, the ISCHEMIA trial was challenging to implement, event rates were low and enrollment fell behind initial milestones. Furthermore, power of the study was compromised, composite end-point definition as well as definitions of crucial individual components were changed amid study progression. There was a "heterobaric" combined end-point with procedural MIs favoring the conservative arm and spontaneous MIs favoring the invasive arm. Finally, the duration of reported follow-up showed signals that findings may shift in favor of invasive treatment and results were sensitive to definition and type of MIs. Therefore, we believe that it is premature to change clinical practice in view of the results of ISCHEMIA trial. As stable CAD patients is a vastly heterogenous patient group, it may be prudent to apply common clinical judgement and individual decision-making according to current guidelines before changing our management strategies.

TI  - Family Outcomes After the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: A Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Background Intensivists are increasingly attuned to the postdischarge outcomes experienced by families because patient recovery and family outcomes are interdependent after childhood critical illness. In this scoping review of international contemporary literature, we describe the evidence of family effects and functioning postpediatric intensive care unit (PICU) as well as outcome measures used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the literature. Methods We reviewed all articles published between 1970 and 2017 in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), or the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Our search used a combination of terms for the concept of "critical care/illness" combined with additional terms for the prespecified domains of social, cognitive, emotional, physical, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and family functioning. Results We identified 71 articles reporting on the postPICU experience of more than 2400 parents and 3600 families of PICU survivors in 8 countries. These articles used 101 different metrics to assess the various aspects of family outcomes; 34 articles also included open-ended interviews. Overall, most families experienced significant disruption in at least five out of six of our family outcomes subdomains, with themes of decline in mental health, physical health, family cohesion, and family finances identified. Almost all articles represented relatively small, single-center, or disease-specific observational studies. There was a disproportionate representation of families of higher socioeconomic status (SES) and Caucasian race, and there was much more data about mothers compared to fathers. There was also very limited information regarding outcomes for siblings and extended family members after a child's PICU stay. Conclusions Significant opportunities remain for research exploring family functioning after PICU discharge. We recommend that future work include more diverse populations with respect to the critically ill child as well as family characteristics, include more intervention studies, and enrich existing knowledge about outcomes for siblings and extended family.

TI  - Educating surgeons for the new golden hours: Honing the skills of palliative care
T2  - SURGICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Oh life! Surgeons excel at life-saving resuscitations and procedures, forging ahead to beat the clock in the "golden hour." Now these stalwart gladiators must hone their skills to adapt to a different golden arena, the last ticking months, days, hours, and moments of life. Palliative care is an expanding focus for the medical community, in general, and the surgical community, in particular. For many surgeons, this is an unfamiliar concept and a huge paradigm shift, a contrast from what they believe they were or are trained to do.
   Historically, the surgical perspective has been one of active, aggressive care, with the surgeon dictating the course of care to the patient. Today, surgeons must look at the other side of the same coin, and flip their perspective to the one of the patient and their needs and goals. When weighing clinical options, surgeons must consider the possibility of minimally invasive interventional radiologic or laparoscopic procedures; no intervention versus extensive traditional operations; and perhaps even no fluids or nutrition versus aggressive fluid resuscitation, hyperalimentation, or tube feedings [2]. In an age of outcomes management, new end points must be established for all patients in the continuum of life to death. Surgeons must include a sensitive plan of care for those who have chronic illnesses in long-term care, not only those who are at the end of life or actively dying. The goal must be to maintain quality of life and to relieve suffering, indeed to ''do no harm."

TI  - Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest in Adults: Mechanism of Neuroprotection, Phases of Hypothermia, and Methods of Cooling
T2  - CRITICAL CARE CLINICS
AB  - Mild therapeutic hypothermia (32 degrees C-34 degrees C) has been shown to improve survival and neurologic outcomes after sudden cardiac arrest in clinical studies. Its use is recommended by the American Heart Association for unconscious adult patients with spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. It decreases cerebral metabolism and protects the brain after ischemia by reduction of brain metabolism, attenuation of neuroexcitotoxic cascade, abolition of reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of apoptosis. This article addresses the mechanism of neuroprotection, phases of hypothermia, and noninvasive and invasive cooling methods.

TI  - Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion impairs neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory
T2  - BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB  - The incidence of cognitive impairment in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients has increased, adversely impacting quality of life and imposing a significant economic burden. Brain imaging of CVD patients has detected changes in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for normal learning and memory. However, it is not clear whether adverse cardiac events or other associated co-morbidities impair cognition. Here, using a murine model of acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), where the coronary artery was occluded for 30 min followed by reperfusion, we tested the hypothesis that acute myocardial infarction triggers impairment in cognitive function. Two months following cardiac I/R, behavioral assessments specific for hippocampal cognitive function were performed. Mice subjected to cardiac I/R performed worse in the fear-conditioning paradigm as well as the object location memory behavioral test compared to sham-operated mice. Reactive gliosis was apparent in the hippocampal subregions CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus 72 h post-cardiac I/R as compared with sham, which was sustained two months post-cardiac I/R. Consistent with the inflammatory response, the abundance of doublecortin positive newborn neurons was decreased in the dentate gyrus 72 h and 2 months post-cardiac I/R as compared with sham. Therefore, we conclude that following acute myocardial infarction, rapid inflammatory responses negatively affect neurogenesis, which may underlie long-term changes in learning and memory.

TI  - The automated external defibrillator
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Sudden death claims 250,000 lives annually in the U.S. The vast majority of such events are due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Even though these arrhythmias can be converted if treated promptly, less than 5% of victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survive to hospitalization. This poor survival is often due to delay in the initiation of quality CPR and defibrillation. Several clinical studies have evaluated the use of an AED by nontraditional emergency medical providers and by laypersons in Public Access Defibrillation programs. These studies have demonstrated a significant improvement in survival due to earlier access to defibrillation provided by the AED. The AED has proven to be safe, reliable, and efficacious in the diagnosis and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias when employed by lay providers/rescuers in a variety of outpatient settings. Society has embraced these data and legislation has been passed that supports the implementation of PAD programs into communities and protects lay rescuers and organizations implementing these programs from liability. Concerns about cost versus benefit still serve as barriers to widespread implementation of PAD programs, but with the declining cost of AEDs and increased public awareness, many communities have initiated PAD programs. We encourage widespread implementation of PAD programs and enhanced public awareness about basic life support, with the expectation that such efforts will enhance survival of out of hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Predictors of long-term survival in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The study consisted of 369 patients (age 62 +/- 13 years) who presented to our institution from April 1984 to April 1994 for malignant ventricular arrhythmias presenting as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 57% of patients, ventricular fibrillation in 25% of patients, and syncope due to VT in 17% of patients. Coronary artery disease was present in 74% of patients, cardiomyopathy in 19% of patients, and no evident heart disease in 7% of patients. Two hundred twenty-one patients were given drug therapy, 47 patients underwent arrhythmia surgery, and 75 patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). During a mean follow-up of 30 months (range 1 to 101), 66 patients (18%) died from a cardiac death of which 26 (39%) were sudden. Cox regression analysis was conducted utilizing a total of 19 variables (clinical and therapeutic) in the entire population and separately in patients with coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy, The most significant variables (multivariate analysis) of survival from cardiac mortality in the entire population were: congestive heart failure (CHF) class (p = 0.0003), ejection fraction (p = 0.02), and the use of drug therapy (p = 0.03); in patients with coronary artery disease, CHF class (p = 0.0001) and ejection fraction (p = 0.0006); and in patients with cardiomyopathy, CHF class (p = 0,009) and sustained VT on Holter monitoring (p = 0.007). Kaplan-Meier survival rates from cardiac death were: significantly lower (p = 0.005) in patients with CHF class III and IV compared with CHF class I and II (25% vs 58%, p = 0.005) with drug therapy; marginally significant (47% vs 88%, p = 0.06) from 20 to 40 months in patients with an ICD; and nonsignificant in patients who underwent arrhythmia surgery (63% vs 77%). Patients with an ICD had a better expected survival (82%) than patients who had arrhythmia surgery (69%) and drug therapy (65%). Thus, in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, CHF class was the most significant independent predictor of survival from cardiac mortality over all disease substrates, and therapy influenced survival depending on the CHF class. Patients in CHF class III and IV who underwent arrhythmia surgery or had an LCD had a better expected survival than those taking drug therapy, and the negative impact of antiarrhythmic therapy was most prominent in patients with CHF class III and IV, (C) 1997 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

TI  - A Stabilization Device That Promotes the Efficiency of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation during Ambulance Transportation to the Level as under Non-Moving Conditions
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: The survival rate of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is low, and measures to improve the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during ambulance transportation are desirable. We designed a stabilization device, and in a randomized crossover trial we found performing CPR in a moving ambulance with the device (MD) could achieve better efficiency than that without the device (MND), but the efficiency was lower than that in a non-moving ambulance (NM).
   Purpose: To evaluate whether a modified version of the stabilization device, can promote further the quality of CPR during ambulance transportation.
   Methods: Participants of the previous study were recruited, and they performed CPR for 10 minutes in a moving ambulance with the modified version of the stabilization device (MVSD). The primary outcomes were effective chest compressions and no-flow fraction recorded by a skill-reporter manikin. The secondary outcomes included back pain, physiological parameters, and the participants' rating about the device after performing CPR.
   Results: The overall effective compressions in 10 minutes were 86.4+/-17.5% for NM, 60.9+/-14.6% for MND, 69.7+/-22.4% for MD, and 86.6%+/-13.2% for MVSD (p<0.001). Whereas changes in back pain severity and physiology parameters were similar under all conditions, MVSD had the lowest no-flow fraction. Differences in effective compressions and the no-flow fraction between MVSD and NM did not reach statistical significance.
   Conclusions: The use of the modified device can improve quality of CPR in a moving ambulance to a level similar to that in a non-moving condition without increasing the severity of back pain.

TI  - Immuno-histological detection of resistant columnar units and vulnerable networks in the rat retina after asphyxia-induced transient cardiac arrest
T2  - RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Stroke-related loss of vision is one of the residual impairments, restricting the quality of life. However, studies of the ocular manifestations of asphyxia cardiac arrest/resuscitation (ACA/R) have reported very heterogeneous results.
   Objective: We aimed to evaluate the ACA/R-induced degeneration pattern of the different retinal cell populations in rats using different immuno-histological stainings.
   Methods: The staining pattern of toluidine blue and the ganglion cell markers beta-III-tubulin and NeuN; the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, indicating ganglion, amacrine, and horizontal cells; calretinin D28k, indicating ganglion and amacrine cells; calbindin, indicating horizontal cells; Chx 10, indicating cone bipolar cells; PKC alpha, indicating ON-type rod bipolar cells; arrestin, indicating cones; and rhodopsin, a marker of rods, as well as the glial cell markers GFAP (indicating astroglia and Muller cells) and IBA1 (indicating microglia), were evaluated after survival times of 7 and 21 days in an ACA/R rat model. Moreover, quantitative morphological analysis of the optic nerve was performed. The ACA/R specimens were compared with those from sham-operated and completely naive rats.
   Results: ACA/R-induced effects were: (i) a significant reduction of retinal thickness after long-term survival; (ii) ganglion cell degeneration, including their fiber network in the inner plexiform layer; (iii) degeneration of amacrine and cone bipolar cells; (iv) degeneration of cone photoreceptors; (v) enhanced resistance to ACA/R by rod photoreceptors, ON-type rod bipolar and horizontal cells, possibly caused by the strong upregulation of the calcium-binding proteins calretinin, parvalbumin, and calbindin, counteracting the detrimental calcium overload; (vi) significant activation of Muller cells as further element of retinal anti-stress self-defense mechanisms; and (vii) morphological alterations of the optic nerve in form of deformed fibers.
   Conclusions: Regardless of the many defects, the surviving neuronal structures seemed to be able to maintain retinal functionality, which can be additionally improved by regenerative processes true to the "use it or lose it" dogma.

TI  - Current standard of care for septic shock
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis is a syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction that results from dysregulated host response to infection, with septic shock defined as persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, a serum lactate > 2 mmol/L and the need for a vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg. Approximately, 49 million cases of sepsis are recorded worldwide annually, with 11 million sepsis-related deaths, the majority occurring in patients with septic shock. A substantial proportion of survivors suffer from moderate to severe functional limitations including physical, cognitive and psychological disability, exacerbation of pre-existing chronic conditions and a high incidence of re-hospitalisation in the first 12 months after the initial diagnosis. Optimal management of patients with septic shock requires prompt and reliable recognition of patients with sepsis who require additional haemodynamic support. Initially, patients will need judicious intravenous fluids and consideration of the need for vasopressors such as norepinephrine. Administration of appropriate antibiotics and consideration for control of the source of infection are also required. In the optimisation phase, depending on patients' comorbidities and response to therapy, the balance of fluid therapy, vasopressors and potentially the addition of an inotropic agent will need to be adjusted, based on clinical findings and haemodynamic and biochemical parameters. For those patients who do not respond to initial therapy, more intensive monitoring may be required with consideration of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids, vasopressin, angiotensin II or other rescue therapies to achieve cardiovascular stability. Once stability has been achieved, clinicians need to consider strategies to ameliorate the potential long-term effects on survivors, while keeping in mind the perspective and experience of their patients.

TI  - Socioeconomic Risk Factors for Pediatric Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Statewide Analysis
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Economic hardship is a major threat to children's health, implying that pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (pOHCA) might be promoted by lower incomes and child poverty. To target resources, it is helpful to identify geographical hotspots. Rhode Island is the smallest state by area in the United States of America. It has one million inhabitants and is comparable to many larger cities worldwide. We aimed to investigate the possible associations of pOHCA with economic factors and the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our goal was to identify high-risk areas and evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an influence on delays in prehospital care.
   Methods: We analyzed all pOHCA cases (patients <18 years of age) in Rhode Island between March 1, 2018-February 28, 2022. We performed Poisson regression with pOHCA as dependent and economic risk factors (median household income [MHI] and child poverty rate from the US Census Bureau) as well as the COVID-19 pandemic as independent variables. Hotspots were identified using local indicators of spatial association (LISA) statistics. We used linear regression to assess the association of emergency nedical services-related times with economic risk factors and COVID-19.
   Results: A total of 51 cases met our inclusion criteria. Lower MHIs (incidence-rate ratio [IRR]) 0.99 per $1,000 MHI; P=0.01) and higher child poverty rates (IRR 1.02 per percent; P=0.02) were significantly associated with higher numbers of ambulance calls due to pOHCA. The pandemic did not have a significant influence (IRR 1.1; P=0.7). LISA identified 12 census tracts as hotspots (P<0.01). The pandemic was not associated with delays in prehospital care.
   Conclusion: Lower median household income and higher child poverty rate are associated with higher numbers of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

TI  - Diagnosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by emergency medical dispatch: A diagnostic systematic review
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Cardiac arrest is a time-sensitive condition requiring urgent intervention. Prompt and accurate recognition of cardiac arrest by emergency medical dispatchers at the time of the emergency call is a critical early step in cardiac arrest management allowing for initiation of dispatcher-assisted bystander CPR and appropriate and timely emergency response. The overall accuracy of dispatchers in recognizing cardiac arrest is not known. It is also not known if there are specific call characteristics that impact the ability to recognize cardiac arrest.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review to examine dispatcher recognition of cardiac arrest as well as to identify call characteristics that may affect their ability to recognize cardiac arrest at the time of emergency call. We searched electronic databases for terms related to "emergency medical dispatcher", "cardiac arrest", and "diagnosis", among others, with a focus on studies that allowed for calculating diagnostic test characteristics (e.g. sensitivity and specificity). The review was consistent with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method for evidence evaluation.
   Results: We screened 2520 article titles, resulting in 47 studies included in this review. There was significant heterogeneity between studies with a high risk of bias in 18 of the 47 which precluded performing meta-analyses. The reported sensitivities for cardiac arrest recognition ranged from 0.46 to 0.98 whereas specificities ranged from 0.32 to 1.00. There were no obvious differences in diagnostic accuracy between different dispatching criteria/algorithms or with the level of education of dispatchers.
   Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity of cardiac arrest recognition at the time of emergency call varied across dispatch centres and did not appear to differ by dispatch algorithm/criteria used or education of the dispatcher, although comparisons were hampered by heterogeneity across studies. Future efforts should focus on ways to improve sensitivity of cardiac arrest recognition to optimize patient care and ensure appropriate and timely resource utilization.

TI  - CHEST COMPRESSION AND VENTILATION RATES DURING CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION - THE EFFECTS OF AUDIBLE TONE GUIDANCE
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To determine: 1) whether chest compressions during CPR are being performed according to American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines during cardiac arrest; and 2) the effect of an audio prompt to guide chest compressions on compliance with AHA guidelines and hemodynamic parameters associated with successful resuscitation.
   Methods: An observational clinical report and laboratory study was conducted. A research observer responded to a convenience sample of cardiac arrests within a 300-bed hospital and counted the rate of chest compressions and ventilations during CPR. To evaluate the effect of an audio prompt on CPR, health care providers performed chest compression without guidance using a porcine cardiac arrest model for 1 minute, followed by a second minute in which audio guidance was added. Chest compression rates, arterial and venous blood pressures, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO(2)) levels, and coronary perfusion pressures were measured and compared for the two periods.
   Results: Twelve in-hospital cardiac arrests were observed in the clinical part of the study. Only two of 12 patients had chest compressions performed within AHA guidelines. No patient had respirations performed within AHA guidelines. In the laboratory, 41 volunteers were tested, with 66% performing chest compressions outside the AHA standards for compression rate without audible tone guidance. With guided chest compressions, the mean (+/- SD) chest compression rate increased from 74 +/- 22 to 100 +/- 3/min (p < 0.01). End-tidal CO2 levels increased from 15 +/- 7 to 17 +/- 7 torr (p < 0.01). Coronary perfusion pressure increased minimally with audible tone-guided chest compressions.
   Conclusions: The majority of Basic Cardiac Life Support-certified health care professionals did not perform CPR according to AHA-recommended guidelines. The use of audible tones to guide chest compression resulted in significantly higher chest compression rates and ETCO(2) levels.

TI  - Effects of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution infusion in comparison with a high dose of furosemide as bolus in refractory congestive heart failure: Long-term effects
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Diuretics have been accepted as first-line treatment in refractory congestive heart failure (CHF), but a lack of response to them is a frequent event. A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up.
   Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level less than or equal to60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia. At study entry, all patients underwent a physical examination and measurement of body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), an evaluation of signs of CHF, and measurement of control levels of serum Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia daily during hospitalization, and measurements of the daily output of urine for Na, K, and Cl. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained at study entry, during hospitalization, and at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the treatment and after discharge, the daily dietary Na intake was 120 mmol in group 1 versus 80 mmol in group 2, with a fluid intake of 1000 mL daily in both groups. An assessment of BW and 24-hour urinary volume, serum, and urinary laboratory parameters were performed daily until patients reached a compensated state, when IV furosemide was replaced with oral administration (250-500 mg/d). After discharge from the hospital, patients were observed as outpatients weekly for the first 3 months and, subsequently, once a month.
   Results The groups were similar in age, sex, EF, risk factors, treatment, and etiology of CHF. All patients showed a clinical improvement. Ten patients in both groups had hyponatremia at entry. A significant increase. in daily diuresis and natriuresis was observed in both groups, but it was more significant in the group receiving HSS (P < .05). The serum Na level increased in group 1 and decreased in group 2 (P < .05). The serum K level was decreased in both groups (P < .05). BW was reduced in both groups (P < .05). Group 2 had an increase in serum creatinine level. Serum uric acid levels increased in both groups. BP-values decreased and HR was corrected to normal values in both groups. In the follow-up period (31 +/- 14 months), 25 patients from group 1 were readmitted to the hospital for heart failure. In group 2, 43 patients were readmitted tothe hospital at a higher class than at discharge. Twenty-four patients in group 1 died during follow-up, versus 47 patients in group 2 (P < .001).
   Conclusion This treatment is effective and well tolerated, improves the quality of life through the relief of signs and symptoms of congestion, and may delay more aggressive treatments. The effects were also beneficial in a long period for mortality reduction (55% vs 13% survival rate) and for clinical improvement.

TI  - Operative management of acquired Jeune's syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
AB  - Background: Acquired Jeune's syndrome is a severe iatrogenic deformity of the thoracic wall following a premature and aggressive open pectus excavatum repair. We report herein our technique and experience with this rare condition.
   Methods: From 1996 to 2011, nineteen patients with acquired Jeune's syndrome were retrospectively identified in a tertiary referral center. The technique used to expand and reconstruct the thoracic wall consisted of 1) release of the sternum from fibrous scar tissue, 2) multiple osteotomies along the lateral aspect of the ribs with anterior advancement of costal-cartilages to protect the heart, 3) stabilization of the thorax by placing a curved bar for retrosternal support and, 4) restoration of the sterno-costal junction by wiring the lower cartilages to the edge of the sternum.
   Results: Major complications observed in this series were: bar displacement (seven cases), postoperative death from cardiac arrest following bronchoscopy (one case), late cardiac tamponade from migration of wire suture fragment (one case), and need for multiple reoperations (one case). Long-term cosmetic results and improvement in daily quality of life were reported as positive in the majority of cases.
   Conclusions: Anterior chest wall reconstruction successfully treated our series of patients with acquired Jeune's syndrome. This multifaceted technique is an effective procedure that allows expansion of the thoracic cavity and improvement of aerobic activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Objectives: We hypothesize chat leaning during in-hospital pediatric CPR will be common, and that real-time automated feedback will be associated with reduced leaning prevalence and force.
   Methods: A feedback-capable monitor/defibrillator equipped with force transducer and accelerometer recorded CC leaning force and depth during in-hospital cardiac arrests (>= 8 years) at a children's hospital. Automated feedback was enabled at the resuscitation leader's discretion, and audiovisual prompts Were given when leaning force exceeded 2.5 kg. Leaning force and depth CC with No Feedback (NoF) vs. with Feedback (F) were compared.
   Results: 20 pediatric (mean age 14.7 +/- 3.8 years) Pulse less arrests generated 37,396 evaluable CC. Median leaning force was 1.6 kg [0.9-2.7 kg] and leaning depth 2.9 (1.6-4.7) mm. Leaning force was greater with NoF (2.5 kg, [1.6-3.5 kg]; n = 1921) vs. F (1.6 kg [0.9-2.6 kg]: n = 35,164, p < 0.001). Leaning > 2.5 kg (adult feedback threshold) occurred in 50% (n = 969) of CC with NoF and 27% (n = 9367) CC with F (p < 0.001). CC Without leaning, defined as a leaning force of < 0.5 kg, occurred in 2.2% (n = 43) CC with NoF vs. 10.5% (n = 3681) CC with F (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Leaning (residual force > 2.5 kg) was common during pediatric CPR. The prevalence and force of leaning were reduced with automated audiovisual feedback. Further study is necessary to determine the effect of the specific leaning threshold on CPR hemodynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ANTIARRHYTHMIC AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC ACTIONS OF BETHANIDINE SULFATE IN PRIMARY VENTRICULAR-FIBRILLATION OR LIFE-THREATENING VENTRICULAR-TACHYCARDIA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Antiarrhythmic and electrophysiologic actions of bethanidine sulfate, a chemical analog of bretylium tosylate, were studied using programmed cardiac electrical stimulation in 14 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unassociated with acute myocardial infarction. Before bethanidine sulfate was administered sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) were inducible in 11 patients and reproducible nonsustained VT was induced in 3 patients. Bethanidine sulfate shortened sinus cycle length and  absolute and relative ventricular refractory periods measured during sinus rhythm, but did not alter ventricular effective refractory period measured during ventricular pacing. Bethanidine sulfate prevented inducible VT in 8 patients (57%), increased the number of extrastimuli needed to induce VT in 2 patients and was ineffective in 4 patients. In only 1 of 26 trials with other conventional antiarrhythmic drugs in these patients was VT prevented. Orthostatic hypotension was a prominent side effect of bethanidine sulfate therapy, but could be reversed in most patients by concomitant administration of protriptyline. Five patients in whom bethanidine sulfate was effective in the laboratory were treated chronically (400-600 mg 4 times daily), and all are alive at 3-40 mo. In the remaining 9 patients, 8 were treted empirically because no drug was effective in the laboratory and 1 was treated with quinidine, which appeared to be protective during testing. Four of these 9 patients, including the patient treated with quinidine, died suddenly during follow-up. Although bethanidine sulfate therapy is difficult to initiate because of orthostatic hypotensive side effects, it may be useful in treating patients at high risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.

TI  - Life-sustaining treatment decisions by spouses of patients with Alzheimer's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
CP  - 47th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Gerontological-Society-of-America
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the anticipated decisions to consent to or to forgo life-sustaining treatment by spouses of patients with Alzheimer's disease and to describe the relationship of spouse and patient characteristics to predicted decisions.
   DESIGN: Prospective quantitative study.
   SETTING: The Aging and Dementia Research Center (ADRC), part of an Alzheimer's Disease Center Core Grant, at New York University Medical Center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Fifty spouse caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients, evaluated at the ADRC, who had a minimum Stage 4 on the Global Deterioration Scale.
   MEASUREMENTS: Spouses were presented with two conditions (critical illness and irreversible coma) and rated their agreement with, certainty of, and comfort with four treatments (resuscitation, breathing machine, feeding tube, and antibiotics). Data were also obtained as to patients' current quality of life, spouses' standard of decision-making, and spouse burden.
   RESULTS: Eighteen of 50 patients had a durable power of attorney for health care, 20 of 50 had a living will, and 26 of 50 had neither. In the face of critical illness, almost equal numbers of spouses would consent to or forgo CPR, 28 of 50 would forgo a breathing machine, 21 of 50 a would forgo a feeding tube, and 5 of 50 would forgo antibiotics. Five of 50 would forgo all four treatments, and 12 of 50 all but antibiotics. Spouses were significantly more likely to forgo treatment in the face of coma than for critical illness (P < .001). Spouses were more certain about decisions related to coma than to critical illness (P < .001), and there was a positive and significant correlation between certainty and comfort (P = .001). Those consenting to treatment were more comfortable than those forgoing treatment (for CPR and antibiotics P = .001). Spouses of patients with Stage 7 AD were more likely to forgo CPR than those with Stages 4 to 6 AD (P < .001). Only two of 50 spouses selected descriptors congruent with a purely substituted judgment standard of decision-making. An equal number of spouses rated patient quality of life as good, fair, or poor. For critical illness, the poorer the quality of life rating, the more likely the spouses were to forgo feeding tubes (P < .001). There was a trend for highly burdened spouses to consent to treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that spouses of patients with AD anticipate forgoing life-sustaining treatments in the face of coma but are less sure about choices for critical illness. Although preliminary in nature, findings suggest that doctors, nurses, and social workers need to provide additional support to spouses choosing to forgo rather than consent to treatment and need to inquire as to what spouses perceive as the factors that are important to them in making a decision.

TI  - Cardiac arrest on the day following surgery in children with unrecognized rhabdomyolysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
AB  - We present two male children who experienced cardiac arrest secondary to unrecognized rhabdomyolysis on the day following an uneventful general anesthetic and recovery room course for adenotonsillectomy. Neither child exhibited hypermetabolism typical of malignant hyperthermia or appeared to have a dystrophinophy, prompting the authors to search for other etiologies of childhood rhabdomyolysis infrequently associated with anesthesia. In this report, we review the heritable metabolic myopathies caused by enzyme deficiencies (enzymopathies) that can lead to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis following certain triggering conditions, and we offer suggestions for avoiding these triggers in the perianesthetic period. We also describe key symptoms and signs that postanesthetic caregivers should be aware of and briefly comment on follow-up diagnostic studies. (C) 1997 by Elsevier Science Inc.

TI  - Comparison of Quantitative Characteristics of Early Post-resuscitation EEG Between Asphyxial and Ventricular Fibrillation Cardiac Arrest in Rats
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis has shown promising results in studying brain injury and functional recovery after cardiac arrest (CA). However, whether the quantitative characteristics of EEG, as potential indicators of neurological prognosis, are influenced by CA causes is unknown. The purpose of this study was designed to compare the quantitative characteristics of early post-resuscitation EEG between asphyxial CA (ACA) and ventricular fibrillation CA (VFCA) in rats.
   Methods Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were randomized into either ACA or VFCA group. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 5-min untreated CA. Characteristics of early post-resuscitation EEG were compared, and the relationships between quantitative EEG features and neurological outcomes were investigated.
   Results Compared with VFCA, serum level of S100B, neurological deficit score and brain histopathologic damage score were dramatically higher in the ACA group. Quantitative measures of EEG, including onset time of EEG burst, time to normal trace, burst suppression ratio, and information quantity, were significantly lower for CA caused by asphyxia and correlated with the 96-h neurological outcome and survival.
   Conclusions Characteristics of earlier post-resuscitation EEG differed between cardiac and respiratory causes. Quantitative measures of EEG not only predicted neurological outcome and survival, but also have the potential to stratify CA with different causes.

TI  - Design projections for prospective studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of cardiac arrest detection technologies
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Recent developments have illustrated the feasibility of scalable out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) detection using consumer-wearable products. While initial evidence is promising, the real-world effectiveness of these technologies is unproven and design decisions to minimize false positives may constrain clinical impact. To support the real-world evaluation of these technologies, we analyzed registry data and evaluated strategies for a clinical trial. Methods: We analyzed Emergency Medical Services (EMS)-treated and EMS-untreated cases in the British Columbia Cardiac Arrest Registry (2019-2020) who may have benefitted from cardiac arrest detection. Within strata formed by Age (0-35, 36-55, 56-65, 65+) and Sex, we estimated strata-specific treatment effects from recognition and calculated the required sample sizes for a set of potential primary clinical outcomes for a trial (survival to hospital discharge, initial shockable cardiac rhythm, EMS treatment). We compared this with population incidence to inform prospective recruitment requirements. Results: Within a population-at-risk of 9,739,356, 11,382 sentinel cases met criteria for inclusion. Strata-specific incidence ranged from 18.3 per 100,000 to 395 per 100,000. The most statistically efficient subgroup for a survival outcome was Males aged 56-65 (171,676 needed, total). For a trial outcome of EMS treatment or initial shockable rhythm, Males over 65 were the most efficient subgroup within which to test the intervention (7,608 and 66,962 needed, total respectively). Conclusion: A prospective trial of OHCA detection technologies will require large recruitment targets. Subgroups with the highest estimated treatment effect are not those with the highest incidence. Large trials in the general population will require multiple centers and innovative recruitment strategies that may be aided by partnership with industry.

TI  - Impact of Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Shocks on Mental Health Review and Management Guidance
T2  - JACC-ADVANCES
AB  - Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and those who experience shocks from an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD-S) are at risk of developing unrecognized and untreated mental health (MH) symptoms. MH sequelae can include anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress symptoms which hinder one's ability to return to usual life and activity, impeding follow-up, health care seeking, and adherence to care plans. Addressing MH as part of a whole person care in such scenarios could lead to improved wellness and recovery. This review examines the MH sequelae of SCA and ICD-S, explores potential therapies for managing these issues, proposes strategies to improve MH post-SCA or defibrillator shock, and identifies areas for future research.

TI  - Ethical issues in neonatal intensive care units
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
AB  - On one hand, advances in neonatal care and rescue technology allow for the healthy survival or prolonged survival time of critically ill newborns who, in the past, would have been non-viable. On the other hand, many of the surviving critically ill infants have serious long-term disabilities. If an infant eventually cannot survive or is likely to suffer severe disability after surviving, ethical issues in the treatment process are inevitable, and this problem arises not only in developed countries but is also becoming increasingly prominent in developing countries. In addition, ethical concerns cannot be avoided in medical research. This review article introduces basic ethical guidelines that should be followed in clinical practice, including respecting the autonomy of the parents, giving priority to the best interests of the infant, the principle of doing no harm, and consent and the right to be informed. Furthermore, the major ethical concerns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China are briefly introduced.

TI  - Detection of asphyxia using heart rate variability
T2  - MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING
AB  - The long-term aims of this study are to find a parameter derived from the ECG that has a high sensitivity and specificity to asphyxia and, once we know or suspect that asphyxia occurred, to estimate how severe it was. We carried out a pilot study in which 24 adult Wistar rats were anaesthetised and subjected to controlled asphyxia for specified durations. We measured the pH, 'neurological score' and the ECG, extracting from this heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). We have developed a technique capable of detecting asphyxia in less than I min, based on monitoring the ECG and estimating HRV by measuring the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (the RR interval is the time interval between two consecutive R-points of the QRS complex). In all cases the heart rate decreased and HRV increased, by an average of 46 +/- 33 ms in relation to the baseline, at the onset of asphyxia. The comparison of the base level of HRV after and before asphyxia shows promise for the estimation of the severity of the episode; however, the limitations of this study should be noted as they include the small size of the cohort and the methods of analysis.

TI  - Effects of automated external defibrillators on hands-off intervals in lay rescuers
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - Background Survival chances after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests caused by hyperdynamic electric cardiac rhythms can be significantly improved by early defibrillation with automated external defibrillators (AEDs). As postulated in international guidelines, the resulting hands-off intervals should not exceed 10 s. Objectives We investigated delay in onset of chest compressions and the length of hands-off intervals during defibrillation associated with the application of AEDs. Materials and methods In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded observational study, the resuscitation efforts by first year medical students were analyzed in different emergency scenarios on manikins. Delay in onset of chest compressions and the length of hands-off intervals between voice prompts from four conventional devices were compared during shockable and nonshockable rhythms. Satisfaction with the device, difficulties with the application, and suggested improvements were assessed by questionnaire. Results In a total of 70 applications, the start with thoracic compressions was delayed by a mean of 115 s. On average, the first shock was administered after 125 s in shockable heart rhythms. Perishock pauses of less than 10 s were achieved with none of the tested devices. Hands-off intervals during defibrillation differed significantly between the devices (p < 0.001). Improvements were suggested regarding marking, voice prompts, and electrodes. Conclusions Perishock pause of less than 10 s was not achieved with any of the tested devices. Shortened and more precise voice prompts as well as more clearly arranged labeling and layout of pads are needed to simplify application, reduce delayed onset of chest compressions and shorten hands-off intervals.

TI  - Rationale and design of the home automatic external defibrillator trial (HAT)
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Most cardiac arrests occur in the home, where emergency medical services (EMS) systems are challenged to provide timely care. Because a large proportion of sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs) are due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, home use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) might offer an opportunity to decrease mortality in those at risk. Predicting who will have a cardiac arrest in the general population is difficult. Individuals at high risk are usually easily identified and may become candidates for implantable cardioverter defibrillators. It is within the population at lower risk where home AEDs may be most useful. The purpose of the Home Automatic External Defibrillator Trial (HAT) is to test whether providing home access to an AED can improve survival in patients at modest risk of SCA, such as those surviving an anterior myocardial infarction but in whom implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy is not deemed necessary. Between January 23, 2003, and October 20, 2005, 7001 patients were enrolled, with completion of follow-up scheduled for September 30, 2007. Randomization was conducted in a I : I fashion between control therapy, comprising the standard lay response to SCA (calling the EMS and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and the use of an AED first, followed by calling the EMS and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary end point is all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include survival from SCA (witnessed and unwitnessed, in home and out of home), incremental cost-effectiveness, and quality of life measures for both the patient and the spouse/companion. The results of the trial should be available in mid 2008.

TI  - Management of Placental Transfusion to Neonates After Delivery
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - This review summarizes high-quality evidence supporting delayed umbilical cord clamping to promote placental transfusion to preterm and term neonates. In preterm neonates, delayed cord clamping may decrease mortality and the need for blood transfusions. Although robust data are lacking to guide cord management strategies in many clinical scenarios, emerging literature is reviewed on numerous topics including delivery mode, twin gestations, maternal comorbidities (eg, gestational diabetes, red blood cell alloimmunization, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and neonatal complications (eg, fetal growth restriction, congenital heart disease, and the depressed neonate). Umbilical cord milking is an alternate method of rapid placental transfusion, but has been associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm neonates. Data on long-term outcomes are discussed, as well as potential contraindications to delayed cord clamping. Overall, delayed cord clamping offers potential benefits to the estimated 140 million neonates born globally every year, emphasizing the importance of this simple and no-cost strategy.

TI  - Induction, detection, formation, and resuscitation of viable but non-culturable state microorganisms
T2  - COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND FOOD SAFETY
AB  - The viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state has been recognized as a strategy for bacteria to cope with stressful environments; in this state, bacteria fail to grow on routine culture medium but are actually alive and can resuscitate into a culturable state under favorable conditions. The VBNC state may pose a great threat to food safety and public health. To date, more than 100 VBNC microorganism species have been proven to exist in fields of food safety, environmental application, and agricultural diseases. Most harsh conditions can induce these microorganisms into the VBNC state, including food processing and preservation methods, adverse environmental conditions, and plant-disease controlling means. The characteristics of VBNC state cells differ from those of normally growing cells and dead cells, based on which of the various detection methods are developed, and they are of great significance for potential risk assessment. To provide molecular level insights into this state, many studies on induction and resuscitation mechanisms have emerged over the past three decades, including research on omics, specific genes, or proteins involved in VBNC state formation and the roles of promoters in resuscitation from the VBNC state. In this review, microorganism species, induction and resuscitation factors, detection methods, and formation and resuscitation mechanisms of the VBNC state are comprehensively and systematically summarized.

TI  - A comparison of α-methylnorepinephrine, vasopressin and epinephrine for cardiac resuscitation
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The objective of this research was to compare the effects of an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, a selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, alpha-methylnorepinephrine (alpha-MNE), and a non-adrenergic vasopressin on post-resuscitation myocardial function and duration of survival. Epinephrine continues to be the primary adrenergic agent for advanced cardiac life support. However, its major inotropic actions and especially its beta-adrenergic and, to a lesser extent, its alpha(1)-actions increase the severity of global ischemia during cardiac arrest and adversely affect post-resuscitation myocardial function and survival. We had previously observed significantly better outcomes with a selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist when compared with epinephrine. Non-adrenergic vasopressin also has promise of more favorable actions. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to compare a selective alpha(2)-adrenergic vasopressor drug with vasopressin, epinephrine, and saline placebo. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in 20 Sprague-Dawley rats. Mechanical ventilation and precordial compression were initiated after 8 min of untreated VF. About 2 min later, alpha-MNE in a dose of 100 mug/kg, vasopressin in a dose of 0.4 U/kg, epinephrine in a dose of 30 mug/kg, or saline control was administered. Defibrillation was attempted after 6 min of CPR. Left ventricular pressure, dP/dt(40), -dP/dt, and cardiac index were measured for an interval of 240 min after resuscitation. Except for saline controls, comparable increases in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) were observed after each drug intervention. All animals were successfully resuscitated. Post-resuscitation myocardial function and survival were significantly better in animals treated with alpha-MNE. Both post-resuscitation myocardial function and survival were most improved after administration of the selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, intermediate after vasopressin and least after epinephrine and saline placebo.

TI  - Protocol summary and statistical analysis plan for the Targeted Therapeutic Mild Hypercapnia after Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest (TAME) trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Targeted therapeutic mild hypercapnia may attenuate brain injury in comatose adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Objective: To describe the study protocol and statistical analysis plan for the Targeted Therapeutic Mild Hypercapnia after Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest (TAME) trial.
   Design, setting, participants and interventions: TAME is a phase 3, multicentre, parallel-group, participant-and outcome assessor blinded randomised controlled trial that will be conducted in intensive care units in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Singapore, Central and Western Europe, and the United Kingdom. A total of 1700 comatose adults resuscitated from out of-hospital cardiac arrest will be randomly assigned to 24 hours of targeted therapeutic mild hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide tension 50-55 mmHg) or targeted normocapnia (arterial carbon dioxide tension 35-45 mmHg) in a 1:1 ratio. TAME recruitment began in March 2018 and is expected to be complete in September 2021.
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants with a favourable functional outcome at 6 months. Functional outcomes will be assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE); this scale ranges from 1 to 8, with a higher value indicating a better outcome. We will define participants with a GOSE of 5 to 8 as having a favourable functional outcome. Secondary outcomes include 6-month mortality, cognitive function and quality of life. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to treat basis.
   Results and conclusions: TAME will compare the effect of targeted therapeutic mild hypercapnia versus targeted normocapnia on functional outcomes in adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are admitted to an intensive care unit.

TI  - Dilemmas in decision-making about resuscitation - a focus group study of older people
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be used by default on patients suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital in the UK unless there is an order that specifies otherwise in the patient's notes. Guidelines recommend that the decision involves competent and willing patients or, in the case of incapacitation, their families. In practice, patient autonomy is often compromised. Ideally, discussion of preferences for end-of-life care should take place prior to hospitalisation. The majority of research on this topic has been conducted on hospitalised patients, so little is known about the views of older, but healthy, people about resuscitation decision-making. The present study was designed to address this gap. A series of eight focus groups involving a total of 48 participants over the age of 65 was conducted to explore people's views about the factors guiding resuscitation decision-making. A qualitative analysis, which emphasised the dilemmatic nature of resuscitation decision-making, identified two broad thematic dilemmas that subsumed six specific themes which contribute to resolving the dilemmas: quality of life (medical condition, mental versus physical incapacity, age and ageing, and burden), and the involvement of others (doctors and families) versus loss of autonomy. The dilemma underlying quality of life is that an acceptable quality of life after CPR cannot be assured. The dilemma underlying the involvement of others is that individual autonomy may be lost. The themes and subthemes provide the basis for guiding these difficult discussions in advance of serious illness. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pre-optimisation of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy: a review of best practice
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
AB  - Although the concept of pre-operative optimisation is traditionally applied to elective surgery, there is ample opportunity to apply similar principles to patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The key challenge is achieving meaningful improvements in a patient's condition without introducing delays to time-sensitive surgery, which may be required in a matter of hours. Optimisation can be considered in two parts: that of the patient's condition; and that of the care pathway. Optimising the patient's condition is less about improving long-term pathology, and more about correcting physiological derangement, such as electrolyte and fluid balance, blood loss, prompt treatment of sepsis, and ensuring appropriate continuation of medication in the peri-operative period. Optimising the care pathway involves ensuring that the system is designed to deliver reliably the appropriate interventions, such as prompt antibiotics, and access to computed tomography scanning and the operating theatre with minimal delay.

TI  - RECOVERY FROM ULTRA-HIGH DOSE ORGANOPHOSPHATE POISONING AFTER "IN-THE-FIELD" ANTIDOTE TREATMENT: POTENTIAL LESSONS FOR CIVIL DEFENSE
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Organophosphate poisoning is associated with a high mortality rate due to respiratory failure, dysrhythmias, and multi-organ failure. We report two cases of survival after "in-the field" antidote treatment of very severe organophosphate poisonings. Two patients orally ingested large amounts of the organophosphorous agent oxydemeton-methyll in suicide attempts, resulting in the hypercholinergic syndrome in both. Resuscitation included early administration of antidote by emergency medical personnel as well as high-dose atropine. Plasma levels of pseudo cholinesterase were initially very low in both patients. Long-term mechanical ventilation was necessary, and both patients developed aspiration pneumonia. At discharge, no major neurological deficits were present. Prompt antidote treatment and aggressive supportive emergency and intensive care unit therapy contribute to improved survival after acute organophosphate poisoning. We believe that in cases of mass poisonings-for example, terrorist activity-therapy must be available on the scene as soon as possible. This also may require decentralized antidote storage.

TI  - Can we improve neurological outcomes in severe traumatic brain injury? Something old (early prophylactic hypothermia) and something new (erythropoietin)
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of mortality and long-term morbidity, particularly affecting young people. With our best therapies, one half of the patients with severe traumatic brain injury are never capable of living independently. Two interventions, which have real potential to improve neurological outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury, are (i) very early induction of prophylactic hypothermia and (ii) exogenous erythropoietin therapy. There is substantial experimental evidence,a plausible biological rationale, and supportive clinical evidence from clinical trials to suggest a possible beneficial effect of prophylactic hypothermia and also for exogenous erythropoietin therapy in severe traumatic brain injury. Despite the recent guidelines and publications recommending these interventions, critical care clinicians should be conservative towards implementing these therapies outside clinical trials due to substantial efficacy and safety concerns. Nevertheless the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) demands that we investigate the safety and efficacy of these promising potential therapies as a matter of urgency.

TI  - RECURRENCE OF MALIGNANT VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA AFTER ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUG-WITHDRAWAL
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Selection of an antiarrhythmic drug program by noninvasive means for patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia has not been demonstrated to be the decisive factor in promoting enhanced long-term survival. Twenty-four patients (16 men, mean age 56 years) with a history of either recurrent ventricular tachycardia or noninfarction ventricualr fibrillation were studied after antiarrhythmic therapy had been symptom-free on a tailored drug program for a mean of 31 months. Twenty of the 24 patients were hospitalized and underwent systematic drug withdrawal to assess continued need for therapy or because of intolerable side effects. In 4 patients, medication was discontinued either on their own or by their local physician. Recurrence after drug withdrawal was defined as either recurrence of the presenting arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) (12 patients) or reappearance of repetitive arrhythmia during Holter monitoring or exercise stress testing comparable to pretreatment levels (11 patients). The clinical arrhythmia recurred in 12 patients. Nine patients had a cardiac arrest. These data document the high recurrence rate of malignant ventricular arrhythmia on cessation of a proved antiarrhythmic program. They further support the concept that patients with life-threatening arrhythmia can be protected from recurrence by noninvasive methods of drug selection that are guided by suppression of advanced forms of ventricular premature  complexes.

TI  - Quality and accuracy of cardiopulmonary resuscitation teaching in short videos: an analysis across three major short video platforms
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Objective Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is vital for saving patients experiencing cardiac arrest. Teaching CPR skills through short videos offers numerous advantages. However, potential inaccuracies or misinformation could mislead the public and impact the effectiveness of CPR education. This study aims to evaluate the quality and accuracy of CPR instructional videos shared on three major short video platforms in China (TikTok, Bilibili, and REDnote), analyze common irregular or erroneous practices, and provide valuable suggestions for content optimization. Methods The collected videos were evaluated using a five-point scoring criterion based on 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC). The videos were categorized into three levels: excellent, moderate, and poor, based on their video quality scores for CPR procedures and non-procedural content. Further categorization was made by video duration (<= 5 min as short; >5 min as long). Additionally, the most critical and prevalent irregularities or errors were documented, and a detailed analysis of the most popular video from each platform was carried out. The relationship between video quality and popularity, and video duration and popularity were examined separately. Results A total of 100 CPR instructional videos were analyzed. While 86% of the videos were produced by healthcare professionals, substantial errors were identified in critical areas such as the extra time spent removing foreign body airway obstruction (67%), and incorrect hand position during compression (62%). Other issues with non-procedural content were identified, including video acceleration (13%), lack of step-by-step explanations (61%), etc. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in popularity across videos of different quality or duration (p = 0.876 among video quality groups for CPR procedures, p = 0.988 among video quality groups for non-procedural content, p = 0.260 between video duration groups). Conclusions This study identified the necessity for improvements in CPR procedures and non-procedural content of CPR instructional videos. To enhance video quality, measures such as rigorous review mechanisms, public feedback and promotion of certified high-quality videos are recommended.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy as a potential killer
T2  - ACTA CARDIOLOGICA
AB  - A 19-year-old man suffered a cardiac arrest during a promenade with his friends. Cardiac resuscitation was started immediately. Anamnesis uncovered that the father as well as a cousin of the patient suffered from myotonic dystrophy (MD). Follow-up ECG monitoring showed intercurrent III degrees AV-block as well as several asymptomatic episodes of ventricular tachycardias, atrial flutter with changing conduction and atrial fibrillation. Neuromuscular testing and genetic analyses confirmed the diagnosis of a myotonic dystrophy.
   Myotonic dystrophy (MD) is a chronic, slowly progressing, autosomal dominant inherited multisystemic disease. The clinical presentation is characterized by wasting of the muscles with delayed relaxation, cataracts and endocrine changes. MD is associated with both cardiac conduction disturbances and structural heart abnormalities. Electrocardiographic abnormalities include conduction disturbances or tachyarrhythmias. This case illustrates that potentially lethal arrhythmias inducing sudden cardiac death may occur in MD patients even in the absence of neurologic symptoms characterizing the systemic illness.

TI  - Inhibition of γδ T Cells Alleviates Blood-Brain Barrier in Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Mice
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the leading cause of death following cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). gamma delta T cells are suggested to aggravate blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury in various pathological processes. We herein investigate the effects of gamma delta T cells inhibitor (UC7-13D5) against I/R injury post-CA/CPR. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to CA through injection of KCL (70 mu L of 0.5 mol/L) and cessation of mechanical ventilation followed by CPR. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the proportion of CD3-positive cells after intraperitoneal injection of 200 mu g UC7-13D5 at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-resuscitation into mice. Neurological scores and modified neurological severity scores were assessed to examine neurological functions. Brain edema was estimated via brain water content measurements. Immunohistochemistry of caspase-3 and immunofluorescence staining of claudin-1, ZO-1 and CD31 were performed to detect neuronal apoptosis, BBB integrity and angiogenesis. Microvascular morphology in the cortical area was assessed via H&E staining. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. Western blotting was performed to measure the protein levels of Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). UC7-13D5 effectively depleted gamma delta T cells. Inhibition of gamma delta T cells improved neurological deficits and reduced brain edema post-CA/CPR. ?dT cells depletion attenuated neuronal apoptosis, BBB disruption and oxidative stress and promoted angiogenesis following CA/CPR. Inhibition of gamma delta T cells facilitated the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in CA/CPR-induced mice. Inhibition of gamma delta T cells alleviates neurological deficits and cerebral edema in mice with CA/CPR by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, BBB disruption and oxidative stress, and promoting angiogenesis via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

TI  - Pre-injury health status and excess mortality in persons with traumatic brain injury: A decade-long historical cohort study
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - An increasing number of patients are able to survive traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) with advanced resuscitation. However, the role of their pre-injury health status in mortality in the following years is not known. Here, we followed 77,088 consecutive patients (59% male) who survived the TBI event in Ontario, Canada for more than a decade, and examined the relationships between their pre-injury health status and mortality rates in excess to the expected mortality calculated using sexand age-specific life tables. There were 5792 deaths over the studied period, 3163 (6.95%) deaths in male and 2629 (8.33%) in female patients. The average excess mortality rate over the follow-up period of 14 years was 1.81 (95% confidence interval = 1.76-1.86). Analyses of follow-up time windows showed different patterns for the average excess rate of mortality following TBI, with the greatest rates observed in year one after injury. Among identified pre-injury comorbidity factors, 33 were associated with excess mortality rates. These rates were comparable between sexes. Additional analyses in the validation dataset confirmed that these findings were unlikely a result of TBI misclassification or unmeasured confounding. Thus, detection and subsequent management of pre-injury health status should be an integral component of any strategy to reduce excess mortality in TBI patients. The complexity of pre-injury comorbidity calls for integration of multidisciplinary health services to meet TBI patients' needs and prevent adverse outcomes.

TI  - Can we have a rationalized selection of intra-aortic balloon pump, Impella, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the catheterization laboratory?
T2  - CARDIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Cardiac assistance represents an emerging issue in cardiovascular medicine. The evolution of invasive cardiology techniques is making the catheterization laboratory one of the main hospital sites where implantation of percutaneous ventricular assistance devices (PVADs) is discussed and performed. Among available PVADs, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are the most popular and offer completely different levels and ways to assist critical patients. The main settings calling for PVAD consideration in the catheterization laboratory are clinically indicated high-risk patients (CHIP) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and patients with cardiogenic shock or refractory cardiac arrest.
   In CHIP, PVAD serves the purpose of preventing hemodynamic collapse during PCI. This may also allow more extensive revascularizations and higher quality revascularization plans (imaging use, debulking, stent result optimization). IABP or Impella are more commonly selected whereas ECMO is seldom considered as a third option for highly selected patients. The "elective" nature of CHIP-PCI should allow careful procedure planning (peripheral artery disease assessment, access site selection and management) in order to minimize vascular/bleeding complications.
   Cardiogenic shock is still associated with high mortality rates, and PVAD theoretically offers further recovery chances. The lack of benefit observed with systematic IABP use is currently prompting consideration of the roles of Impella and ECMO. Prolonged assistance is often needed. Thus, team decisions and shared protocols for PVAD selection have to be promoted, taking into consideration available resources and operators' skills.
   In this paper, we critically review the available data in the field and highlight the possible decisionmaking hubs that catheterization-laboratory teams may consider in order to rationalize PVAD selection.

TI  - Incidence of Deep Sternal Wound Infection Is Not Reduced with Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma in High-Risk Cardiac Surgery Patients
T2  - THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON
AB  - Background Deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) remain a devastating complication in cardiac surgery applying full sternotomy. As the risk profile in cardiac surgery changed toward an older and sicker population, the incidence of DSWI increases. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) holds promise in tissue regeneration with respect to bone regeneration, reduction of bleeding, and accelerated wound healing. The effect of PRP on DSWI was investigated in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery with full sternotomy.
   Methods 196 consecutive patients at risk of DSWI were randomized to application of autologous PRP before sternal wiring (n = 97) or control (n = 99). All patients underwent cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegic cardiac arrest. Endpoint was occurrence of DSWI requiring revision surgery.
   Results Demographic, intraoperative, and perioperative variables as well as risk factors were comparable between groups. Incidence of DSWI was not different between the PRP-group and the control-group (6/97 (6.2%) vs. 3/99 (3.0%); n.s.).
   Conclusions Local application of autologous PRP in cardiac surgery patients with full sternotomy at high risk for sternal complications did not reduce the incidence of DSWI.

TI  - Outcomes With Intermediate Left Main Disease: Analysis From the ISCHEMIA Trial
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with significant (>= 50%) left main disease (LMD) have a high risk of cardiovascular events, and guidelines recommend revascularization to improve survival. However, the impact of intermediate LMD (stenosis, 25%-49%) on outcomes is unclear.
   METHODS: Randomized ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) participants who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography at baseline were categorized into those with (25%-49%) and without (<25%) intermediate LMD. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest The primary quality of life outcome was the Seattle Angina Questionnaire summary score.
   RESULTS: Among the 3699 participants who satisfied the inclusion criteria, 962 (26%) had intermediate LMD. Among invasive strategy participants with intermediate LMD on coronary computed tomography angiography, 49 (7.0%) had significant (>= 50% stenosis) left main stenosis on invasive angiography. Patients with intermediate LMD had a higher risk of cardiovascular events in the unadjusted but not in the fully adjusted model compared with those without intermediate LMD. An invasive strategy increased procedural MI and decreased nonprocedural MI with no significant difference for other outcomes including the primary end point There was no meaningful heterogeneity of treatment effect based on intermediate LMD status except for nonprocedural MI for which there was a greater absolute reduction with invasive management in the intermediate LMD group (-6.4% versus -2.0%; P-interaction =0.049). The invasive strategy improved angina-related quality of life and the benefit was durable throughout follow-up without significant heterogeneity based on intermediate LMD status.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the ISCHEMIA trial, there was no meaningful heterogeneity of treatment benefit from an invasive strategy regardless of intermediate LMD status except for a greater absolute risk reduction in nonprocedural MI with invasive management in those with intermediate LMD. An invasive strategy increased procedural MI, reduced nonprocedural MI, and improved angina-related quality of life.

TI  - Sternum-sparing multivessel coronary surgery as a routine procedure: Midterm results of total coronary revascularization via left anterior thoracotomy
T2  - JTCVS TECHNIQUES
AB  - Objective: A sternum-sparing approach of minimally invasive total coronary revascularization via left anterior thoracotomy demonstrated promising early outcomes in unselected patients with coronary artery multivessel disease. Follow-up data are still missing. Methods: From November 2019 to September 2023, coronary artery bypass grafting via left anterior minithoracotomy on cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic cardiac arrest was performed as a routine procedure in 392 consecutive, nonemergency patients (345 men; 67.0 +/- 9.9 years; range, 32-88 years). All patients had multivessel coronary artery disease (77.6% 3-vessel-disease, 22.4% 2-vessel-disease, and 32.9% left main stenosis). Patients at old age (older than a 80 years, 12.5%), with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <30%, 7.9%), diabetes mellitus (34.9%), massive obesity (body mass index > 35, 8.9%), and chronic lung disease (17.1%) were included. Mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score was 2.9 +/- 2.8. Mean midterm follow-up (100%) was 15.2 +/- 10.7 months (range, 0.1-39.5 months). Results: Left internal thoracic artery (99.0%), radial artery (70.4%), and saphenous vein grafts (57.4%) were used, and 70.4% of patients received at least 2 arterial grafts. A total of 3.0 +/- 0.8 anastomoses (range, 2-5 anastomoses) per patient were performed to revascularize the territories of left anterior descending (98.7%), circumflex (91.6%), and right coronary (70.9%) artery. Complete anatomical revascularization was achieved in 95.1%. At follow-up, all-cause-mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and stroke was 3.1%, 1.5%, 5.4%, and 0.7%, respectively. Overall major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rate was 8.7%. Conclusions: This is the first report of midterm follow-up after routine sternum-sparing total coronary revascularization via left anterior thoracotomy for multivessel coronary artery disease with a high rate of multiple arterial grafting and complete anatomical revascularization. Outcome was favorable and similar to that of contemporary conventional coronary artery bypass grafting.

TI  - Predicting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Machine Learning Models: Protocol fora Scoping Review
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains a public health conundrum with high morbidity and mortality rates. While early identification of high-risk patients could enable preventive interventions and improve survival, evidence on the effectiveness of current prediction methods remains inconclusive. Limited research exists on patients' prearrest pathophysiological status and predictive and prognostic factors of IHCA, highlighting the need for a comprehensive synthesis of predictive methodologies. Objective: This scoping review aims to synthesize and critically evaluate the quality and quantity of clinical features and machine learning (ML) models for predicting IHCA. The review will evaluate temporal characteristics, predictive and prognostic values of prearrest clinical features, and model performance metrics. Methods: This scoping review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and aims to synthesize studies that used ML algorithms to predict IHCA published between April 2009 and April 2024. We will conduct a comprehensive search using 4 major databases: PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Embase. The inclusion criteria are peer-reviewed, English-language studies that explore ML applications for predicting IHCA in adult patients (aged >= 18 years). Exclusion criteria include review articles, preprints, non-English-language studies, and studies without specific ML metrics for IHCA prediction. Two independent reviewers will conduct the screening and data extraction using Rayyan for deduplication and ensuring study eligibility. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data, and a narrative synthesis will provide insights into the clinical features used in the models, the performance metrics, and any gaps in the literature. Results: A total of 2479 records were identified between April 2009-April 2024. After removing duplicates and conducting screening, 16 studies have been included in the review. Data extraction and synthesis are ongoing and are expected to be completed by June 2025. The anticipated results from this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical predictors of IHCA used in ML models, including commonly reported clinical features such as vital signs, biomarkers, and comorbidities. We expect to highlight variations in data quality and quantity across studies, which may influence model performance. Conclusions: This study will contribute to advancing ML applications for IHCA prediction by addressing data challenges and promoting standardization to improve the clinical decision-making process. The results of this review are expected to inform future studies; promote consistency in the reporting of clinical features; and, ultimately, enhance the decision-making process in clinical settings, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients experiencing IHCA.

TI  - CPR-Induced Life-Threatening Hemothorax in a Rescue PCI Patient: Case Report and Brief Challenges of Regional Centers
T2  - REPORTS
AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is performed in cardiac arrests. There exist life support guidelines for individuals in performing effective CPR. CPR-related bleeding and hemothoraces are rare. Intercostal artery rupture leading up to shock and respiratory compromise in such situations is rare. Here, we present a unique case with a management dilemma while discussing challenges and guidance to regional centers. Case presentation: A 49-year-old Caucasian male experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest which required bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation from a colleague prior to commencement of lysis protocol at the local hospital. Transfer was later arranged to the nearest cardiac catheterization laboratory where a rescue percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in the left anterior descending artery that required strict dual antiplatelet use. Beneath the shroud of these events was a life-threatening right-sided hemothorax from rupture of intercostal arteries that occurred during initial resuscitation. Astute recognition of this post-percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in eventual transfer of the patient to a tertiary center where the source and the collection of the bleed was addressed. The patient's took a great trajectory to improvement. Conclusions: A regional center poses many challenges and limitations. Massive bleeding from intercostal arteries leading to hemorrhagic shock and respiratory compromise from an expanding hemothorax post-CPR is rare. Post-percutaneous coronary intervention use of dual antiplatelets posed a management dilemma that prompted assistance from tertiary counterparts. Clinicians should be astute and quick in assessing and providing care.

TI  - RIGHT CORONARY DISSECTION AND LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING THROMBUS: DUAL DILEMMA IN A YOUNG CARDIAC ARREST SURVIVOR
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) leading to cardiac arrest is an exceptionally rare occurrence in young adults. Those affected tend to abuse sympathomimetic drugs, have strong family histories, or have a significant burden of cardiac risk factors. Another uncommon cause of STEMI is coronary artery dissection, which overwhelmingly affects middle-and older-aged women with few cardiac risk factors. Case Report: A 22year- old athlete with no medical history was admitted to our institution post-cardiac arrest with an anterior STEMI and concomitant right coronary dissection. To our knowledge, this represents the first documented case of these simultaneous pathologies in a young cardiac arrest survivor. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Myocardial infarction is rare in young adults, and a diverse range of etiologies must be considered promptly to prevent delays in time-sensitive therapies, such as antiplatelet agents and revascularization. The emergency physician is most often the first point of contact in patients with acute coronary syndromes, and the failure to recognize it in young adults threatens them with premature death and potentially life-long disability.

TI  - Promising results from a residential rehabilitation intervention focused on fatigue and the secondary psychological and physical consequences of cardiac arrest: The SCARF feasibility study
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aims: This study investigated the feasibility and potential effect of SCARF (Survivors of Cardiac ARest focused on Fatigue) a multidisciplinary residential rehabilitation intervention focused on fatigue and the secondary psychological and physical consequences of cardiac arrest (CA). Methods: This was a prospective one-armed feasibility study. Six progression criteria were identified related to the feasibility of the intervention and viability of a future effect study in terms of: participant :recruitment (1), participant retention (2,3,4), and completeness of outcomes (5,6). Data on participant/clinician satisfaction with the intervention was also collected along with self-reported outcomes: fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, depression, function and disability, and physical activity (at baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months) and physical capacity (baseline and 12 weeks). Results: Four progression criteria were met including retention (87.5%) and completion of baseline outcomes (97.5%). Two criteria were not met: recruitment rate was 2.9 participants per month (estimated rate needed 6.1) and completion of final outcomes was 65% (estimated proportion needed 75%). Participant/clinician satisfaction with the intervention was high. Three months after the SCARF intervention small to moderate effect size changes of r = 0.18-0.46 were found for self-reported fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, depression, function and disability and for two of the physical capacity tests (d = 0.46-0.52). Conclusion: SCARF was found to be a feasible intervention with high participant/clinician satisfaction, high participant retention and the possible potential to improve self-reported and physical capacity outcomes. Procedures for study recruitment and collection of final outcomes should be modified before a fully powered randomised controlled trial is conducted.

TI  - Neuroethics across the Disorders of Consciousness Care Continuum
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - This review provides an ethical analysis of disorders of consciousness (DoC) along the care continuum, from preinjury to injury, acute care to subacute care and early rehabilitation, and finally transitioning to chronic rehabilitation and societal reintegration. We provide an actionable, chronological assessment of ethical issues related to DoC care. This expands upon established ethics literature, which focuses almost exclusively on the clinical encounter for DoC. Our goal is to broaden the aperture of ethical analysis to address how social and environmental conditions predispose some persons to brain injury, and how such conditions might also pose barriers to meaningful societal reintegration after recovery.

TI  - Early vasopressor use following traumatic injury: a systematic review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Current guidelines suggest limiting the use of vasopressors following traumatic injury; however, wide variations in practice exist. Although excessive vasoconstriction may be harmful, these agents may help reduce administration of potentially harmful resuscitation fluids. This systematic review aims to compare early vasopressor use to standard resuscitation in adults with trauma-induced shock.
   Design Systematic review.
   Data sources We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials. gov and the Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until October 2016, as well as the proceedings of 10 relevant international conferences from 2005 to 2016.
   Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials and controlled observational studies that compared the early vasopressor use with standard resuscitation in adults with acute traumatic injury.
   Results Of 8001 citations, we retrieved 18 full-text articles and included 6 studies (1 randomised controlled trial and 5 observational studies), including 2 published exclusively in abstract form. Across observational studies, vasopressor use was associated with increased short-term mortality, with unadjusted risk ratios ranging from 2.31 to 7.39. However, the risk of bias was considered high in these observational studies because patients who received vasopressors were systematically sicker than patients treated without vasopressors. One clinical trial (n= 78) was too imprecise to yield meaningful results. Two clinical trials are currently ongoing. No study measured long-term quality of life or cognitive function.
   Conclusions Existing data on the effects of vasopressors following traumatic injury are of very low quality according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. With emerging evidence of harm associated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and, in selected subgroups of patients, with permissive hypotension, the alternatives to vasopressor therapy are limited. Observational data showing that vasopressors are part of usual care would provide a strong justification for high-quality clinical trials of early vasopressor use during trauma resuscitation.

AB  - The Prevent Study is designed to investigate the effect of ct rate-smoothing algorithm on the onset of ventricular tachycardia in patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) with dual-chamber pacing and sensing function. Included in the study are patients who require ICD therapy for recurrent ventricular tachycardia or aborted cardiac arrest. After giving informed consent to the study, the patients receive a Ventak AV ICD (CPI-Guidant, St. Paul, MN). The patients are randomized to start either with active or inactive rate-smoothing algorithm. After 3 months, all patients cross over to the opposite group. Questionnaires are used to investigate quality-of-life issues. A total of 240 patients will be enrolled in the study, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. (C) 1999 by Excerpta Medico, Inc.

TI  - Relationship between age and outcomes of comatose cardiac arrest survivors in a setting without withdrawal of life support
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: Previous studies on the relationship between age and outcomes after cardiac arrest were performed in settings where the majority of patients died after the withdrawal of life support (WLS). We examined the association between age and outcomes of comatose cardiac arrest survivors in a setting where WLS was not performed.
   Methods: This single-centre retrospective observational study included adult comatose cardiac arrest survivors treated with targeted temperature management. In Korea, WLS is not permitted unless the patient is pronounced brain-dead. The primary outcome was poor neurologic outcome at hospital discharge, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories scores of 3-5. The secondary outcomes were in-hospital and six-month mortalities.
   Results: A total of 534 patients were analysed. In multivariate analysis, age was not associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.02), but it was independently associated with neurologic outcome at hospital discharge (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05) and six-month mortality (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07). When age was categorised into 10-year intervals, age groups less than 61-70 years had significantly lower OR for poor neurologic outcome compared with the reference group (61-70 years), while the OR for poor neurologic outcome in age groups greater than 70 years did not differ from that in the reference group.
   Conclusion: In a setting where WLS is not performed, we found that age was not associated with in-hospital mortality but was independently associated with neurologic outcome at hospital discharge and six-month mortality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Simultaneous blockade of α1- and β-actions of epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 8th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - Objective: Experimental and clinical studies have implicated that alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic effects of epinephrine significantly increased the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction by increasing myocardial oxygen consumption during ventricular fibrillation. This prompted experimental studies to investigate the effect of simultaneous blockade of alpha(1)- and beta-actions of epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Design: Literature review.
   Results: Improved postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction was observed in epinephrine-treated animals after its alpha(1)- and beta-actions were blocked, which were associated with less postresuscitation arrhythmia, lower blood lactate level, better neurologic recovery, and longer duration of survival.
   Conclusions: After simultaneous alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic blockade, epinephrine administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation yielded improved postresuscitation myocardial functions and significantly better postresuscitation outcomes.

TI  - Life and death decisions in the extremely preterm infant: What happens in a level III perinatal centre?
T2  - PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe resuscitation decisions and withdrawal of treatment practices in live-born infants at the extremes of prematurity at St Joseph's Health Care (London, Ontario).
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all neonatal deaths between 22 weeks, zero days' and 25 weeks, six days' gestational age over an eight-year period. Documentation concerning end-of-life discussions was subjected to thematic review to limit or withhold resuscitation or withdraw treatment.
   RESULTS: Three hundred eighteen infants were delivered between 22 weeks, zero days' and 25 weeks, six days' gestational age. Of these, 21% of infants (67 of 318) were stillborn, 38% (121 of 318) were alive on discharge from hospital and 41% (130 of 318) died in the neonatal period. Of the live-born infants who did not survive to discharge, 34% (44 of 130) had no initial attempts at resuscitation. Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment was the immediate cause of death in 84% of cases (61 of 73) in which the infant survived initial resuscitation. Documented parental rationale for withdrawal of treatment included "preventing pain and suffering", "not wanting (their baby) to die on a ventilator" and "poor quality of life". Families in which the mother identified as Catholic were more likely to withhold resuscitation and to withdraw life-sustaining treatment because death was imminent despite ongoing treatment. Non-Catholic families were more likely to withdraw life-sustaining treatment based on prediction of a poor long-term prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decisions not to initiate resuscitation remain fairly common practice at the extremes of prematurity. The majority of deaths in those who Survive initial resuscitative measures are secondary to withdrawal of treatment decisions made in the neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  - Analyzing the heart rhythm during chest compressions: Performance and clinical value of a new AED algorithm
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Purpose: Automated external defibrillators (AED) prompt the rescuer to stop chest compressions (CC) for ECG analysis during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We assessed the diagnostic accuracy and clinical benefit of a new AED algorithm (cprINSIGHT), which analyzes ECG and impedance signals during CC, allowing rhythm analysis with ongoing chest compressions.
   Methods: Amsterdam Police and Fire Fighters used a conventional AED in 2016-2017 (control) and an AED with cprINSIGHT in 2018-2019 (intervention). In the intervention AED, cprINSIGHT was activated after the first (conventional) analysis. This algorithm classified the rhythm as "shockable" (S) and "non-shockable" (NS), or "pause needed". Sensitivity for S, specificity for NS with 90% lower confidence limit (LCL), chest compression fractions (CCF) and pre-shock pause were compared between control and intervention cases accounting for multiple observations per patient.
   Results: Data from 465 control and 425 intervention cases were analyzed. cprINSIGHT reached a decision during CC in 70% of analyses. Sensitivity of the intervention AED was 96%, (LCL 93%) and specificity was 98% (LCL 97%), both not significantly different from control. Intervention cases had a shorter median pre-shock pause compared to control cases (8 s vs 22 s, p < 0.001) and higher median CCF (86% vs 80%, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: AEDs with cprINSIGHT analyzed the ECG during chest compressions in 70% of analyses with 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity when it made a S or a NS decision. Compared to conventional AEDs, cprINSIGHT leads to a significantly shorter pre-shock pause and a significant increase in CCF.

TI  - Prediction of Countershock Success in Patients Using the Autoregressive Spectral Estimation
T2  - METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia and within of minutes of its occurrence, optimal timing of countershock therapy is highly warranted to improve the chance of survival. This study was designed to investigate whether the autoregressive (AR) estimation technique was capable to reliably predict countershock success in VF cardiac arrest patients.
   Methods: ECG data of 1077 countershocks applied to 197 cardiac arrest patients with out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest between March 2002 and July 2004 were retrospectively analyzed. The ECG from the 2.5 s interval of the precountershock VF ECG was used for computing the AR based features Spectral Pole Power (SPP) and Spectral Pole Power with Dominant Frequency weighing (SPPDF) and Centroid Frequency (CF) and Amplitude Spectrum Area (AMSA) based on Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).
   Results: With ROC AUC values up to 84.1 % and diagnostic odds ratio up to 19.12 AR based features SPP and SPPDF have better prediction power than the FFT based features CF (80.5 %; 6.56) and AMSA (82.1 %; 8.79).
   Conclusions: AR estimation based features are promising alternatives to FFT based features for countershock outcome when analyzing human data.

TI  - Particularities of hand and wrist complex injuries in polytrauma management
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Hand and wrist lesions are relatively common in polytraumatised patients. These subjects sustain a wide range of potential life-threatening conditions and hand and wrist injuries incurred are often not diagnosed or are insufficiently treated. Closed lesions are the most frequently missed diagnosis, but even severe open lesions may be incorrectly treated. Most of these hand and wrist injuries can have a strong negative impact on long-term quality of life, particularly when treatment of these injuries is poor or delayed. Orthopaedic and hand surgeons should be vigilant in their assessment and treatment of patients with multiple injuries and a global approach, based on the advanced trauma life support (ATLS)-protocol, must be applied. The very common association of head, chest, abdomen, bone and soft-tissue lesions in the polytraumatised patient requires a multidisciplinary team approach from the beginning. The energy of trauma in these patients often causes complex injuries to the wrist and hand; these require correct treatment in terms of both timing and techniques. It is not possible to create a practical, useful guideline with a "one lesion-one solution'' approach, because every case is different; therefore, this paper describes a spectrum of indications and techniques that may be useful in managing hand and wrist injuries, particularly in polytraumatised patients.

TI  - Cognitive Aids Do Not Prompt Initiation of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Simulated Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Arrests
T2  - SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE
AB  - Introduction Although American Heart Association guidelines exist for proper management of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be of poor quality and is not performed in all indicated situations. Cognitive aids have been created to assist in rapid, accurate recall of guidelines for pediatric CPA management.
   Methods Pediatric residents participated in individual mock codes for two years. Using a high-fidelity simulator, each resident participated in a standardized scenario that required management of both pulseless ventricular tachycardia and pulseless electrical activity. The primary study objective was to calculate the proportion of residents (a) who were not performing CPR on a simulated pulseless patient when cognitive aid use was first initiated and (b) who subsequently initiated CPR after cognitive aid use.
   Results One hundred thirty-two (83.5%) of 158 pediatric residents participated, and of 125 videos available for review, 107 residents (85.6%) used a cognitive aid. Mean (SD) time to cognitive aid use was 106 (100) seconds after the mannequin became pulseless. Most common immediate actions prompted by cognitive aid use were the following: defibrillation, 43 (40%) of 107; and adrenaline (epinephrine) administration, 28 (26%) of 107. Most alarmingly, 58 (54%) of 107 were not performing CPR on the pulseless patient when cognitive aid use was initiated and only two (3.4%) of 58 were subsequently prompted to initiate chest compressions.
   Discussion Cognitive aids in use during this study did not prompt timely initiation of CPR, potentially contributing to delays and errors in CPA management. Failure of these aids to prompt CPR initiation represents a missed opportunity to enhance performance of this vital skill.

TI  - Extremely low gestational age neonates and resuscitation: survey on perspectives of Canadian neonatologists
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives Resuscitation care planning for extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) is complex and ethically charged. Increasing survival at lower gestational ages has had a significant impact on this complexity. It also has an impact on healthcare resource utilization and policy development in Canada. This study sought to determine the current attitudes and practices of neonatologists in Canada, and to assess moral distress associated with resuscitation decisions in the ELGAN population. It also aimed to explore the perspectives of adopting a shared decision-making approach where further data with regard to best interests and prognosis are gathered in an individualized manner after birth. Methods Neonatologists in Canadian level III NICUs were surveyed in 2020. Results Amongst the 65 responses, 78% expressed moral distress when parents request non-resuscitation at 24 weeks. Uncertainty around long-term outcomes in an era with improved chances of morbidity-free survival was the most prominent factor contributing to moral distress. 70% felt less moral distress deciding goals of care after the baby's initial resuscitation and preferred an individualized approach to palliation decisions based on postnatal course and assessment. Conclusions While most current guidelines still support the option of non-resuscitation for infants born at less than 25 weeks, we show evidence of moral distress among Canadian neonatologists that suggests the consideration of routine resuscitation from 24 weeks and above is a more ethical approach in the current era of improved outcomes. Canadian neonatologists identified less moral distress when goals of care are developed postnatally, with availability of more evidence for prognostication, instead of antenatally based primarily on gestational age.

TI  - Resuscitation of viable but nonculturable microorganisms: A highly promising strategy for enhanced bioremediation
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state is a common phenomenon through which microorganisms respond to stress to ensure long-term survival. To date, more than 100 microbial species have been reported to enter the VBNC state under various stressful conditions. In the VBNC state, cells undergo morphological, physiological, and genetic changes, with the mechanisms of VBNC state formation differing among microbial species and stressful conditions. Although the VBNC state has been extensively investigated in the fields of medicine and food safety, research on the VBNC state of pollutant-degrading microorganisms remains limited. Mounting evidence has confirmed the existence of the VBNC state in microorganisms capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phenol. The resuscitation of VBNC microorganisms, which represent a significant portion of microbial resources, is crucial for the effective microbial remediation of polluted environments. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the formation, characteristics, and mechanisms of the VBNC state in microorganisms. It also outlines various methods for resuscitating VBNC bacteria, with a specific focus on resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). Importantly, from the perspective of environmental bioremediation, this review highlights the potential of VBNC state bacteria, the application of Rpfs in resuscitating VBNC bacteria in polluted environments, and the feasibility of utilizing resuscitated strains as inoculants for environmental bioremediation.

TI  - Sudden cardiac arrest on the field of play: turning tragedy into a survivable event
T2  - NETHERLANDS HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest remains the leading cause of death in exercising athletes, and recent studies have shown that it occurs more frequently than historical estimates. While out-of-hospital cardiac arrest often proves fatal, advance preparation can improve outcomes and the chance of survival. First responders to a collapsed athlete on the field of play may include team medical personnel, coaches, other athletes, officials, venue staff, emergency medical services personnel, or lay bystanders. Prompt and accurate recognition of sudden cardiac arrest, a comprehensive and rehearsed emergency action plan, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and immediate access to and use of an automated external defibrillator are each pivotal links in the chain of survival. This review summarises the components of an effective emergency action plan, highlights the critical role of automated external defibrillators, and reviews the diagnosis and management of sudden cardiac arrest on the field of play.

TI  - Genome-based analysis to understanding rapid resuscitation of cryopreserved anammox consortia via sequential supernatant addition
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Simple cryopreservation of anaerobic ammonium-oxidation (anammox) consortia has become a promising preservation technology for the fast start-up of the anammox process. Here, we use genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to understand of the microbial interaction in a simple and effective resuscitation process for long-term cryopreserved anammox consortia by sequential addition of anammox SBR supernatant. Performance results showed that sequential addition of anammox supernatant significantly reduced the resuscitation time of the granule-based anammox process from 40 to 20 days. Genome-centric metagenomics were used to recover 19 high-quality draft genomes of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria. Comparative metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression of Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, the dominant anammox bacterium, and heterotrophic bacteria to better understand their potential interactions. Proteobacteria-affiliated bacteria found in the supernatant were highly active in producing the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate which are needed for growth of the auxotrophic anammox bacteria. In addition, the significantly higher expression levels of hzsA and CO2-fixtion genes in the Candidatus Kuenenia genome indicated the anammox bacteria were likely more active and growing faster after sequential anammox supernatant addition during the resuscitation process. The resuscitation treatment pulse assays confirmed that sequential addition of supernatant was an effective way for the rapid resuscitation of anammox consortia. Our findings offer the first evidence of cross-feeding during the rapid resuscitation of cryo-preserved anammox consortia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Therapeutic Hypothermia With Progesterone Improves Neurologic Outcomes in Ventricular Fibrillation Cardiac Arrest After Electric Shock
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Trauma by electricity imposes mechanical, electrical, and thermal forces on the human body. Often, the delicate cardiac electrophysiology is disrupted causing dysrhythmia and subsequent cardiac arrest. Anoxic brain injury (ABI) is the most severe consequence and the main cause of mortality following cardiac arrest. Establishing a working protocol to treat patients who are at risk for ABI after suffering a cardiac arrest is of paramount importance. There has yet to be sufficient exploration of combination therapy of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and progesterone as a neuroprotective strategy in patients who have suffered cardiac arrest after electric shock.
   The protocol required TH initiation upon transfer to the ICU with a target core body temperature of 33 degrees C for 18 hours. This was achieved through a combination of cooling blankets, ice packs, chilled IV fluids, nasogastric lavage with iced saline, and intravascular cooling devices. Progesterone therapy at 80-100 mg intramuscularly every 12 hours for 72 hours was initiated shortly after admission to the ICU.
   We present a case series of three patients (mean age = 29.3 years, mean presenting Glasgow Coma Score = 3) who suffered ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest from non-lightning electric shock, and who had considerably improved outcomes following the TH-progesterone combination therapy protocol. The average length of stay was 13.7 days.
   The cases presented suggest that there may be a role for neuroprotective combination therapy in post-resuscitation care of VF cardiac arrest. While TH is well documented as a neuroprotective measure, progesterone administration is a safe therapy with promising, albeit currently inconclusive, neuroprotective effect. Future protocols involving TH and progesterone combination therapy in these patients should be further explored.

TI  - Treatment and outcome of patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit
T2  - NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sudden circulatory arrest is most often of cardiac origin. Our aim was to evaluate circulatory arrest etiology and treatment strategies in patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with persistent impairment of consciousness in relation to survival and the subsequent quality of life.
   DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients after CPR treated according to the local protocol including mild hypothermia in the intensive cardiac care unit.
   RESULTS: Over 2 years, we admitted 57 mechanically ventilated patients after CPR. 47 patients (82%) were resuscitated outside the hospital. In 33 patients (58%) the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation; in the remaining patients (42%) asystole/pulseless electrical activity. Urgent coronary angiography was performed in 36 patients and percutaneous coronary intervention in 25 of them. The admission APACHE II score was 32,4 +/- 3,4 with predicted mortality of 77, 1%. The hospital survival rate was 54% and 47% of the patients were discharged home in a good state of health (Glasgow outcome score 4-5).
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that comprehensive post-resuscitation care including therapeutic hypothermia and percutaneous coronary intervention in selected cases may have a positive impact on the prognosis of patients after CPR.

TI  - Incidence and Outcomes of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients Admitted to the Hospital in Canada from 2013 to 2017
T2  - CJC OPEN
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a promi- nent medical concern worldwide. Epidemiologic metrics and trends over time for OHCA cases in Canada are not well defined. This study evaluated geographic differences in the incidence and outcomes of OHCA patients admitted to hospitals across Canada, during the period 2013-2017. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study included 10,492 nontraumatic OHCA patients aged 2-85 years (66% male) who were admitted to an acute-care hospital in any Canadian province or territory (excluding Quebec) between 2013 and 2017. Overall age- and sex-standardized incidence measures (per 100,000 population per year) were calculated through direct standardization to the 2016 Ca- nadian population. Temporal trends in incidence and survival to hos- pital discharge were evaluated. Results: The overall age- and sex-standardized incidence of OHCA patients admitted to the hospital was 8.3 per 100,000 population per year, which did not change significantly from 2013 to 2017 (incidence rate ratio: 1.01, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.02). The incidence was highest in British Columbia (9.2 per 100,000 population per year), Manitoba (9.0 per 100,000 population per year), and Nova Scotia (9.0 per 100,000 population per year), and lowest in New Brunswick (6.5 per 100,000 population per year), Prince Edward Island (6.8 per 100,000 population per year), and Saskatchewan (7.5 per 100,000 population per year). The proportion of OHCA patients who survived to hospital discharge was highest in Prince Edward Island (57%) and lowest in Ontario (38%). No significant trend in rates of survival to hospital discharge was observed from 2013 (43%) to 2017 (42%; P = 0.86). Conclusions: The age- and sex-standardized incidence of OHCA pa- tients admitted to the hospital, and their survival outcomes, were stable in Canada from 2013 to 2017, with considerable variation noted across geographic regions.

TI  - HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE: ACCIDENTAL ATENOLOL TOXICITY?
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Antihypertensive medications, including beta-blockers, are widely used in patients with chronic kidney disease. Unlike most beta-blockers, atenolol is excreted primarily by the kidney, and its clearance by peritoneal dialysis is poor. These pharmacokinetic factors may predispose patients to gradual accumulation of the drug over time. Objectives: To review the management of a diagnostic dilemma, the role of glucagon therapy, and the clinical implications of atenolol clearance. Case Report: A young woman with end-stage renal disease requiring peritoneal dialysis presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability with hypotension and relative bradycardia. The patient reported that she took her regular four antihypertensive agents, including atenolol, with no excess ingestion or recent dose changes. After resuscitation and consideration of a broad differential diagnosis, the most likely cause of the patient's illness was determined to be unintentional atenolol toxicity, with secondary mesenteric ischemia due to a low-flow state that caused her abdominal pain. Glucagon therapy led to rapid correction of the patient's hemodynamic instability and pain. Conclusion: The unique pharmacokinetics of long-term medications must be considered in patients with impaired clearance, such as this patient with end-stage renal disease treated by peritoneal dialysis. Medications may gradually accumulate to supratherapeutic levels, which over time may lead to symptoms of significant toxicity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cardiac arrest: An interdisciplinary review of the literature from 2018
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: The Interdisciplinary Cardiac Arrest Research Review (ICARE) group was formed in 2018 to conduct a systematic annual search of peer-reviewed literature relevant to cardiac arrest (CA). The goals of the review are to illustrate best practices and help reduce knowledge silos by disseminating clinically relevant advances in the field of CA across disciplines.
   Methods: An electronic search of PubMed using keywords related to CA was conducted. Title and abstracts retrieved by these searches were screened for relevancy, separated by article type (original research or review), and sorted into 7 categories. Screened manuscripts underwent standardized scoring of overall methodological quality and importance. Articles scoring higher than 99 percentiles by category-type were selected for full critique. Systematic differences between editors and reviewer scores were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
   Results: A total of 9119 articles were identified on initial search; of these, 1214 were scored after screening for relevance and deduplication, and 80 underwent full critique. Prognostication & Outcomes category comprised 25%. and Epidemiology & Public Health 17.5% of fully reviewed articles. There were no differences between editor and reviewer scoring.
   Conclusions: The total number of articles demonstrates the need for an accessible source summarizing high-quality research findings to serve as a high-yield reference for clinicians and scientists seeking to absorb the ever-growing body of CA-related literature. This may promote further development of the unique and interdisciplinary field of CA medicine.

TI  - Role of buccal PCO2 in the management of fluid resuscitation during hemorrhagic shock
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 8th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - Arterial pressure is a widely used measurement for estimating the severity of hemorrhagic shock and to guide its management. However, this capability is reduced when very low arterial pressure values cannot be reliably measured by noninvasive methods. Moreover, hypoperfusion may be masked by compensatory hemodynamic changes, and therefore, in the presence of near normal blood pressure, tissue hypoperfusion may progress undetected. Accordingly, hypercarbia is a general phenomenon of perfusion failure, which occurs in coincidence of the onset of hypotension and is promptly reversed with restoration of normal blood flows. Increases in buccal mucosa PCO2 are highly correlated with increases in gastric wall and sublingual mucosa PCO2 and decreases in tissue blood flows during hemorrhagic shock. In both clinical and experimental settings, tissue PCO2 measured in the oral mucosa proved to be a practical and reliable measurement for the diagnosis of circulatory failure states and an indicator of its severity. In contrast to intraarterial pressure, buccal PCO2 discriminated between short- and long-term survival after large-volume blood loss. Buccal Pco(2) measurement therefore emerges as a useful predictor for survival and outcome and a useful guide to manage fluid resuscitation during hemorrhagic shock.

TI  - AVE4454B-a novel sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 inhibitor-compared less effective than cariporide for resuscitation from cardiac arrest
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - We compared the efficacy of the novel sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE-1) inhibitor AVE4454B with cariporide for resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) assessing the effects on left ventricular myocardial distensibility during chest compression, myocardial function after the return of spontaneous circulation, and survival. Three groups of 10 rats each were subjected to 10 min of untreated VF and resuscitation attempted by providing chest compression for up to 8 min with the depth of compression adjusted to attain an aortic diastolic pressure between 26 and 28 mmHg (to secure a coronary perfusion pressure above 20 mmHg) followed by electrical shocks. Rats received AVE4454B (1 mg/kg), cariporide (1 mg/kg), or vehicle control immediately before chest compression. We observed that NHE-1 inhibition (NHEI) preserved left ventricular myocardial distensibility during chest compression evidenced by less depth of compression required to attain the target aortic diastolic pressure corresponding to (mean +/- standard deviation) 14.1 +/- 1.1 mm in the AVE4454B group (P < 0.001 versus control), 15.0 +/- 1.4 mm in the cariporide group (P < 0.01 versus control), and 17.0 +/- 1.2 mm in controls. When the depth of compression was related to the coronary perfusion pressure generated-an index of left ventricular distensibility-only the cariporide group attained statistical significance. Postresuscitation, both compounds ameliorated myocardial dysfunction evidenced by lesser reductions in mean aortic pressure and the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure increase as well as earlier normalization of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increases. This effect was associated with improved survival corresponding to 55% in the AVE4454B group (not significant) and 70% in the cariporide group (P < 0.01 versus control by Gehan-Breslow analysis) at 240 min postresuscitation. An inverse correlation was found between plasma cytochrome c and indices of left ventricular function at 240 min postresuscitation suggesting that NHEI exerts beneficial effects in part by attenuating mitochondria! injury. We conclude that cariporide is more effective than AVE4454B for resuscitation from cardiac arrest given its more prominent effect on preserving left ventricular myocardial distensibility and promoting survival.

TI  - Cariporide given during resuscitation promotes return of electrically stable and mechanically competent cardiac activity
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and myocardial dysfunction commonly occur after cardiac resuscitation compromising the return of stable circulation. We investigated in a pig model of VF whether limiting Na+-induced cytosolic Ca2+ overload using the sarcolemmal sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) inhibitor cariporide promotes resuscitation with stable circulation.
   Methods: VF was electrically induced in 20 male pigs and left untreated for 6 min after which CPR was initiated and continued for 8 min before attempting defibrillation. Pigs were randomized to receive 3-mg/kg cariporide (n = 10) or 0.9%-NaCl (n = 10) before chest compression.
   Results: Seven of 10 pigs in each group were successfully resuscitated and survived 2 h. Cariporide ameliorated post-resuscitation ventricular ectopic activity Such that fewer singlets (5 +/- 5 vs. 26 +/- 21; p < 0.05) and fewer bigemini (1 +/- 3 vs. 33 +/- 25; p < 0.05) were observed during the initial 5 min post-resuscitation. Additionally, cariporide-treated pigs did not require additional post-resuscitation shocks for ventricular tachycardia or recurrent VF (0.0 +/- 0.0 vs. 5.3 +/- 7.8 shocks; p = 0.073). During the initial 60 min cariporide treated pigs had higher, cardiac index (6.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.4 +/- 1.1 L/min/m(2); p < 0.01), left ventricular stroke work index (45 +/- 9 vs. 36 +/- 10 gm m/beat/m(2); p < 0.05), and numerically higher mean aortic pressure (104 +/- 11 vs. 91 +/- 12 mmHg; p = 0.054).
   Conclusion: Cariporide administered at the start of chest compression may help restore electrically and mechanically stable circulation after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Infants and Children With Cardiac Disease A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Cardiac arrest occurs at a higher rate in children with heart disease than in healthy children. Pediatric basic life support and advanced life support guidelines focus on delivering high-quality resuscitation in children with normal hearts. The complexity and variability in pediatric heart disease pose unique challenges during resuscitation. A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the literature addressing resuscitation in children with heart disease. MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were searched from 1966 to 2015, cross-referencing pediatric heart disease with pertinent resuscitation search terms. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and levels of evidence for practice guidelines were used. The recommendations in this statement concur with the critical components of the 2015 American Heart Association pediatric basic life support and pediatric advanced life support guidelines and are meant to serve as a resuscitation supplement. This statement is meant for caregivers of children with heart disease in the prehospital and in-hospital settings. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the high-risk pediatric cardiac population will promote early recognition and treatment of decompensation to prevent cardiac arrest, increase survival from cardiac arrest by providing high-quality resuscitations, and improve outcomes with postresuscitation care.

TI  - Amniotic fluid embolism rescued by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but often catastrophic complication of pregnancy that leads to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Although few case reports have reported successful use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) with AFE, concerns can be raised about the increased bleeding risks with that device. Methods This study included patients with AFE rescued by VA-ECMO hospitalized in two high ECMO volume centers between August 2008 and February 2021. Clinical characteristics, critical care management, in-intensive care unit (ICU) complications, and hospital outcomes were collected. ICU survivors were assessed for health-related quality of life (HRQL) in May 2021. Results During that 13-year study period, VA-ECMO was initiated in 54 parturient women in two high ECMO volume centers. Among that population, 10 patients with AFE [median (range) age 33 (24-40), SAPS II at 69 (56-81)] who fulfilled our diagnosis criteria were treated with VA-ECMO. Pregnancy evolved for 36 (30-41) weeks. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest before ECMO and two were cannulated under cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pre-ECMO hemodynamic was severely impaired with an inotrope score at 370 (55-1530) mu g/kg/min, a severe left ventricular ejection fraction measured at 14 (0-40)%, and lactate at 12 (2-30) mmol/L. 70% of these patients were alive at hospital discharge despite an extreme pre-ECMO severity and massive blood product transfusion. However, HRQL was lower than age-matched controls and still profoundly impaired in the role-physical, bodily pain, and general health components after a median of 44 months follow-up. Conclusion In this rare per-delivery complication, our results support the use of VA-ECMO despite intense DIC and ongoing bleeding. Future studies should focus on customized, patient-centered, rehabilitation programs that could lead to improved HRQL in this population.

TI  - Panayiotopoulos Syndrome Presenting With Status Epilepticus and Cardiorespiratory Arrest A Case Report
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Panayiotopoulos syndrome is early-onset benign childhood epilepsy, now classified as an electroclinical syndrome. The original description in 1989 focused on the triad of nocturnal seizures, tonic eye deviation, and vomiting. With available data from the long-term studies, a wide variety of manifestations have been described, with recognition of autonomic features as being the most prominent aspect of this epilepsy. The presenting symptoms are usually focal seizures comprising autonomic symptoms and/or behavioral changes. Majority of these seizures are in sleep, with half of the seizures progressing to become secondarily generalized. Occasionally, these seizures can present with prominent autonomic features such as ictal vomiting, pallor, flushing/cyanosis, and tachycardia with prolonged thermoregulatory changes lasting for hours, constituting autonomic status epilepticus. Recovery from this autonomic status epilepticus is within hours and is always complete. Autonomic status epilepticus has been previously reported in this epilepsy syndrome, but ictal cardiorespiratory arrest is extremely rare, with only 4 cases being reported in literature. All 4 cases reported in literature recovered spontaneously and did not require resuscitation. Here we present a 3 1/2-year-old male child with Panayiotopoulos syndrome who presented with status epilepticus and ictal cardiorespiratory arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation for revival.

TI  - Barriers to bystander CPR in deprived communities: Findings from a qualitative study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Study aim Rates of out of hospital cardiac arrest are higher in deprived communities. Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (BCPR) can double the chance of survival but occurs less often in these communities in comparison to more affluent communities. People living in deprived communities are, therefore, doubly disadvantaged and there is limited evidence to explain why BCPR rates are lower. The aim of this paper is to examine the barriers to administering BCPR in deprived communities. Method Mixed method qualitative study with ten single sex focus groups (n = 61) conducted in deprived communities across central Scotland and 18 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from the UK, Europe and the USA. Results Two key themes related to confidence and environmental factors were identified to summarise the perceived barriers to administering BCPR in deprived communities. Barriers related to confidence included: self-efficacy; knowledge and awareness of how, and when, to administer CPR; accessing CPR training; having previous experience of administering BCPR; who required CPR; and whether the bystander was physically fit to give CPR. Environmental barriers focused on the safety of the physical environment in which people lived, and fear of reprisal from gangs or the police. Conclusions Barriers to administering BCPR identified in the general population are relevant to people living in deprived communities but are exacerbated by a range of contextual, individual and environmental factors. A one-size-fits-all approach is not sufficient to promote 'CPR readiness' in deprived communities. Future approaches to working with disadvantaged communities should be tailored to the local community.

TI  - Neurological Complications Occurring After Liver Transplantation: Role of Risk Factors, Hepatic Encephalopathy, and Acute (on Chronic) Brain Injury
T2  - LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) remains the only way to definitively cure patients with the most severe liver diseases. Because the survival rate is now fairly high, important questions about neurological sequelae or quality of life after LT have emerged. Indeed, LT represents a peculiar situation because up to 30% of patients present with neurological symptoms after LT compared with only 4% after cardiac transplant and 0.5% after renal transplant. These postoperative neurological symptoms have long been interpreted as sequelae of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, postoperative decompensation of an unknown cerebral condition due to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis or undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorders or aging constitute other possibilities that are underrecognized. Some patients who undergo LT for acute liver failure and patients with cirrhosis without episodes of HE and without any previous cerebral alteration also display post-LT neurological symptoms. This latter situation speaks in favor of a direct adverse effect of either general anesthesia, the surgical procedure, or factors related to the postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) environment. The role of inflammation, which has been described in the ICU setting, could also be a crucial determinant. In this review, we will discuss the neurological complications associated with LT, the neurocognitive complications after LT, and how to assess the LT-related neurological or neurocognitive complications. Furthermore, we will review the various hypotheses surrounding post-LT neurocognitive impairment and will conclude with recommendations for future directions.

TI  - Extracorporeal resuscitation-criteria, prerequisites, outcome A reality check
T2  - MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN
AB  - In select patients, in whom conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cCPR) fails to re-establish circulation, the 2021 European Resuscitation Council guidelines suggest considering extracorporeal resuscitation (eCPR) as a rescue therapy in settings in which it can be implemented. eCPR is becoming established during refractory cardiac arrest as a bridge-to-therapy for diagnosis and treatment of reversible causes of cardiac arrest, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, accidental hypothermia, overdose with cardiotoxic substances, and acute hypoxia. Patient selection criteria comprise prognostic characteristics of cardiac arrest such as witnessed status, resuscitation efforts within 5 min, shockable initial rhythm, and characteristics of effective cCPR such as signs of life during resuscitation, persistent ventricular fibrillation, intermittent episodes of spontaneous circulation or end-tidal CO2 levels constantly > 10 mm Hg, patient age and health status. The timeframe from cardiac arrest to eCPR is a major contributor for neurologically favourable survival and should not exceed 60 min according to current guidelines. This may be achieved with an efficient "load & go" strategy, including early patient selection and rapid transport with ongoing mechanical cCPR to the eCPR centre, or with a prehospital eCPR strategy. Two randomized controlled eCPR trials demonstrated survival rates of 43% and 31.5% in patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation and cardiac-origin cardiac arrest, respectively. Whether these results are generalizable outside such highly specialized centres, and which prehospital and in-hospital strategy is best for which patients, remains to be determined in future studies.

TI  - Investigating the Effectiveness of Serious Games in Educating Neonatal Resuscitation: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS REVIEW
AB  - Background: Neonatal resuscitation is a critical skill that requires regular training and practice; however, traditional training methods are often limited by accessibility, cost and engagement. Serious games (SGs) have emerged as a promising educational tool to address these challenges. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of SGs in neonatal resuscitation education.
   Objectives: This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of SGs in neonatal resuscitation education.
   Methods: This systematic review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines and utilized a comprehensive search strategy across multiple databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest) using keywords and MeSH terms related to neonatal resuscitation and SGs. Studies published in English up to July 25, 2024, focusing on SGs for neonatal resuscitation training were included. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving disagreements through discussion.
   Results: SGs were as effective as video lectures in improving neonatal resuscitation performance. Also, remote digital SGs provided interactive and enjoyable learning experiences for anesthesiologists and pediatric trainees. Paramedics and registered nurses significantly improved neonatal resuscitation performance and knowledge using SGs. Nursing students exhibited increased knowledge, problem-solving abilities and self-confidence with virtual reality-based SGs.
   Conclusions: SGs demonstrate promise as a complementary tool for neonatal resuscitation education. They can enhance knowledge acquisition, and skills development, and potentially improve motivation and engagement. However, further research is needed to optimize game design, investigate long-term learning outcomes, and assess skills transfer to clinical practice. Integrating SGs with traditional simulation-based training methods could offer a comprehensive and effective approach to training healthcare professionals in this critical skill set.

TI  - Frailty Burden and Efficacy of Initial Invasive Strategy in Chronic Coronary Disease: The ISCHEMIA Trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - Background: Frailty is common among patients with chronic coronary disease and is associated with worse outcomes. Methods: A pooled, post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials was conducted. Baseline frailty was assessed using a Frailty Index (FI), and participants were categorized into data-derived tertiles. Multivariable Cox models with multiplicative interaction terms (frailty x treatment arm) were constructed to evaluate whether baseline frailty status modified the treatment effect of the initial invasive (vs conservative) strategy on a composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest and the secondary outcome of HRQoL (Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]). Results: Among 5322 participants (mean 64 years, 24% female), a high frailty burden (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1) was associated with lower baseline SAQ scores and increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes on follow-up. Baseline frailty burden did not significantly modify the effect of the initial invasive strategy on the primary composite outcome (P(interaction)frailty x intervention arm = 0.30). However, frailty significantly modified the effect of the initial invasive strategy on HRQoL, with higher baseline frailty burden associated with greater improvement in SAQ scores at 1 year with initial invasive (vs. conservative) treatment (P(interaction)frailty x intervention arm < 0.001). The treatment effect of an initial invasive vs. conservative strategy on 12-month SAQ score change was most pronounced in individuals with lower baseline SAQ scores in both higher and lower frailty burden groups. Conclusion: Patients with chronic coronary disease with a higher frailty burden are more likely to experience greater improvements in HRQoL with initial invasive management without a higher risk of adverse clinical events. Lower baseline SAQ scores predicted greater improvement in HRQoL with initial invasive management, independent of frailty burden.

TI  - Outcome of babies with no detectable heart rate before 10 minutes of age, and the effect of gestation
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD-FETAL AND NEONATAL EDITION
AB  - Objective Current resuscitation guidelines suggest that it is reasonable to consider stopping resuscitation where no heart rate (cardiac activity) has been detected for 10 min in a newborn baby from birth. We aimed to determine the mortality rate and 2-year neurodevelopmental outcome of all babies born with no heart rate before 10 min of age where resuscitation was attempted in a tertiary referral centre over a 5-year period.
   Design To identify all babies with no heart rate before age 10 min we examined two groups:
   All babies classified as live born who received cardiac massage at birth between January 2009 and December 2013.
   All babies classified as stillborn between January 2009 and December 2013 where attempts were made at resuscitation beyond 10 min.
   Results 87 babies received cardiac massage. 81 babies were live born and 6 were classified as stillborn. Twenty-two babies had no heart rate before 10 min of age. Eight babies survived to 2-year follow-up. 6/11 term babies survived, 2/4 babies born between 32 weeks and 37 weeks survived, and no infants born less than 32 weeks survived (n=7). Of the survivors, 5/8 had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years' age. One patient was lost to follow-up, while the other two patients had hemiplegia.
   Conclusions Our results add to the body of evidence suggesting that having no heart rate before 10 min of age, in term babies, may not be an appropriate prompt to discontinue resuscitation.

TI  - Acute Pancreatitis: A Review
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - ImportanceIn the United States, acute pancreatitis is one of the leading causes of hospital admission from gastrointestinal diseases, with approximately 300000 emergency department visits each year. Outcomes from acute pancreatitis are influenced by risk stratification, fluid and nutritional management, and follow-up care and risk-reduction strategies, which are the subject of this review. ObservationsMEDLINE was searched via PubMed as was the Cochrane databases for English-language studies published between January 2009 and August 2020 for current recommendations for predictive scoring tools, fluid management and nutrition, and follow-up and risk-reduction strategies for acute pancreatitis. Several scoring systems, such as the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II tools, have good predictive capabilities for disease severity (mild, moderately severe, and severe per the revised Atlanta classification) and mortality, but no one tool works well for all forms of acute pancreatitis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition are associated with lower rates of mortality and infectious complications, yet the optimal type and rate of fluid resuscitation have yet to be determined. The underlying etiology of acute pancreatitis should be sought in all patients, and risk-reduction strategies, such as cholecystectomy and alcohol cessation counseling, should be used during and after hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. Conclusions and RelevanceAcute pancreatitis is a complex disease that varies in severity and course. Prompt diagnosis and stratification of severity influence proper management. Scoring systems are useful adjuncts but should not supersede clinical judgment. Fluid management and nutrition are very important aspects of care for acute pancreatitis.
   This narrative review summarizes the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of acute pancreatitis, including advances in risk stratification, fluid and nutritional management, and follow-up care and risk-reduction strategies.

TI  - STABILITY OF PATIENT PREFERENCES REGARDING LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENTS
T2  - CHEST
AB  - Physicians often express concern about the reliability of critically ill patient''s preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments. We interviewed 30 Veterans Administration intensive care unit patients to determine their preferences for resuscitation, resuscitation requiring mechanical ventilation, artificial hydration and nutrition, and hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia. Patients expressed their preferences considering their current health and then two hypothetical scenarios, stroke and dementia. Follow-up interviews occurred one month later to assess preference stability. We found a diversity of opinions about life-sustaining treatments. Despite significant changes in health status and mood (p < 0.05), treatment preferences were stable over time (kappa = .35-.70). Our results suggest that life-sustaining treatment preferences solicited during a serious illness are reliable and may be used in decision making when a patient becomes unable to communicate or is mentally incapacitated.

TI  - Predictors of Operative Mortality in Cardiac Surgical Patients with Prolonged Intensive Care Unit Duration
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several systems have been developed to predict mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission in medical and surgical patients. However, a similar tool specific to cardiac surgical patients with prolonged ICU duration does not exist. The purpose of the current study was to identify independent perioperative predictors of operative mortality among cardiac surgical patients with prolonged ICU duration.
   STUDY DESIGN: From 2003 to 2008, a total of 13,105 cardiac surgical patients with ICU durations >48 hours were identified within a statewide database. Perioperative factors, including Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality, were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified significant correlates of operative mortality and their relative strength of association as determined by the Wald chi-square statistic.
   RESULTS: Mean patient age was 66.8 +/- 11.2 years, median ICU duration was 76.5 hours (range 56.0 to 124.0 hours), and mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was 4.4% +/- 6.2%. Among preoperative and operative factors, intra-aortic balloon pump use, patient age, immunosuppressive therapy, hemodialysis requirement, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and heart failure proved to be the strongest correlates of mortality (all p < 0.05) on risk-adjusted multivariate analysis. Type of cardiac procedure had no significant association with mortality after risk adjustment. Among postoperative complications, cardiac arrest, prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 24 hours), and stroke were the strongest predictors of risk-adjusted mortality (all p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Operative mortality can be predicted by select risk factors for cardiac surgical patients with prolonged ICU duration. Patient age, preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump, postoperative cardiac arrest, prolonged ventilation, and stroke have the strongest association with mortality. Identification of these factors in the perioperative setting can enhance resource use and improve mortality after cardiac surgery. (J Am Coll Surg 2013; 216: 1116-1123.

TI  - Community lay rescuer automated external defibrillation programs - Key state legislative components and implementation strategies - A summary of a decade of experience for healthcare providers, policymakers, legislators, employers, and community leaders from the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee, Council on Clinical Cardiology, and Office of State Advocacy
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death for adults >= 40 years of age. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that sudden cardiac arrest is responsible for about 250 000 out-of-hospital deaths annually in the United States. Since the early 1990s, the AHA has called for innovative approaches to reduce time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation and improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest. In the mid-1990s, the AHA launched a public health initiative to promote early CPR and early use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by trained lay responders in community (lay rescuer) AED programs. Between 1995 and 2000, all 50 states passed laws and regulations concerning lay rescuer AED programs. In addition, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act (CASA, Public Law 106-505) was passed and signed into federal law in 2000. The variations in state and federal legislation and regulations have complicated efforts to promote lay rescuer AED programs and in some cases have created impediments to such programs. Since 2000, most states have reexamined lay rescuer AED statutes, and many have passed legislation to remove impediments and encourage the development of lay rescuer AED programs. The purpose of this statement is to help policymakers develop new legislation or revise existing legislation to remove barriers to effective community lay rescuer AED programs. Important areas that should be considered in state legislation and regulations are highlighted, and sample legislation sections are included. Potential sources of controversy and the rationale for proposed legislative components are noted. This statement will not address legislation to support home AED programs. Such recommendations may be made after the conclusion of a large study of home AED use.

TI  - Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB  - Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) increase the risk for affective disorders in human survivors. Postischemic anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors have been documented in animal models of CA/CPR; however, the stability of post-CA/CPR anxiety-like behavior over time and the underlying physiologic mechanisms remain unknown. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system may mediate the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression; therefore, this study measured CA/CPR-induced changes in CRF receptor binding and HPA axis negative feedback. Mice were exposed to CA/CPR or SHAM surgery and assessed 7 or 21 days later. Consistent with earlier demonstrations of anxiety-like behavior 7 days after CA/CPR, increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field was also present 21 days after CA/CPR. On postoperative day 7, CA/CPR was associated with an increase in basal serum corticosterone concentration relative to SHAM, but this difference resolved by postoperative day 21. The Dexamethasone Suppression Test showed that the CA/CPR group had enhanced negative feedback compared with SHAM controls at postoperative day 21. Furthermore, there was a gradual increase in CRF1 receptor binding in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, as well as a transient decrease of both CRF1 and CRF2A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. Therefore, sustained changes in activity of the HPA axis and the CRF system after CA/CPR may contribute to the postischemic increase in affective disorders.

TI  - Post-Asphyxial Aftercare and Management of Neonates in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Evidence Synthesis
T2  - NEONATOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Effective post-resuscitation care is crucial for improving outcomes in neonates post-asphyxia. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of post- asphyxial aftercare strategies and forms part of a supplement describing an extensive synthesis of effective newborn interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Evidence was generated by performing de novo reviews, updates to reviews via systematic searches, and reanalyses of studies conducted in LMICs from existing reviews. Results: Sixty-one trials recruiting 5,046 term infants post-asphyxia were included across all intervention domains. Limited studies were available from LMICs related to fl uid restriction, antiseizure medications, and early interventions to improve developmental outcomes. Our reanalysis of whole- body cooling trials in LMICs found effects on neonatal mortality and mortality or neurological disability in infancy differed significantly based on the care center and type of cooling device used. Pharmacological therapies for neuroprotection evaluated in 27 trials in middle-income countries had varied effects in neonates with encephalopathy. Majority of the trials (60%) focused on magnesium sulfate therapy and showed significant improvements in short-term mortality and morbidities. Conclusion: The sample sizes of included trials were relatively small, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Evidence on long-term survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes was limited. Further research on promising neuroprotective therapies and factors affecting their implementation in low-resource contexts is required. To reduce the high burden related to asphyxia in LMICs, this review underscores the need for a paradigm shift toward prevention, and strategies that emphasize improving antenatal and obstetric care.

TI  - Rapid Response Teams and Team Composition: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
T2  - NURSING ECONOMICS
AB  - Cardiac arrest results in numerous deaths and serious morbidities in hospital settings every year.
   Rapid response teams (RRT), consisting of interdisciplinary team members, can be called prior to a patient's need for resuscitation during cardiac arrest.
   Determining the effectiveness of these teams has been a concern to researchers as well as to the hospitals implementing these teams..
   In this study, total personnel costs associated with different RRTs were analyzed, and RRT effectiveness was compared to existing code blue or cardiac arrest teams.
   RRTs that shared personnel with the traditional cardiac arrest team, yet also added new personnel, provided better care at a reduced cost when looking at quality-adjusted life years 6 months after cardiac arrest.

TI  - A Comparison of In-flight and Ground-Based Emergency Medical Events on the Clinical Demand for Outreach Medical Services at Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Limited information is available covering all medical events managed by the airport-based outreach medical service. This study explores the clinical demand for emergency medical outreach services at Taoyuan International Airport (TIA), Taiwan. Methods: Electronic medical records collected from TIA medical outreach services from 2017 to 2018, included passengers' profiles, flight information, events location, chief complaints, diagnosis (using ICD-9 -CM codes), and management outcomes. Medical events distribution was stratified by location and ages, and were compared statistically. Results: Among 1,501 eligible records, there were 81.8% ground-based emergency medical events (GBME), 16.9% in-flight medical events (IFME) managed after scheduled landing, and 1.3% IFME leading to unscheduled diversion or re-entry to TIA. The top three GBME diagnoses were associated with neurological (23.3%), gastrointestinal (21.2%), and trauma-related (19.3%) conditions. The top three IFME diagnosis that prompted unscheduled landings via flight diversion or re-entry were neurological (47.4%), psychological (15.8%), and cardiovascular (10.5%). The chief complaints that prompted unscheduled landings were mostly related to neurological (42.1%), cardiovascular (26.3%), and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) (10.5%) symptoms. A higher frequency of IFME events due to dermatologic causes in patients aged <= 18 years compared with adults and older adults (19 vs. 1.5% and 0, respectively); and a higher frequency of IFME due to cardiovascular causes in adults >= 65 years compared with patients aged <= 65 (15.1 vs. 9%). Among all IFME patients, six out-of-hospital deaths occurred among passengers from scheduled landings and two deaths occurred among 18 IFME passengers who were transferred to local hospitals from flight diversion or re-entry. A statistically significant difference in outcomes and short-term follow-up status was found between patients with IFME and those with GBME (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Ground-based emergency medical events exceeded in-flight medical events at TIA. The most frequent events were related to neurological, gastrointestinal symptoms, or trauma. Results of this study may provide useful information for training medical outreach staff and preparing medical supplies to meet the clinical demand for airport medical outreach services.

TI  - The role of adrenaline in comprehensive management of electrical storms in high-risk Brugada syndrome with rare SCN5A mutation: a case report from medical stabilization to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) have a risk of sudden cardiac death, often linked to mutations in the SCN5A gene. Electrical storms (ESs) in this population are life-threatening and typically require urgent administration of isoproterenol; however, in resource-limited settings, alternative pharmacologic strategies may be required. The management of ES in BrS is complex and often relies on case reports due to the rarity of the condition.Case summary A 50-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with sudden cardiac arrest during a social event. Following successful resuscitation and multiple defibrillations for ventricular fibrillation, the patient was transferred to our centre with an ECG showing a spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern. Despite therapy with multiple antiarrhythmic agents including amiodarone and lidocaine, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation. In the absence of isoproterenol, low-dose adrenaline infusion was initiated, resulting in prompt termination of ES. A single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was subsequently implanted in combination with quinidine and cilostazol for long-term suppression of arrhythmic events and prevention of recurrent ES. Genetic testing revealed two SCN5A mutations [c.4744C>T (p.Arg1582Cys) and c.3067C>T (p.Arg1023Cys)]; the first has not been previously reported in BrS.Discussion This case underscores the potential utility of adrenaline as an accessible and effective alternative in the acute management of ES in BrS patients, if isoproterenol is unavailable. It also highlights the importance of genetic evaluation in BrS for tailored therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Cryopreservation and Resuscitation of Natural Aquatic Prokaryotic Communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Experimental reproducibility in aquatic microbial ecology is critical to predict the dynamics of microbial communities. However, controlling the initial composition of naturally occurring microbial communities that will be used as the inoculum in experimental setups is challenging, because a proper method for the preservation of those communities is lacking. To provide a feasible method for preservation and resuscitation of natural aquatic prokaryote assemblages, we developed a cryopreservation procedure applied to natural aquatic prokaryotic communities. We studied the impact of inoculum size, processing time, and storage time on the success of resuscitation. We further assessed the effect of different growth media supplemented with dissolved organic matter (DOM) prepared from naturally occurring microorganisms on the recovery of the initially cryopreserved communities obtained from two sites that have contrasting trophic status and environmental heterogeneity. Our results demonstrated that the variability of the resuscitation process among replicates decreased with increasing inoculum size. The degree of similarity between initial and resuscitated communities was influenced by both the growth medium and origin of the community. We further demonstrated that depending on the inoculum source, 45-72% of the abundant species in the initially natural microbial communities could be detected as viable cells after cryopreservation. Processing time and long-term storage up to 12 months did not significantly influence the community composition after resuscitation. However, based on our results, we recommend keeping handling time to a minimum and ensure identical incubation conditions for repeated resuscitations from cryo-preserved aliquots at different time points. Given our results, we recommend cryopreservation as a promising tool to advance experimental research in the field of microbial ecology.

TI  - Public access defibrillation: a shocking idea?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE
AB  - Currently, survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom is poor. Ambulance response standards require that an ambulance reach 75 per cent of cardiac arrests within 8 min. But a short time to defibrillation from the onset of collapse is a key predictor of outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Department of Health has recently implemented a lay responder defibrillation programme, with the aim of shortening this time interval for victims in public places. This initiative utilizes automated external defibrillators (AEDs). which provide written and recorded voice prompts to minimize training requirements and errors in use. Lay responder AED programmes with very short response times have reported survival to discharge rates of up to 53 per cent for patients presenting in ventricular fibrillation (VF). This compares well with the results of a meta-analysis that reported a survival rate of only 6.4 per cent for traditional defibrillator-equipped ambulance systems. The annual incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in England is 123 per 100 000 population. Approximately half of these present in VF, and could benefit from an AED programme. But only 16 per cent of cardiac arrests occur in a public place. It has been calculated that there are approximately 5000 instances of VF in public places each year in England. If half of these patients can be reached and administered a first shock within 4 min of their collapse, an additional 400 victims may survive each year. Given the current investment by the DoH of pound2 million, this suggests a cost per life saved of approximately pound 505 over a 10 year period.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators: risks accompany the life-saving benefits
T2  - HEART
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest is the one of the most common causes of death in developed countries and accounts for between 180 000 and over 450 000 per year in the USA. Antiarrhythmic drug approaches to prevention of sudden cardiac death have been resoundingly ineffective. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) constitutes one of the most important and well validated therapeutic advances in modern cardiovascular medicine. Consequently, ICD use has increased exponentially, although implementation has been quite variable geographically and with respect to other measures. In view of the expanded use of ICDs, the potential shortcomings and risks of ICD therapy have attracted attention. This commentary summarises the weaknesses, disadvantages and risks of the ICD in a balanced fashion in light of their proven life-saving benefits.

TI  - Bystander interventions and survival after exercise-related sudden cardiac arrest: a systematic review
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Objective To evaluate the provision of bystander interventions and rates of survival after exercise-related sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Design Systematic review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and grey literature sources were searched from inception to November/December 2020. Study eligibility criteria Observational studies assessing a population of exercise-related SCA (out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred during exercise or within 1 hour of cessation of activity), where bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or automated external defibrillator (AED) use were reported, and survival outcomes were ascertained. Methods Among all included studies, the median (IQR) proportions of bystander CPR and bystander AED use, as well as median (IQR) rate of survival to hospital discharge, were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies were included in this review, with a median study duration of 78.7 months and a median sample size of 91. Most exercise-related SCA patients were male (median: 92%, IQR: 86%-96%), middle-aged (median: 51, IQR: 39-56 years), and presented with a shockable arrest rhythm (median: 78%, IQR: 62%-86%). Bystander CPR was initiated in a median of 71% (IQR: 59%-87%) of arrests, whereas bystander AED use occurred in a median of 31% (IQR: 19%-42%) of arrests. Among the 19 studies that reported survival to hospital discharge, the median rate of survival was 32% (IQR: 24%-49%). Studies which evaluated the relationship between bystander interventions and survival outcomes reported that both bystander CPR and AED use were associated with survival after exercise-related SCA. Conclusion Exercise-related SCA occurs predominantly in males and presents with a shockable ventricular arrhythmia in most cases, emphasising the importance of rapid access to defibrillation. Further efforts are needed to promote early recognition and a rapid bystander response to exercise-related SCA.

TI  - In-hospital Complications Are More Likely to Occur After Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty Than After Locked Plating for Proximal Humeral Fractures
T2  - CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB  - Background Currently, there seems to be a paradigm change in the surgical treatment of proximal humeral fractures in patients aged 65 years and older, with a considerable increase in the use of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) compared with angular stable internal fixation (locking plate fixation). However, even among shoulder specialists there is controversy regarding the best treatment strategy. Questions/purposes To evaluate for (1) a greater risk of in-hospital major adverse events, (2) a greater risk for in-hospital surgical complications, and (3) a greater risk of 30-day mortality, locking plate fixation and RTSA were compared for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures of patients aged 65 years and older after controlling for potentially confounding variables in a large-database analysis. Methods Health claims data of the largest German insurance company including approximately one-third of the population (26.5 million policyholders) between 2010 and 2018 were analyzed. This database was chosen because of its size, nationwide distribution, and high quality/completeness. In total, 55,070 patients (>= 65 years of age) treated with locking plate fixation (75% [41,216]) or RTSA (25% [13,854]) for proximal humeral fracture were compared. As primary endpoints, major adverse events (including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, organ failure, resuscitation, and death) and surgical complications (infection, hematoma, loss of reduction, dislocation, and revision surgery) were analyzed. The risk of all endpoints was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression models in the context of comorbidities to address existing group differences. Results After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as age, sex, and risk profile, RTSA was associated with a higher risk for major adverse events (OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.29 to 1.53]; p < 0.001) and surgical complications (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.21]; p < 0.01) compared with locking plate fixation. There was no evidence for an increase in mortality (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.86 to 1.12]; p = 0.81). Conclusion The increased in-hospital risk for major adverse events and surgical complications may moderate the enthusiasm associated with RTSA for proximal humeral fractures in patients 65 years and older. Treatment decisions should be based on individual risk estimation to avoid potential harmful events. Future studies must include long-term outcomes and quality of life to enlighten these findings in a broader context.

TI  - The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute coronary syndrome hospitalizations and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Greece
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: After coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, striking decreases in the number of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and rises in rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have been noted.
   Study design: This is an analysis of prospectively collected data from a cardiology department in a single, large volume hospital of the National Health System of the Metropolitan area of Athens.
   Methods: We investigated the numbers of OHCA and hospital admissions for ACS during a 1-year period and made comparisons between the pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 outbreak periods.
   Results: One hundred and eighty five patients were admitted during the total period of observation with the diagnosis of ACS. The mean monthly number of admissions for ACS for the pre-COVID-19 era was significantly higher than that for the post-COVID-19 era (20.1 +/- 7.8 vs 8.8 +/- 6.5 admissions, P = 0.024). The cases of OHCA which were transferred to our emergency room department by emergency medical services during the same period were nominally lower in the prepandemic compared with the post-pandemic era (1.9 +/- 1.7 vs 4.0 +/- 4.6, P = 0.28).
   Conclusions: The present study provides hints on the potential unintended consequences of the pandemic in countries characterized by fewer COVID-19 cases and fatalities but prompt measures of social contact restrictions and lockdown.

TI  - A Review of Shockable Arrhythmia Detection of ECG Signals Using Machine and Deep Learning Techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB  - An electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential medical tool for analyzing the functioning of the heart. An arrhythmia is a deviation in the shape of the ECG signal from the normal sinus rhythm. Long-term arrhythmias are the primary sources of cardiac disorders. Shockable arrhythmias, a type of life-threatening arrhythmia in cardiac patients, are characterized by disorganized or chaotic electrical activity in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), disrupting blood flow throughout the body. This condition may lead to sudden cardiac arrest in most patients. Therefore, detecting and classifying shockable arrhythmias is crucial for prompt defibrillation. In this work, various machine and deep learning algorithms from the literature are analyzed and summarized, which is helpful in automatic classification of shockable arrhythmias. Additionally, the advantages of these methods are compared with existing traditional unsupervised methods. The importance of digital signal processing techniques based on feature extraction, feature selection, and optimization is also discussed at various stages. Finally, available databases, the performance of automated algorithms, limitations, and the scope for future research are analyzed. This review encourages researchers' interest in this challenging topic and provides a broad overview of its latest developments.

TI  - Impact of survival probability, life expectancy, quality of life and patient preferences on do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders in a hospital
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Consensus exists that a do-not-attempt-resuscitation order (DNAR) is appropriate if a resuscitation attempt is futile. Less agreement exists when this point is reached. We investigated the influence of three major considerations for in-hospital DNAR orders: expected survival probability after resuscitation, prospects of the patients? current condition without a cardiac arrest and the patients' autonomous decision not to want resuscitation. We calculated an expected survival probability according to two multi-morbidity prediction scores for each patient, assuming the event of cardiac arrest. The prospects of the current condition without a cardiac arrest was estimated by the patients' physician, in terms of life expectancy and quality of life (level of dependency after discharge and pain). The patients' preference was documented from the medical records. A total of 470 patients were included in the study. Fifty-eight patients (12%) had a DNAR-order, 11 of these patients (19%) wanted no resuscitation. The patients' prospects (life expectancy, dependency after discharge), and age proved to be independently associated with the presence of a DNAR order. The odds ratio (OR) for the presence of a DNAR order was 37 (CL 14-107) for an estimated life expectancy less than 3 months, 13 (CL 4-41) for a life in a nursing home and four (CL 2-12) for an age of 80 years and older. Expected survival probability after resuscitation and pain were not independently associated with a DNAR order. We conclude that resuscitation is considered futile on the basis of the patients' age and prospects without cardiac arrest and that the impact of expected survival probability on these decisions is small.

TI  - Ex vivo lung perfusion in donation after circulatory death: A post hoc analysis of the Normothermic Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion as an Assessment of Extended/Marginal Donors Lungs trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors offer the ability to expand the lung donor pool and ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) further contributes to this ability by allowing for additional evaluation and resuscitation of these extended criteria donors. We sought to determine the outcomes of recipients receiving organs from DCD EVLP donors in a multicenter setting. Methods: This was an unplanned post hoc analysis of a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized trial that took place during 2011 to 2017 with 3 years of followup. Patients were placed into 3 groups based off procurement strategy: brain- dead donor (control), brain-dead donor evaluated by EVLP, and DCD donors evaluated by EVLP. The primary outcomes were severe primary graft dysfunction at 72 hours and survival. Secondary outcomes included select perioperative outcomes, and 1-year and 3-years allograft function and quality of life measures. Results: The DCD EVLP group had significantly fi cantly higher incidence of severe primary graft dysfunction at 72 hours (P P = .03), longer days on mechanical ventilation (P P < .001) and in-hospital length of stay (P P = .045). Survival at 3 years was 76.5% % (95% % CI, 69.2%-84.7%) %-84.7 % ) for the control group, 68.3% % (95% % CI, 58.9%- %- 79.1%) % ) for the brain-dead donor group, and 60.7% % (95% % CI, 45.1%-81.8%) %-81.8 % ) for the DCD group (P P = .36). At 3-year follow-up, presence observed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or quality of life metrics did not differ among the groups. Conclusions: Although DCD EVLP allografts might not be appropriate to transplant in every candidate recipient, the expansion of their use might afford recipients stagnant on the waitlist a viable therapy.

TI  - Outcomes of Pediatric Patients With Defibrillators Following Initial Presentation With Sudden Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background:
   Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are recommended for secondary prevention after sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The outcomes of pediatric patients receiving an ICD after SCA remain unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate outcomes, future risk for appropriate shocks, and identify characteristics associated with appropriate ICD therapy during follow-up.
   Methods:
   Multicenter retrospective analysis of patients (age <= 21 years) without prior cardiac disease who received an ICD following SCA. Patient/device characteristics, cardiac function, and underlying diagnoses were collected, along with SCA event characteristics. Patient outcomes including complications and device therapies were analyzed.
   Results:
   In total, 106 patients were included, median age 14.7 years. Twenty (19%) received appropriate shocks and 16 (15%) received inappropriate shocks (median follow-up 3 years). First-degree relative with SCA was associated with appropriate shocks (P<0.05). In total, 40% patients were considered idiopathic. Channelopathy was the most frequent late diagnosis not made at time of presentation. Neither underlying diagnosis nor idiopathic status was associated with increased incidence of appropriate shock. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (hazard ratio, 4.6 [1.2-17.3]) and family history of sudden death (hazard ratio, 6.5 [1.4-29.8]) were associated with freedom from appropriate shock in a multivariable model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.8). Time from diagnoses to evaluation demonstrated a nonlinear association with freedom from appropriate shock (P=0.015). In patients >2 years from implantation, younger age (P=0.02) and positive exercise test (P=0.04) were associated with appropriate shock.
   Conclusions:
   The risk of future device therapy is high in pediatric patients receiving an ICD after SCA, irrelevant of underlying disease. Lack of a definitive diagnosis after SCA was not associated with lower risk of subsequent events and does not obviate the need for secondary prophylaxis.

TI  - Delayed therapy of experimental global cerebral ischemia with acetyl-L-carnitine in dogs
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB  - Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), when administered immediately following restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from experimental cardiac arrest (CA) has previously been demonstrated to promote normalization of brain energy metabolism and neurologic recovery following 10 min CA. In order to determine ultimate efficacy for this or other drugs, clinical trials must be performed in human subjects. In several human clinical trials, though, drug administration has been significantly delayed following resuscitation from CA. These experiments test the hypothesis that post-resuscitative delay in ALCAR administration will impair the ability of this drug to promote neurologic recovery. Neurological deficit scoring (23 h) as well as frontal cortex lactate levels (2 and 24 h) were. compared following resuscitation from 10 min CA in dogs receiving either ALCAR or drug vehicle 30 min following ROSC. Dogs treated with ALCAR 30 min following ROSC from 10 min CA exhibited more normal cerebral cortex lactate levels than did vehicle control animals. There was no difference, however, in neurologic deficit scores between groups, with all animals demonstrating moderate to severe clinical neurologic impairment at 23 h following ROSC. A 30-min delay in ALCAR administration following ROSC from 10 min CA impairs the ability of this drug to promote neurologic recovery despite apparent normalization of brain lactate levels.

TI  - Prehospital Trauma Compendium: Prehospital Management of Adults with Traumatic Out-of-Hospital Circulatory Arrest - A Joint Position Statement and Resource Document of NAEMSP, ACS-COT, and ACEP
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - The National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians (NAEMSP), American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT), and American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) believe that evidence-based, pragmatic, and collaborative protocols addressing the care of patients with traumatic out-of-hospital circulatory arrest (TOHCA) are needed to optimize patient outcomes and clinician safety. When the etiology of arrest is unclear, particularly without clear signs of life-threatening trauma, standard basic and advanced cardiac life support (BCLS/ACLS) treatments for medical cardiac arrest is appropriate. Traumatic circulatory arrest may result from massive hemorrhage, airway obstruction, obstructive shock, respiratory disturbances, cardiogenic causes or massive head trauma. While resuscitation and/or transport is appropriate for some populations, it is appropriate to withhold or discontinue resuscitation attempts for TOHCA patients for whom these efforts are non-beneficial. This position statement and resource document were written as an update to the 2013 joint position statements.NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT recommend:EMS resuscitation of adults with TOHCA should:Prioritize prompt identification of patients who may benefit from transport to definitive care at trauma centers when safe and appropriate.Emphasize the identification of reversible causes of traumatic circulatory arrest and timely use of clinically indicated life-saving interventions (LSIs) within the EMS clinician's scope of practice. These include:External hemorrhage control with direct pressure, wound packing, and tourniquetsAirway management using the least-invasive approach necessary to achieve and maintain airway patency, oxygenation, and adequate ventilation.Chest decompression if there is clinical concern for a tension pneumothorax. Empiric bilateral decompression, however, is not indicated in the absence of suspected chest trauma.External chest compressions may be considered but only secondary to other LSIs.Epinephrine should not be routinely used, and if used should not be administered before other LSIs.If point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) demonstrates no evidence of cardiac motion, this may have utility in TOHCA management for prognostication.Emphasize that placement of cardiac monitors and/or use of POCUS should occur after indicated LSIs have been appropriately performedConditions where resuscitation attempts should be withheld, include TOHCA patients with:Injuries that are incompatible with life (e.g., decapitation, hemi-corpectomy, incineration, open skull injury with extruding brain matter).Evidence of prolonged circulatory arrest (e.g., rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decomposition).Advance care planning documents that indicate Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/ Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR)/Allow Natural Death medical orders.Conditions where resuscitation attempts are discontinued for TOHCA patients should recognize:Mechanism of injury should not be used as the sole determinant to discontinue resuscitation efforts.Electrical rhythm should not be used as the sole determinant to discontinue resuscitation efforts. Of note, non-shockable rhythms (Pulseless Electrical Activity/Asystole) are associated with an extremely low likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or survival with neurologic recovery.There is insufficient evidence to support any specific universal standardized time-based cutoffs to discontinue resuscitation efforts based on the duration of resuscitation or transport times to definitive care.
   EMS decisions to transport or discontinue resuscitation should be locally determined based on EMS and trauma system resources and proximity.Implementation of protocols for TOHCA should consider:Risks and benefits of resuscitation attempts and transport for public safety and EMS clinician safety.Individual patient cost and organ donation should not be a factor in EMS clinical decision-making on-scene.Local provisions for specific clinical resources (e.g. regional trauma capabilities), environmental (e.g. avalanche, etc.), or population-based situations are important and require active EMS physician oversight in collaboration with local trauma system stakeholders.

TI  - Physician understanding of patient resuscitation preferences: Insights and clinical implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe physician understanding of patient preferences concerning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and to assess the relationship of physician understanding of patient preferences with do not resuscitate (DNR) orders and in-hospital CPR.
   DESIGN: We evaluated physician understanding of patient CPR preference and the association of patient characteristics and physician-patient communication with physician understanding of patient CPR preferences. Among patients preferring to forgo CPR, we compared attempted resuscitations and time to receive a DNR order between patients whose preference was understood or misunderstood by their physician.
   PATIENTS/SETTING: Seriously ill hospitalized adult patients were enrolled in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for the Outcomes of Treatments.
   GENERAL RESULTS: Physicians understood 86% of patient preferences for CPR, but only 46% of patient preferences to forgo CPR. Younger patient age, higher physician-estimated quality of life, and higher physician prediction of 6-month survival were independently associated with both physician understanding when a patient preferred to receive CPR and physician misunderstanding when a patient preferred to forgo CPR. Physicians who spoke with patients about resuscitation and had longer physician-patient relationships understood patients' preferences to forgo CPR more often. Patients whose physicians understood their preference to forgo CPR more often received DNR orders, received them earlier, and were significantly less likely to undergo resuscitation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often misunderstand seriously ill, hospitalized patients' resuscitation preferences, especially preferences to forgo CPR. Factors associated with misunderstanding suggest that physicians infer patients' preferences without asking the patient. Patients who prefer to forgo CPR but whose wishes are not understood by their physician may receive unwanted treatment.

TI  - Hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis
T2  - PANCREATOLOGY
AB  - Hypertriglyceridemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis. It typically occurs in patients with an underlying disorder of lipoprotein metabolism and in the presence of a secondary condition such as uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol abuse, or medication use.
   The presentation of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is similar to that of acute pancreatitis due to other causes; however, patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis are more likely to have severe disease courses and have a higher likelihood of persistent organ failure. The initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is also similar to acute pancreatitis from other causes and consists of aggressive fluid resuscitation, pain control, and nutritional support. Hypertriglyceridemia is specifically treated with apheresis or insulin therapy when necessary.
   The prompt recognition of hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of acute pancreatitis is essential in both the initial and long-term management of this disease and are essential to prevent recurrent acute pancreatitis. The review seeks to highlight the etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical course of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis. (c) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A prospective study of the efficacy of the physician order form for life-sustaining treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), a comprehensive, one-page order form, was developed to convey preferences for life-sustaining treatments during transfer from one care site to another. This study examined the extent to which the POLST form ensured that nursing home residents' wishes were honored for Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) and requests for transfer only if comfort measures fail.
   DESIGN: The study used chart record data to follow prospectively a sample of nursing home residents with the POLST.
   SETTING: Eight geographically diverse, long-term, adult-care facilities in Oregon in which the POLST was in use.
   PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents (n = 180), who had a POLST recording DNR designation and who indicated a desire for transfer only if comfort measures failed, were followed for 1 year.
   MEASUREMENTS: For all subjects: treatment and disposition after significant health status changes; orders for narcotics and for provision or limitation of aggressive interventions. For hospitalized subjects: diagnosis, medical interventions, and DNR orders. For those who died: cause and location of death, life-sustaining treatments attempted, and comfort measures provided.
   RESULTS: No study subject received CPR, ICU care, or ventilator support, and only 2% were hospitalized to extend life. Of the 38 subjects who died during the study year, 63% had an order for narcotics, and only two (5%) died in an acute care hospital. A total of 24 subjects (13%) were hospitalized during the year. Hospitalized subjects' mean length of stay was 4.9 days, and the mean rate of hospitalizations for all subjects was 174 per 1000 resident years. In 85% of all hospitalizations, patients were transferred because the nursing home could not control suffering. In 15% of hospitalizations (n = 4), the transfer was to extend life, overriding POLST orders.
   CONCLUSIONS: POLST orders regarding CPR in nursing home residents in this study were universally respected. Study subjects received remarkably high levels of comfort care and low rates of transfer for aggressive life-extending treatments.

TI  - Artificial intelligence based resuscitation simulation: a pilot study of a novel approach to team leadership training
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Introduction Team leadership training is essential alongside with technical training for effective resuscitation management. Addressing this gap, we developed a novel simulation system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create Artificial Intelligence (Al) agents simulating team members in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) scenarios. This pilot study aimed to to develop a novel LLM-based ACLS simulation training platform and evaluate its performance in simulated resuscitation scenarios on established protocols.<br /> Method Using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet API, we designed a simulation system with four Al agents assigned specific roles as healthcare staff within an ACLS team. Each agent strictly followed the 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) ACLS guidelines while interacting with an ACLS certified emergency medicine specialist user. The ten patient scenario transcripts were evaluated with three blinded emergency medicine specialists whether all the recommended steps are completed. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Kendall's W and Krippendorff's Alpha statistics to evaluate agreement both within raters and the model.<br /> Results Al agents consistently adhered to the AHA 2020 ACIS algorithm across scenarios, with a high inter-rater reliability (Kendall's W > 0.75 ) . Krippendorff's Alpha values for agreement ranged from substantial (0.84) to almost perfect (0.99), indicating robust compliance with guidelines and effective simulation of resuscitation responses.<br /> Conclusion This study highlights the potential of LL.M-powered simulations as an adjunct to traditional resuscitation training. The system effectively supported team leadership training by providing consistent and guideline-compliant responses. While the results are promising, further research with larger participant samples is necessary to evaluate the long-term educational impact and scalability of such systems.

TI  - Circumstances of out of hospital cardiac arrest in patients with ischaemic heart disease
T2  - HEART
AB  - Objectives: To discover the circumstances of out of hospital cardiac death irrespective of resuscitation attempts.
   Design: Prospective community study over the two years 1994 and 1995.
   Setting: The health districts of Brighton, South Glamorgan, and York, UK.
   Subjects: 1290 victims of sudden death or cardiac arrest caused by coronary heart disease who were under 76 years of age.
   Interventions: Basic and advanced life support for witnessed cardiac arrests.
   Main outcome measures: Survival to reach hospital and for 30 days after the arrest.
   Results: 35 (35%) of 101 patients ( mean age 64) whose arrest was witnessed by a doctor or paramedic survived for 30 days compared with 9 of 464 (2%) whose arrest was witnessed by a relative or bystander at home ( mean age 66) and 15 of 200 (8%) whose arrest was witnessed in a public place ( mean age 61). None of the 525 victims of an unwitnessed arrest survived but the majority of those whose arrest was witnessed had complained of new symptoms before the arrest. Victims who were given basic life support by relatives or bystanders had better survival ( 14 of 183 ( 8%)) than those who were not ( 10 of 481 ( 2%), p< 0.001). Of the 20% of arrests that occurred in public places, few were in places where public access defibrillators would now be available.
   Conclusions: The burden of out of hospital cardiac arrest is mainly in the home but most victims have premonitory symptoms. Public education to seek help urgently for new or prolonged chest pain seems the most promising method to address the problem.

TI  - Correction of Murine SCID-X1 by Lentiviral Gene Therapy Using a Codon-optimized IL2RG Gene and Minimal Pretransplant Conditioning
T2  - MOLECULAR THERAPY
AB  - Clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy to treat X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) using retroviral vectors, leading to immune system functionality in the majority of treated patients without pretransplant conditioning. The success was tempered by insertional oncogenesis in a proportion of the patients. To reduce the genotoxicity risk, a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector (LV) with improved expression of a codon optimized human interleukin-2 receptor gamma gene (IL2RG) cDNA (co gamma c), regulated by its 1.1 kb promoter region (gamma cPr), was compared in efficacy to the viral spleen focus forming virus (SF) and the cellular phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoters. Pretransplant conditioning of IL2rg(-/-) mice resulted in long-term reconstitution of T and B lymphocytes, normalized natural antibody titers, humoral immune responses, ConA/IL-2 stimulated spleen cell proliferation, and polyclonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements with a clear integration preference of the SF vector for proto-oncogenes, contrary to the PGK and gamma cPr vectors. We conclude that SIN lentiviral gene therapy using co gamma c driven by the gamma cPr or PGK promoter corrects the SCID phenotype, potentially with an improved safety profile, and that low-dose conditioning proved essential for immune competence, allowing for a reduced threshold of cell numbers required.

TI  - Inconsistencies in cardiac arrest reporting
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Data relating to survival from in-hospital cardiac arrest are used to audit staff performance and to help to determine whether new resuscitation techniques are effective. Individual studies into outcome from cardiac arrest have defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, but no such national criteria have been published to enable constant auditing of cardiac arrests.
   The aim of this survey was to investigate the consistency with which in-hospital cardiac arrests are recorded throughout the United Kingdom. Such data are, almost universally, collected by Resuscitation Officers (RO). A questionnaire was sent to ROs across the UK asking them to state how they would interpret and categorise hypothetical, but nonetheless typical, clinical situations involving a cardiac arrest team being called. These included an event where the patient had regained consciousness prior to the arrival of the cardiac team and also an event where rigor mortis was already present and the resuscitation promptly abandoned upon the arrival of the cardiac arrest team. The percentage survival to discharge of adult cardiac arrests for each hospital was also requested. This identified whether inclusion or exclusion of certain clinical events may have influenced cardiac arrest survival. figures for that hospital.
   It is clear from this study that in-hospital clinical events when a cardiac arrest team is called are audited with a great deal of inconsistency. Some events, such as a patient who has rigor mortis, are excluded as a false or inappropriate call in some hospitals and included as an unsuccessful resuscitation in others.
   There is a need for guidance on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for auditing of cardiac arrests so that meaningful data can be obtained from across the UK and useful conclusions drawn. The situation at present will result in data being audited that are of limited use. In the era of evidence-based medicine, it seems vital to obtain accurate cardiac arrest survival figures in order to have any hope of improving them. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - A practical approach to the use of targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest
T2  - MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB  - Among comatose survivors after cardiac arrest, target temperature management (TTM) is considered the most effective treatment to reduce the consequences of postanoxic brain injury. Several international guidelines have thus incorporated TTM in the management of the postresuscitation phase. However, despite extremely promising results in animal models and in randomized trials including selected patient cohorts, TTM benefits on neurological outcome have been questioned. Moreover, TTM potential side effects have raised some concerns on its wide application in all cardiac arrest patients in different healthcare systems. There is indeed still relatively large uncertainty concerning some practical aspects related to TTM application, such as: A) how to select patients who will benefit the most from TTM; B) the optimal time to initiate TTM; C) the best target temperature; D) the most effective methods to provide TTM; E) the length of the cooling phase; and F) the optimal rewarming rate and fever control strategies. The purpose of this manuscript is to review and discuss the most recent advances in TTM use after cardiac arrest and to give some proposals on how to deal with all these relevant practical questions.

TI  - Cardiac arrest and repeated ST-segment elevation caused by initially unrecognized coronary vasospasm
T2  - SRPSKI ARHIV ZA CELOKUPNO LEKARSTVO
AB  - Introduction Coronary artery spasm (CAS) is defined as a transient vasoconstriction of an epicardial coronary artery with a total or subtotal vessel occlusion, causing myocardial ischemia. Although the overall incidence of CAS during coronary angiography is estimated to be between 0.3% and 1%, CAS remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated cause of acute cardiac events. Case outline We report a case of a 62-year-old male presenting with cardiac arrest and repeated ST segment elevations during chest pain episodes, caused by initially unrecognized CAS. Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is generally not recommended for the treatment of CAS, due to clinical manifestations and the presence of underlying flow-limiting stenosis, we decided to perform PCI of the left anterior descending coronary artery. During the two-year-follow up period, the patient reported no chest pains nor exercise limitations at regular outpatient controls.Conclusion CASs should be considered an unrecognized cause of refractory angina, acute coronary syndrome, malignant arrhythmia, and even cardiac arrest. Although medical therapy is the first option for CAS treatment, PCI could be a safe and effective approach in selected patients.

Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have been available for some years and as a result defibrillation can be carried out by individuals other than physicians and healthcare providers such as trained first responders and untrained lay rescuers. This so-called public access defibrillation nourished hope of progress in the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest. However, several limitations exist, such as low frequency of sudden cardiac arrest in public, rare use of publicly placed AEDs, low cost effectiveness, legal requirements and insufficient public willingness to help. Due to these restrictions of public access defibrillation other measures are more promising than the attempt at general distribution of AEDs. These measures are primary or secondary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac arrest, general knowledge of adequate activation of emergency medical services, implementation of first responder teams equipped with AEDs and particularly a better education in and application of the well-established principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - Key advances in critical care in the out-of-hospital setting: the evolving role of laypersons and technology
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - During the past decade, critical care in the out-of-hospital setting has transcended the original emphasis on on-scene advanced life support interventions by doctors, paramedics, and nurses. Many of the life-saving efforts and advances in critical care situations have now begun to focus more and more on how, through evolving technology, the average person can save lives and perhaps even spare precious intensive care unit (ICU) resources. A striking example was the recent study conducted at the Chicago airports at which automated external defibrillators (AEDs) were deployed throughout the airline terminals for use by the public at large. Not only did random bystanders on the concourses save an extremely high percentage of cardiac arrest patients with the AEDs, most patients rapidly awakened, even before the arrival of professional rescuers. Thus, this technology-assisted intervention, performed by an average person, pre-empted the need for many other critical care interventions and prolonged care in the ICU. Equipped with automated prompts to improve performance, new technology also exists to help to monitor the inadequacies and too-frequent interruption of life-saving chest compressions during basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As a result of these technological advances, survival rates for cardiac arrest are now expected to improve significantly.

TI  - Development of a clinical prediction rule to identify patients with knee pain and clinical evidence of knee osteoarthritis who demonstrate a favorable short-term response to hip mobilization
T2  - PHYSICAL THERAPY
AB  - Background and Purpose
   The primary purpose of this study was to develop a clinical prediction rule (CPR) for identifying patients with knee pain and clinical evidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) with favorable short-term response to hip mobilizations. The secondary purpose was to determine the predictive validity of individual clinical tests for identifying these same patients.
   Subjects and Methods
   Sixty subjects with knee OA, aged 51 to 79 years, completed self-report questionnaires, a clinical examination of the hip and knee, and functional tests and were treated with 4 hip mobilizations. Follow-up, testing was completed 2 days later. The reference criterion for determining a favorable response was either (1) a decrease of at least 30% on composite Numerical Pain Rating Scale score obtained during functional tests or (2) a Global Rating of Change Scale score of at least 3.
   Results
   The CPR developed in this study comprised 5 variables: (1) hip or groin pain or paresthesia, (2) anterior thigh pain, (3) passive knee flexion less than 122 degrees, (4) passive hip medial (internal) rotation less than 17 degrees, and (5) pain with hip distraction. Based on the pretest probability of success (68%), the presence of one variable had a positive likelihood ratio of 5.1 and increased the probability of a successful response to 92% at 48-hour follow-up. If 2 variables were present, the Positive likelihood ratio was 12.9 and the probability of success increased to 97%.
   Discussion and Conclusion
   The results suggest that the CPR developed in this study could improve clinicians' decision making and efficiency in examining and treating patients with knee OA.

TI  - Intranasal Administration of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosome Alleviates Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury arises from inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain, commonly occurring following cardiac arrest, which lacks effective treatments. Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of exosomes released from mesenchymal stem cells. Given the challenge of systemic dilution associated with intravenous administration, intranasal delivery has emerged as a promising approach. In this study, we investigate the effects of intranasally administered exosomes in an animal model. Exosomes were isolated from the cell supernatants using the ultracentrifugation method. Brain injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats through a transient four-vessel occlusion model. Intranasal administration was conducted with 3 x 108 exosome particles in 20 mu L of PBS or PBS alone, administered daily for 7 days post-injury. Long-term cognitive behavioral assessments, biodistribution of exosomes, and histological evaluations of apoptosis and neuroinflammation were conducted. Exosomes were primarily detected in the olfactory bulb one hour after intranasal administration, subsequently distributing to the striatum and midbrain. Rats treated with exosomes exhibited substantial improvement in cognitive function up to 28 days after the insult, and demonstrated significantly fewer apoptotic cells along with higher neuronal cell survival in the hippocampus. Exosomes were found to be taken up by microglia, leading to a decrease in the expression of cytotoxic inflammatory markers.

TI  - Administration of Donor-Derived Nonexpanded Adipose Stromal Vascular Fraction Attenuates Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Donation After Cardiac Death Rat Renal Transplantation
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Donation after cardiac death (DCD) has become a potential source for transplantation organs. However, ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) induced by cardiac arrest has limited the use of DCD organs. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) without the culturing step has been proposed as a safer and easier source for stem cell therapy, which has emerged as an attractive technology that could facilitate the recovery of renal function and structure from acute kidney injury induced by IRI after DCD renal transplantation. In this study, freshly isolated donor-derived SVF was identified and then delivered intra-arterially into the grafts in DCD rat renal transplantation. Administration of freshly isolated donor-derived SVF could significantly alleviate the IRI of renal grafts and enhance graft reparation by promoting graft cell proliferation and microvascularization in DCD renal transplantation. Moreover, results revealed that the oxidative stress in grafts was significantly alleviated with SVF treatment, and this might be attributed to the overexpression of anti-oxidative molecules including nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2, superoxide dismutase-1, and heme oxygenase-1. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the administration of freshly isolated donor-derived nonexpanded adipose SVF could attenuate IRI and protect the grafts after DCD rat renal transplantation.

TI  - The standardization debate: A conflation trap in critical care electroencephalography
T2  - SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY
AB  - Purpose: Persistent uncertainty over the clinical significance of various pathological continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) findings in the intensive care unit (ICU) has prompted efforts to standardize ICU cEEG terminology and an ensuing debate. We set out to understand the reasons for, and a satisfactory resolution to, this debate.
   Method: We review the positions for and against standardization, and examine their deeper philosophical basis.
   Results: We find that the positions for and against standardization are not fundamentally irreconcilable. Rather, both positions stem from conflating the three cardinal steps in the classic approach to EEG, which we term "description", "interpretation", and "prescription". Using real-world examples we show how this conflation yields muddled clinical reasoning and unproductive debate among electroencephalographers that is translated into confusion among treating clinicians. We propose a middle way that judiciously uses both standardized terminology and clinical reasoning to disentangle these critical steps and apply them in proper sequence.
   Conclusion: The systematic approach to ICU cEEG findings presented herein not only resolves the standardization debate but also clarifies clinical reasoning by helping electroencephalographers assign appropriate weights to cEEG findings in the face of uncertainty.

TI  - Cardiac arrest in diving: The key to success
T2  - UNDERSEA AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE
AB  - This case report describes the successful management of an out-of-hospital arrest in a diver following a suspected arterial gas embolism (AGE). It illustrates both the inherent risks of diving and the importance of prompt and effective implementation of the "chain of survival " from bystanders. Rapid on-scene responses from paramedics and helicopter emergency medical services facilitated prompt evacuation to a Category 1 (multiplace) recompression chamber (RCC) where specialists in cardiology and hyperbaric medicine were available. Alternative causes of cardiac arrest were considered, with a presumed AGE successfully treated with multiple rounds of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The key factors which led to this successful outcome are discussed, including early recognition and call for help, competent cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, and direct evacuation to a Category 1 RCC, with additional consideration of the diagnosis leading to cardiac arrest. The case clearly illustrates the need for all those involved in diving regularly to be competent and confident in performing basic life support, as well as the awareness of the emergency services of the need for diving casualties to be treated at appropriate hyperbaric facilities. Were it not for the simple, prompt and effective treatment this diver received, both on scene and in hospital, it is highly unlikely that such a positive outcome would have been achieved.

TI  - Improved Survival With Automated External Defibrillator-Only Training in a Public-Access Defibrillation Program: A 23-Year Database Analysis of Progetto Vita
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains a significant public health challenge, characterized by poor overall survival. Early defibrillation is crucial to manage fatal arrhythmias. The use of automated external defibrillators is a promising tool in minimizing time to defibrillation and enhancing survival. Methods PV (Progetto Vita) in Piacenza pioneered the first community-based automated external defibrillator project in Europe. We present survival data spanning 23 years for all cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest managed under both PV and standard emergency medical services interventions. Results A total of 6996 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were recorded. Among these, 156 cases were managed by PV volunteers (PV group). The PV group managed a significantly higher proportion of shockable rhythms than the emergency medical services group (69.9% versus 10.9%). Mean time to arrival was shorter (5.7 versus 10.2 minutes), and survival rates better with favorable neurological outcomes (46.2% versus 2.9%, overall). Survival rates declined with time. However, a higher proportion of patients in the PV -group demonstrated favorable neurological outcomes, even up to 9 minutes from the call, compared with the EMS group. Over the study period, the increasing number of automated external defibrillators in fixed public places coincided with a substantial rise in ventricular fibrillation survival in the PV group patients (22% for 2003-2012 to 73% for 2013-2022, P<0.001). Both time from call to arrival and PV-group intervention emerged as independent predictors of survival (odds ratio 1.08 and 0.28, respectively). Conclusions Our simplified automated external defibrillator-focused training for community has shown higher survival rates and emerges as a highly successful strategy in a small city.

TI  - Critical care nurses' experiences of caring challenges during post-resuscitation period: a qualitative content analysis
T2  - BMC NURSING
AB  - BackgroundPatients in the post-resuscitation period experience critical conditions and require high-quality care. Identifying the challenges that critical care nurses encounter when caring for resuscitated patients is essential for improving the quality of their care.AimThis study aimed to identify the challenges encountered by critical care nurses in providing care during the post-resuscitation period.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Sixteen nurses working in the intensive care units of three teaching hospitals were selected through purposive sampling. The Data collected were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.ResultsParticipants experienced individual, interpersonal, and organizational challenges when providing post-resuscitation care. The most significant challenges include inadequate clinical knowledge and experience, poor management and communication skills, lack of support from nurse managers, role ambiguity, risk of violence, and inappropriate attitudes of physicians towards nurses' roles. Additionally, nurses expressed a negative attitude towards resuscitated patients.ConclusionCritical care nurses face several challenges in providing care for resuscitated patients. To enhance the quality of post-resuscitation care, address the challenges effectively and improve long-time survival it is crucial to implement interventions such as In-service education, post-resuscitation briefing, promotion of interprofessional collaboration among healthcare teams, providing sufficient human resources, clarifying nurses' roles in the post-resuscitation period and increasing support from nursing managers.

TI  - Assessing the quality of chest compressions with a DIY low-cost manikin (LoCoMan) versus a standard manikin: a quasi-experimental study in primary education
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Extending the access to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training to a wider public is an important step in increasing survivability of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, often price and maintenance of CPR manikins are barriers that prevent training at schools. This study aims to evaluate the learning of hands-only (HO) CPR by practicing with a low-cost manikin (LoCoMan) with visual qualitative feedback and to compare the results with the skills acquired by practice on a conventional manikin. A quasi-experimental study with 193 schoolchildren (10 to 12 years old) who were allocated to two groups: the LoCoMan group was taught via an integrative approach (science combined with physical education (PE)) and practiced on a handmade manikin, and a control group practiced in a traditional setting with a commercial manikin (Resusci Junior, Laerdal, Norway). All participants practiced for 1 hands-on skill session before performing a post-test on an instrumented CPR manikin. The outcomes including HO-CPR performance variables were compared between groups. The LoCoMan and control groups both achieved acceptable percentage of HO-CPR quality (57% and 71%, p = 0.004). Among 6th-graders, there were no significant differences in HO-CPR quality between LoCoMan 68% and control 71%, p = 0.66. The control group achieved better chest compression depth while the LoCoMan group showed more compressions with adequate chest recoil. Conclusion: Schoolchildren are able to build and use a low-cost manikin with visual feedback. The integrative learning approach used in this study may be a feasible alternative methodology for training and learning HO-CPR in schools when commercial manikins are not available. What is Known: center dot Access to CPR training should be universal and independent of age, location, financial means, or access to qualified instructors. center dot Scientific societies promote the implementation of CPR in schools, so that teachers and schoolchildren can play a multiplier role in their environment, but the gap in CPR learning is related to cultural, economic factors or access to resources and materials. What is New: center dot LoCoMan may be a useful device for teaching and learning CPR in schoolchildren from the age of 10 and upwards. center dot LOCOMAN shows that it is feasible and possible to build a low-cost manikin (about <euro>5 in the European Region) and to integrate it into an integrative educational project, and outlines how this could be done. this approach can be an incentive for teachers to attempt teaching CPR, but also for education outside the formal environment.

TI  - Delphi Analysis of Science Gaps in the 2015 American Heart Association Cardiac Arrest Guidelines
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background-Current cardiac arrest guidelines have limited high-quality scientific evidence to support recommendations for care. The quality of scientific evidence on which guidelines are based may correlate with improved patient outcomes and meaningful survival. We sought to develop a prioritized list of knowledge gaps in resuscitation to assist researchers, policy makers, and funding agencies in their decision-making process.
   Methods and Results-A 4-stage modified Delphi method was used with a panel of cardiac arrest experts. Experts addressed the prompt: "What are the top 3 gaps in knowledge involving cardiac arrest care that should be research priorities for National Institutes of Health/American Heart Association funding to have the greatest impact on public health?" Knowledge gaps were identified in the initial round, rated in a second round, and rank ordered in the third round, and they underwent final review and consensus (final round). The outcome was 10 knowledge gaps, with prioritization of the top 3 gaps. A total of 61 gaps, with 19 distinct themes, were identified by participants. The 10 knowledge gaps most likely to affect public health identified by the expert panel included, in order, the following: telecommunicator cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hemodynamic monitoring for goal-directed resuscitation, reasons why bystanders fail to respond, optimization of postarrest care, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest identification and response, individualizing resuscitation strategies, predicting patients at risk, tools for neuroprognostication, optimal airway management, and optimizing educational strategies.
   Conclusions-Ten priorities for cardiac arrest research were identified, but consensus was not reached on the prioritized top 3. Future research should address these gaps to potentially improve resuscitation guideline evidence quality.

TI  - Serum tau and neurological outcome in cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - ObjectiveTo test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.
   MethodsWe measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 3-5 at 6 months.
   ResultsIncreased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median=38.5, interquartile range [IQR]=5.7-245ng/l in poor vs median=1.5, IQR=0.7-2.4ng/l in good outcome, for tau at 72 hours, p<0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (p<0.0001). Tau cutoffs had low false-positive rates (FPRs) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 hours had FPR=2% (95% CI=1-4%) with sensitivity=66% (95% CI=61-70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau vs 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, p=0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy in predicting outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.
   InterpretationSerum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

TI  - Serial Plasma Choline Measurements after Cardiac Arrest in Patients Undergoing Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia: A Prospective Observational Pilot Trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objective: Choline is related to phospholipid metabolism and is a marker for global ischaemia with a small reference range in healthy volunteers. The aim of our study was to characterize the early kinetics of plasma free choline in patients after cardiac arrest. Additionally, we investigated the potential of plasma free choline to predict neurological outcome.
   Methods: Twenty patients admitted to our medical intensive care unit were included in this prospective, observational trial. All patients were enrolled between May 2010 and May 2011. They received post cardiac arrest treatment including mild therapeutic hypothermia which was initiated with a combination of cold fluid and a feedback surface cooling device according to current guidelines. Sixteen blood samples per patient were analysed for plasma free choline levels within the first week after resuscitation. Choline was detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
   Results: Most patients showed elevated choline levels on admission (median 14.8 mmol/L; interquartile range; IQR 9.9-20.1) which subsequently decreased. 48 hours after cardiac arrest choline levels in all patients reached subnormal levels at a median of 4.0 mmol/L (IQR 3-4.9; p = 0.001). Subsequently, choline levels normalized within seven days. There was no significant difference in choline levels when groups were analyzed in relation to neurological outcome.
   Conclusions: Our data indicate a choline deficiency in the early postresucitation phase. This could potentially result in impaired cell membrane recovery. The detailed characterization of the early choline time course may aid in planning of choline supplementation trials. In a limited number of patients, choline was not promising as a biomarker for outcome prediction.

TI  - Personalized physiology-guided resuscitation in highly monitored patients with cardiac arrestthe PERSEUS resuscitation protocol
T2  - HEART FAILURE REVIEWS
AB  - Resuscitation guidelines remain uniform across all cardiac arrest patients, focusing on the delivery of chest compressions to a standardized rate and depth and algorithmic vasopressor dosing. However, individualizing resuscitation to the appropriate hemodynamic and ventilatory goals rather than a standard one-size-fits-all treatment seems a promising new therapeutic strategy. In this article, we present a new physiology-guided treatment strategy to titrate the resuscitation efforts to patient's physiologic response after cardiac arrest. This approach can be applied during resuscitation attempts in highly monitored patients, such as those in the operating room or the intensive care unit, and could serve as a method for improving tissue perfusion and oxygenation while decreasing post-resuscitation adverse effects.

TI  - Installation of Public Access Defibrillators for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests: Identifying Suitable Locations by Using a Geographic Information System
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background Survival following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest depends on prompt defibrillation. Despite the efforts made to install automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in crowded areas, their usage rate remains suboptimal. This study evaluated the efficiency of installing AEDs at key landmarks in Taoyuan City to enhance accessibility and usage.METHODS AND RESULTS This retrospective cohort study analyzed nontraumatic public out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases in Taoyuan City from 2017 to 2021, using data from the Taoyuan Fire Department and a regional registry. AED data were collected for 1163 devices. A geographic information system mapped target locations within the city, and real-world walking routes were examined to assess coverage. The primary outcome was actual coverage and the coverage efficiency ratio, calculated as the actual coverage divided by the number of facilities at a location. The coverage efficiency ratio compared the coverage efficiency of target locations with existing public access defibrillators (PADs). Top locations for superior coverage in both downtown and outside downtown areas were bus stops and convenience stores (7-Eleven and FamilyMart), which outperformed existing PADs. Convenience stores had a higher coverage efficiency ratio than the public service sector. Bus stops showed high AED usage rates before ambulance arrival.Conclusions The current PAD locations in Taoyuan City offer limited coverage, which highlights the need for strategically installed AEDs, particularly in convenience stores. Policymakers should consider using the cultural relevance and accessibility of convenience stores, particularly 7-Eleven branches, to enhance AED usage rates.

TI  - Synthesis of Nonselective Sorbents Modified with Carbon Nanomaterials and Their Hemocompatibility
T2  - NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - A search for promising nonselective sorbents based on composite materials, including using carbon nanomaterials, is an urgent task of resuscitation and toxicology. The synthesis and estimation of the biocompatibility of sorbents based on gamma-aluminum oxide and polydimethylsiloxane, modified with singlewalled carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibers, are carried out. It is detected that the synthesized sorbents adsorb low and medium molecular weight substances on their surface. Moreover, it is found that there is a toxic effect on red blood cells (hemolysis) occurs with prolonged exposure (120 h), short-term (5 min) exposure of the components of human peripheral blood with the sorbents leads to a loss in the number of platelets and leukocytes, mainly granulocytes, of mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood, as well as short-term and long-term contact of the blood components with the samples of sorbents contributes to a decrease in the metabolic activity of the cells and the activation of nitric-oxide production. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the sorbent based on y aluminum oxide and polydimethylsiloxane, modified with carbon nanomaterials, is promising for the development of nonselective sorbents.

TI  - Leptospirosis and the Kidney: An Overview
T2  - LEPTOSPIROSIS AND THE KIDNEY
AB  - Leptospirosis is one of the main causes of tropical infections causing acute kidney injury (AKI). These infections commonly relate to the low socioeconomic status and humid climate. Leptospires modified their membrane transport for cell volume regulation and acid - base control to survive in the various environments of the tropics. Kidney is one of the main targets due to highly vascular blood supply, low rate of leptospires clearance, and suitable acid - base environment. The unique clinical characteristics of leptospirosis-associated AKI are non-oliguria and hypokalemia. The mechanism of leptospirosis-associated AKI can be due to direct or indirect effect. Leptospiral bacteria invade renal interstitium by the attachment of outer membrane protein to renal tubular epithelium. The indirect effect mostly results from dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, hemoglobinuria, and hyperbilirubinemia as the part of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Prompt antibiotic treatment, adequate hemodynamic resuscitation, and early renal support are the key success in the treatment of leptospirosis-associated AKI. The concept of the transition from AKI to chronic kidney disease has been recently proposed in the field of nephrology. Unfortunately, the long-term renal outcome of these specific diseases is still lacking. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Sensor-free, Camera-only: Low-cost multi-angle CPR skill assessments method based on computer vision
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB  - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is critical for survival following Cardiac Arrest (CA), particularly in out-of-hospital settings. However, current CPR skill assessments often rely on simulators with manual scoring, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise, many AI-based methods still depend on expensive, sensor-laden equipment. This study introduces a novel, sensor-free approach for CPR evaluation, aiming to provide a cost-effective solution for wider accessibility. We propose the LCSG-YOLO model, an enhanced version of the YOLO11 algorithm, coupled with the Kalman-Hungarian-Confidence-Temporal (KCHT) matching algorithm. The KCHT algorithm refines target tracking and assignment, improving detection precision and system efficiency by addressing challenges in dynamic object tracking and ambiguous assignments. By integrating these techniques, our system analyzes CPR training videos to assess compression position, frequency, and depth. We calculate standardized mean times for compressions and respirations, determine operation frequencies, and extract grayscale and jitter signals from compression regions using image processing and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This allows for accurate evaluation of compression depth and frequency characteristics. The LCSG-YOLO approach offers a practical, computer vision-based solution for CPR training and assessment, potentially expanding CPR education in resource-limited environments. The results show that the LCSG-YOLO model outperforms YOLO11s and YOLO11n, with improvements of 6.4% and 2.3% in chest compression detection box precision and 4.2% and 6.4% in artificial respiration detection recall, as detailed in our comparative performance analysis. The KCHT algorithm achieves detection accuracies of 98.6% and 98.7% for standard hand positioning during chest compressions and artificial respiration, respectively.

TI  - Predictors of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support for Children with Acute Myocarditis
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis in children may range from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac arrest. This study analyzed the clinical spectrum of acute myocarditis in children to identify factors that could aid primary care physicians to predict the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) earlier and consult the pediatric cardiologist promptly. Between October 2011 and September 2016, we retrospectively analyzed 60 patients aged 18 years or younger who were admitted to our pediatric emergency department with a definite diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Data on demographics, presentation, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram and echocardiography findings, treatment modalities, complications, and long-term outcomes were obtained. During the study period, 60 patients (32 male, 28 female; mean age, 8.8 +/- 6.32 years) were diagnosed with acute myocarditis. Fever, cough, and chest pain were the most common symptoms (68.3%, 56.7%, and 53.3%, resp.). Arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 60%, vomiting, weakness, and seizure were more common in the ECMO group than in the non-ECMO group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Female sex, vomiting, weakness, seizure, arrhythmia, and echocardiography showing LVEF < 60% may predict the need for ECMO. Initial serum troponin-I cutoff values greater than 14.21 ng/mL may also indicate the need for ECMO support for children with acute myocarditis.

TI  - Real-Time Ventricular Fibrillation Amplitude-Spectral Area Analysis to Guide Timing of Shock Delivery Improves Defibrillation Efficacy During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Swine
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background-The ventricular fibrillation amplitude spectral area (AMSA) predicts whether an electrical shock could terminate ventricular fibrillation and prompt return of spontaneous circulation. We hypothesized that AMSA can guide more precise timing for effective shock delivery during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Methods and Results-Three shock delivery protocols were compared in 12 pigs each after electrically induced ventricular fibrillation, with the duration of untreated ventricular fibrillation evenly stratified into 6, 9, and 12 minutes: AMSA-Driven (AD), guided by an AMSA algorithm; Guidelines-Driven (GD), according to cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines; and Guidelines-Driven/AMSA-Enabled (GDAE), as per GD but allowing earlier shocks upon exceeding an AMSA threshold. Shocks delivered using the AD, GD, and GDAE protocols were 21, 40, and 62, with GDAE delivering only 2 AMSA-enabled shocks. The corresponding 240-minute survival was 8/12, 6/12, and 2/12 (log-rank test, P=0.035) with AD exceeding GDAE (P=0.026). The time to first shock (seconds) was (median [Q1-Q3]) 272 (161-356), 124 (124-125), and 125 (124-125) (P<0.001) with AD exceeding GD and GDAE (P<0.05); the average coronary perfusion pressure before first shock (mm Hg) was 16 (9-30), 10 (6-12), and 3 (-1 to 9) (P=0.002) with AD exceeding GDAE (P<0.05); and AMSA preceding the first shock (mV.Hz, mean +/- SD) was 13.3 +/- 2.2, 9.0 +/- 1.6, and 8.6 +/- 2.0 (P<0.001) with AD exceeding GD and GDAE (P<0.001). The AD protocol delivered fewer unsuccessful shocks (ie, less shock burden) yielding less postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and higher 240-minute survival.
   Conclusions-The AD protocol improved the time precision for shock delivery, resulting in less shock burden and less postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, potentially improving survival compared with time-fixed, guidelines-driven, shock delivery protocols.

TI  - Blood levels of copeptin on admission predict outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic hypothermia
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Prognostic stratification of cardiac arrest survivors is essential for the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy. However, accurate early outcome predictions for this patient population remain challenging. At present, there is a lack of data examining the prognostic value of C-terminal provasopressin (copeptin) in cardiac arrest survivors.
   Methods: A group of 40 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who were treated with endovascular hypothermia was analyzed. Copeptin levels were measured in blood samples taken at admission using a commercially available immunoassay. Neurological outcome was assessed at 30 days post admission according to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC): CPC 1, no neurological deficit; CPC 2, mild to moderate dysfunction; CPC 3, severe dysfunction; CPC 4, coma; and CPC 5, death.
   Results: Copeptin levels were significantly lower in patients with CPC 1 compared with CPC 2 or CPC 3 to CPC 5 (74.3 +/- 14.4 pmol/l, 219.8 +/- 33.9 pmol/l and 302.7 +/- 52.1 pmol/l, respectively; P < 0.0001). Using an optimal cutoff value <= 217.9 pmol/l calculated from the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under curve = 0.801, 95% confidence interval = 0.644 to 0.910; P = 0.0001), the sensitivity of predicting survival with good neurological outcome was 78.6% and the specificity was 75.0%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a copeptin level > 217.9 pmol/l was an independent predictor of severe neurological dysfunction or death, with an adjusted odds ratio of 27.00 (95% confidence interval = 2.27 to 321.68; P = 0.009).
   Conclusion: The present study found that copeptin levels have a significant prognostic value at the time of hospital admission, and are a promising diagnostic tool for predicting outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - A patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest saved from heart transplantation and amputation through a collaboration between modern and traditional Chinese medicine: A case report
T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
AB  - Introduction: Patients with end-stage heart failure have limited options for medical treatment, and this ultimately necessitates heart transplantation. Patients undergoing heart transplant surgery are burdened with substantial costs related to finances, procedural risks, and postoperative quality of life. This report presents a case of heart failure in a patient whose limbs and heart were preserved through a collaboration between modern and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Patient Presentation: A 47-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and was diagnosed with 3-vessel disease and acute decompensated heart failure on October 27, 2020. After extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patient presented with cyanosis and gangrene in all four limbs. Cardiologists and plastic surgeons recommended heart transplantation and amputation. The patient wanted to keep his limbs and heart intact and requested to receive TCM. A TCM physician was consulted by visiting staff to provide combined care. After TCM intervention, both the ejection fraction (EF) and gangrene improved. Until now, the patient continues to receive TCM treatment, lives with preserved limbs and heart, and went through SARS-CoV2 infection smoothly in 2023. Conclusion: TCM met the expectations of the patient and reduced the high medical expenses. This approach may improve the outlook and be a more economical option for patients with end-stage heart failure.

TI  - HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY-OF-LIFE AMONG PATIENTS UNDERGOING PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
AB  - A randomized clinical trial was recently conducted to investigate whether a new antiplatelet agent could prevent restenosis in patients who had undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty (PTCA). Approximately 1,200 patients were enrolled at 13 separate clinical sites. To assess the impact of this intervention on health-related quality of life, a patient questionnaire for telephone administration was developed. This questionnaire focused attention on several specific dimensions likely to be important in this patient population: physical well-being perceived health, emotional well-being, home management, work, recreation, and social and sexual functioning. This paper describes the instrument that was used in this trial and reports on its psychosomatic properties based on completed interviews with approximately 500 patients at study entry and 1 month after PTCA.

TI  - Anxiety, depression, and PTSD following cardiac arrest: A systematic review of the literature
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objectives: Identify the occurrence rate of post-arrest psychological distress; evaluate methodological approaches; suggest future research priorities; address clinical implications.
   Methods: The electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE and PsychInfo/APA PsycNET were utilized to search for terms including 'Cardiac Arrest', 'Therapeutic Hypothermia' and 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Quality of Life', 'Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)', 'Psychological Outcomes', 'Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)', and 'Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)'.
   Results: High rates of psychological distress have been reported after OHCA. Specifically, incidence rates of depression have ranged from 14% to 45%; anxiety rates have ranged from 13% to 61%; PTSD rates reportedly range from 19% to 27%. Variability between studies is likely attributable to methodological variations relating to measures used, time since arrest, and research setting.
   Discussion: Given the occurrence rate of psychological distress after OHCA, psychological screening and early intervention seems indicated in the cardiac arrest population. Further studies are needed to better establish occurrence rates in both inpatient and outpatient settings, determine appropriate measures and normative cut off scores, and decide on the most appropriate method of intervention.

TI  - Extension of ischemic tolerance of porcine livers by cold preservation including postconditioning with gaseous oxygen
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Background. Transplantation of organs from nonheartbeating donors was recommended to reduce organ shortage, In vitro experiments with rat livers have shown that the warm ischemic tolerance of the liver may be extended by persufflation with gaseous oxygen during cold storage, The qualification of this method for procurement of livers harvested after cardiac arrest was tested in an in vivo approach with pigs,
   Methods. Livers from 15 donor pigs were explanted, heparinized, flushed with and stored in University of Wisconsin solution for 4 hr at 4 degreesC, and then implanted into 15 recipients. The organs were dissected immediately after cardiac arrest (group 1) or after 60 min of warm ischemia (groups 2 and 3), Group 2 livers received 75,000 IU of superoxide dismutase together with the flush solution and were persufflated with gaseous oxygen via the venous vascular system during cold storage. Main end point was survival after 5 days. Additionally, metabolic, functional and inflammatory criteria were measured in the blood.
   Results. All animals of the groups 1 and 2 survived, all animals of group 3 died within 3 hr after reperfusion, In all groups the blood parameters reflected significant damage of the livers. However, the ischemic damage was comparable in the groups 1 and 2 whereas the livers of group 3 exhibited significantly higher levels of aspartate alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, and a significantly elongated partial thromboplastin time 1 hr after reperfusion (P=0.016),
   Conclusions. Venous systemic oxygen persufflation in combination with antioxidative medication is a promising new method of resuscitating ischemically altered livers from nonheartbeating donors for successful transplantation.

TI  - Nutrition Considerations in Traumatic Brain Injury
T2  - NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - The provision of adequate nutrition support for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a clinical challenge for decades. The primary and secondary injuries create unique metabolic derangements along with accompanying issues such as optimal timing and route of nutrition, appropriate fluid and electrolytes, drug administration, rehabilitation, and dysphagia. Enteral nutrition is clearly established as the preferential route of nutrition support for this population vs parenteral nutrition. There appears to be a consensus on early initiation of enteral nutrition, but less definitive are recommendations on advancement timing and formula components. Nutrition therapies should include exact fluid resuscitation goals specific for TBI and strict electrolyte monitoring to avoid extreme fluid, electrolyte, or glucose shifts that could be detrimental to the patient. While the critical care patient often tolerates small bowel feeding, the long-term rehabilitation patient should transition to and tolerate gastric feeding. Drug-nutrient and adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea should be routinely evaluated in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Monitoring for dysphagia is critical to avoid the costly negative aspects associated with aspiration and to capitalize on quality of life and appropriate oral nutrition. Emphasizing the priority of early nutrition support within a multi-disciplinary team may be the critical key for successful provision and tolerance of nutrition support in the TBI population.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation and Reperfusion
T2  - CIRCULATION RESEARCH
AB  - The modern treatment of cardiac arrest is an increasingly complex medical procedure with a rapidly changing array of therapeutic approaches designed to restore life to victims of sudden death. The 2 primary goals of providing artificial circulation and defibrillation to halt ventricular fibrillation remain of paramount importance for saving lives. They have undergone significant improvements in technology and dissemination into the community subsequent to their establishment 60 years ago. The evolution of artificial circulation includes efforts to optimize manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, external mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices designed to augment circulation, and may soon advance further into the rapid deployment of specially designed internal emergency cardiopulmonary bypass devices. The development of defibrillation technologies has progressed from bulky internal defibrillators paddles applied directly to the heart, to manually controlled external defibrillators, to automatic external defibrillators that can now be obtained over-the-counter for widespread use in the community or home. But the modern treatment of cardiac arrest now involves more than merely providing circulation and defibrillation. As suggested by a 3-phase model of treatment, newer approaches targeting patients who have had a more prolonged cardiac arrest include treatment of the metabolic phase of cardiac arrest with therapeutic hypothermia, agents to treat or prevent reperfusion injury, new strategies specifically focused on pulseless electric activity, which is the presenting rhythm in at least one third of cardiac arrests, and aggressive post resuscitation care. There are discoveries at the cellular and molecular level about ischemia and reperfusion pathobiology that may be translated into future new therapies. On the near horizon is the combination of advanced cardiopulmonary bypass plus a cocktail of multiple agents targeted at restoration of normal metabolism and prevention of reperfusion injury, as this holds the promise of restoring life to many patients for whom our current therapies fail.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in inflammatory bowel disease: Gene polymorphisms, animal models, and potential for anti-TNF therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION
AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases frequently require surgery because of intestinal complications. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, in particular those that histopathologically resemble Crohn's disease, are characterized by increased mucosal TNF production, and anti-TNF antibodies have shown efficacy in decreasing disease activity. These data have provided a rationale for immunotheraphy of Crohn's disease. Administration of anti-TNF antibodies to patients with Crohn's disease not responding to standard immunosuppressive treatment rapidly induced complete remisssions, and healing of intestinal ulceration. A rapid reduction of circulating IL-6, CPR, and sPLA2 levels was observed in all patients, as well as a reduction of mucosal cells expressing RANTES and MIP-1. Short-term treatment with anti-TNF antibodies was not associated with significant toxicity, but results from long-term administration are still lacking. These data indicate that TNF is a pivotal and central inflammatory mediator in this disease. Further characterization of the precise mechanism of action of anti-TNF antibody therapy may further unravel the cause of immune dysregulation in Crohn's disease. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - SOS gene induction and possible mutagenic effects of freeze-drying in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - We report the results of a study of the potential negative effects of the freeze-drying process, normally considered a benign means for long-term conservation of living cells and the golden standard in bacterial preservation. By monitoring gene induction using a whole-cell Escherichia coli bioreporter panel, in which diverse stress-responsive gene promoters are fused to luminescent or fluorescent reporting systems, we have demonstrated that DNA repair genes belonging to the SOS operon (recA, sulA, uvrA, umuD, and lexA) were induced upon resuscitation from the freeze-dried state, whereas other stress-responsive promoters such as grpE, katG, phoA, soxS, and sodA were not affected. This observation was confirmed by the UMU-chromotest (activation of the umuD gene promoter) in Salmonella typhimurium, as well as by real-time PCR analyses of selected E. coli SOS genes. We further show that a functional SOS operon is important in viability maintenance following resuscitation, but that at the same time, this repair system may introduce significantly higher mutation rates, comparable to those induced by high concentrations of a known mutagen. Our results also indicate that the entire freeze-drying process, rather than either freezing or drying separately, is instrumental in the induction of DNA damage.

TI  - Selective Brain Cooling: A New Horizon of Neuroprotection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia (TH), which prevents irreversible neuronal necrosis and ischemic brain damage, has been proven effective for preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury in post-cardiac arrest syndrome and neonatal encephalopathy in both animal studies and clinical trials. However, lowering the whole-body temperature below 34 degrees C can lead to severe systemic complications such as cardiac, hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic side effects. Although the brain accounts for only 2% of the total body weight, it consumes 20% of the body's total energy at rest and requires a continuous supply of glucose and oxygen to maintain function and structural integrity. As such, theoretically, temperature-controlled selective brain cooling (SBC) may be more beneficial for brain ischemia than systemic pan-ischemia. Various SBC methods have been introduced to selectively cool the brain while minimizing systemic TH-related complications. However, technical setbacks of conventional SBCs, such as insufficient cooling power and relatively expensive coolant and/or irritating effects on skin or mucosal interfaces, limit its application to various clinical settings. This review aimed to integrate current literature on SBC modalities with promising therapeutic potential. Further, future directions were discussed by exploring studies on interesting coping skills in response to environmental or stress-induced hyperthermia among wild animals, including mammals and birds.

TI  - Effects of repetitive electrical shocks on postresuscitation myocardial function
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 5th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
AB  - Whereas myocardial cell injury can occur during electrical defibrillation proportional to the energy level of individual shocks, only minimal (or no) injury seems to develop when the energy is limited to the levels typically required to terminate ventricular fibrillation, During cardiac arrest, however, multiple shocks are often required to terminate ventricular fibrillation or to treat episodes that appear subsequently during the resuscitation effort or the postresuscitation interval. Concern exists because an inverse relationship has been reported between the number of electrical shocks delivered during cardiac resuscitation and both resuscitability and survival, Repetitive electrical shacks can alter diastolic function and prompt leftward shifts of the end-diastolic pressure-volume curves, Repetitive shocks may, therefore, contribute to the recently recognized phenomenon of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and hamper efforts to reestablish competent myocardial function after resuscitation, Thus, strategies aimed at limiting the number of electrical shocks during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are highly desirable, These may include real-time ventricular fibrillation waveform analysis to improve targeting of individual shocks and efforts (using mechanical and pharmacologic means) to render the myocardium more responsive to individual shocks and to promote greater electrical stability after successful defibrillation.

TI  - Resuscitation-promoting factors as lytic enzymes for bacterial growth and signaling
T2  - FEMS IMMUNOLOGY AND MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) is a muralytic enzyme that increases the culturability of dormant bacteria. Recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the structure, function and physiological role of Rpfs in different organisms, most notably the major human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which encodes multiple rpf-like genes. A key unresolved question, however, concerns the relationship between the predicted biochemical activity of Rpfs - cleavage of the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond in the glycan backbone of peptidoglycan - and their effect on culturability. In M. tuberculosis, the interaction between RpfB and the D,L-endopeptidase, Rpf interacting protein A (RipA), enables these proteins to synergistically degrade peptidoglycan to facilitate growth. Furthermore, the combined action of Rpfs with RipA and other peptidoglycan hydrolases might produce muropeptides that could exert diverse biological effects through host and/or bacterial signaling, the latter involving serine/threonine protein kinases. Here, we explore these possibilities in the context of the structure and composition of mycobacterial peptidoglycan. Clearly, a deeper understanding of the role of Rpfs and associated peptidoglycan remodeling enzymes in bacterial growth and culturability is necessary to establish the significance of dormancy and resuscitation in diseases such as tuberculosis, which are associated with long-term persistence of viable bacterial populations recalcitrant to antibiotic and immune clearance.

TI  - Gratitude Interventions: Effective Self-help? A Meta-analysis of the Impact on Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
AB  - Research suggests gratitude interventions-designed to increase appreciation of positive qualities, situations, and people in one's life-may improve psychological well-being (e.g., Seligman et al. in Am Psychol 60:410-421, 2005. 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410). Accordingly, mental health practitioners have promoted gratitude interventions as a means of self-help. However, results from previous reviews suggest that well-being improvements associated with gratitude interventions may be attributable to placebo effects (Davis et al. in J Couns Psychol 63:20-31, 2016. 10.1037/cou0000107; Wood et al. in Clin Psychol Rev 30:890-905, 2010, 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.03.005). With this meta-analysis, we examined the efficacy of gratitude interventions (k = 27, N = 3675) in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety at post-test and follow-up periods. Gratitude interventions had a small effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety at both post-test (g = - 0.29, SE = 0.06, p < .01) and follow-up (g = - 0.23, SE = 0.06, p < .01). Correcting for attenuation from unreliability did not change results. Moderation analyses indicated effect sizes were larger for studies using waitlist, rather than active, control conditions at post-test and follow-up. We did not find consistent evidence for effects of other moderator variables (e.g., risk of bias, depressive symptom severity, or type of intervention used). Our results suggest the effects of gratitude interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety are relatively modest. Therefore, we recommend individuals seeking to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety engage in interventions with stronger evidence of efficacy for these symptoms.

TI  - Comparison of Effectiveness of Two Different Practical Approaches to Teaching Basic Life Support and Use of an Automated External Defibrillator in Primary School Children
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: As the first three links of the chain of survival of victims of cardiac arrest depend on prompt action by bystanders, it is important to educate as much of the population as possible about basic life support and use of an automatic external defibrillator (BLS and AED). Schoolchildren are an accessible population that can be easily taught and numerous BLS and AED courses are available. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two different practical approaches to teaching BLS and AED. Material and Methods: We compared two different BLS and AED courses (course A and B) offered to 280 eighth- and ninth-grade students in primary schools. Knowledge about and the intention to perform BLS and AED were evaluated using validated questionnaires before and after the courses. Descriptive methods were used to describe the results. To compare courses, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Differences in knowledge and intention to perform BLS and AED after the courses were significant between courses (p < 0.001 and p = 0.037, respectively). After course A, students demonstrated significantly better knowledge and numerically greater intention to perform BLS and AED (intention score 6.55 +/- 0.61 out of 7). Conclusions: Courses in which students have the opportunity to individually practice BLS skills show a greater increase in knowledge and in intention to perform BLS and AED.

TI  - Rapid-Response Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation to Support Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Children With Cardiac Disease
T2  - CIRCULATION
CP  - 82nd Scientific Session of the American-Heart-Association
AB  - Background-Survival of children with in-hospital cardiac arrest that does not respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is poor. We report on survival and early neurological outcomes of children with heart disease supported with rapid-response extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to aid cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).
   Methods and Results-Children with heart disease supported with ECPR were identified from our ECMO database. Demographic, CPR, and ECMO details associated with mortality were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Pediatric overall performance category and pediatric cerebral performance category scores were assigned to ECPR survivors to assess neurological outcomes. There were 180 ECPR runs in 172 patients. Eighty-eight patients (51%) survived to discharge. Survival in patients who underwent ECPR after cardiac surgery (54%) did not differ from nonsurgical patients (46%). Survival did not vary by cardiac diagnosis and CPR duration did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Factors associated with mortality included noncardiac structural or chromosomal abnormalities (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9), use of blood-primed ECMO circuit (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.4-36), and arterial pH <7.00 after ECMO deployment (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 2.1-17.4). Development of end-organ injury on ECMO and longer ECMO duration were associated with increased mortality. Of pediatric overall performance category/pediatric cerebral performance category scores assigned to survivors, 75% had scores <= 2, indicating no to mild neurological injury.
   Conclusions-ECPR may promote survival in children with cardiac disease experiencing cardiac arrest unresponsive to conventional CPR with favorable early neurological outcomes. CPR duration was not associated with mortality, whereas patients with metabolic acidosis and noncardiac structural or chromosomal anomalies had higher mortality.

TI  - Acute estradiol protects CA1 neurons from ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death via the PI3K/Akt pathway
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Global ischemia arising during cardiac arrest or cardiac surgery causes highly selective, delayed death of hippocampal CA1 neurons. Exogenous estradiol ameliorates global ischemia-induced neuronal death and cognitive impairment in male and female rodents. However, the molecular mechanisms by which a single acute injection of estradiol administered after the ischemic event intervenes in global ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death are unclear. Here we show that acute estradiol acts via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling cascade to protect CA1 neurons in ovariectomized female rats. We demonstrate that global ischemia promotes early activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) and forkhead transcription factor of the O class (FOXO)3A, known Akt targets that are related to cell survival, and activation of caspase-3. Estradiol prevents ischemia-induced dephosphorylation and activation of GSK3 beta and FOXO3A, and the caspase death cascade. These findings support a model whereby estradiol acts by activation of PI3K/Akt signaling to promote neuronal survival in the face of global ischemia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Health-Related Quality of Life Among Patients Who Have Survived an Episode of Sepsis in the United States: A Systematic Review
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
AB  - Introduction: Sepsis is a serious condition that may lead to death or profoundly affect the well-being of those who survive. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and summarize evidence on the impact of all-cause sepsis on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes among sepsis survivors in the USA. Methods: Studies assessing HRQoL, physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes in patients who survived an episode of sepsis and published from January 1, 2010, to September 30, 2023, were systematically identified through EMBASE, MEDLINE, and MEDLINE In-Process databases, as well as through gray literature. Results: Of 2885 records identified, 7 studies (7 publications; N = 180,592 participants) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. Studies examined the effects of sepsis on the following outcomes of interest: HRQoL (4 studies), physical functioning (5 studies), cognitive status (3 studies), and psychological well-being (3 studies). After 12 months, sepsis survivors who developed chronic critical illness (N = 63) had significantly poorer HRQoL as measured by EuroQoL 5-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire mean utility index score and Short Form 36-item (SF-36) physical and mental summary scores compared with patients who rapidly recovered (N = 110). Among patients admitted to a skilled nursing facility post-sepsis (N = 66,540), 34% and 72.5% had severe or very severe cognitive impairment and dependence to perform activities of daily living, respectively. Significant increase in moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment among severe sepsis survivors (N = 623) before and after sepsis was reported (median 0.9 [IQR: 0.4, 1.4] years; 6.1% and 16.7%, respectively [P < 0.001]). Substantial depression and anxiety symptoms were frequently observed post-sepsis, but with limited evidence for increased burden as assessed by specific psychological measures. Conclusion: These findings underscore the profound negative impacts of sepsis on patients' HRQoL, ability to perform activities of daily living, and cognitive abilities.

TI  - Enhanced pyruvate dehydrogenase activity improves cardiac outcomes in a murine model of cardiac arrest
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Rationale
   Post-ischemic changes in cellular metabolism alter myocardial and neurological function. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the limiting step in mitochondrial glucose oxidation, is inhibited by increased expression of PDH kinase (PDK) during ischemia/reperfusion injury. This results in decreased utilization of glucose to generate cellular ATP. Post-cardiac arrest (CA) hypothermia improves outcomes and alters metabolism, but its influence on PDH and PDK activity following CA are unknown. We hypothesized that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following CA is associated with the inhibition of PDK activity and increased PDH activity. We further hypothesized that an inhibitor of PDK activity, dichloroacetate (DCA), would improve PDH activity and post-CA outcomes.
   Methods and results
   Anesthetized and ventilated adult female C57BL/6 wild-type mice underwent a 12-minute KCl-induced CA followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Compared to normothermic (37 E C) CA controls, administering TH (30 degrees C) improved overall survival (72-hour survival rate: 62.5% vs. 28.6%, P<0.001), post-resuscitation myocardial function (ejection fraction: 50.9 +/- 3.1% vs. 27.2 +/- 2.0%, P<0.001; aorta systolic pressure: 132.7 +/- 7.3 vs. 72.3 +/- 3.0 mmHg, P<0.001), and neurological scores at 72-hour post CA (9.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.3, P<0.05). In both heart and brain, CA increased lactate concentrations (1.9-fold and 3.1-fold increase, respectively, P<0.01), decreased PDH enzyme activity (24% and 50% reduction, respectively, P<0.01), and increased PDK protein expressions (1.2-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, P<0.01). In contrast, post-CA treatment with TH normalized lactate concentrations (P<0.01 and P<0.05) and PDK expressions (P<0.001 and P<0.05), while increasing PDH activity (P<0.01 and P<0.01) in both the heart and brain. Additionally, treatment with DCA (0.2 mg/g body weight) 30 min prior to CA improved both myocardial hemodynamics 2 hours post-CA (aortic systolic pressure: 123 +/- 3 vs. 96 +/- 4 mmHg, P<0.001) and 72-hour survival rates (50% vs. 19%, P<0.05) in normothermic animals.
   Conclusions
   Enhanced PDH activity in the setting of TH or DCA administration is associated with improved post-CA resuscitation outcomes. PDH is a promising therapeutic target for improving post-CA outcomes.

TI  - Effects of uniform-allocation constraints in networked common-pool resource extraction games
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB  - Communities that share common-pool resources (CPRs) often coordinate their actions to sustain resource quality more effectively than if they were regulated by some centralized authority. Networked models of CPR extraction suggest that the flexibility of individual agents to selectively allocate extraction effort among multiple resources plays an important role in maximizing their payoffs. However, empirical evidence suggests that real-world CPR appropriators may often de-emphasize issues of allocation, for example by responding to the degradation of a single resource by reducing extraction from multiple resources, rather than by reallocating extraction effort away from the degraded resource. Here, we study the population-level consequences that emerge when individuals are constrained to apply an equal amount of extraction effort to all CPRs that are available to them within an affiliation network linking agents to resources. In systems where all resources have the same capacity, this uniform-allocation constraint leads to reduced collective wealth compared to unconstrained best-response extraction, but it can produce more egalitarian wealth distributions. The differences are more pronounced in networks that have higher degree heterogeneity among resources. In the case that the capacity of each CPR is proportional to its number of appropriators, the uniform-allocation constraint can lead to more efficient collective extraction since it serves to distribute the burden of over-extraction more evenly among the network's CPRs. Our results reinforce the importance of adaptive allocation in self-regulation for populations who share linearly degrading CPRs; although uniform-allocation extraction habits can help to sustain higher resource quality than does unconstrained extraction, in general this does not improve collective benefits for a population in the long term.

TI  - Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 ameliorates postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction in rat via mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in the development of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction (PRMD). Endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) has obvious protective effects on cardiomyocytes and that mitochondria are considered to be the main targets of CO action. This study aimed to investigate whether exogenous CO (carbon monoxide releasing molecule 2, CORM-2) could protect against PRMD, and improve cardiac function in rats via the mitochondria pathway. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham group, model cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) group, CORM-2 treatment group, inactivated CORM-2 group, and DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide, CORM-2 vehicle) group. Excluding the sham group, all groups underwent CPR 4 min after cardiac arrest (CA), animals in every group underwent surgery for catheter insertion before the CA-CPR. In the treatment groups, CORM-2 and inactivated CORM-2 (both 4 mg/kg, dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in normal saline) were intraperitoneally injected 12 h before CPR was started. In the sham, model CPR, and vehicle groups, animals were administered normal saline or vehicle as appropriate. The results demonstrated that the mitochondrial ultrastructure abnormalities in CORM-2 group was less severe than CPR rats. CORM-2 alleviated myocardial contractile and diastolic dysfunction after CPR, decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in myocardial tissues, and meanwhile suppressed cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore, CORM-2 lessen the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased myocardial mitochondrial respiratory complex IV enzyme activity after CPR. Dynamin-related protein 1(Drp1) was significantly less expressed in CORM-2 group with high expression of mitofusion-2 (Mfn2), sug-gesting that CORM-2 can promote mitochondrial fusion and reduce mitochondrial fission. Collectively, we provide the evidence that CORM-2 effectively relieved myocardial injury after CPR in rats, protected myocardial mitochondria, and preserved cardiac function after resuscitation. The proposed mechanisms of action were improved mitochondrial respiratory function, maintained mitochondrial dynamics balance, and suppressed the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.

TI  - Adherence to therapeutic hypothermia guidelines for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - AUSTRALIAN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Out of hospital cardiac arrest is associated with a high rate of mortality, and poor neurological outcomes. Favourable neuro-protective effects are associated with induced hypothermia and international recommendations exist for therapeutic hypothermia.
   Objective: This study reviews practice for therapeutic hypothermia for out of hospital cardiac arrest patients within one ICU. It aims to describe the level of adherence to the guideline, identify barriers to implementation and to improve adherence.
   Setting: This project was conducted in an adult ICU which admits 2000 patients yearly.
   Methods: A retrospective chart audit was used to document practice for a 12 month period.
   Results: 33 patients were admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of out of hospital cardiac arrest and met study inclusion criteria. From this sample of 33 patients, four patients (12%) were at the goal temperature of 32.5-33.5 degrees C, in the target time of 2 h. Nearly half (n = 17) were not cooled at all. The length of time the patient was in the ICU prior to active cooling commencing varied from < 1 h (n = 15, 45%) to > 3 h ( n = 5, 15%). Twenty-four percent (n = 9) were cooled for the recommended length of time. There were medical orders stating a target temperature in nearly half of the cases (n = 18), however, only 27% (n = 9) were consistent with the ICU guidelines. A number of strategies have been initiated. They aim to improve communication and ready access to the required materials.
   Conclusions: The audit indicated that less than a third of the patients experienced therapeutic induced hypothermia and only 12% were at goal temperature within the required 2 h. Strategies initiated to improve guideline implementation included; regular education sessions with ICU staff; placing a cooling blanket on the bed prior to admitting a patient post OOHCA; improving ready access to cooling agents and the addition of a care path for the induction and maintenance of therapeutic hypothermia to support and prompt clinicians when using the computerised patient record system.

AB  - Importance Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates have markedly risen in the last decades, but neurological outcome only improved marginally. Despite research on more than 20 neuroprotective strategies involving patients in comas after cardiac arrest, none have demonstrated unequivocal evidence of efficacy; however, treatment with acyl-ghrelin has shown improved functional and histological brain recovery in experimental models of cardiac arrest and was safe in a wide variety of human study populations. Objective To determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenous acyl-ghrelin to improve neurological outcome in patients in a coma after cardiac arrest. Design, Setting, and Participants A phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, Ghrelin Treatment of Comatose Patients After Cardiac Arrest: A Clinical Trial to Promote Cerebral Recovery (GRECO), was conducted between January 18, 2019, and October 17, 2022. Adult patients 18 years or older who were in a comatose state after cardiac arrest were assessed for eligibility; patients were from 3 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Expected death within 48 hours or unfeasibility of treatment initiation within 12 hours were exclusion criteria. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive intravenous acyl-ghrelin, 600 mu g (intervention group), or placebo (control group) within 12 hours after cardiac arrest, continued for 7 days, twice daily, in addition to standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was the score on the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale at 6 months. Safety outcomes included any serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were mortality and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels on days 1 and 3. Results A total of 783 adult patients in a coma after cardiac arrest were assessed for eligibility, and 160 patients (median [IQR] age, 68 [57-75] years; 120 male [75%]) were enrolled. A total of 81 patients (51%) were assigned to the intervention group, and 79 (49%) were assigned to the control group. The common odds ratio (OR) for any CPC improvement in the intervention group was 1.78 (95% CI, 0.98-3.22; P = .06). This was consistent over all CPC categories. Mean (SD) NSE levels on day 1 after cardiac arrest were significantly lower in the intervention group (34 [6] mu g/L vs 56 [13] mu g/L; P = .04) and on day 3 (28 [6] mu g/L vs 52 [14] mu g/L; P = .08). Serious adverse events were comparable in incidence and type between the groups. Mortality was 37% (30 of 81) in the intervention group vs 51% (40 of 79) in the control group (absolute risk reduction, 14%; 95% CI, -2% to 29%; P = .08). Conclusions and Relevance In patients in a coma after cardiac arrest, intravenous treatment with acyl-ghrelin was safe and potentially effective to improve neurological outcome. Phase 3 trials are needed for conclusive evidence. Trial Registration Clinicaltrialsregister.eu: EUCTR2018-000005-23-NL

TI  - Esophageal thermal injuries associated with food ingestion: an updated scoping review
T2  - ANNALS OF LAPAROSCOPIC AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
AB  - Background: Esophageal thermal injuries (ETIs) associated with food ingestion can lead to severe complications and long-term sequelae. Purpose of the study was to provide a comprehensive overview of these peculiar esophageal burns, including etiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies. Methods: The study was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta- Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google databases were queried until 31st December 2023. Eligible studies included all articles reporting data, management, and outcomes on ETI. Results: Twenty-seven patients (23 case reports) experiencing ETI from solid and liquid hot food ingestion were included. Overall, 12 patients suffered from hot solid food ingestion while 15 experienced hot liquid food ingestion causing ETI. Odynophagia, dysphagia, and chest pain were the most commonly reported symptoms. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical assessment, endoscopic evaluation, and imaging modalities. A multidisciplinary approach involving both gastroenterologists and surgeons is critical. Management strategies encompass supportive care, such as fluid resuscitation and nutritional support, along with specific interventions like surgical repair and endoscopic dilatation in severe cases. Conclusions: ETI resulting from the ingestion of hot liquids and solid foods pose a not negligible morbidity and mortality risk. Early recognition, prompt diagnosis, and appropriate management are essential in improving outcomes. Prevention through public education and regulatory measures to minimize the incidence of complications remain paramount to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

TI  - Combined treatment of nerve growth factor and transcranical direct current stimulations to improve outcome in children with vegetative state after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - BIOLOGY DIRECT
AB  - BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the most dramatic events in pediatric age and, despite advanced neurointensive care, the survival rate remains low. Currently, no effective treatments can restore neuronal loss or produce significant improvement in these patients. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin potentially able to counteract many of the deleterious effects triggered by OHCA. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to be neuroprotective in many neurological diseases, such as motor deficit and cognitive impairment. Children with the diagnosis of chronic vegetative state after OHCA were enrolled. These patients underwent a combined treatment of intranasal administration of human recombinant NGF (hr-NGF), at a total dose of 50 gamma/kg, and tDCS, in which current intensity was increased from zero to 2 mA from the first 5 s of stimulation and maintained constant for 20 min. The treatment schedule was performed twice, at one month distance each. Neuroradiogical evaluation with Positron Emission Tomography scan (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Power Spectral Density of the brain (PSD) was determined before the treatment and one month after the end. Neurological assessment was deepened by using modified Ashworth Scale, Gross Motor Function Measure, and Disability Rating Scale.ResultsThree children with a chronic vegetative state secondary to OHCA were treated. The combined treatment with hr-NGF and tDCS improved functional (PET and SPECT) and electrophysiological (EEG and PSD) assessment. Also clinical conditions improved, mainly for the reduction of spasticity and with the acquisition of voluntary finger movements, improved facial mimicry and reaction to painful stimuli. No side effects were reported.ConclusionsThese promising preliminary results and the ease of administration of this treatment make it worthwhile to be investigated further, mainly in the early stages from OHCA and in patients with better baseline neurological conditions, in order to explore more thoroughly the benefits of this new approach on neuronal function recovery after OHCA.

TI  - Regional Tissue Oximetry Reflects Changes in Arterial Flow in Porcine Chronic Heart Failure Treated With Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) is widely used in treatment of decompensated heart failure. Our aim was to investigate its effects on regional perfusion and tissue oxygenation with respect to extracorporeal blood flow (EBF). In five swine, decompensated low-output chronic heart failure was induced by long-term rapid ventricular pacing. Subsequently, VA ECMO was introduced and left ventricular (LV) volume, aortic blood pressure, regional arterial flow and tissue oxygenation were continuously recorded at different levels of EBF. With increasing EBF from minimal to 5 l/min, mean arterial pressure increased from 47 +/- 22 to 84 +/- 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and arterial blood flow increased in carotid artery from 211 +/- 72 to 479 +/- 58 ml/min (P<0.01) and in subclavian artery from 103 +/- 49 to 296 +/- 54 ml/min (P<0.001). Corresponding brain and brachial tissue oxygenation increased promptly from 57 +/- 6 to 74 +/- 3 % and from 37 +/- 6 to 77 +/- 6%, respectively (both P<0.01). Presented results confirm that VA ECMO is a capable form of heart support. Regional arterial flow and tissue oxygenation suggest that partial circulatory support may be sufficient to supply brain and peripheral tissue by oxygen.

TI  - Successful resuscitation of a patient With electrical storm over 7 days: a case report
T2  - LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION
AB  - A 75 year old woman with atrial fibrillation-related tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy suffered ventricular fibrillation induced by dobutamine and was successfully defibrillated into atrial fibrillation in hospital. During the following 7 days, she suffered a cardiac electrical storm with 55 episodes of ventricular tachycardia rapidly degenerating to ventricular fibrillation and was converted with a total of 51 defibrillations and 4 chest compressions. Sinus rhythm was restored by electric cardioversion in the second episode of ventricular fibrillation. There was no response to the use of any recommended anti arrhythmic drugs. However, the use of chlorpromazine and promethazine surprisingly stabilized her heart rhythm. During a two-year follow-up period, the patient has remained free of ventricular fibrillation episodes and maintained sinus rhythm.

TI  - Early and long-term results of coronary artery bypass grafting in dialysis patients
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
CP  - 46th Annual Meeting of the Southern-Thoracic-Surgical-Association
AB  - Background. Dialysis patients frequently present with debilitating coronary artery disease but are regarded as challenging patients for coronary artery bypass grafting.
   Methods. The operative, early postoperative, and late results of 44 dialysis patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from 1984 to 1997 were retrospectively reviewed.
   Results. Compared wit patients in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, only cerebrovascular accident and postoperative cardiac arrest occurred more frequently in dialysis patients. However, 73% experienced some type of complication. Operative mortality was 11.4%. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and severe distal disease were predictive of increased operative mortality. New York Heart Association angina class fell from 2.8 to 1.5, and New York Heart Association congestive heart failure class fell from 2.6 to 1.8. Overall quality-of-life scores did not improve; however, walking distances remained consistently improved. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 32.0% +/- 12.0%. Five-year survival was 0% for smokers and 83.6% +/- 7.6% for nonsmokers (p = 0.0142). Causes of late death were myocardial infarction (4), sepsis (1), subdural hematoma (1), stroke (1), and unknown (6).
   Conclusions. Coronary artery bypass grafting should be avoided in dialysis patients with severe diffuse disease. A smoking history is associated with poor outcome. Coronary artery bypass grafting in dialysis patients is associated with a higher incidence of complications but can be performed with an acceptable operative mortality and is associated with good symptomatic relief of angina and heart failure.

TI  - Clinical Presentation of Patients with Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
AB  - Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent but important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) especially in younger women. However, the clinical presentation and the acuity of symptoms prompting invasive management in SCAD patients have not been described. Understanding these presenting features may improve SCAD diagnosis and management. Methods: We reviewed SCAD patients who were prospectively followed at the Vancouver General Hospital SCAD Clinic. Their presenting symptoms and unstable features were obtained from detailed clinical histories and hospital admission documentation. Baseline characteristics, predisposing and precipitating conditions, angiographic findings, management strategies, in-hospital, and long-term events were recorded prospectively. Results: We included 196 SCAD patients who had complete documentation of their presenting symptoms. The majority were women (178/196; 90.8%) and all presented with MI (24.0% STEMI). The most frequent presenting symptom was chest discomfort, reported by 96%. Other symptoms included arm pain (49.5%), neck pain (22.1%), nausea or vomiting (23.4%), diaphoresis (20.9%), dyspnea (19.3%), and back pain (12.2%). Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation occurred in 8.1% (16/196), with 1.0% having cardiac arrest. The time from symptom onset to hospital presentation was 1.1 +/- 3.0 days. NSTEMI patients had longer delay for coronary angiography compared with STEMI (2.0 +/- 2.5 days vs. 0.8 +/- 1.7 days, P=0.002). Overall, 34.2% had unstable symptoms upon arrival for coronary angiography. Those with unstable symptoms were more likely to undergo repeat angiography (65.7% vs. 50.4%, P=0.049), and repeat or unplanned revascularization (14.9% vs. 5.4%, P=0.033) during acute hospitalization. Conclusion: Chest discomfort was the most frequent presenting symptom with SCAD and one-third had unstable symptoms prompting urgent invasive angiography. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Protecting Mitochondrial Bioenergetic Function During Resuscitation from Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE CLINICS
AB  - Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest requires reestablishment of aerobic metabolism by reperfusion of tissues that have been deprived of oxygen for variable times. However, reperfusion concomitantly activates pathogenic mechanisms known as "reperfusion injury." Mitochondria play a critical role as effectors and targets of such injury. Mitochondrial injury compromises oxidative phosphorylation and prompts release of cytochrome c to the cytosol and bloodstream, where it correlates with severity of injury. Novel and clinically relevant strategies to protect mitochondrial bioenergetic function are expected to attenuate injury at the time of reperfusion and enhance organ viability, ultimately improving resuscitation and survival from cardiac arrest.

TI  - When I go in to wake them ... I wonder: Parental perceptions about congenital long QT syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS
AB  - Purpose: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) affects an estimated 1 in 5000 persons, is characterized by QT interval prolongation, and has a clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic longevity to sudden death in the young as the initial event. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of parents who have a child or children with LQTS. Information from parents of children with this diagnosis can provide insight to healthcare providers who care for these families.
   Data sources: The literature reveals that very little is known about the psychosocial aspects of this potential sudden death syndrome. This was a secondary analysis of a 2002 qualitative phenomenological primary study done to explore fear of death and quality of life for 58 patients with LQTS. The secondary study analyzed responses derived from 31 parents of children with LQTS.
   Conclusions: We speculated this far-reaching clinical spectrum would arouse fear and uncertainty for a parent of a child with LQTS. Results of the study revealed that parents with young children described fear of their children dying and strategies they used to manage their fear, as well as frustrations about lack of knowledge of LQTS among healthcare providers. When the diagnosis of LQTS is established during adolescence, the impact on the lives of children and their families is more significant.
   Implications for practice: In order to support families experiencing the stress of living daily with someone with LQTS, healthcare providers including nurse practitioners need a better understanding of the symptoms, diagnosis, management, and lifestyle implications of LQTS. Further studies are needed to understand the long-term psychosocial effects of children on beta-blockers, children with implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and children, adolescents, and young adults who survive a sudden death event.

TI  - Recent Advances in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Cardiocerebral Resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) is a new approach for resuscitation of patients with cardiac arrest. It is composed of 3 components: 1) continuous chest compressions for bystander resuscitation; 2) a new emergency medical services (EMS) algorithm; and 3) aggressive post-resuscitation care. The first 2 components of CCR were first instituted in 2003 in Tucson, Arizona; in 2004 in the Rock and Walworth counties of Wisconsin; and in 2005 in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The CCR method has been shown to dramatically improve survival in the subset of patients most likely to survive: those with witnessed arrest and shockable rhythm on arrival of EMS. The CCR method advocates continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilations for witnessed cardiac arrest. It advocates either prompt or delayed defibrillation, based on the 3-phase time-sensitive model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) articulated by Weisfeldt and Becker. For bystanders with access to automated external defibrillators and EMS personnel who arrive during the electrical phase (i.e., the first 4 or 5 min of VF arrest), the delivery of prompt defibrillator shock is recommended. However, EMS personnel most often arrive after the electrical phase-in the circulatory phase of VF arrest. During the circulatory phase of VF arrest, the fibrillating myocardium has used up much of its energy stores, and chest compressions that perfuse the heart are mandatory prior to and immediately after a defibrillator shock. Endotracheal intubation is delayed, excessive ventilations are avoided, and early-administration epinephrine is advocated.

TI  - Technological innovations in layperson CPR education - A scoping review
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: Rapid initiation of CPR is key for survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, making bystander CPR education a key part of the cardiac chain-of-survival. CPR classes continue to include new technologies that enable more widespread and high-fidelity training. We aimed to examine the landscape of technological innovations in layperson CPR training since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science from database inception to July 2024 for studies. We included articles with layperson CPR classes that included a technological advance, either in the equipment or mode of delivery of education. We focused on studies published after the start of 2020. Results: Out of 1070 studies screened, 50 met the selection criteria. The primary groups of technology found were extended reality (20), feedback devices (11), asynchronous video instruction (10), tele-education (5), and low-cost CPR manikins (4). These technologies show promise to offer comparable or improved effectiveness compared to traditional options. Several topics may warrant further investigation, such as cognitive load associated with extended reality, the practicality of student-created CPR training devices, and possible interactive effects between technologies. Conclusion: Future systematic reviews should evaluate the specific learning contexts for which these individual technologies, or combinations of these technologies, may be best suited to guide regulating bodies and CPR instructors in their pedagogical decisions.

TI  - First-in-man application of Liwen RF™ ablation system in the treatment of drug-resistant hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - ObjectivesThis study sought to evaluate the clinical applicability of the Liwen Liu RF (TM) ablation system for percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA). BackgroundData on new cardiac radiofrequency ablation devices for the treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) are limited. Materials and methodsFrom July 2019 to July 2020, a total of 68 patients with drug-resistant HOCM, who underwent PIMSRA with the Liwen RF (TM) ablation system, which has an ablation electrode of stepless adjustable length, were prospectively enrolled. Safety endpoints included, amongst others, the occurrence of pericardial effusion and/or hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmias, device failure and procedural death. The reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients at 12 months follow-up were used as a surrogate marker for device efficacy. ResultsAll procedures were technically successful. The total energy output time of the system was 75.8 (IQR: 30.0) min, and the average power was 43.61 +/- 13.34 watts. No ablation system error occurred. The incidence of pericardial effusion or hemorrhage, transient arrhythmia and resuscitation was 8.8, 39.7, and 1.5% during procedure, respectively. None of the patients died. During 30-day follow-up, there were no complications with the exception of a pericardial effusion in one patient (1.5%). No further complications were reported after 30 days. The patients' resting [baseline: 75 (IQR: 48) vs. 12-months: 12 (IQR: 19) mmHg, p < 0.001] and provoked [baseline: 122 (IQR: 53) vs. 12-months: 41 (IQR: 59) mmHg, p < 0.001] LVOT gradients decreased significantly during follow-up. ConclusionIn this study, we demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the Liwen RF (TM) ablation system to treat HOCM. The system allows for significant and sustainable LVOT gradient reduction during 12-months of follow-up. Hence, the Liwen RF (TM) ablation system is a promising new device that has the potential to become an alternative to existing septal reduction concepts in HOCM patients.

TI  - Measuring cognitively demanding activities in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - ADVANCES IN SIMULATION
AB  - BackgroundThis methodological intersection article demonstrates a method to measure cognitive load in clinical simulations. Researchers have hypothesized that high levels of cognitive load reduce performance and increase errors. This phenomenon has been studied primarily by experimental designs that measure responses to predetermined stimuli and self-reports that reduce the experience to a summative value. Our goal was to develop a method to identify clinical activities with high cognitive burden using physiologic measures.MethodsTeams of emergency medical responders were recruited from local fire departments to participate in a scenario with a shockable pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) patient. The scenario was standardized with the patient being resuscitated after receiving high-quality CPR and 3 defibrillations. Each team had a person in charge (PIC) who wore a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device that recorded changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration in their prefrontal cortex (PFC), which was interpreted as cognitive activity.We developed a data processing pipeline to remove nonneural noise (e.g., motion artifacts, heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure) and detect statistically significant changes in cognitive activity. Two researchers independently watched videos and coded clinical tasks corresponding to detected events. Disagreements were resolved through consensus, and results were validated by clinicians.MethodsTeams of emergency medical responders were recruited from local fire departments to participate in a scenario with a shockable pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) patient.

Participants arrived in teams of 4 to 7 members, including one PIC. We recorded the PIC's fNIRS signals and identified 173 events associated with increased cognitive activity. [Defibrillation] (N = 34); [medication] dosing (N = 33); and [rhythm checks] (N = 28) coincided most frequently with detected elevations in cognitive activity. [Defibrillations] had affinity with the right PFC, while [medication] dosing and [rhythm checks] had affinity with the left PFC.ConclusionsFNIRS is a promising tool for physiologically measuring cognitive load. We describe a novel approach to scan the signal for statistically significant events with no a priori assumptions of when they occur. The events corresponded to key resuscitation tasks and appeared to be specific to the type of task based on activated regions in the PFC. Identifying and understanding the clinical tasks that require high cognitive load can suggest targets for interventions to decrease cognitive load and errors in care.

TI  - Combination of Multidisciplinary Therapies Successfully Treated Refractory Ventricular Arrhythmia in a STEMI Patient: Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to loss of cardiac function and sudden cardiac death. The most common cause of VF is ischemic cardiomyopathy, especially in the context of an acute coronary event. Prompt treatment with resuscitation and defibrillation can be lifesaving. Refractory VF, or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT), refers to cases that do not respond to traditional advanced cardiac life-support (ACLS) measures, and it has a low survival rate. Some new life-saving interventions and novel techniques have been proposed as viable treatment options for patients presenting with refractory VF/pVT out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; these include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), esmolol, stellate ganglion block (SGB), and double sequential defibrillation (DSD). Recently, DSD has been discussed and used more frequently, but its survival rate is still not promising. We report a case of refractory VF caused by acute myocardial infarction that was treated with ACLS, DSD, ECMO, and cardiac catheterization in sequence, with a successful outcome.

TI  - An intervention for cardiac arrest survivors with chronic fatigue: A feasibility study with preliminary outcomes
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The primary aim was to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants for an Energy Conservation + Problem Solving Therapy (EC + PST) intervention delivered over the telephone, to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention, and to assess the appropriateness of the outcome measures. The secondary aim was to evaluate the preliminary intervention effect on fatigue impact, activity performance, and participation in daily activities in post-cardiac arrest (CA) adults with chronic fatigue.
   Methods: This feasibility study used a prospective, pre-post experimental design. Individuals who were at least 3 months post-CA with moderate-to-severe fatigue were eligible to participate. By participating in EC + PST intervention sessions, participants learned how to apply EC strategies to solve their fatigue related problems. Participants were assessed before and after completing the intervention using outcome measures assessing fatigue, activity performance, and participation in daily activities.
   Results: Eighteen CA survivors with chronic fatigue successfully completed the intervention and the assessments with high satisfaction. We observed a 15% recruitment rate and ceiling effects on two outcome measures of perceived-performance in daily activities. Significant decreases in the impact of physical (p = .001) and cognitive (p = .006) fatigue of CA survivors were observed with small to moderate effect sizes of r = 0.23-0.25 after receiving the EC + PST intervention.
   Conclusion: The delivery of EC + PST intervention over the telephone is feasible, and the intervention is highly acceptable to CA survivors with chronic fatigue. Also, the EC + PST intervention seems promising in reducing the impact of physical and cognitive fatigue of CA survivors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acute gastric dilatation after excessive consumption of traditional Chinese medicine: a case report
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction Acute gastric dilatation (AGD) is a rare but clinically significant condition characterized by abnormal enlargement of the stomach. It can lead to serious complications such as gastric necrosis, perforation, and respiratory failure if not promptly managed. AGD has been associated with mechanical obstructions, binge eating, and systemic conditions like diabetes mellitus. However, AGD induced by excessive consumption of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has not been previously reported.Patient concerns A 40-year-old male with a history of chronic dyspepsia presented to the emergency department with recurrent vomiting. Over the 3 days prior to admission, he self-reported consuming approximately 3.5 liters of TCM liquid (about 1.1-1.3 liters per day). This attempt to alleviate his chronic dyspepsia symptoms failed to show the expected therapeutic effect. The patient denied experiencing headache, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.Diagnosis Abdominal CT revealed significant gastric distension, and subsequent endoscopy showed pyloric ulcer with stenosis, gastric retention, chronic atrophic gastritis, and a relaxed cardia. Laboratory investigations indicated metabolic alkalosis, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of tissue hypoxia.Interventions The patient was immediately managed with nasogastric tube decompression, anti-infection therapy, gastric mucosal protection, fluid resuscitation, parenteral nutritional support, fasting, and gastrointestinal decompression.Outcomes The patient's symptoms and signs notably improved after these interventions. A follow-up CT scan demonstrated improved gastric dilation. At a 4-week follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of vomiting and resumed normal oral intake. Repeat endoscopy showed healed pyloric ulcers and improved gastric motility. No adverse events (e.g., rehospitalization or medication intolerance) were reported during a 3-month follow-up period.Conclusion This case highlights the necessity of including AGD in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with frequent vomiting after excessive consumption of TCM. It underscores the importance of thorough evaluation to prevent misdiagnosis and severe complications. The case also emphasizes the need for caution when using TCM, especially in patients with organic lesions or pyloric obstruction.

TI  - Cerebral resuscitation: state of the art, experimental approaches and clinical perspectives
T2  - NEUROLOGIC CLINICS
AB  - Neuronal injury following global cerebral ischemia continues to be a central problem of patients in the postresuscitation phase following cardiocirculatory arrest. In addition to measures focusing on rapid restoration of spontaneous circulation, the most effective treatment after cardiac arrest, as shown by large randomized trials, is the use of therapeutic mild hypothermia. Current guidelines of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) are recommending the use of therapeutic mild hypothermia for all unconscious patients after cardiac arrest. At present there is no specific neuroprotective treatment available. Promising animal experimental data concerning the use of thrombolytic agents during cardiopulmonary resuscitation have led to a large European multicenter trial (TROICA trial) that will provide its data in 2006.

TI  - ECMO-facilitated rapid and deep hypothermia reduces brain injury on MRI following prolonged cardiac arrest in a translational swine model
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Introduction: Neuroprotective interventions after cardiac arrest are essential but largely lack evidence of efficacy. Early therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the only intervention that has shown promise in humans. However, despite a consistent signal for efficacy in animal models, conflicting clinical data hamper clinical acceptance. Two potential causes for the lack of translation from animal studies to humans are the time to achieve target temperature in humans and the inability to cool to deep hypothermic states due to the inherent detrimental cardiac effects accompanying deep hypothermia. Given the observed inconsistent impact of TH on human patients with cardiac arrest despite animal data, we developed a perfusion-controlled, translational swine model to quantify the effects of rapid deep TH on HIBI, quantifying severity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at a controlled time threshold. Methods: Ten swine underwent cardiac arrest with 20 min of "no-flow" state, followed by resuscitation and controlled reperfusion using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Animals were randomized to either control (normal temperature reperfusion) or rapid hypothermic reperfusion (RHR) (29 degrees C through ECMO-facilitated cooling). All swine underwent brain MRI with Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) before cardiac arrest and then 2 h after ECMO reperfusion. Whole-brain gray and white matter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared pre- and post-ECMO cannulation and arrest in all animals. Results: At 45 min post-reperfusion, the mean temperature for RHR animals was 30.4 degrees C (95 % CI 29.6-31.1 degrees C), while for control animals it was 35.7 degrees C (95 % CI 34.9-36.5 degrees C, p < 0.0001). Whole brain ADC in RHR swine increased by a mean of 1.36 +/- 4.09 %, while in control swine it decreased by a mean of 4.36 +/- 4.50 % (Median difference of -5.91, 95 %CI -12.13 to -0.15; P value = 0.047). Discussion: Swine with induced cardiac arrest who underwent rapid ECMO-mediated cooling post-arrest had less cerebral hypoxic cellular injury, as quantified by changes on MRI DWI, than controls. These findings support the protective effect on neurologic injury of a rapid and brief period of induced deep hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Compared to prior translational models, our use of ECMO has the advantage of an ability to control important factors such as no-flow ischemic time and variability in post-arrest cardiac output as well as to mitigate complications of cardiac dysrhythmias that tend to arise from deep hypothermia. This portends a greater promise for translational success of ECMO-facilitated rapid cooling and potentially other ECMO-mediated models of cardiac arrest than experienced by previous attempts.

TI  - Salvage techniques in traumatic cardiac arrest: thoracotomy, extracorporeal life support, and therapeutic hypothermia
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review Survival from traumatic cardiac arrest is associated with a very high mortality despite aggressive resuscitation including an Emergency Department thoracotomy (EDT). Novel salvage techniques are needed to improve these outcomes.
   Recent findings More aggressive out-of-hospital interventions, such as chest decompression or thoracotomy by emergency physicians or anesthesiologists, seem feasible and show some promise for improving outcomes. For trauma patients who suffer severe respiratory failure or refractory cardiac arrest, there seems to be an increasing role for the use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS), utilizing heparin-bonded systems to avoid systemic anticoagulation. The development of exposure hypothermia is associated with poor outcomes in trauma patients, but preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that mild, therapeutic hypothermia (34 degrees C) improves survival from severe hemorrhagic shock. Sufficient data exist to justify a clinical trial. For patients who suffer a cardiac arrest refractory to EDT, induction of emergency preservation and resuscitation by rapid cooling to a tympanic membrane temperature of 10 degrees C may preserve vital organs long enough to allow surgical hemostasis, followed by resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Summary Salvage techniques, such as earlier thoracotomy, ECLS, and hypothermia, may allow survival from otherwise lethal injuries.

TI  - Use of a Visual Aid to Improve Counseling at the Threshold of Viability
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To pilot-test a visual aid developed to help counsel pregnant women.
   METHODS: After agreeing to participate, pregnant women at >28 weeks of gestation were assigned randomly to counseling with or without a visual aid. The visual aid contained pictures, graphics, and short messages about delivery room resuscitation, chances of survival, anticipated neonatal course, and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities. A neonatal fellow performed counseling with a standardized script for an anticipated delivery at 23 weeks of gestation. In precounseling and postcounseling sessions, women were given a structured interview to assess their knowledge of chances of survival and disability and attitudes toward resuscitation.
   RESULTS: Of the 89 women who participated, 76% were black and 59% read below a 9th-grade level. Compared with the no-visual aid group, women in the visual aid group recalled more disabilities and predicted longer neonatal stays (P = .01). For both groups, mothers' perceptions of the chances of survival were lower after counseling; the decrease was greater in the visual aid group (P = .03). The majority of women in each group opted for resuscitation, which was not affected by counseling. In multivariate analyses, use of the visual aid was a significant independent factor in explaining before/after differences in survival chances and recall of a long NICU stay and number of disabilities; higher literacy levels also were significant for recalling the number of disabilities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of a visual aid improved mothers' knowledge and showed promise as a decision aid for counseling at the threshold of viability. Pediatrics 2011;128:e1511-e1519

TI  - BYSTANDER CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION - IS VENTILATION NECESSARY
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background. Prompt initiation of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves survival. Basic life support with mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions is intimidating, difficult to remember, and difficult to perform. Chest compressions alone can be easily taught, easily remembered, easily performed, adequately taught by dispatcher-delivered telephone instruction, and more readily accepted by the public. The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the need for ventilation during CPR in a clinically relevant swine model of prehospital witnessed cardiac arrest.
   Methods and Results. Thirty seconds after ventricular fibrillation, swine were randomly assigned to 12 minutes of chest compressions plus mechanical ventilation (group A), chest compressions only (group B), or no CPR (group C). Standard advanced cardiac life support was then provided. Animals successfully resuscitated were supported for 2 hours in an intensive care setting, and then observed for 24 hours. All 16 swine in groups A and B were successfully resuscitated and neurologically normal at 24 hours, whereas only 2 of 8 group C animals survived for 24 hours (P<.001, Fisher's exact test). One of the 2 group C survivors was comatose and unresponsive.
   Conclusions. In this swine model of witnessed prehospital cardiac arrest, the survival and neurological outcome data establish that prompt initiation of chest compressions alone appears to be as effective as chest compressions plus ventilation and that both techniques of bystander CPR markedly improve outcome compared with no bystander CPR.

TI  - The Design of an Adaptive Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a promising therapy for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that is refractory to standard therapy, but no multicenter randomized clinical trials have been conducted to establish its efficacy. We report the design and operating characteristics of a proposed randomized Bayesian adaptive "enrichment" clinical trial designed to determine whether ECPR is effective for refractory OHCA and, if effective, to define the interval after arrest during which patients derive benefit.
   METHODS: Through iterative trial simulation and trial design modification, we developed a Bayesian adaptive trial of ECPR for adults who experience non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Our proposed trial design addresses the threats to trial success identified during the design process, which were (1) the uncertainty surrounding the cardiac arrest (CA)-to-ECPR interval within which clinical benefit might be preserved (2) the difference in prognosis between patients with an initial rhythm that is non-shockable vs. shockable. Trial subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either standard care or expedited transport to a hospital for potential ECPR. The CA-to-ECPR interval will be estimated in real time based on the sum of the estimated paramedic response time (911 call to scene arrival), paramedic scene time, and transport time to hospital. A Bayesian decreasing step function will be used to estimate the efficacy of the treatment with an outcome of the 90-day utility-weighted Modified Rankin Scale (uwmRS) for each rhythm subgroup and estimated CA-to-ECPR interval at pre-specified interims. The trial will adaptively lengthen the estimated CA-to-ECPR eligibility window if the treatment appears effective at the upper limit of initial eligibility window. If ECPR appears ineffective at longer estimated CA-to-ECPR intervals, the upper limit of the window for enrollment eligibility will be shortened. The analysis will be stratified by rhythm subgroup.
   RESULTS: With a maximum total sample size of 400, and a cap on the maximum sample size of 300 for the non-shockable rhythm subgroup, the trial design has power ranging from 91-100% to detect a benefit from ECPR for non-shockable rhythms under the various efficacy scenarios simulated and power ranging from 69-98% for shockable rhythms under the same scenarios. The trial design also has a high probability of correctly identifying the maximum CA-to-ECPR interval within which ECPR produces a clinically significant benefit of 0.2 on the uwMRS. If ECPR is equivalent to standard CA care, the type I error is 2.5% with a 99% probability of stopping enrollment early for futility in the non-shockable subgroup and a 97% probability of stopping enrollment early for futility in the shockable subgroup.
   CONCLUSION: This proposed adaptive trial design helps to ensure the population of patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment-as defined both by rhythm subgroup and estimated CA-to-ECPR interval-is enrolled. The design promotes early termination of the trial if continuation is likely to be futile.

TI  - Significance of ventilation during lay person resuscitation. Confirmation of the validity of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines 2005
T2  - NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN
AB  - The latest scientific advisory note of the American Heart Association (AHA), which was published online-first on March 31 2008, includes a call to action for bystanders witnessing an adult out-of-hospital sudden collapse probably of cardiac origin, and who are not or not sufficiently trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), to provide chest compression alone without ventilation (so-called compression-only CPR). Both the German Resuscitation Council (GRC) as well as the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) do not see any need for change or amendment of the actual ERC Resuscitation Guidelines in Adult Basic Life Support: "Laypeople should be encouraged to perform compression-only CPR if they are unable or unwilling to provide rescue breaths". This statement is already included in the official Resuscitation Guidelines published by the ERC in November 2005. Bystanders, who have been trained and are confident with CPR, however, should perform resuscitation applying chest compression-ventilation until arrival of the emergency team. The training of young lay rescuers and the establishment of training programs through emergency medical organisations and in schools should be substantially promoted.

TI  - Myocardial Infarction in Neonates: A Review of an Entity with Significant Morbidity and Mortality
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Coronary artery disease is a global problem with high mortality rates and significant residual sequelae that affect long-term quality of life. Myocardial infarction (MI) in neonates is a recognized, uncommon entity, but the incidence and broad spectrum of the disease is unknown and likely underestimated due to limited reporting which in the majority is confined to acute ischemic events. The challenges involve clinical diagnosis which masquerades in the early phase as non-specific symptoms and signs that are commonly found in a host of neonatal disorders. Precise diagnostic criteria for neonatal MI are lacking, and management is driven by clinical presentation and hemodynamic stabilization rather than an attempt to rapidly establish the root cause of the condition. We conducted a review of the published reports of neonatal MI from 2000 to 2014, to establish an approach to the diagnosis and management based on the existing evidence. The overall evidence from 32 scientific articles stemmed from case reports and case series which were graded as low-to-very low quality. Neonatal MI resembles childhood and adult MI with features that involve characteristic ECG changes, raised biomarkers, and diagnostic imaging, but with lack of robust, standardized criteria to facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention. The mortality rate of neonatal MI ranges from 40 to 50% based on inclusion criteria, but the short-term data reflect normal quality of life in survivors. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of neonatal MI may optimize outcomes, but at the present time is based on limited evidence. Well-designed clinical studies focusing on the definition, diagnosis, and management of neonatal MI, backed by international consensus guidelines, are needed to alter the prognosis of this serious condition.

A1  - PC4 CAP Collaborators
TI  - Preventing Cardiac Arrest in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Through Multicenter Collaboration
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
AB  - IMPORTANCE Preventing in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) likely represents an effective strategy to improve outcomes for critically ill patients, but feasibility of IHCA prevention remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether a low-technology cardiac arrest prevention (CAP) practice bundle decreases IHCA rate.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) teams from the Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium (PC4) formed a collaborative learning network to implement the CAP bundle consistent with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement framework; 15 hospitals implemented the bundle voluntarily. Risk-adjusted IHCA incidence rates were analyzed across 2 time periods, 12 months (baseline) and 18 months after CAP implementation (intervention) using difference-in-differences (DID) regression to compare 15 CAP and 16 control PC4 hospitals that chose not to participate in CAP but had IHCA rates tracked in the PC4 registry. Patients deemed at high risk for IHCA, based on a priori evidence-based criteria and empirical hospital-specific criteria, were selected to receive the CAP bundle. Data were collected from July 2018 to December 2019, and data were analyzed from March to August 2020.
   INTERVENTIONS CAP bundle included 5 elements developed to promote increased situational awareness and communication among bedside clinicians to recognize and mitigate deterioration in high-risk patients.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk-adjusted IHCA incidence rate across all CICU admissions (IHCA events divided by all admissions).
   RESULTS The bundle was activated in 2664 of 10 510 CAP hospital admissions (25.3%); admission characteristics were similar across study periods. There was a 30% relative reduction in risk-adjusted IHCA incidence rate at CAP hospitals (intervention period: 2.6%; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9; baseline: 3.7%; 95% CI, 3.1-4.0), but no change at control hospitals (intervention period: 2.7%; 95% CI, 2.3-2.9; baseline: 2.7%; 95% CI, 2.2-3.0). DID analysis confirmed significantly reduced odds of IHCA among all admissions at CAP hospitals compared with control hospitals during the intervention period vs baseline (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91; P =.01). DID odds ratios were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.98) for the surgical subgroup, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.48-1.14) for the medical subgroup, and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.50-1.03) for the high-risk admission subgroup at CAP hospitals after intervention. All-cause risk-adjusted mortality rate did not change after intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Implementation of this CAP bundle led to significant IHCA reduction across multiple pediatric CICUs. Future studiesmay determine if this bundle can be effective in other critically ill populations.

T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
AB  - Cardiovascular mortality has declined significantly in recent years, however, sudden cardiac death remains the leading cause of death in a range of different mortality indicators, very often caused by cardiac arrhythmias. The electrophysiological causes of sudden cardiac death include ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole and pulseless electrical activity. In addition, other cardiac arrhythmias may also trigger sudden cardiac death, periarrest arrhytmias. The rapid and accurate recognition of the various arrhythmias and their appropriate management are major challenges at both prehospital and hospital care levels. In these conditions, prompt recognition of life-threatening conditions, rapid response and proper treatment are critical. This publication reviews the various device and drug treatment modalities for the management of periarrest arrythmic conditions in the light of the 2021 guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council. This article highlights the epidemiology and aetiology of periarrest arrythmic states, and outlines the state-of-the-art treatment options for various tachy- and bradyarrhythmias, providing guidance in the management of these conditions both in hospital and out-of-hospital settings.

TI  - Sacubitril/Valsartan Improves Cardiac Function in Dialysis Patients
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Heart failure (HF) is characterized by the activation of adverse neurohormonal systems and a high mortality rate. Noteworthy, HF is a well-known complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), where dialysis patients are seven to eight times more likely to encounter cardiac arrest than the general population. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient treatments to improve cardiac function in dialysis patients and eventually reduce the cardiovascular death toll. Sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) is a dual inhibitor/blocker of the neprilysin and angiotensin II receptors, which exert cardioprotective effects among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF). Unfortunately, the drug is not approved for subjects with advanced CKD or dialysis patients due to safety concerns. The current study examined the cardiac effects of Sac/Val in HD patients. Administration of Sac/Val (100-400 mg/day) to 12 hemodialysis (HD) patients with HFrEF for six months gradually improved ejection fraction (EF) independently of morphological changes in cardiac geometry, as assessed by echocardiography (ECHO), and hemodynamic alterations. Interestingly, the Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (Kansas City KCCQ-12) revealed that quality of life significantly improved after Sac/Val treatment. No major adverse effects were reported in the present study, supporting the safety of Sac/Val at least in these patients and for the applied follow-up period. Collectively, these findings support the use of Sac/Val as a cardioprotective agent in both HD and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Yet, a more comprehensive study is required to establish these findings and to extend the follow-up period for 12 months in order to solidify these encouraging results.

A1  - Valsartan Heart Failure Trial Inve
TI  - A randomized trial of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan in chronic heart failure
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure.
   Methods: A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours.
   Results: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure: 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P<0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P<0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs.
   Conclusions: Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.

TI  - Therapeutic Hypothermia May Improve Neurological Outcomes in Extracorporeal Life Support for Adult Cardiac Arrest
T2  - HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION
AB  - Background Limited data exists on patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia during extracorporeal life support (ECLS). We investigated outcomes and prognostic factors in these patients.
   Methods A retrospective review was conducted for 225 consecutive adult patients treated with ECLS between July 2003 and January 2016. Extracorporeal life support was initiated for refractory cardiac arrest (>10 mins) in 79 patients (35.1%). Patient demographics, ECLS-related complications, in-hospital mortality and neurological outcomes were analysed.
   Results The mean age was 49.9 +/- 12.4 years. Sixty-two patients (78.5%) were male. The mean duration of CPR and ECLS were respectively, 32.0 +/- 23.3 mins and 5.4 +/- 4.0 days. Therapeutic hypothermia (34 degrees C) was maintained for 24 hours in 14 patients (17.7%). Thirty-five patients (44.3%) were weaned off ECLS. Twenty-one patients (26.6%) survived to hospital discharge with 16 (20.3%) recovering good neurological function. Compared to ECLS at normothermia, neurologically favourable survival was higher in the hypothermia group (42.9% vs 15.4%, p= 0.020). Multivariable analysis identified a non-shockable rhythm [ odds ratio (OR) 5.1, confidence interval (CI) 1.5-16.8], ischaemic hepatitis (OR 6.2, CI 1.1-33.6) and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (OR 5.1, CI 1.5-17.1) as predictors of in-hospital mortality. Therapeutic hypothermia (OR 4.9, CI 1.2-20.4) and acute renal failure (OR 0.19, CI 0.05-0.70) were predictors of neurologically favourable survival.
   Conclusions In this report of patients treated with ECLS, in-hospital survival and survival with good neurological performance were 26.6% and 20.3% respectively. Anon-shockable rhythm, ischaemic hepatitis and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy were predictors of in-hospital mortality. Therapeutic hypothermia during ECLS was associated with improved neurological outcomes.

TI  - Outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in intensive care units in a university hospital
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the demographic characteristics of patients who suffered cardiac arrest in our intensive care units (ICUs) as well. as to identify those factors influencing outcome after resuscitation following cardiac arrest.
   Methods: We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in our ICUs at the Georg-August University Hospital, Goettingen, Germany, from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2003.
   Results: One hundred and sixty-nine patients underwent CPR. Severity of illness assessed by SAPS 11 score on admission was 51.8 +/- 18.5 (predicted mortality 46.6%). The initially monitored rhythm at the time of arrest was asystote in 51 (30.2%) patients. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) was recorded in 65 (38.5%) and pulseless electrical activity in 49 (29.0%) patients. Twenty (23.8%), 28 (33.3%) and 33 (39.3%) patients with initially recorded asystote, VT/VF and putseless electrical activity (PEA) rhythms, respectively, survived to ICU discharge. Eighty of the 169 patients survived to hospital discharge giving a survival rate of 47.3%. The highest ICU mortality was seen in patients admitted for neurosurgery (80%) followed by major vascular surgery (77.8%), non-surgical patients (67.4%) and patients with severe sepsis (66.7%). The occurrence of cardiac arrest within the first 24 h was associated with a significantly lower ICU mortality compared to a later incident. At hospital discharge 66 patients (82.5% of the survivors) achieved good cerebral recovery, 12 patients (15.0%) were severely disabled (CPC 3) while 2 (2.5%) remained unconscious.
   Conclusion: Several factors affect the outcome from CPR. However, quicker triage to ICU, closer monitoring along with prompt intervention might minimise the consequences of cardiac arrest and its complications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploration of the impact of a voice activated decision support system (VADSS) with video on resuscitation performance by lay rescuers during simulated cardiopulmonary arrest
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Aim To assess whether access to a voice activated decision support system (VADSS) containing video clips demonstrating resuscitation manoeuvres was associated with increased compliance with American Heart Association Basic Life Support (AHA BLS) guidelines.
   Methods This was a prospective, randomised controlled trial. Subjects with no recent clinical experience were randomised to the VADSS or control group and participated in a 5-min simulated out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest with another 'bystander'. Data on performance for predefined outcome measures based on the AHA BLS guidelines were abstracted from videos and the simulator log.
   Results 31 subjects were enrolled (VADSS 16 vs control 15), with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Study subjects in the VADSS were more likely to direct the bystander to: (1) perform compressions to ventilations at the correct ratio of 30: 2 (VADSS 15/16 (94%) vs control 4/15 (27%), p=<0.001) and (2) insist the bystander switch compressor versus ventilator roles after 2 min (VADSS 12/16 (75%) vs control 2/15 (13%), p=0.001). The VADSS group took longer to initiate chest compressions than the control group: VADSS 159.5 (+/- 53) s versus control 78.2 (+/- 20) s, p<0.001. Mean no-flow fractions were very high in both groups: VADSS 72.2% (+/- 0.1) versus control 75.4 (+/- 8.0), p=0.35.
   Conclusions The use of an audio and video assisted decision support system during a simulated out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest prompted lay rescuers to follow cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines but was also associated with an unacceptable delay to starting chest compressions. Future studies should explore: (1) if video is synergistic to audio prompts, (2) how mobile technologies may be leveraged to spread CPR decision support and (3) usability testing to avoid unintended consequences.

TI  - "Resuscitation" of marginal liver allografts for transplantation with machine perfusion technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
AB  - As the rate of medically suitable donors remains relatively static worldwide, clinicians have looked to novel methods to meet the ever-growing demand of the liver transplant waiting lists worldwide. Accordingly, the transplant community has explored many strategies to offset this deficit. Advances in technology that target the ex vivo "preservation" period may help increase the donor pool by augmenting the utilization and improving the outcomes of marginal livers. Novel ex vivo techniques such as hypothermic, normothermic, and subnormothermic machine perfusion may be useful to "resuscitate" marginal organs by reducing ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, other preservation techniques such as oxygen persufflation are explored as they may also have a role in improving function of "marginal" liver allografts. Currently, marginal livers are frequently discarded or can relegate the patient to early allograft dysfunction and primary non-function. Bench to bedside advances are rapidly emerging and hold promise for expanding liver transplantation access and improving outcomes. (C) 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

TI  - RISK STRATIFICATION OF THE POTENTIALLY SEPTIC PATIENT IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: THE MORTALITY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SEPSIS (MEDS) SCORE
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The prompt recognition and management of septic patients remains a challenge within the busy Emergency Department (ED). Prognostic screening aids have traditionally required time-delayed laboratory measurements not validated upon the emergency medicine population. Recently, a brief prognostic tool has been derived and subsequently validated in heterogeneous ED populations. Clinical Question: Can a risk-stratification tool predict 1-month mortality in ED patients with suspected infection? Evidence Review: Six studies evaluating the Mortality in the Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score were identified and evaluated. Results: Higher MEDS scores are associated with increasing mortality. MEDS score's short- and long-term prognostic accuracy is superior to other sepsis scales as well as isolated biomarkers C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. MEDS' prognostic accuracy in severe sepsis is inferior to undifferentiated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients. Conclusion: The MEDS score is an accurate and reliable prognostic tool for 28-day mortality in ED SIRS patients, but may not be optimal for those with severe sepsis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cooling in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: practices and opinions on minimum standards in the state of California
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although hospitals increasingly offer therapeutic hypothermia (TH), there is variable implementation of related services. We assessed current practices and opinions regarding what services should be required of centers providing TH in California.
   STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed neonatal intensive care unit physicians statewide regarding practices and opinions about services related to TH.
   RESULTS: Of the 50 participating centers (47% response rate), 66% offer TH. Most TH centers reported using: an evidence-based protocol (92%), neurology consultation (92%), amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) or EEG (88%), magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) interpreted by pediatric neuroradiologists (71%) and developmental follow-up (93%). TH centers reported treating a median of 11 patients annually (interquartile range (IQR) 4 to 24). Respondents considered it 'critical' that TH centers offer: aEEG monitoring (70%), MRI (69%), occupational and physical therapy (67%) and developmental follow-up (94%). Over 70% thought TH centers should treat a minimum volume annually (median = 10, IQR 5 to 12).
   CONCLUSION: Physicians across practice settings in California endorsed minimum standards for TH centers to promote quality of care.

TI  - Sensor technologies to detect out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review of diagnostic test performance
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the cessation of circulation to vital organs that can only be reversed with rapid and appropriate interventions. Sensor technologies for early detection and activation of the emergency medical system could enable rapid response to CA and increase the probability of survival. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the literature surrounding the performance of sensor technologies in detecting OHCA.
   Methods: We searched the academic and grey literature using keywords related to cardiac arrest, sensor technologies, and recognition/detection. We included English articles published up until June 6, 2022, including investigations and patent filings that reported the sensitivity and specificity of sensor technologies to detect cardiac arrest on human or animal subjects. (Prospero# CRD42021267797).
   Results: We screened 1666 articles and included four publications examining sensor technologies. One tested the performance of a physical sensor on human participants in simulated CA, one tested performance on audio recordings of patients in cardiac arrest, and two utilized a hybrid design for testing including human participants and ECG databases. Three of the devices were wearable and one was an audio detection algorithm utilizing household smart technologies. Real-world testing was limited in all studies. Sensitivity and specificity for the sensors ranged from 97.2 to 100% and 90.3 to 99.9%, respectively. All included studies had a medium/high risk of bias, with 2/4 having a high risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Sensor technologies show promise for cardiac arrest detection. However, current evidence is sparse and of high risk of bias. Small sample sizes and databases with low external validity limit the generalizability of findings.

TI  - Time accuracy of a barcode system for recording resuscitation events: laboratory trials
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Barcode systems for recording clinical data from resuscitation attempts offer the prospect of more complete and time-accurate data collection; in addition, collection of data in digital form and the resulting ease of computer processing promises to facilitate data analysis for quality improvement and research. We conducted trials of such a barcode system, recording events during a videotaped, simulated in-hospital resuscitation, with particular attention to time accuracy. Methods: Nine subjects watched a videotape of a simulated cardiac resuscitation, recording events first with the barcode system and then with a conventional handwritten form. Recorded times were compared to an accurate record of events (gold standard) from the videotape. Results: Mean absolute errors and standard deviations of errors from the gold standard were significantly smaller with the barcode system (P < 0.01 for both). Numbers of event omissions did not differ significantly. Conclusion: The barcode system is more accurate than conventional handwritten recording in capturing event times from a simulated resuscitation. The system shows promise as a means to improve time accuracy of resuscitation records. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hospital readmission in patients treated with tiered-therapy implantable defibrillators
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background We wished to determine the incidence, reasons, casts, and predictors of cardiac-related hospital readmission in patients with tiered-therapy implantable defibrillators. Hospital readmission in patients with defibrillators reduces their quality of life and increases the cost associated with such therapy.
   Methods and Results We retrospectively studied 65 consecutive local patients (median age, 67 years; median ejection fraction, 0.34) who underwent tiered-therapy defibrillator implantation at this institution. Patients were followed for a median of 19 months (interquartile range, 10 to 27 months). The cause, duration, costs, and predictors of cardiac-related rehospitalizations were analyzed. There were 76 cardiac admissions for 34 patients. The rate of cardiac-related hospital readmission was 0.72 per patient-year of follow-up. Arrhythmia-related admissions accounted for 33 of such admissions in 23 patients. Actuarial freedom from cardiac-related admissions was 0.57 and 0.40 at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The median length of stay for hospital readmissions was 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 8 days). The median cost per admission was $5842 (interquartile range, $3549 to $12 170). The time to first readmission and the total rehospitalization time per year of follow-up were associated with a poor preimplant New York Heart Association functional class. Readmission for cardiac arrhythmias was nor predicted by clinical parameters.
   Conclusions Rehospitalization For cardiac reasons is common in patients receiving implantable defibrillators and is responsible for substantial resource consumption. The need for readmission for arrhythmia-related reasons cannot be predicted by clinical parameters at the time of device implantation.

TI  - Risk factors for complete recovery of adults after weaning from veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory failure: an analysis from adult patients in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB  - Background As extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been widely used, the patient quality of life following ECMO termination has become an important issue as same as the patient's survival. To date, the factors affecting complete recovery of adult survivors from ECMO have not been investigated. Methods Data from adult patients in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry who received veno-venous ECMO between 2012 and 2017 were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results In total, 6536 patients with 242,183 days of veno-venous ECMO were reviewed. The overall survival to discharge rate after weaning from ECMO was 89.7% (n= 5861), and 10.3% (n= 675) of the patients died during hospitalization. The discharge location varied as follows: 33.7% (n= 1976) returned home, 23.4% (n= 1369) were transferred to a referral hospital, 41.8% (n= 2447) required hospital services, and 0.6% (n= 36) were discharged to other places. The patients were divided into two groups according to the discharge location: a complete recovery group (n= 1976) and a partial recovery group (n= 3885). In the multivariate analyses, age (>= 65 years) (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.87,p= 0.001), cardiac arrest before ECMO (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96,p= 0.021), vasopressor use (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.83,p< 0.001), renal replacement therapy (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28-0.57,p< 0.001), ECMO-related complications (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.85,p< 0.001), and long-term ECMO support (>= 2 weeks) (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37-0.48,p< 0.001) were significantly associated with complete recovery. Conclusion Complete recovery after veno-venous ECMO support is associated with the patient's baseline condition, ECMO duration, and ECMO-related complications. Respiratory ECMO should aim to increase both the survival and the quality of life after weaning from ECMO.

TI  - Contracting, prompting and reinforcing substance use disorder continuing care
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
AB  - The contracting, prompting and reinforcing (CPR) aftercare intervention has improved treatment adherence and outcomes in a number of clinical trials. In multisite randomized clinical trial 92 graduates of two intensive substance use disorder programs who received CPR were compared to 91 who received standard treatment (STX). The CPR group evidenced increased frequency of aftercare group therapy attendance and near significant findings suggested that more CPR than STX participants completed 3 months (76 vs. 64%), 6 months (48 vs. 35%), and 9 months (35 vs. 22%) of aftercare. However, the groups did not differ on the majority of attendance measures and had similar abstinence rates at the 3-month (67% CPR vs. 71% STX), 6-month (52% CPR vs. 51% SDC), and 12-month (the primary outcome measure; 48% CPR vs. 49% STX) follow-up points. Exploratory analyses suggest that CPR might be more effective among participants not required to attend aftercare. The incremental capital and labor cost of CPR compared to STX was $98.25 per participant (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pre-Hospital Discharge Testing of Defibrillator Without Anesthesia: Effects on Psychological Symptoms During Clinical Follow-Up
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: After the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), patients often fear therapeutic shock. The extent to which the experience of preYhospital discharge (PHD) testing without anesthesia after ICD implantation, under observation by a physician, affects shock-related anxiety symptoms on follow-up has not been investigated as yet. Methods: In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, 44 patients with a primary prevention indication for an ICD were randomly assigned to experience PHD testing without anesthesia (n = 23) or with anesthesia (n = 21). Patients were longitudinally evaluated before (T-1), shortly after (T-2), and 3 months after (T-3) PHD testing. During the respective PHD testings, the course of patients' serum cortisol release was measured. Results: During PHD testing, patients without anesthesia showed a significantly higher serum cortisol release than patients with anesthesia (F(4,152) = 22.227, p < .001). Patients who experienced PHD testing without anesthesia felt significantly safer with the ICD (U = 165.000, p = .040), would significantly more often recommend other patients to undergo PHD testing without anesthesia (chi(2) = 12.013, p = .002), and showed significantly lower levels of general shock-related anxiety shortly afterward (F(1,42) = 6.327, p = .02) and 3 months after PHD testing (F(1,41) = 8.603, p = .005). Conclusions: The implementation of PHD testing without anesthesia is associated with lower anxiety concerning therapeutic shock. Patients should be advised about the effects of PHD testing without anesthesia on their psychological well-being in the long run.

TI  - Home defibrillation:: A feasibility study in myocardial infarction survivors at intermediate risk of sudden death
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurs at home in 65-80% of cases and is often witnessed. We designed a study to explore the feasibility of a home defibrillation program (a) evaluating the retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillators (AED) use skills (BLSD) (b) assessing the impact on anxiety, depression, and quality of life and (c) recording the critical issues emerging from program implementation.
   Methods Thirty-three post-myocardial infarction patients and their 56 relatives received BLSD training and an AED. Assessment of BLSD skills, levels of anxiety, and depression and quality of life were scheduled every 3 months for 1 year or until a common stopping date.
   Results Overall BLSD score was 26 +/- 3 at baseline vs. 22 +/- 5 at 3 months (P < .0001), 21 +/- 6 at 6 months (P < .0001), 22 +/- 4 at 9 months (P < 0.0001) and 23 +/- 5 at 12 months (P = .001). Conversely, the BLSD component "AED use"-remained stable throughout the study. Quality of life, anxiety, and depression scores remained constant. Compliance to BLSD retraining sessions and AEDs checks decreased over time and was influenced by a concomitant clinical appoinment.
   Conclusions BLSD performance of families of post-myocardial infarction patients decreases over time, even though the ability to operate AEDs appears to be the least affected component. Compliance with retraining sessions and AED checks declines over time and is improved if they are combined with clinical appointments. The implementation of a home defibrillation program does not affect anxiety, depression, or the quality of life.

TI  - Evaluation of an Online Educational Tool to Improve Postresuscitation Debriefing in the Emergency Department
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objective: Postresuscitation debriefing (PRD) addresses Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies and is recommended by the American Heart Association. Postresuscitation debriefing improves resuscitation outcomes, promotes team morale, supports emotional well-being, and reduces burnout. Despite these benefits, PRD occurs infrequently. Commonly cited barriers to PRD include lack of training and comfort in facilitating PRD. We are unaware of any video-based educational tools that train physicians in PRD. We aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational tool on the frequency of PRD using a before- and after-study design.
   Methods: We created and distributed a 20-minute, video-based educational tool via youtube.com on PRD to pediatric emergency medicine (EM) fellows, pediatric EM attendings, senior EM residents, and EM attending physicians. Participants completed web-based surveys before, immediately after, and 3 months after watching the tool. We analyzed the effects of participation on PRD knowledge, comfort conducting PRD, and frequency of PRD performance.
   Results: Thirty-five (63%) of 56 participants completed all 3 surveys. Participation in our study showed significant improvements in reported frequency of performing PRD (23% presurvey, 38% follow-up survey; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-29%; P = 0.03), perceived knowledge of PRD (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 3.05-12.29; P < 0.001), and comfort in conducting PRD (odds ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.96-7.03; P < 0.001). Most respondents (94%) reported that the tool was worthwhile. Most (83%) would recommend the tool to colleagues, and 86% reported positive effects on their teams with PRD.
   Conclusions: Implementation of a video-based educational tool on PRD in the emergency department was associated with increased provider report of PRD frequency, knowledge, and comfort level.

TI  - All-trans retinoic acid-induced, life-threatening complete atrioventricular block
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - We report a case of complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) with ventricular asystole and recurrent AVBs due to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). A 57-year-old man with acute promyelocytic leukemia was undergoing induction therapy with ATRA and developed episodic seizures with altered consciousness on the 14th day and then CAVB followed by cardiac arrest on the 15th day. Although he initially recovered after resuscitation, he suffered from recurrent CAVB, which persisted for 3 days despite immediate ATRA discontinuation. He then received ATRA retreatment with reduction of dosage, but a high-degree AVB recurred on the 5th day. After discontinuation of ATRA therapy, the patient recovered 3 days later without any cardiovascular event during follow-up. The serial electrocardiogram changes suggested an infra-Hisian block with possible ATRA dose-response relationship. To our knowledge, this is the first established case of ATRA-induced CAVB in the literature. We suggest clinical alertness for this life-threatening complication.

TI  - Recent developments in persufflation for organ preservation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Purpose of reviewTo summarize current literature and recent findings on the potential of humidified oxygenated gas perfusion (persufflation) as an alternative method for improved organ preservation.Recent findingsAlthough there are some conflicting data, the majority of the evidence suggests that persufflation, by enhancing oxygenation, can improve preservation and even rescue organs, including organs with prior exposure to warm ischemia. In some cases, persufflation produced better results than hypothermic machine perfusion. The timing of persufflation is of importance; benefits of persufflation appear to increase as the timing of its administration postprocurement decreases. This may be particularly true for tissues that are more sensitive to ischemia, such as the pancreas prior to islet isolation. Combining oxygen persufflation with nitric oxide and addition of pulsatile flow may provide further benefits and amplify its effects on improving transplant outcomes.SummaryPersufflation is a promising, relatively simple, preservation technique that enables improved oxygenation, which provides protection and improvement in the graft condition during preservation and prior to transplantation. More detailed studies are needed to optimize persufflation and evaluate its short and long-term effects in vivo.

TI  - Cost-utility of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients with cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a resource-intensive tool that provides haemodynamic and respiratory support in patients who have suffered cardiac arrest. In this study, we investigated the cost-utility of ECPR (cost/QALY) in cardiac arrest patients treated at our institution.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients who received ECPR following cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2018. All medical care-associated charges with ECPR and subsequent hospital admission were recorded. The quality-of-life of survivors was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark II. The cost-utility of ECPR was calculated with cost and quality-of-life data.
   Results: ECPR was used in 32 patients (15/32 in-hospital, 47%) with a median age of 55.0 years (IQR 46.3-63.3 years), 59% male and 66% African American. The median duration of ECPR support was 2.1 days (IQR 0.9-3.8 days). Survival to hospital discharge was 16%. The median score of the Health Utilities Index Mark II at discharge for the survivors was 0.44 (IQR 0.32-0.52). The median operating cost for patients undergoing ECMO was $125,683 per patient (IQR $49,751-$206,341 per patient). The calculated cost-utility for ECPR was $56,156/QALY gained.
   Conclusions: The calculated cost-utility is within the threshold considered cost-effective in the United States (<$150,000/QALY gained). These results are comparable to the cost-effectiveness of heart transplantation for end-stage heart failure. Larger studies are needed to assess the cost-utility of ECPR and to identify whether other factors, such as patient characteristics, affect the cost-utility benefit.

TI  - Prognosis of patients who recovered after an episode of sudden death
T2  - ANALES DE MEDICINA INTERNA
AB  - Objectives: Sudden death constitutes a major sanitary problem with high mortality and serious neurological complications. The objective of this study was to analyze the prognosis and the characteristics of patients who initially recovered after an episode of cardiac arrest and who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
   Method: We retrospectively studied the clinical characteristics and outcome of 65 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit during a 3 years period with aborted sudden death.
   Results: 65 patients, 44 (67.7%) men and 21 (32.3%) women. Middle ages 69.1 +/- 13.9. 29 (44.6%) out of hospital and 36 (55.4%) into hospital sudden death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 10 minutes in 28 cases (43.1%), and > 10 minutes in 37 (56.9%).36 (55.4%) of all sudden deaths were of cardiac origin. 37 patients (56.9%) died and 28 (43.1 %) survived the episode. It was LET in II cases (76.9%). 29 (44.6%) of all had post- anoxic encephalopathy and most died before discharge from ICU. Of 28 survivors, 5 patients were discharged alive with post-anoxic encephalopathy (17.8%) and 23 were discharged without neurological disturbances (82.2%). This was more frequent when sudden death was into hospital (p 0.009) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was < 10 minutes (p 0.045).
   Conclusions: High number of the patients admitted to a Intensive Care unit with aborted sudden death died during ICU stay. Many patients had post-anoxic encephalopathy and most of these died. So, up to 35% of the patients admitted after an episode of cardiac arrest were discharged alive and without severe neurological damage.

TI  - Case Report: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding and multiorgan injury caused by ethylicin poisoning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethylicin is a pesticide with excellent bactericidal ability. The incidence of poisoning has increased in recent years with the widespread use of ethylicin in green agriculture, but reports are lacking. In this study, we described three cases of oral ethylicin poisoning. Patients developed severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding after oral administration of ethylicin. Gastroscopy showed extensive mucosal erosions and ulcerations in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Impaired consciousness, multiorgan injury, irreversible shock, and cardiac arrest were observed in cases where larger doses of ethylicin were ingested. Patients were treated with comprehensive therapeutic measures, including total gastrointestinal decontamination, medications such as proton pump inhibitors and somatostatin to reduce gastric bleeding. Endoscopic hemostasis was performed when pharmacologic hemostasis was not effective. Parenteral nutritional support and organ function support were given. In patients' follow up, esophageal stenosis and dysphagia during feeding was noted, which severely affected the quality of life. Ethylicin poisoning has been a public health problem and the awareness should be raised.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A promise as yet largely unfulfilled
T2  - DM DISEASE-A-MONTH
AB  - After failure of initial external defibrillation, restoration of spontaneous circulation is largely contingent on rapid and effective reversal of myocardial ischemia by both mechanical and pharmacologic means. Despite the introduction of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) more than 35 years ago, its universal acceptance, and its wide implementation, no improvements in outcome excepting early defibrillation have been documented over these many years. The science of CPR therefore is still in its infancy It was incorrectly assumed that all that needs to be known is known and that. the need for scientific research was therefore not apparent. Accordingly, serious resuscitation research was neither encouraged nor equitably supported. The ABCs of CPR currently provide for the establishment of a patent airway (A) and intermittent positive pressure ventilation, preferably with oxygen-enriched air (B), These are to be immediately followed with precordial compression (C). This ordering of priorities, however, is based on consensus rather than objective outcome measurements, The ABCs recently have been seriously challenged on the basis of results of both experimental and clinical studies.
   Conventional external precordial compression restores systemic blood flow. It may be used by both professional and nonprofessional CPR providers, especially bystanders, because of its apparent simplicity and noninvasiveness, However, manual or mechanical external precordial compression typically generates cardiac outputs that represent less than 30 % of normal values, Coronary blood flow which is critical for restoration of spontaneous circulation, is correspondingly reduced. Accordingly; several alternatives to conventional precordial compression have been proposed with the intent of increasing cardiac output and both coronary and cerebral blood flows.
   Among the large number of pharmaceutical agents initially recommended for cardiac resuscitation, only agents that produce peripheral vasoconstriction are of proved benefit. Epinephrine has been the preferred vasopressor agent for the management of cardiac arrest for more than 35 years because of its alpha-adrenergic effects. However, the potentially adverse effects of epinephrine are related to its beta-adrenergic inotropic actions. The beta-adrenergic actions account for disproportionate increases in myocardial oxygen consumption with increased severity of myocardial ischemic injury and provocation of ectopic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Nevertheless, epinephrine remains the drug of choice, although adrenergic drugs with selective alpha-adrenergic actions or nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs are likely to emerge as useful alternatives. Experimental and clinical observations have led to identification of continuous monitoring of both end-tidal carbon dioxide and ventricular fibrillation waveforms as practical noninvasive guides because they are highly correlated with both cardiac output and coronary blood flow Both end-tidal carbon dioxide and ventricular fibrillation waveforms now serve as predictors of the likelihood of successful resuscitation. These two measurements may now be used to guide interventions and especially to assure optimal precordial compression. It is well established that sudden death among adults is predominantly due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation. Early defibrillation serves as an unequivocally effective immediate intervention. Minimally trained first responders and members of the general public are being enfranchised to use automated external defibrillators for very early defibrillation. Use of these devices by bystanders is the most promising new intervention since CPR was first proposed in the early 1960s. Postresuscitation ventricular dysrhythmias and heart failure are now called postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. This complication has been recognized as a leading cause of the high postresuscitation mortality rate. More than 80% of victims who undergo successful resuscitation die after admission. Much effort is devoted to the understanding of mechanisms and to defining effective therapeutic options for improving outcomes to reduce the death rate from postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the sports professional: Recommendations for intervention and training in coexistence with COVID-19
T2  - APUNTS SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - The aim is to promote a safer intervention in a cardiac arrest assisted by a sports professional during the current pandemic conditions due to COVID-19. The European Resuscitation Council protocol for lay people is adequate for this group, but it must be complemented with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) adapted to sports professionals. The adaptations of action with respect to the 2015 practical guidelines are: assessment of breathing visually without opening the victim's airways, placement of a mask (preferably > FFP2) on the victim before starting resuscitation, resuscitation only with chest compressions except for of children and drowned-cohabitant, and the use of PPE for the sports field of easy learning and greater safety against possible transmission of COVID-19 by drops/aerosols (FFP3, glasses, gloves). These considerations should be included in the training/re-training of sports professionals in resuscitation and sports entities should favour the availability of aforementioned PPE.

TI  - Application of a portable sealed positive pressure infusion device in a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - <bold>Background:</bold> Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of trauma-related mortality in military and disaster settings, necessitating prompt fluid resuscitation. Conventional infusion methods, which rely on elevating fluid containers to generate hydrostatic pressure, risk secondary injury and are less efficient during prehospital transport. We developed a wearable, portable, sealed positive-pressure infusion device to optimize fluid administration in austere environments. <bold>Methods:</bold> Ten male Bama miniature pigs underwent controlled hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 60 mmHg, induced by blood withdrawal until approximately 40-45% of estimated total blood volume [70 mL/kg body weight] and maintained for 30 min). Animals were randomized to receive resuscitation with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in saline at 10 mL/min using either the novel device or conventional manual pressure infusion. Vital signs and blood parameters (e.g., activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT]) were measured at baseline, shock phase, 1 h post-resuscitation, and upon completion of resuscitation. Resuscitation time, fluid volume, and maximum infusion line pressure were recorded. <bold>Results:</bold> All animals achieved successful resuscitation (100% immediate survival). During a 7-day follow-up, one animal in each group died (20%, p > 0.05). The device group exhibited a significantly shorter resuscitation time (103.0 +/- 16.97 [95% CI: 81.93, 124.07] vs. 122.4 +/- 8.02 [95% CI: 112.44, 132.36] minutes, p = 0.0496) and a higher infusion rate (9.29 +/- 0.50 [95% CI: 8.67, 9.91] vs. 7.68 +/- 0.40 [95% CI: 7.18, 8.18] mL/min, p < 0.001) compared with the control group. Both groups exhibited reduced APTT post-resuscitation; these descriptive findings may be associated with the colloid used but require further investigation with comprehensive coagulation assays (e.g., viscoelastic testing) and do not imply clinical benefit or harm. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The portable sealed positive-pressure infusion device provided stable pressure, improved infusion performance, and maintained safety. It represents a feasible solution for managing hemorrhagic shock in prehospital austere settings.

TI  - Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction An increasing body of evidence from laboratory and clinical studies suggests that vasopressin may represent a promising alternative vasopressor for use during cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Current guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation recommend the use of adrenaline ( epinephrine), with vasopressin considered only as a secondary option because of limited clinical data.
   Method The present study was conducted in a prehospital setting and included patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia undergoing one of three treatments: group I patients received only adrenaline 1 mg every 3 minutes; group II patients received one intravenous dose of arginine vasopressine ( 40 IU) after three doses of 1 mg epinephrine; and patients in group III received vasopressin 40 IU as first-line therapy. The cause of cardiac arrest ( myocardial infarction or other cause) was established for each patient in hospital.
   Results A total of 109 patients who suffered nontraumatic cardiac arrest were included in the study. The rates of restoration of spontaneous circulation and subsequent hospital admission were higher in vasopressin-treated groups (23/53 [45%] in group I, 19/31 [61%] in group II and 17/27 [63%] in group III). There were also higher 24-hour survival rates among vasopressin-treated patients ( P < 0.05), and more vasopressin-treated patients were discharged from hospital (10/51 [20%] in group I, 8/31 [26%] in group II and 7/27 [ 26%] group III; P = 0.21). Especially in the subgroup of patients with myocardial infarction as the underlying cause of cardiac arrest, the hospital discharge rate was significantly higher in vasopressin-treated patients ( P < 0.05). Among patients who were discharged from hospital, we found no significant differences in neurological status between groups.
   Conclusion The greater 24-hour survival rate in vasopressin-treated patients suggests that consideration of combined vasopressin and adrenaline is warranted for the treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. This is especially the case for those patients with myocardial infarction, for whom vasopressin treatment is also associated with a higher hospital discharge rate.

AB  - This paper reports the success of amino-functionalization on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to promote neuronal cells growth on MWCNT electrode for extracellular recording, attributed to the formation of positive charge of NH2 molecules on their surfaces. Besides, the surface of MWCNT electrode becomes hydrophilic after amino-functionalization (AF-MWCNTs) which can enhance electrical conductivity because of lower MWCNT/electrolyte interfacial impedance and higher interfacial capacitance. Durability tests show that electrical characteristics of the MWCNTs treated by 2 wt% 1,4-diaminobutane solution (2 wt%-AF-MWCNTs) can last for at least six months in air ambient. The neural recording of crayfish shows that 2 wt%-AF-MWCNTs can provide better capability on detecting action potentials of caudal photoreceptor (CPR) interneuron compared to suction glass pipette from the evidence of a higher S/N ratio (126 versus 23). The amino-functionalized MWCNT electrode is feasible for long-term recording application according to the results of biocompatibility tests. As the MWCNTs were directly synthesized on Si-based substrates by catalyst-assisted thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at a low temperature (400 degrees C), these self-aligned MWCNT electrodes could be friendly implemented in integrated circuits fabrications.

TI  - Brain Hypoxia Is Associated With Neuroglial Injury in Humans Post-Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CIRCULATION RESEARCH
AB  - RATIONALE: Secondary brain hypoxia portends significant mortality in ischemic brain diseases; yet, our understanding of hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) pathophysiology in humans remains rudimentary.
   OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of secondary brain hypoxia on injury to the neurovascular unit in patients with HIBI.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective interventional study of invasive neuromonitoring in 18 post-cardiac arrest patients with HIBI. The partial pressures of brain tissue O-2 (PbtO(2)) and intracranial pressure were directly measured via intraparenchymal microcatheters. To isolate the cerebrovascular bed, we conducted paired sampling of arterial and jugular venous bulb blood and calculated the transcerebral release of biomarkers of neurovascular injury and inflammation in the patients with HIBI and 14 healthy volunteers for control comparisons. Ten patients with HIBI exhibited secondary brain hypoxia (PbtO(2)<20 mmHg), while 8 exhibited brain normoxia (PbtO(2)>= 20 mmHg). In the patients with secondary brain hypoxia, we observed active cerebral release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (-161 [-3695 to -75] pg/mL; P=0.0078), neurofilament light chain (-231 [-370 to -11] pg/mL; P=0.010), total tau (-32 [-310 to -3] pg/mL; P=0.0039), neuron-specific enolase (-14 890 [-148 813 to -3311] pg/mL; P=0.0039), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (-14.7 [-37.7 to -4.1] pg/mL; P=0.0059) indicating de novo neuroglial injury. This injury was unrelated to the systemic global ischemic burden or cerebral endothelial injury but rather was associated with cerebral release of IL-6 (interleukin-6; -10.3 [-43.0 to -4.2] pg/mL; P=0.0039). No cerebral release of the aforementioned biomarkers was observed in patients with HIBI with brain normoxia or the healthy volunteers. Hyperosmolar therapy in the patients with secondary brain hypoxia reduced the partial pressure of jugular venous O-2-to-PbtO(2) gradient (39.6 [34.1-51.1] versus 32.0 [24.5-39.2] mm Hg; P=0.0078) and increased PbtO(2) (17.0 [9.1-19.7] versus 20.2 [11.9-22.7] mm Hg; P=0.039) suggesting improved cerebrovascular-to-parenchymal O-2 transport.
   CONCLUSIONS: Secondary brain hypoxia is associated with de novo neuroglial injury and cerebral release of IL-6. Mitigating cerebrovascular-to-parenchymal limitations to O-2 transport is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with HIBI with secondary brain hypoxia.

TI  - Myocardial infarction: a paradigm of success in modern medicine
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGY
CP  - 97th Annual Meeting of the United-States-and-Canadian-Academy-of-Pathology
AB  - Hospital mortality for acute myocardial infarction declined from 30% to 10% in the last 30 years, thanks to coronary care units and early revascularization with thrombolysis, angioplasty, and stein implantation. Pathologists played a major role by establishing plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis as the major cause of acute myocardial infarction and by discovering that ischemic myocardium necrosis progresses from endocardium to epicardium as a "wave front" phenomenon, with potential reversible injury if the reperfusion is accomplished within 3 h. Lone-term mortality following myocardial infarction is mostly due to sudden electrical death, which may be prevented by pharmacologic (antiarrhythmic drugs) and nonpharmacologic (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, pacemaker) therapy. Ventricular assist devices may support the left ventricle as a bridge to transplantation. Long-term mortality at distance from acute myocardial infarction declined from 10% to 2% per year. Despite these indisputable achievements, there are still pending questions: in vivo identification of vulnerable plaque, mechanisms of thrombosis by plaque erosion, prompt treatment on the spot of instantaneous cardiac arrest by external defibrillation, adverse effect of myocardial reperfusion, fate of bare- and drug-eluting coronary stents. With these limitations and challenges well in mind, nowadays myocardial infarction does not represent a nightmare as it was in the past. The achievements in its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment should be considered as a pride of cardiovascular medicine. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Definitive External Fixation for Anterior Stabilization of Combat-related Pelvic Ring Injuries, With or Without Sacroiliac Fixation
T2  - CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Military-Orthopaedic-Surgeons (SOMOS)
AB  - Background Combat-related pelvic ring injuries frequently lead to placement of a temporizing external fixation device for early resuscitation and transport. These injuries are commonly complicated by concomitant polytrauma and extensive soft-tissue injuries, which may preclude early internal fixation and lead to prolonged use of external fixation. To date, few studies have reported on the outcomes of definitive external fixation for combat-related pelvic ring injuries. Questions/purposes (1) In patients treated with definitive external fixation after combat-related pelvic ring injuries, how often is the quality of reduction within radiographically acceptable parameters at the end of treatment? (2) What proportion of patients demonstrate local heterotopic ossification after these injuries? (3) What patient- and treatment-related factors are associated with increased complications and pain? Methods We retrospectively studied all patients with pelvic ring injuries treated at a tertiary military referral center from January 2003 to December 2012. In total, 114 patients were identified, 55 of whom maintained an external fixation frame throughout their treatment. During that time, the general indications for definitive external fixation were an open, contaminated pelvic ring injury with a high risk of infection or open urologic injury; confluent abdominal, perineal, and thigh wounds; or comminution of the pubic ramus that would necessitate plate fixation extending up the anterior column in patients with open abdomen or exposure-compromising abdominal wounds. Posterior fixation, either sacroiliac or lumbopelvic, was applied in patients with sacroiliac instability. Of the 55 patients with pelvic ring injuries treated with definitive external fixation (27 open and 28 closed), four underwent hemipelvectomy and construct removal for massive ascending infections and four were lost to follow-up, leaving 47 patients (85%) who were available at a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median 29 months, interquartile range 17-43 months). All 47 patients underwent serial imaging to assess their injury and reduction during treatment. External fixators were typically removed after 12 weeks, except in patients in whom pin-site irritation or infection prompted earlier removal, and all were confirmed to be grossly stable during an examination under anesthesia. Clinical union was defined as the absence of radiographically present fracture lines and stable examination findings under anesthesia when the external fixator was removed. Data on demographics, injury pattern, associated injuries, revision procedures, complications, and final functional outcomes including ambulation status, sexual function, and pain were collected. Pelvic radiographs were reviewed for the initial injury pattern, type of pelvic fixation construct, residual displacement after removal of the frame, and evidence of formation of heterotopic ossification in the pelvis or bilateral hips. Pelvic displacement and diastasis were determined by digital caliper measurement on plain images; malunion was defined as anterior diastasis of the pelvis or vertical incongruity of the hemipelvis greater than 10 mm. Results Radiographic malunion after construct removal occurred in eight of 24 patients with open injuries and in five of 23 patients with closed injuries. Heterotopic ossification developed in the pelvis or hips of all 24 patients with open injuries and in two of the 23 patients with closed injuries.
   In patients with open pelvic ring injuries, concomitant acetabular fractures were associated with pelvic pain at the final follow-up examination (risk ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.5; p = 0.017). No treatment factor resulted in superior functional outcomes. In the closed-injury group, concomitant lower-extremity amputation was associated with improved radiographic final reduction (RR 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7; p = 0.02). There was no association between radiographic malunion and increased pain (RR 1.9; 95% CI, 0.5-7.0; p = 0.54 for the open group; RR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; p = 0.86 for the closed group). Conclusion In this series of patients with severe combat-related pelvic ring injuries who were treated anteriorly with definitive external fixation because of a severe soft-tissue injury, high infection risk, or unacceptable physiologic cost of internal fixation, malunion and chronic pelvic pain were less common than previously observed. Prior studies primarily differ in their lack of sacroiliac or lumbopelvic stabilization for posteriorly unstable fracture patterns, likely accounting for much of these differences. There may have been important between-study differences such as extremely severe injuries, concomitant injuries, and study population. Our study also differs because we specifically analyzed a large cohort of patients who sustained open pelvic ring injuries. Future studies should prospectively investigate the ideal construct type and pin material, optimize the length of treatment and assessment of healing, and improve radiographic measures to predict long-term functional outcomes.

TI  - Impact of near-death experiences on dialysis patients: A multicenter collaborative study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES
AB  - Background: People who have come close to death may report an unusual experience known as a near-death experience (NDE). This study aims to investigate NDEs and their aftereffects in dialysis patients.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting & Participants: 710 dialysis patients at 7 centers in Taipei, Taiwan.
   Predictor: Demographic characteristics, life-threatening experience, depression, and religiosity.
   Outcomes: NDE and self-perceived changes in attitudes or behaviors.
   Measurements: Greyson's NDE scale, Royal Free Questionnaire, 10-Question Survey, Ring's Weighted Core Experience Index, and Beck Depression Inventory.
   Results: 45 patients had 51 NDEs. Mean NDE score was 11.9 (95% confidence interval, 11.0 to 12.9). Out-of-body experience was found in 51.0% of NDEs. Purported precognitive visions, awareness of being dead, and '' tunnel experience '' were uncommon (< 10%). Compared with the no-NDE group, subjects in the NDE group were more likely to be women and younger at life-threatening events. Both frequency of participation in religious ceremonies and pious religious activity correlated significantly with NDE score in patients with NDEs (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). The NDE group reported being kinder to others (P = 0.04) and more motivated (P = 0.02) after their life-threatening events than the no-NDE group.
   Limitations: Determining the incidence of NDEs is dependent on self-reporting. Many NDEs occurred before the patient began long-term dialysis therapy. Causality between NDE and aftereffects cannot be inferred.
   Conclusions: NDE is not uncommon in the dialysis population and is associated with positive aftereffects. Nephrology care providers should be aware of the occurrence and aftereffects of NDEs. The high occurrence of life-threatening events, availability of medical records, and accessibility and cooperativeness of patients make the dialysis population very suitable for NDE research.

TI  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Evidence-Based Practice in Neonatal Resuscitation among Birth Asphyxiated Newborns in a Developing Country
T2  - SAGE OPEN NURSING
AB  - Introduction The World Health Organization emphasizes that neonatal resuscitation performed in the first "golden minute" following birth can influence both immediate and long-term outcomes of newborns, especially asphyxiated ones. The modes of resuscitation, which is an evidenced-based practice, require evaluation to identify their effectiveness.Objectives This study evaluated neonatal resuscitation techniques and their effectiveness in the management of asphyxiated neonates during the perinatal period.Design Cross-sectional design with observation of delivery and immediate care of 254 newborns in five hospitals from April to June 2022.Methods Neonatal resuscitation and demographic characteristics were noted. Data were analyzed descriptively using STATA 17 and Cramer's V test of association between APGAR scores and resuscitation modes was done with statistical significance established at p <= .05.Results Neonatal resuscitation was primarily performed by midwives (98.4%), with 48.8% of the infants resuscitated after birth. The most common modalities of resuscitation were drying, keeping warm, rubbing the back, and flicking the feet, with 46.0% started on bag and mask ventilation. The success rate of resuscitation was impressive (58.1%), satisfactory (38.7%), and poor (3.2%). There was a strong association of the first minute APGAR score with drying the neonate (p = .0001, phi c = 0.619), keeping the neonate warm, and rubbing the back of the neonate (p = .0001, phi c = 0.613). However, their association with the fifth minute APGAR score was weak (p = .002, phi c = 0.222). Feet flicking has no significant association with the fifth minute APGAR score.Conclusion Neonatal resuscitation, which is an evidence-based practice, is more effective in the first minute than in the fifth minute. Regular training of midwives to update their resuscitation skills is important to promote timely and efficient resuscitation of newborns. Further studies into the advancements in resuscitation modes and the use of technology to improve resuscitation beyond the first minute are recommended.

TI  - Machine perfusion of thoracic organs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
CP  - 26th European Conference on General Thoracic Surgery of the European-Society-of-Thoracic-Surgeons (ESTS)
AB  - This article summarizes recent knowledge and clinical advances in machine perfusion (MP) of thoracic organs. MP of thoracic organs has gained much attention during the last decade. Clinical studies are investigating the role of MP to preserve, resuscitate, and assess heart and lungs prior to transplantation. Currently, MP of the cardiac allograft is essential in all type DCD heart transplantation while MP of the pulmonary allograft is mandatory in uncontrolled DCD lung transplantation. MP of thoracic organs also offers an exciting platform to further investigate downregulation of the innate and adaptive immunity prior to reperfusion of the allograft in recipients. MP provides a promising technology that allows pre-transplant preservation, resuscitation, assessment, repair, and conditioning of cardiac and pulmonary allografts outside the body in a near physiologic state prior to planned transplantation. Results of ongoing clinical trials are awaited to estimate the true clinical value of this new technology in advancing the field of heart and lung transplantation by increasing the total number and the quality of available organs and by further improving recipient early and long-term outcome.

TI  - Accidental Pyrethroid Ingestion in Toddler: Near-Fatal Atypical Presentation and Successful Recovery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - We are reporting a case of pyrethroid poisoning with atypical presentation in a 21-month-old toddler who was transferred to us from a peripheral center. Signs and symptoms at presentation were predominantly of cardiopulmonary dysfunction contrary to more common presenting features of gastrointestinal and neurological impairment. The reason for this seems to be the aspiration pneumonitis as a consequence of vomiting induced by parents at home, rather than the toxin itself even though a rather rapid progression of lung injury does not rule out the possibility. He had developed decreased level of consciousness and increased work of breathing after ingestion, which had progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, septic shock, and multi organ failure. He even had a brief cardiac arrest with Return of Spontaneous Circulation after 5 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, immediately after arrival at our unit, which seemed more likely to be a consequence of inappropriate management during transfer of the child. In addition to antibiotics and vasopressors, he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation and prone positioning initially, and lung-protective conventional ventilation later. His cardiopulmonary status improved gradually and he was successfully extubated after 12 days. Other organ systems also showed complete recovery. Even though Magnetic Resonance Imaging of brain done a few days after cardiac arrest showed features suggestive of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy he showed complete neurological recovery. He was thriving well at three-month follow-up with no neurological deficits, good exercise tolerance, and normal renal and liver function. Atypical presentation of pyrethroid poisoning is associated with significant morbidities and there seems to no reliable parameters in children to identify the risk of the same. Considering that there is no specific antidote, prompt, and aggressive supportive therapy is necessary for a favorable outcome. This case highlights several important aspects in the care of the pediatric patient after ingestion of insecticides. First, attempt to induce emesis, especially outside of a healthcare facility is not only ineffective but also highly dangerous, and should not be done. Second, unstable patients require inter and intrahospital transfer by experienced and trained personnel; and lastly, management for these complex and atypical cases should be done as early as possible in a center which is equipped to provide high level of circulatory and ventilatory support while prioritizing neuro-protective measures, and neurologic recovery and rehabilitation.

TI  - Unlocking the sealed entrance-exploring left coronary treatment options: a case report
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
AB  - Background Left main coronary artery (LMCA) atresia is a rare anomaly characterized by the absence of the left coronary ostium, a blind-ending left main trunk, and retrograde collateral flow from the right coronary artery. Clinical manifestations may include angina, syncope, dyspnoea, sudden death, or failure to thrive. Information on the treatment of this anomaly is extremely limited, and the long-term outcomes of conventional coronary artery bypass grafting in young patients remain uncertain.Case summary A 37-year-old woman presented with recurrent syncope during adolescence and later developed chest pain and cardiac arrest during childbirth. Coronary angiography confirmed LMCA atresia, yet repeated stress perfusion tests consistently showed no ischaemia. Considering the limited negative predictive value of stress testing and insights from guidelines addressing other congenital coronary anomalies, surgical reconstruction was performed using an external iliac artery (EIA) autograft directly anastomosed from the aorta to the LMCA. The harvest site was repaired with a vascular prosthesis. The patient recovered uneventfully and has remained stable under medical therapy.Discussion This case represents the first reported surgical reconstruction of LMCA atresia using an EIA autograft. It highlights the limitations of ischaemia testing in congenital coronary anomalies, the potential advantages of reconstruction over conventional bypass surgery in the setting of competitive native flow, and the importance of individualized, thoughtful decision-making. External iliac artery autograft reconstruction may offer a promising alternative for patients with this rare condition.

TI  - Ginger supplementation does not increase energy expenditure in female adults
T2  - NUTRITION
AB  - Food components with thermogenic properties are promising antiobesity agents. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) bioactive compounds have a capsaicin-like vanillyl portion, which has been attributed to thermogenic effect in previous experimental studies. However, studies conducted in humans have evaluated only the acute thermogenic effect of ginger, and demonstrated contradictory results. We evaluated the effect of long-term consumption of dry ginger extract on the resting energy expenditure (REE) of female adults with high body adiposity.
   Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT02570633). Participants age 18 to 60 y were randomly assigned into two groups: Intervention (600 mg of ginger extract daily) and placebo (cellulose). The intervention lasted 3 mo. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and REE were assessed at each visit.
   Results: A total of 66 female participants with high body adiposity were included in the analysis (mean age: 29 y [range, 20-55 y]; body mass index: 23.3 +/- 2.7), with 30 participants in the ginger group and 36 in the placebo group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. No dif-ferences were observed for group  pound time interaction on REE. Body composition and blood pressure followed the same pattern (all P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Ginger extract consumption for 3 mo did not change the REE, anthropometric, and clinical data of female adults with excess adiposity.

TI  - Which factors determine our quality of life, health and ability? Results from a Danish population sample and the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort
T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
AB  - Objective: To examine the statistical associations between Global Quality of Life (QOL) and a series of indicators representing health, ability, philosophy of life, sexuality, quality of working life and other medically relevant aspects of life.
   Design: Cross-sectional comparative study using the self-administered SEQOL questionnaire.
   Place and Duration of Study: The Quality of Life Research Center, the University Hospital Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Subjects and Methods: (1) A representative sample of 2,500 Danes (18-88 years) randomly selected from the CPR-register, (2) Follow-up survey of members of the Copenhagen Perinatal Birth Cohort, 4,648 Danes (31-33 years). The associations were measured qualitatively as well as quantitatively calculating the difference in percentage and using the method of weight modified linear regression. QOL, measured by SEQOL (self-evaluation of quality of life), containing eight global QOL measures: well-being, life-satisfaction, happiness, fulfillment of needs, experience of temporal and spatial domains, expression of life's potentials and objective factors.
   Results: Strongest was the association between OOL, overall view of life (41.5% / 59.1%), relationship to self (39.3% 56.8%), partner (32.2% / 31.7%) and friends (33.3% / 42.7%). Different aspects of physical as well as psychological health were also strongly correlated with QOL: self-perceived physical health (33.2% /29.4%), satisfaction with own health (27.3% / 29.0%), self-perceived mental health (38.4/51.0), number of severe health problems (29.8% / 35.3%). Objective factors such as income, age, sex, weight and social group did not have any noteworthy relationship to QOL, and neither did lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, drug use, exercise, and diet.
   Conclusion: It seems that the factors important for present OOL and health is derived from good relations, with the close as well as the distant world, and overall view of life. What one possesses in objective terms - money, status, work - does not seem to be important to global quality of life and of little importance to self-assessed health. Our results indicate that what is really important is not what one has, but how he sees, evaluates and experiences what he has. The person's level of consciousness and responsible attitude towards life and others seem far more important for the global quality of life and health.

TI  - Our Children Are Not a Diagnosis: The Experience of Parents Who Continue Their Pregnancy After a Prenatal Diagnosis of Trisomy 13 or 18
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A
AB  - Trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 (T13-18) are associated with high rates of perinatal death and with severe disability among survivors. Prenatal diagnosis (PND) may lead many women to terminate their pregnancy but some women choose to continue their pregnancy. We sent 503 invitations to answer a questionnaire to parents who belong to T13 and 18 internet support groups. Using mixed methods, we asked parents about their prenatal experience, their hopes, the life of their affected child, and their family experience. 332 parents answered questions about 272 children; 128 experienced PND. These parents, despite feeling pressure to terminate (61%) and being told that their baby would likely die before birth (94%), chose to continue the pregnancy. Their reasons included: moral beliefs (68%), child-centered reasons (64%), religious beliefs (48%), parent-centered reasons (28%), and practical reasons (6%). At the time of the diagnosis, most of these parents (80%) hoped to meet their child alive. By the time of birth, 25% chose a plan of full interventions. A choice of interventions at birth was associated with fewer major anomalies (P<0.05). Parents describe Special healthcare providers as those who gave balanced and personalized information, respected their choice, and provided support. Parents make decisions to continue a pregnancy and choose a plan of care for their child according to their beliefs and their child's specific medical condition, respectively. Insights from parents' perspective can better enable healthcare providers to counsel and support families. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Transcutaneous oximetry values in chronic ulcer patients during Hyperbaric treatment at 1.4 ATA to 2 ATA
T2  - UNDERSEA AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE
AB  - Chronic wounds have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Different pathologies, such as poor blood supply and tissue breakdown, may lead to inadequate oxygenation of the wound. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is a widely used treatment for an increasing number of medical practices. A new so-called "hyperbaric treatment" trend has emerged. The use of low-pressure, soft-sided, or inflatable chambers represents a growing trend in hyperbaric medicine. Used in professional settings as well as directly marketed to individuals for home use, they are promoted as equivalent to clinical hyperbaric treatments provided in medical centers. However, these chambers are pressurized to 1.3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) on either air or with an oxygen concentrator, both generate oxygen partial pressures well below those used in approved hyperbaric centers for UHMS-approved indications. A total of 130 consecutive patients with chronic ulcers where tested. TcPO2 was measured near the ulcer area while the patient was breathing 100% O-2 at 1.4 ATA for five and 10 minutes. The average TcPO2 at 1.4 ATA after 10 minutes of O-2 breathing was 161 mmHg (1-601 mmHg, standard deviation 137.91), compared to 333 mmHg in 2 ATA (1-914 +/- 232.56), p < 0.001. Each electrode tested was also statistically significant, both after five minutes of O-2 breathing and after 10 minutes. We have not found evidence supporting the claim that 1.4 ATA treatment can benefit a chronic ulcer patient. The field of HBO2 is constantly evolving. We have discovered new ways to treat previously incurable ailments. Nevertheless, it is important to note that new horizons must be examined scientifically, supported by evidence-based data. The actual effect of 1.4 ATA on many ailments is yet to be determined.

TI  - Sepsis: Diagnosis and Management
T2  - AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
AB  - Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

TI  - Preparticipation Cardiovascular Screening of Athletes: Current Controversies and Challenges for the Future
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Sports cardiology is an evolving field in cardiology, with several topics remaining controversial. Beyond the several well-known benefits of regular exercise practice, the occurrence of adverse clinical events during sports in apparently healthy individuals, especially sudden cardiac death, and the described long-term adverse cardiac adaptations associated to high volume of exercise, remain challenging. The early identification of athletes with increased risk is critical, but the most appropriate preparticipation screening protocols are also debatable and a more personalized evaluation, considering individual and sports-related characteristics, will potentially optimize this evaluation. As the risk of major clinical events during sports is not zero, independently of previous evaluation, ensuring the capacity for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, especially with availability of automated external defibrillators, in sports arenas, is crucial for its prevention and to improve outcomes. As in other areas of medicine, application of new digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, is promising and could improve in near future several aspects of sports cardiology. This paper aims to review the methodology of athletes' preparticipation screening, emphasizing current controversies and future challenges, in order to improve early diagnosis of conditions associated with sudden cardiac death.

TI  - The intensity of forest management affects the nest cavity production of woodpeckers and tits in mature boreal forests
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Cavities made by birds are an important microhabitat for many taxa in forests. Long-term dynamics of cavity patterns and the effect of forest management on cavities are, however, largely unknown. We studied cavity production, measured as nest cavity production rates (CPR=no. of new cavities/km(2)/year), of woodpeckers and tits in forests with different management intensity in southern Finland, based on a data from 37 years. Forests were divided into managed, seminatural and natural stands. The data covered 56 forest stands with the total area of 1690 ha. Stands were inventoried annually for new cavities. The total numbers of woodpecker and tit cavities were 2238 and 329, respectively. There were large differences in CPRs between forest stands with different management intensity. For woodpeckers, the CPR was highest in natural forests (5.7) and lowest in managed forests (1.5). For the tit species, the respective numbers were 0.9 and 0.3. The CPRs of different cavity-making bird species and cavity tree characteristics (e.g. tree condition and species) were consistent, suggesting that different cavity-makers benefit from similar forest and tree characteristics. The results also suggest that forests managed with currently prevailing methods limit the production of cavities. To promote cavities, the results from this and other studies suggest that managed forests should include more features of natural forests, such as more diverse tree species and within-stand structural variability distribution (tree-level heterogeneity), larger amount of decayed wood, more retention trees and snags and longer rotation periods.

TI  - Professionals' preferences in prenatal counseling at the limits of viability: a nationwide qualitative Dutch study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Prenatal counseling practices at the limits of viability do vary, and constructing a counseling framework based on guidelines, professional and parental preferences, might achieve more homogeneity. We aimed to gain insight into professionals' preferences on three domains of counseling, particularly content, organization, and decision making and their influencing factors. A qualitative, nationwide in-depth exploration among Dutch perinatal professionals by semi-structured interviews in focus groups was performed. Regarding content of prenatal counseling, preparing parents on the short-term situation (delivery room care) and revealing their perspectives on "quality of life" were considered important. Parents should be informed on the kind of decision, on the difficulty of individual outcome predictions, on survival and mortality figures, short- and long-term morbidity, and the burden of hospitalization. For organization, the making of and compliance with agreements between professionals may promote joint counseling by neonatologists and obstetricians. Supportive materials were considered useful but only when up-to-date, in addition to the discussion and with opportunity for personalization. Regarding decision making, it is not always clear to parents that a prenatal decision needs to be made and they can participate, influencing factors could be, e.g., unclear language, directive counseling, overload of information, and an immediate delivery. There is limited familiarity with shared decision making although it is the preferred model.
   Conclusion: This study gained insight into preferred content, organization, and decision making of prenatal counseling at the limits of viability and their influencing factors from a professionals' perspective.

TI  - Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea Affecting Menstruating Women Using Herbs: A Review
T2  - NATURAL PRODUCTS JOURNAL
AB  - Primary dysmenorrhea is a common condition that affects menstruating women, especially young women. Painful cramping in the lower abdominal area, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue is associated with primary dysmenorrhea, which restricts women from normal living life. The productivity and work performance of women are heavily affected by the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Low Dose Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. However, variability in individual response to the drugs and their side effects hinder their long-term use among women. Complementary medicine such as herbs is a promising alternative for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, but it lacks scientific evidence. The pharmacological and clinical studies of 9 herbs were included in this review. Although excellent analgesic effects of herbs were reported by clinical studies, the detailed mechanism of action of most herbs remains unelucidated. Several studies discovered that herbs exert analgesic effects through direct uterine muscle relaxation effect, inhibition of Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2), inhibition of intracellular calcium level, and reduction of prostaglandin synthesis. Further investigation of pharmacological action and the recommended dosages of the herbs for the optimal analgesic effect is needed.

TI  - Multimodal prehabilitation to improve the clinical outcomes of frail elderly patients with gastric cancer: a study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (GISSG+2201)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Gastric cancer (GC) diagnosed in the elderly population has become a serious public health problem worldwide. Given the combined effects of frailty and the consequences of cancer treatment, older individuals with GC are more likely than young patients to suffer from postoperative complications and poor clinical outcomes. Nutrition, functional capacity and psychological state-based multimodal prehabilitation, which is dominated by Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway management, has been shown to reduce postoperative complications, promote functional recovery and decrease hospitalisation time in certain malignancies. However, no previous studies have investigated the clinical application of multimodal prehabilitation in frail older patients with GC.Methods and analysis The study is a prospective, multicentre randomised controlled trial in which a total of 368 participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomised into either a prehabilitation group or an ERAS group. The prehabilitation group will receive multimodal prehabilitation combined with ERAS at least 2 weeks before the gastrectomy is performed, including physical and respiratory training, nutritional support, and therapy and psychosocial treatment. The ERAS group patients will be treated according to the ERAS pathway. All interventions will be supervised by family members. The primary outcome measures are the incidence and severity of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes include survival, functional capacity and other short-term postoperative outcomes. Overall, the multimodal prehabilitation protocol may improve functional capacity, reduce the surgical stress response and concomitant systemic inflammation, and potentially modulate the tumour microenvironment to improve short-term and long-term clinical outcomes and patients' quality of life.Ethics and dissemination All procedures and participating centres of this study were approved by their respective ethics committees (QYFYKYLL 916111920). The final study results will be published separately in peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - Development and Validation of Indicators for Population Injury Surveillance in Hong Kong: Development and Usability Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: Injury is an increasingly pressing global health issue. An effective surveillance system is required to monitor the trends and burden of injuries.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify a set of valid and context-specific injury indicators to facilitate the establishment of an injury surveillance program in Hong Kong.
   Methods: This development of indicators adopted a multiphased modified Delphi research design. A literature search was conducted on academic databases using injury-related search terms in various combinations. A list of potential indicators was sent to a panel of experts from various backgrounds to rate the validity and context-specificity of these indicators. Local hospital data on the selected core indicators were used to examine their applicability in the context of Hong Kong.
   Results: We reviewed 142 articles and identified 55 indicators, which were classified into 4 domains. On the basis of the ratings by the expert panel, 13 indicators were selected as core indicators because of their good validity and high relevance to the local context. Among these indicators, 10 were from the construct of health care service use, and 3 were from the construct of postdischarge outcomes. Regression analyses of local hospitalization data showed that the Hong Kong Safe Community certification status had no association with 5 core indicators (admission to intensive care unit, mortality rate, length of intensive care unit stay, need for a rehabilitation facility, and long-term behavioral and emotional outcomes), negative associations with 4 core indicators (operative intervention, infection rate, length of hospitalization, and disability-adjusted life years), and positive associations with the remaining 4 core indicators (attendance to accident and emergency department, discharge rate, suicide rate, and hospitalization rate after attending the accident and emergency department). These results confirmed the validity of the selected core indicators for the quantification of injury burden and evaluation of injury-related services, although some indicators may better measure the consequences of severe injuries.
   Conclusions: This study developed a set of injury outcome indicators that would be useful for monitoring injury trends and burdens in Hong Kong.

TI  - Research progress and considerations on oral rehydration therapy for the prevention and treatment of severe burn shock: A narrative review
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Severe burns are a significant cause of life-threatening conditions in both peacetime and wartime. Shock is a critical complication during the early stages of burn injury, contributing substantially to mortality and long-term disability. Effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for preventing and treating shock, with prompt administration being vital. However, timely intravenous fluid resuscitation is often challenging, and errors in resuscitation significantly contribute to mortality. Therefore, exploring a more rapid and effective non-invasive method of fluid resuscitation is necessary. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has shown considerable potential in this regard. This paper reviews ORT's historical development and current research progress, discussing its application in early anti-shock treatment for burns. While ORT is generally safe, potential complications like diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort must be noted, particularly if the rehydration rate is too rapid or if gastrointestinal issues exist. Careful patient assessment and monitoring are essential during ORT administration. Based on a comprehensive review of relevant research, we present provisional guidelines for ORT in burn patients. These guidelines aim to inform clinical practice but should be applied cautiously due to limited clinical evidence. Implementation must be tailored to the patient's condition under healthcare supervision, with adjustments according to evolving circumstances: (1) Initiation timing: Start as soon as possible, and the ideal start time is usually within 6 h after injury. (2) Rate of application: Employing a fractional administration approach, wherein small quantities of approximately 150-250 millilitres are provided for each instance and the initial fluid rate of oral rehydration can be simplified to 100 mL/kg/24 h. (3) Composition combination: In addition to essential salts and glucose, the oral rehydration solution can incorporate various anti-inflammatory and cellular protection constituents.

TI  - Cardiometabolic risk profile in non-obese children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in childhood is a complex disease primarily due both to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and pediatric obesity. Notably, inflammation has been recognized as one of the most important shared pathogenic factor between obesity and OSAS resulting in an increased cardiometabolic risk for these patients. To date, evidence is still limited in non-obese population with OSAS. We aimed to evaluate the cardiometabolic risk profile of a pediatric population of non-obese subjects affected by OSAS. A total of 128 school-aged children (mean age 9.70 +/- 3.43) diagnosed with OSAS and 213 non-OSAS children (mean age 9.52 +/- 3.35) as control group were enrolled. All subjects underwent a complete clinical and biochemical assessment (including white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), % of neutrophils (NEU%), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), uric acid, fasting insulin, iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels). A significant association between inflammation markers (including WBC, PLT, MPV, NEU%, ferritin, CPR, and ESR) and OSAS was found (all p < 0.001). Children with OSAS also showed increased transaminase, glucose, uric acid, and insulin levels (all p < 0.001) compared to healthy controls.
   Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggested a worse cardiometabolic profile in non-obese children with OSAS. Given the pivotal pathogenic role of inflammation both for hypoxiemia and metabolic derangements, therapeutic strategies for OSAS might also counteract the increased cardiometabolic risk of these patients, by improving their long-term quality of life.

TI  - Cardiovascular Protection to Improve Clinical Outcomes After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Is There a Proven role?
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Cardiac abnormalities seen in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are considered to be a neurally mediated process rather than a manifestation of coronary artery disease. In patients with SAH, myocardial injury evidenced by troponin elevation appears to predict short and long-term outcomes independently of other conventional risk. Although incidence of electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmias and left ventricular systolic dysfunction do not independently predict the outcomes, monitoring these changes and optimizing hemodynamic status in high-grade SAH is crucial to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion and arterial oxygenation. Novel interventions that go beyond blood pressure control, prevention of re-bleeding, and aneurysm obliteration should target early physiologic derangements seen in the acute phase of SAH. The early resuscitation phase in SAH represents the greatest opportunity for impacting clinical outcome and is thus the most promising window of opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating novel therapeutic strategies related to protection and modulation of cardiovascular function. Specific measures, such as the early use of beta-adrenergic antagonists, to prevent these cardiac abnormalities and ameliorate its impact on morbidity and mortality are yet to be established.

TI  - Use of Dexmedetomidine in Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (tf-TAVI) Procedures
T2  - ADVANCES IN THERAPY
AB  - Introduction Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist without any effect on the GABA receptor. Its sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, and sympatholytic activities together with opioid-sparing effects make it suitable for short- and long-term sedation in the intensive care setting. We report our experience with dexmedetomidine use during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure as an alternative to general anesthesia. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of high-risk patients undergoing dexmedetomidine infusion for the transfemoral TAVI procedure between July 2017 and October 2019. The primary outcome parameters were hemodynamic: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP); respiratory oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and sedation level (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, RASS). The frequency of conversion to general anesthesia and the need for sedative "rescue therapy" were secondary endpoints. We also reported the overall anesthetic management and the incidence of intra- and postoperative complications. Results Eighty-five patients were evaluated (age 81.58 +/- 5.23 years, 36.5% men, 63.5% women). High comorbidity, according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS PROM). The patients' hemodynamic functions were kept normal. Complications such as cardiac arrest occurred in four patients; orotracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were necessary. Atrioventricular block occurred in nine patients. Respiratory parameters were maintained stable. Complications such as apnea, hypoventilation, and hypoxemia did not occur. All patients had RASS scores above or equal to 0 and - 1. No patient required rescue midazolam or fentanyl. No conversion to general anesthesia in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine was observed in the absence of hemodynamic complications caused by the surgical technique. Conclusion In this series, sedation with dexmedetomidine for TAVI procedures with femoral access was proven effective and safe. Dexmedetomidine may be a valid alternative to general anesthesia in high-risk older patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI.

TI  - Mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lacking three of the five rpf-like genes are defective for growth in vivo and for resuscitation in vitro
T2  - INFECTION AND IMMUNITY
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains five genes, rpfA through rpfE, that bear significant homology to the resuscitation-promoting factor (rpf) gene of Micrococcus luteus, whose product is required to resuscitate the growth of dormant cultures of M. luteus and is essential for the growth of this organism. Previous studies have shown that deletion of any one of the five rpf-like genes did not affect the growth or survival of M. tuberculosis in vitro. In conjunction with the results of whole-genome expression profiling, this finding was indicative of their functional redundancy. In this study, we demonstrate that the single deletion mutants are phenotypically similar to wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vivo. The deletion of individual rpf-like genes had no discernible effect on the growth or long-term survival of M. tuberculosis in liquid culture, and the ability to resuscitate spontaneously from a nonculturable state in a most probable number assay was also unaffected for the three strains tested (the Delta rpfB, Delta rpfD, and Delta rpfE strains). In contrast, two multiple strains, KDT8 (Delta rpfA-mutation Delta rpfC Delta rpfB) and KDT9 (Delta rpfA Delta rpfC Delta rpfD), which lack three of the five rpf-like genes, were significantly yet differentially attenuated in a mouse infection model. These mutants were also unable to resuscitate spontaneously in vitro, demonstrating the importance of the Rpf-like proteins of M. tuberculosis in resuscitation from the nonculturable state. These results strongly suggest that the biological functions of the five rpf-like genes of M. tuberculosis are not wholly redundant and underscore the potential utility of these proteins as targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Chronic health conditions and survival after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest
T2  - HEART
AB  - Objective: To investigate whether chronic clinical comorbidity, as collected from emergency medical services ( EMS) reports, influences survival after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation ( VF) cardiac arrest.
   Methods: In this observational retrospective cohort study in King County, Washington, USA 1043 people who suffered out-of-hospital VF arrest due to heart disease between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2003 were studied. Chronic conditions were ascertained and tallied from EMS reports using a uniform abstraction form by people blinded to outcome status. The outcome was survival to hospital discharge.
   Results: 75% ( 776/1043) of patients had at least one chronic health condition and 51% ( 529/1043) had prior clinically recognised heart disease. Overall, the increasing count of chronic conditions was inversely associated with the odds of survival to hospital discharge after adjustment for potential confounders ( OR 0.84 ( 95% Cl 0.74 to 0.95) for each additional chronic condition). The chronic condition-outcome association tended to be more prominent among those with longer EMS response intervals ( p = 0.07 for interaction term between condition count and response interval). For example, the OR of survival was 0.72 ( 95% Cl 0.59 to 0.88) for each additional chronic condition when the EMS response interval was 8 min compared with an OR of 0.95 ( 95% Cl 0.79 to 1.14) when the EMS response interval was 3 min.
   Conclusion: In this cohort, an increasing burden of clinical comorbidity based on a review of EMS reports was associated with a lower odds of survival after VF arrest. This finding suggests that chronic conditions influence arrest pathophysiology and in turn could help guide resuscitation care.

TI  - Ethical aspects of emergency medicine
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - Objective: Thirty years ago, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Today, CPR is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function. Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost. The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital Resuscitation.
   Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment. According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions. The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a per son is suffering from circulatory arrest. The decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive CPR. Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles. The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare. Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past. Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence. There is potential harm in CPR. Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years. In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility. However, futility should be defined in a strict fashion, as there might be an individual chance of survival. The principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment, which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness. The time frame in CPR requires medical decision-making within seconds, and CPR is usually initiated without the patient's involvement. If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time. Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene. The principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources. The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.
   Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR. However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine. Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.

TI  - Outcome Measurement in Children With a History of Disorders of Consciousness After Severe Brain Injury: Telephone Administration of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition, and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Pediatric Revision
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES:Examine initial feasibility and utility of a battery of measures administered via telephone interview with a caregiver for describing long-term outcomes in individuals with a history of disorders of consciousness (DoC) after pediatric acquired brain injury (ABI). DESIGN:Cross-sectional. SETTING:Caregiver interview administered via telephone. PATIENTS:Convenience sample admitted to an inpatient pediatric neurorehabilitation unit with DoC after ABI at least 1 year prior to assessment (n = 41, 5-22 yr old at assessment). INTERVENTIONS:None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3), and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Pediatric Revision (GOS-E Peds) were examined. Administration time of the Vineland-3 ranged from 13 to 101 minutes (m = 50) and the GOS-E Peds ranged from 2 to 10 minutes (m = 3). Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) ranged from standard scores (SSs) of 20 (exceptionally low) to 100 (average) and GOS-E Peds scores ranged from 3 (i.e., upper moderate disability) to 7 (vegetative state). Lower adaptive functioning on the Vineland-3 ABC was strongly associated with greater disability on the GOS-E Peds (r = -0.805). On the Vineland-3 ABC, 19.5% earned the lowest possible score, whereas 12.2% obtained the lowest possible score for survivors on the GOS-E Peds; only 7.3% earned lowest scores on both measures. CONCLUSIONS:The Vineland-3 and GOS-E Peds were feasibly administered by telephone and were complementary in this cohort; the GOS-E provided a quick and easy measure of gross functional outcome, whereas the Vineland-3 took longer to administer but provided a greater level of detail about functioning. When both measures were used together, the range and variability of scores were maximized.

TI  - Update in Hospital Medicine: Evidence You Should Know
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice of hospital medicine is complex, and the number of clinical publications each year continues to grow. To maintain best practice it is necessary for hospitalists to stay abreast of the literature, but difficult to accomplish due to time. The annual Society of Hospital Medicine meeting offers a plenary session on Updates in Hospital Medicine. This article is a summary of those papers presented at the meeting.
   METHODS: We reviewed articles published between January 2014 and January 2015 in the leading medical journals, searching for papers with good methodological quality, the potential to change practice, and papers that are thought provoking. The authors collectively agreed on 14 articles. The findings, cautions, and implications are discussed for each paper.
   RESULTS: Key findings include: a novel neprilysin inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker combination drug reduces mortality in patients with heart failure; the concern for acute kidney injury after venous contrast may be overstated; the Confusion Assessment Method Severity score is an important tool for prognostication in delirious patients; ramelteon shows promise for lowering incident delirium among elderly medical patients; polyethylene glycol appears effective in rapidly resolving hepatic encephalopathy; cirrhotic patients on a nonselective beta-blocker have increased mortality after they develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; current guidelines regarding prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in medical inpatients likely result in nonbeneficial use of medications; from a safety and efficacy perspective, direct oral anticoagulants perform quite well against conventional therapies in patients with VTE and atrial fibrillation, including in elderly populations; 2 new once-weekly antibiotics, dalbavancin and oritivancin, approved for skin and soft tissue infections, appear noninferior to vancomycin; offering family members of a patient undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation the opportunity to observe has durable impact on long-term psychological outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: This update reviews key clinical articles published in 2014, selected by the authors for their methodological quality and potential for changing the practice of inpatient physicians. All of these articles add to the body of inpatient medical knowledge and contribute to the debate on best practices. (C) 2015 Society of Hospital Medicine

TI  - Reduction in hospital-wide mortality after implementation of a rapidresponse team: a long-term cohort study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Rapid response teams (RRTs) have been shown to reduce cardiopulmonary arrests outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Yet the utility of RRTs remains in question, as most large studies have failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in hospital-wide mortality after RRT implementation.
   Methods: A cohort design with historical controls was used to determine the effect on hospital-wide mortality of an RRT in which clinical judgment, in addition to vital-signs criteria, was widely promoted as a key trigger for activation. All nonprisoner patients admitted to a tertiary referral public teaching hospital from 2003 through 2008 were included. In total, 77, 021 admissions before RRT implementation (2003 through 2005) and 79, 013 admissions after RRT implementation (2006 through 2008) were evaluated. The a priori primary outcome was unadjusted hospital-wide mortality. A Poisson regression model was then used to adjust for hospital-wide mortality trends over time. Secondary outcomes defined a priori were unadjusted out of ICU mortality and out of ICU cardiopulmonary arrest codes.
   Results: In total, 855 inpatient RRTs (10.8 per 1,000 hospital-wide discharges) were activated during the 3-year postintervention period. Forty-seven percent of RRTs were activated for reasons of clinical judgment. Hospital-wide mortality decreased from 15.50 to 13.74 deaths per 1,000 discharges after RRT implementation (relative risk, 0.887; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.817 to 0.963; P = 0.004). After adjusting for inpatient mortality trends over time, the reduction in hospital-wide mortality remained statistically significant (relative risk, 0.825; 95% CI, 0.694 to 0.981; P = 0.029). Out-of-ICU mortality decreased from 7.08 to 4.61 deaths per 1, 000 discharges (relative risk, 0.651; 95% CI, 0.570 to 0.743; P < 0.001). Out-of-ICU cardiopulmonary-arrest codes decreased from 3.28 to 1.62 codes per 1, 000 discharges (relative risk, 0.493; 95% CI, 0.399 to 0.610; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Implementation of an RRT in which clinical judgment, in addition to vital-signs criteria, was widely cited as a rationale for activation, was associated with a significant reduction in hospital-wide mortality, out-of-ICU mortality, and out-of-ICU cardiopulmonary-arrest codes. The frequent use of clinical judgment as a criterion for RRT activation was associated with high RRT utilization.

TI  - Regular in-situ simulation training of paediatric Medical Emergency Team leads to sustained improvements in hospital response to deteriorating patients, improved outcomes in intensive care and financial savings
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim of the study: The introduction of a paediatric Medical Emergency Team (pMET) was accompanied by weekly in-situ simulation team training. Key ward staff participated in team training, focusing on recognition of the deteriorating child, teamwork and early involvement of senior staff. Following an earlier study [1], this investigation aimed to evaluate the long-term impact of ongoing regular team training on hospital response to deteriorating ward patients, patient outcome and financial implications.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study of all deteriorating in-patients in a tertiary paediatric hospital requiring admission to paediatric intensive care (PICU) the year before, 1 year after and 3 years after the introduction of pMET and team training.
   Results: Deteriorating patients were recognised more promptly (before/1year after/3years after pMET; median time 4/1.5/0.5h, p < 0.001), more often reviewed by consultants (45%/ 76%/81%, p < 0.001) and more rapidly escalated to PICU (median time 10.5/5/3.5h, p = 0.02). There was a significant reduction in associated PICU admissions (56/51/32, p = 0.02) and PICU bed days (527/336/193, p < 0.001). The total annual cost of training ( pound 74,250) was more than offset by savings from reduced PICU bed days ( pound 801,600 per annum). Introduction of pMET coincided with significantly reduced hospital mortality (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: These results indicate that lessons learnt by ward staff during team training led to sustained improvements in the hospital response to critically deteriorating in-patients, significantly improved patient outcomes and substantial savings. Integration of regular in-situ simulation training of medical emergency teams, including key ward staff, in routine clinical care has potential application in all acute specialties.

TI  - HYPERBARIC OXYGENATION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CERTAIN AFFECTIONS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM
T2  - KLINICHESKAYA MEDITSINA
AB  - Posthypoxic conditions of the central nervous system (CNS) were successfully treated by hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). Air embolism should be managed by high pressure of compressed air during decompression (beginning with 2.8 ATA), in addition to HBO. Favourable effects were obtained in 39 of the 48 patients when this therapy was employed. The effect was less favourable when only HBO was employed. It has been established that HBO contributes to consciousness recovery and to a lesser degree affects regress of focal neurological abnormalities in cerebrovascular thrombosis and embolism. HBO produces a favourable effect in short-term circulatory arrest. The mortality rate significantly decreases when HBO is used in the early hours of this affection. HBO also stabilizes hemodynamics and promotes correction of respiratory disorders, the processes of functional recovery of the intimately connected DNS and extracerebral systems. Dog experiment with prolonged circulatory arrest due to electroshock and acute blood loss have demonstrated that HBO contributes to the correction of lactate-acidotic-blood disorders and rapid compensation of neurological abnormalities in animals with early functional CNS recovery, while in animals with later CNS functional recovery after long-term circulatory arrest HBO fails to produce a favourable affect on the final outcome of resuscitation measures. Thus, HBO can be recommended for use in combination with other measures for treating posthypoxic CNS conditions.

TI  - Giant angiolipoma of the back complicated with ulceration and sepsis: unusual presentation of a rare benign tumour
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
AB  - A 63-year-old woman presented to the emergency unit with a huge (40 x 35 x 10 cm) oval-shaped pedunculated growth in the back with superficial ulceration in its lower aspect, associated with signs of sepsis. After adequate resuscitation, the patient was transferred to the operation theatre where the tumour was completely excised and the resultant wound was closed in primary manner using polypropylene sutures with suction drains inserted in the wound bed. The patient was discharged home after two days and was followed-up for two months. No wound complications were recorded on follow-up.
   Angiolipoma is a benign variant of lipoma that, despite what has been reported in the literature, may affect any age and any region of the body. Complications of angiolipoma may include ulceration, sepsis, gangrene and possible systemic inflammatory response syndrome which may pose a threat to the patient's life, hence should be managed promptly after adequate patient preparation.

TI  - Field termination of resuscitation: Analysis of a newly implemented protocol
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
CP  - Annual Meeting of the National-Association-of-EMS-Physicians
AB  - Introduction. Earlier work has shown the safety of termination-of-resuscitation (TOR) protocols for traumatic and nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). This study examined the implementation of these protocols in one urban/suburban EMS system. The objective was to determine how often patients are transported to the ED despite meeting TOR criteria. Methods. All adult OOHCA patients transported to two EDs during a 3.5-year interval were retrospectively identified through dispatch and hospital records. EMS and ED records were evaluated to assess for the presence of TOR protocol criteria and to determine whether the patients should have been transported or pronounced dead on scene. Records were also examined for documentation of mitigating circumstances that might have prompted transport despite meeting TOR criteria. Results. 865 OOHCA patients were identified; 235 met study criteria. Of these, 131 (56%) met TOR criteria but were transported anyway. All expired in the ED or in the hospital (131/131 = 100%, 95% CI: 97.7-100) Of the 43 traumatic OOHCA patients, 27 (63%) met TOR criteria, yet were transported, and all expired in the ED (27/27 = 100%, 95% CI: 89.5-100). Of the 192 nontraumatic OOHCA patients, 104 (54%) met TOR criteria, yet were transported, and all expired in the ED or in the hospital (104/104 = 100%, 95% CI: 97.2-100). In no case was a mitigating circumstance documented to justify transporting a patient meeting TOR criteria. Conclusions. Termination-of-resuscitation protocols are not being implemented as intended in this EMS system: more than half of cardiac arrest patients meeting criteria for termination of resuscitation were transported anyway. These protocol violations result in emergency transport to the ED for a substantial number of patients for whom continued resuscitative efforts are futile: no patient who met TOR criteria in this sample survived to discharge.

TI  - DIRECT PERITONEAL RESUSCITATION ALTERS LEUKOCYTE INFILTRATION IN THE LUNG AFTER ACUTE BRAIN DEATH
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Background: Brain death is associated with significant lung injury and inflammation. This has been associated with worse long-term outcomes for transplanted lungs. Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) reduces systemic inflammation in brain death and improves lung procurement rate. The effect of DPR on macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs is not known. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats had a 4F Fogarty catheter inserted into the skull and the balloon inflated until brain death was achieved. Rats were resuscitated with normal saline to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 80mmHg (targeted intravenous fluid, TIVF) and DPR animals received an intraperitoneal injection of commercial peritoneal dialysis solution. Rats were sacrificed at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after brain death. Protein levels were assessed using quantitative ELISA. Leukocyteswere quantified using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: At all time points, DPR downregulated multiple inflammatory cytokines including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1a, and IL-6. Adhesion molecules ICAM, E-selectin, and P-selectin were increased above sham at 4 and 6 h after brain death and reduced with DPR, whereas VCAM was reduced at 2 and 6 h. Infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils were trended downward at 6 h with DPR, though this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Animals that received TIVF alone had significant increases in inflammatory cytokines within the lung tissue, leading to adhesion molecule expression and ultimately leukocyte infiltration. Each stage of inflammation was affected by DPR. Using DPR in brain dead organ donors shows promise as a way to reduce lung injury and inflammation.

TI  - Outcomes of Extracorporeal Life Support Use in Accidental Hypothermia: A Systematic Review
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Background. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been used in the treatment of accidental hypothermia with hemodynamic instability, with promising outcomes. This systematic review examines ECLS treatment of accidental hypothermia to assess outcomes.
   Methods. An electronic search was performed to identify articles reporting ECLS use for treatment of accidental hypothermia. Only reports describing patients aged more than 16 years after January 1, 2005, were included. Nineteen studies were identified comprising 47 patients. Demographic information, perioperative variables, and outcomes were extracted for analysis.
   Results. Median patient age was 48 years (interquartile range (IQR), 29 to 56), and 72.3% (34 of 47) were male. On presentation, median body temperature was 24.6 degrees C (IQR, 22.2 degrees to 26 degrees C), median potassium level 4.3 mmol/L (IQR, 3.4 to 4.6 mmol/L), and median Glasgow Coma Scale score 3 (IQR, 3 to 7). Cardiac arrest occurred in 35 of 47 patients (74.5%). Median time to ECLS initiation from scene was 155 minutes (IQR, 113 to 245). Median ECLS duration was 18 hours (IQR, 4 to 27), with median rewarming rate of 2 degrees C per hour (IQR, 1.5 degrees to 4 degrees). Median intensive care unit stay and hospital length of stay were 8 days (IQR, 2 to 16) and 17 days (IQR, 10 to 36), respectively. Inhospital mortality was 19.1% (9 of 47). Median discharge Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (IQR, 15 to 15) with minor long-term cognitive impairments noted in 6 of 47 patients (19.4%). Survival was significantly associated with potassium on presentation (P < .001), initial body temperature (P < .001), and ECLS rewarming rate (P < .001).
   Conclusions. Extracorporeal life support is a viable cardiac support option for rewarming patients with accidental hypothermia, and initial potassium level, initial body temperature, and ECLS rewarming rate appear to be significantly associated with survival.

TI  - Intranasal Delivery of a Caspase-1 Inhibitor in the Treatment of Global Cerebral Ischemia
T2  - MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Caspase-1 is an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation, a critical component of many diseases that affect neuronal degeneration. However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI.

TI  - Obstetric, child health outcomes, trends and readmissions for term women birthing in South-West Sydney (2001-2016): A linked data population-based study
T2  - SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore obstetric outcomes and postpartum readmissions of women and infants in an area in NSW, serving women who are from lower socio-economic and culturally diverse backgrounds. Methods: A linked data population-based study was conducted of women living in South-West Sydney Local Health District. Registry data on women giving birth to singleton infants between 37 + 0-41 + 6 weeks gestation, between January 1st 2001-December 31st 2016, was utilised and analysed. Results: In total data of 130 533 singleton term pregnancies were analysed with rates differing by health status as follows: healthy (11.6%), maternal diabetes (8.3%), hypertensive disease (10.1%), maternal diabetes and hypertensive disease (8.2%), psychological disorders/diseases (40.5%), or psychological diseases with either diabetes or hypertension (28.1%). When compared to women with healthy pregnancies, women with complex pregnancies were more likely to have an induction of labour, epidural anaesthesia, caesarean section, early term births and poor foetal growth, and infants had higher rates of asphyxiation and need for major resuscitation. Postnatally, women with complex pregnancies and their infants were more frequently readmitted to the hospital in the year following birth, both in the short- and longer-term. Additionally, the change in glucose cut-offs in 2014 led to a significant increase in gestational diabetes diagnosis. Conclusion: Overall, women with complicated pregnancies in the South-West Sydney Local Health District faced significantly more adverse obstetric and child outcomes, with increased hospital readmissions within the first year postpartum.

TI  - Progress in the Application of Molecular Hydrogen in Medical Skin Cosmetology
T2  - CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Molecular hydrogen is a colorless, tasteless, biologically active small-molecule gas with reducing properties, demonstrating therapeutic and preventive effects across various human systems. Its mechanisms of action include selective antioxidation, antiinflammatory effects, apoptosis inhibition, and the regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways. In the skin, molecular hydrogen reduces oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting oxidative stress, leading to improvements in texture and tone. It also regulates the inflammatory response, alleviating redness, itching, and discomfort, while promoting skin repair and regeneration. Moreover, hydrogen activates antioxidant enzymes in skin cells, boosting their antioxidant capacity and delaying aging. Clinical trials show that molecular hydrogen significantly improves conditions like acne, chloasma, and skin sensitivity. However, research in skin cosmetology remains in its early stages, with unanswered questions regarding mechanisms of action, optimal dosage, and long-term safety. Further investigation through clinical trials is essential for expanding its applications in this field. Molecular hydrogen holds significant promise in skin cosmetology, and as research and technology evolve, it is expected to drive innovations and breakthroughs in skin care. This review examines the therapeutic potential, mechanisms, and clinical applications of molecular hydrogen in skin cosmetology, addressing challenges and proposing pathways for future advancements in this field.

TI  - Relationships between institutional success and length of tenure in a Kenyan irrigation scheme
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - In a context of higher reliance on irrigation schemes to ensure food security, it is crucial to understand institutional success of water resource management. In addition to other factors explored in great depth by the CPR literature, the actions of long-term appropriators contribute to the success of institutions. However, only a limited amount of work has attempted to examine the actual relationship between length of tenure and institutional success. To examine these relationships, we analyze a long-enduring CPR, the Mwea irrigation scheme (MIS) in Kenya, a network created in the 1950s and whose appropriators have held different lengths of tenure. We explore payment of operation and maintenance (O&M) fees of 71 irrigation units over two consecutive years. We examine 422 household surveys in eight out of the 71 irrigation units on the practice of institutions. We find that length of tenure impacts institutional success by influencing the behaviors of appropriators. Appropriators with longer tenure promote institutional success by provisioning the resource in a more sustainable manner through achieving high payments of O&M fees. Relatively dissatisfied with the implementation of the rules, they use formal and informal means to criticize institutions and to promote institutional change and adaptation. In contrast, appropriators with shorter tenure achieve lower payments of O&M fees, they complain less, and are more satisfied with the existing implementation of the rules. They are satisfied with the status quo. Hence, it is through the pressure of experienced appropriators that institutions such as the MIS evolve and adapt to become more successful.

TI  - CHANGES IN DECISIONS BY ELDERLY PERSONS BASED ON TREATMENT DESCRIPTION
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: We examined hypotheses that elderly persons refusing minimally described treatment might choose nonaggressive treatment if options were described, and that persons refusing treatment would want an active decision-making role.
   Methods: One hundred fifty-one of 260 elderly volunteers recruited from 10 urban and suburban nutrition sites completed a self-administered questionnaire asking whether they would accept treatment of pneumonia in their current health status, in physical incapacity by stroke, or in early or late Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, treatment choices ranging from oral antibiotics to ventilator use for severe pneumonia were described, and subjects again chose treatment for each situation. For each choice, subjects were asked who they wanted to make the decision.
   Results: One hundred sixteen subjects (75% women, 78% white) passed a comprehension quiz about pneumonia, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. When asked to decide on treatment of pneumonia before descriptions of treatment, 1.8% refused treatment in their current state of health, 29.8% in stroke, and 41.3% and 65.7% in early and late Alzheimer's disease, respectively. When treatment choices ranging from oral antibiotics to ventilator treatment were offered, treatment refusal was significantly less in the comorbid situations at 21.7% for stroke, and 30.8% and 51.4% for early and late Alzheimer's disease. However, less aggressive treatment was not chosen more often by persons who had initially refused treatment. For each comorbidity more refusers than accepters chose to be the decision maker.
   Conclusions: Elderly persons are more likely to refuse treatment in situations of severe comorbidities, but accept treatment more often when different options are explained. Refusers may want a strong role in the decision.

TI  - Quality of BLS decreases with increasing resuscitation complexity
T2  - RESUSCITATION
CP  - 77th Scientific Meeting of the American-Heart-Association
AB  - Objective: Multiple procedures performed in parallel may cause each procedure to be performed less effectively than if performed in isolation. BLS performed by pre-hospital providers potentially includes artificial ventilations, chest compressions, and application of an automated external defibrillator (AED). This study examines the effectiveness of artificial ventilation and chest compressions both with and without an AED.
   Methods: Thirty-six prehospital providers participated in a prospective observational study. Tested in pairs (n = 18), subjects randomly completed three, 6-min scenarios [apneic patient with a pulse (VENT), a pulseless patient (CPR), and a pulseless patient with an AED available (CPR + AED)]. A full-torso manikin capable of generating a carotid pulse was connected to a computer to record number of ventilations, tidal volume, flow rate, number of compressions, and compression depth. Data were analyzed by t-test, ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U-test.
   Results: Artificial ventilation performed in isolation provided more correct ventilations than during CPR or CPR + AED (25.7%, 14.2%, 13.7%, p = 0.02). Fewer ventilations were delivered during CPR and CPR + AED (p = 0.03). More compressions were delivered with CPR alone vs. CPR + AED (51.9, 35.7 min(-1), p = 0.00). More correct compressions were delivered during CPR atone vs. CPR + AED (p = 0.05).
   Conclusions: Both the quality and quantity of BLS decreases as the number of procedures performed simultaneously increases. Further decrements might occur when ALS skills enter into resuscitation. These results suggest a need to automate and/or prompt the performance of BLS to optimize resuscitation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spinal cord infarction during venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB  - Spinal cord infarction (SCI) is a rare disease among central nervous system vascular diseases. Only a little is known about venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO)-related SCI. Retrospective observational study conducted, from 2006 to 2019, in a tertiary referral center on patients who developed VA-ECMO-related neurovascular complications, focusing on SCI. During this period, among the 1893 patients requiring VA-ECMO support, 112 (5.9%) developed an ECMO-related neurovascular injury: 65 (3.4%) ischemic strokes, 40 (2.1%) intracranial bleeding, one cerebral thrombophlebitis (0.05%) and 6 (0.3%) spinal cord infarction. Herein, we report a series of six patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest receiving circulatory support with VA-ECMO who developed subsequent SCI during ECMO course, confirmed by spine MRI after ECMO withdrawal. All six patients had long-term neurological disabilities. VA-ECMO-related SCI is a rare but catastrophic complication. Its diagnosis is usually delayed due to sedation requirement and/or ICU acquired weakness after sedation withdrawal, leading to difficulties in monitoring their neurological status. Even if no specific treatment exist for SCI, its prompt diagnosis is mandatory, to prevent secondary spine insults of systemic origin. Based on these results, we suggest that daily sedation interruption and neurological exam of the lower limbs should be performed in all VA-ECMO patients. Large registries are mandatory to determine VA-ECMO-related SCI risk factor and potential therapy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATAL & NEONATAL NURSING
AB  - The S.T.A.B.L.E.(R) Program is the first neonatal continuing education program to focus exclusively on the post-resuscitation/pre-transport stabilization care of sick infants. Neonatal Resuscitation Program provides the requisite education for healthcare providers to safely and systematically resuscitate neonates. However, those infants who require resuscitation also require ongoing care to decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality. The S.T.A.B.L.E. Program provides all members of the neonatal healthcare team with the knowledge needed to render necessary care to infants who are under post-resuscitation or pre-transport stabilization care. Utilizing an organized approach, the S.T.A.B.L.E. Program facilitates the care process by prompting healthcare providers to focus on specific areas of care. This article provides an overview of (1) the history of the S.T.A.B.L.E. Program, (2) the philosophy and goals of the program, (3) a course overview of individual modules, (4) acceptance and recognition of the program in the healthcare community, (5) the target audience, and (6) administration of the course.

TI  - Prognostication of neurologic outcome using gray-white-matter-ratio in comatose patients after cardiac arrest
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background This study aimed to assess the prognostic value regarding neurologic outcome of CT neuroimaging based Gray-White-Matter-Ratio measurement in patients after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Methods We retrospectively evaluated CT neuroimaging studies of 91 comatose patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest and 46 non-comatose controls. We tested the diagnostic performance of Gray-White-Matter-Ratio compared with established morphologic signs of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, e. g. loss of distinction between gray and white matter, and laboratory parameters, i. e. neuron-specific enolase, for the prediction of poor neurologic outcomes after resuscitated cardiac arrest. Primary endpoint was neurologic function assessed with cerebral performance category score 30 days after the index event. Results Gray-White-Matter-Ratio showed encouraging interobserver variability (ICC 0.670 [95% CI: 0.592-0.741] compared to assessment of established morphologic signs of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (Fleiss kappa 0.389 [95% CI: 0.320-0.457]) in CT neuroimaging studies. It correlated with cerebral performance category score with lower Gray-White-Matter-Ratios associated with unfavourable neurologic outcomes. A cut-off of 1.17 derived from the control population predicted unfavourable neurologic outcomes in adult survivors of cardiac arrest with 100% specificity, 50.3% sensitivity, 100% positive predictive value, and 39.3% negative predictive value. Gray-White-Matter-Ratio prognostic power depended on the time interval between circulatory arrest and CT imaging, with increasing sensitivity the later the image acquisition was executed. Conclusions A reduced Gray-White-Matter-Ratio is a highly specific prognostic marker of poor neurologic outcomes early after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Sensitivity seems to be dependent on the time interval between circulatory arrest and image acquisition, with limited value within the first 12 h.

TI  - Neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest in the light of targeted temperature management
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose of review
   Delayed awakening after targeted temperature management (TTM) and sedation is frequent among cardiac arrest patients. Differentiating between prolonged coma and irreversible cerebral damage can be challenging, therefore the utilization of a multimodal approach is recommended by international guidelines. Here, we discuss indications and advantages/disadvantages of available modalities for coma prognostication and describe new tools to improve our accuracy for outcome prediction.
   Recent findings
   Studies from the TTM era confirmed that combining neurological examination with electrophysiological assessment [electroencephalography (EEG) and somato-sensory evoked potentials (SSEP)] greatly improves coma prognostication. This combination is nowadays recognized as the most useful by many clinicians and appears widely applicable as part of initial patient assessment. Additional tests (serum neuron specific enolase and neuroimaging) may be most useful to orient clinical decisions in patients with prolonged coma. Advanced analysis of EEG and SSEP recordings and the emergence of quantitative pupillometry hold great promise.
   Summary
   Multimodal prognostication offers a comprehensive approach of anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and is increasingly used in postresuscitation care. Worldwide implementation and future advancements of available modalities, together with the increasing use of novel automated devices for quantitative neurological examination, may further optimize prognostic accuracy in the early ICU phase following cardiac arrest.

TI  - The Most Relevant Factors Affecting the Perioperative Death Rate in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and COVID-19, Based on Annual Follow-Up in the ORPKI Registry
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting the functioning of the entire healthcare system. The disease itself may be associated with thromboembolic complications. The purpose of this study is to compare patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and patients with ACS who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in terms of their clinical profile, management, treatment complications, and prognosis. Methods: We analyzed 47,940 cases of patients treated for ACS in 2020, including 44,952 patients (93.8%) who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 and 2988 patients (6.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19. Results: Patients with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to experience out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (7.9 vs. 1.1%; p < 0.0001) and be transported directly to a catheterization laboratory (21.3% vs. 8.1%; p < 0.0001). Mortality was significantly higher in this group (0.9% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.0001). The risk of perioperative death was increased by age over 65 years, use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI IIb/IIIa), femoral access, critical left main stem coronary artery (LMCA) vascular lesions, ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and no-reflow phenomenon. Conclusions: Despite the pandemic, patients with COVID-19 were treated equally to healthy patients. Efficient organization of the healthcare system allowed the prompt transportation of patients to catheterization laboratories. The study group was characterized by a worse prognosis that was affected by multiple factors.

TI  - Sulforaphane improves post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting cardiomyocytes ferroptosis via the Nrf2/IRF1/GPX4 pathway
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Background: Ferroptosis is an important type of cell death contributing to myocardial dysfunction induced by whole body ischemia reperfusion following cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation. Sulforaphane (SFN), known as the activator of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), has been proven to effectively alleviate regional myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. The present study was designed to investigate whether SFN could improve post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting cardiomyocytes ferroptosis and its potential regulatory mechanism. Methods and results: An in vivo pig model of CA and resuscitation was established. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)stimulated AC16 cardiomyocytes was constructed as an in vitro model to simulate the process of CA and resuscitation. In vitro experiment, SFN reduced ferroptosis-related ferrous iron, lipid reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde, increased glutathione, and further promoted cell survival after H/R stimulation in AC16 cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, the activation of Nrf2 with the SFN decreased interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression, then reduced its binding to the promoter of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and finally recovered the latter's transcription after H/R stimulation in AC16 cardiomyocytes. In vivo experiment, SFN reversed abnormal expression of IRF1 and GPX4, inhibited cardiac ferroptosis, and improved myocardial dysfunction after CA and resuscitation in pigs. Conclusions: SFN could effectively improve myocardial dysfunction after CA and resuscitation, in which the mechanism was potentially related to the inhibition of cardiomyocytes ferroptosis through the regulation of Nrf2/IRF1/GPX4 pathway.

TI  - Mild resuscitative hypothermia and outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Recovery without residual neurological damage after cardiac arrest with global cerebral ischemia is still a rare event. Severe impairment of bodily or cognitive functions is often the result. The individual, emotional, and social aspects of brain damage and rehabilitation are seldom taken into account. Efforts to improve the prevention of brain damage immediately after successful resuscitation of patients are missing. The efficacy of hypothermia in preserving neurologic function when instituted before and during certain no-flow cardiovascular states has been well documented both clinically and experimentally since the 1950s. Most studies have used moderate (28-33 degrees C) to deep (20-28 degrees C) hypothermia to demonstrate these protective effects. Considering the use of hypothermia for preservation and resuscitation, the lack of controlled outcome trials, the long period of time required to reach therapeutic hypothermia, and the incidence of rewarming complications such as infection, arrhythmia, and coagulopathy have made it difficult to apply these methods to emergency situations such as cardiac arrest. Recent experimental evidence in dogs has shown that hypothermia induced after cardiac arrest does indeed mitigate the effects of the postresuscitation syndrome and improves neurologic function and reduces histologic brain damage. More importantly, such benefits can be demonstrated with mild (34-36 degrees C) hypothermia thus minimizing complications and requiring less time for induction of hypothermia. Ice water nasal lavage, direct carotid infusion of cold fluids, use of a cooling helmet, and peritoneal cooling are promising techniques for clinical cerebral cooling. External auditory canal temperature (e.g., tympanic membrane temperature changes) could provide an approximation to brain temperatures. For accurate temperature monitoring, however, a central pulmonary artery thermistor probe should be inserted. Temperature monitoring is needed to avoid temperature <30 degrees C. Mild hypothermia may prove to be an important and secure component for cerebral preservation and resuscitation during and after global ischemia; it may also prove to be a useful method of cerebral resuscitation after global ischemic states, thereby promoting the prevention of neuromental diseases.

TI  - HEAD TRAUMA IN THE CAT 1. Assessment and management of craniofacial injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB  - Practical relevance Feline trauma is commonly seen in general practice and frequently involves damage to the head.
   Clinical challenges While craniofacial injuries following trauma vary widely in severity, affected cats can often be severely compromised in terms of their neurological, respiratory and cardiovascular status, and their management can be challenging in both the short and long term. They need prompt stabilisation and careful monitoring in the initial period to maximise prospects of a successful outcome. Many cats with severe facial trauma will require surgery to stabilise skull fractures or address injuries to the eyes, with its inherent issues surrounding pain management, ensuring adequate nutrition and the necessity for ongoing hospitalisation.
   Diagnostics Cats with head trauma benefit from imaging of the injured areas as well as thoracic radiography. Imaging the skull can be challenging and is best performed under general anaesthesia. In unstable patients this can be delayed to prevent any associated morbidity.
   Evidence base The clinical evidence base relating to injury to the feline head is limited, despite its relative frequency in general practice. This review focuses on the initial approach to craniofacial (in particular, ocular and jaw) trauma, and outlines simple techniques for management of soft tissue and bone injuries. Much of the information is based on the authors' clinical experience, as there is a paucity of well-described clinical case material.

TI  - Why are physicians not prescribing diuretics more frequently in the management of hypertension?
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Diuretics have again been recommended by the Sixth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) as one of the first-choice medications in the management of hypertension. This recommendation is based on the results of numerous randomized, diuretic-based, long-term controlled clinical trials that have demonstrated a reduction in both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular morbidity. Despite this and other national recommendations, the use of diuretics has steadily decreased over the past 15 years. Reasons include heavy promotion of other medications and the perception that diuretics produce adverse metabolic effects and do not reduce coronary heart disease events. Data, however, indicate that (1) changes in glucose and cholesterol metabolism are minor, especially with the smaller doses now being used; (2) cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been reduced in hypertensive patients, even in those with hyperlipidemia or diabetes, when diuretics are used; and (3) concerns about hypokalemia-induced arrhythmias have been overstated. While special indications exist for other medications in the treatment of hypertension, for example, use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (usually in addition to a diuretic) for a patient with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy, most patients, including those with hyperlipidemia or glucose intolerance, can be effectively treated with a diuretic as initial therapy or as part of a combination regimen, Diuretics should be used more not less frequently; use of diuretics would reduce the number of resistant hypertensive patients.

TI  - Appropriate use of wearable defibrillators with multiparametric evaluation to avoid unnecessary defibrillator implantation
T2  - OPEN HEART
AB  - Introduction Wearable cardioverter-defibrillators (WCD) have emerged as a valuable tool in the management of patients at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. These devices offer a non-invasive and temporary solution, providing continuous monitoring and the potential for prompt defibrillation when needed. In this study, we explore the use of WCD and evaluate arrhythmic events through comprehensive monitoring. Methods From November 2022 to May 2024, we conducted an outpatient follow-up of 41 patients receiving WCD. Regular check-ups, remote monitoring and comprehensive echocardiography were performed to optimise a tailored therapy. Results The average age of the patients was 59.2.4 +/- 16.5 years, with 78% being male. Among the cohort, 54% had hypertension, 41% were smokers and 66% had dyslipidaemia, while 27% were diabetic. WCD was assigned according to the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists position paper focussing on the appropriate use of WCD and European Society of Cardiology guidelines on ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: 24 (58%) patients had a de novo diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, 11 (27%) patients had a recent acute coronary syndrome and ejection fraction <35%, 3 (7%) patients had a cardiac electronic device extraction and 3 (7%) patients had myocarditis with features of electrical instability. The average follow-up was 62 +/- 38 days according to specific aetiology, with a daily wearing time of 22.7 +/- 1.3 hours. No device interventions were recorded. At the end of the follow-up period, 15 patients still required an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Among these, 12 patients (29%) underwent ICD implantation. Two patients (5%) declined the procedure. Conclusions The use of WCD for patients at high risk of arrhythmias allowed to optimise therapy and limit the indications for ICD. Inappropriate implantation of ICD was avoided in 69% of patients who received WCD. The device showed a good safety profile, low incidence of device interventions and adequate patients' adherence to WCD use.

TI  - Impact of Deferred Surgical Intervention on the Outcome of External Laryngeal Trauma
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Background. External laryngeal trauma (ELT) can be a fatal injury. Proper management of ELT significantly affects patient survival and quality of life. The optimal timing of surgical intervention is controversial. In this study, we review the incidence, management, and outcome of ELT and attempt to analyze the risk factors and prognosis of this injury.
   Methods. We conducted retrospective review using prospective data collection from patients with ELT in a level I trauma center from May 2008 to May 2013. We retrieved data regarding the severity of ELT, Injury Severity Score (ISS), New Injury Severity Score (NISS), Reverse Trauma Score (RTS), surgical timing, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), hospital length of stay (HLOS), long-term outcome, and mortality. We analyzed the risk of prolonged hospitalization, adverse outcome, and mortality.
   Results. The 48 patients in this cohort had a mean age of 40.8 +/- 19.6 years. Twenty-four patients underwent operation within 48 hours, 10 patients underwent operation after 48 hours, and the other 14 patients did not require surgical intervention. A high NISS and the necessity for operation prolonged the ICU LOS and the HLOS. A high ISS and a low RTS predicted mortality. Initial phonatory impairment and the necessity of surgical intervention increased adverse outcomes.
   Conclusions. In conclusion, ELT leads to high mortality and morbidity. The mortality in our series was related to severe associated injuries and to initial physical decompensation. Proper resuscitation and aggressively physiologic compensation were more important in the initial phase. Deferred treatment was acceptable until the patients were ready for operation.

TI  - Tumor organoid biobank-new platform for medical research
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Organoids are a new type of 3D model for tumor research, which makes up for the shortcomings of cell lines and xenograft models, and promotes the development of personalized precision medicine. Long-term culture, expansion and storage of organoids provide the necessary conditions for the establishment of biobanks. Biobanks standardize the collection and preservation of normal or pathological specimens, as well as related clinical information. The tumor organoid biobank has a good quality control system, which is conducive to the clinical transformation and large-scale application of tumor organoids, such as disease modeling, new drug development and high-throughput drug screening. This article summarized the common tumor types of patient-derived organoid (PDO) biobanks and the necessary information for biobank construction, such as the number of organoids, morphology, success rate of culture and resuscitation, pathological types. In our results, we found that patient-derived tumor organoid (PDTO) biobanks were being established more and more, with the Netherlands, the United States, and China establishing the most. Biobanks of colorectal, pancreas, breast, glioma, and bladder cancers were established more, which reflected the relative maturity of culture techniques for these tumors. In addition, we provided insights on the precautions and future development direction of PDTO biobank building.

TI  - Development of a new method for the noninvasive measurement of deep body temperature without a heater
T2  - MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS
AB  - The conventional zero-heat-flow thermometer, which measures the deep body temperature from the skin surface, is widely used at present. However, this thermometer requires considerable electricity to power the electric heater that compensates for heat loss from the probe; thus, AC power is indispensable for its use. Therefore, this conventional thermometer is inconvenient for unconstrained monitoring. We have developed a new dual-heat-flux method that can measure the deep body temperature from the skin surface without a heater. Our method is convenient for unconstrained and long-term measurement because the instrument is driven by a battery and its design promotes energy conservation. Its probe consists of dual-heat-flow channels with different thermal resistances, and each heat-flow-channel has a pair of IC sensors attached on its top and bottom. The average deep body temperature measurements taken using both the dual-heat-flux and then the zero-heat-flow thermometers from the foreheads of 17 healthy subjects were 37.08 degrees C and 37.02 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the correlation coefficient between the values obtained by the 2 methods was 0.970 (p < 0.001). These results show that our method can be used for monitoring the deep body temperature as accurately as the conventional method. and it overcomes the disadvantage of the necessity of AC power supply.

TI  - Team training: implications for emergency and critical care pediatrics
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose of review
   The field of team training is quickly evolving and data are emerging to support the close relationship between effective teamwork and patient safety in medicine. This paper provides a review of the literature on team training with specific emphasis on the perspectives of emergency and critical care pediatricians.
   Recent findings
   Errors in medicine are most frequently due to an interaction of human factors like poor teamwork and poor communication rather than individual mistakes. Critical care settings and those in which patients are at the extremes of age are particularly high-risk, making emergency and critical care pediatrics a special area of concern. Team training is one approach for reducing error and enhancing patient safety. Currently, there is no single standard for team training in medicine, but multiple disciplines, including anesthesiology, emergency medicine and neonatology, have adapted key principles from other high-reliability industries such as aviation into crisis resource management training.
   Summary
   Team training holds promise to improve patient safety in pediatric emergency departments and critical care settings. We must carefully delineate the optimal instructional strategies to improve team behaviors and combine these with rigorous outcomes assessment to diagnose team problems and prescribe targeted solutions, and determine their long-term impact on patient safety.

TI  - The rationale for cardiomyocyte resuscitation in myocardial salvage
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE-JMM
AB  - Clinical heart failure results from the cumulative loss of functioning myocardium from any cause. At the cellular level, cardiac myocytes die from three causes, individually or in combination: Necrosis occurs when external conditions are not sufficient to sustain minimal cellular functions, as with ischemia, and there is a general and unorganized breakdown of cell organelles, engendering an inflammatory response that may have harmful collateral tissue effects. Apoptosis, or cell suicide, occurs when specific external or internal conditions provoke a highly structured sequence of events to shut down cellular functions and remove the cell, with minimal consequences to surrounding tissue. Autophagy is a normal response to cell starvation that is induced under conditions of chronic metabolic or other stress. Current therapeutics, such as early myocardial revascularization after myocardial infarction, are focused exclusively upon minimizing cardiac myocyte necrosis and may even contribute to secondary apoptosis and autophagy. This review explores possible approaches to bring cardiac myocytes that are destined to die, back to life, i. e., cellular resuscitation. Two pro-apoptotic proteins in particular, Bnip3 and Nix, are transcriptionally upregulated specifically in response to myocardial ischemia and pathological hypertrophy and have been examined as therapeutic targets. In Bnip3 and Nix genetic mouse models, prevention of cardiac myocyte apoptosis in ischemic and hemodynamically overloaded hearts salvaged myocardium, minimized late ventricular remodeling, and enhanced ventricular performance. Cardiomyocyte resuscitation by preventing programmed cell death shows promise as an additive approach to minimizing necrosis for long-term prevention of heart failure.

TI  - The impact of a ventilation timing light on CPR Quality: A randomized crossover study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - A ventilation timing light (VTL) is a small commercially available single-use device that is programmed to light up at six-second intervals prompting rescuers to provide a single controlled breath during manual ventilation. The device also indicates the duration of the breath by remaining illuminated for the duration of the inspiratory time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the VTL on a selection of CPR quality metrics. Methods: A total of 71 paramedic students who were already proficient in performing high-performance CPR (HPCPR) were required to perform HPCPR with and without a VTL. The quality of the HPCPR delivered, reflected by the selected quality metrics; chest compression fraction (CCF), chest compression rate (CCR), and ventilation rate (VR), was then evaluated. Results: While HPCPR with and without a VTL were both able to achieve guideline-based performance targets of CCF, CCR, and VR, the group who had used the VTL to deliver HPCPR were able to consistently provide 10 ventilations for every minute of asynchronous compressions (10 Conclusion: The use of a VTL allows for a VR target of 10 ventilations per minute to be consistently achieved without compromising guidelinebased compression fraction targets (>80%), and chest compression rates when used during the delivery of HPCPR in a simulated OHCA event.

TI  - Impact of Air Pollution on Cardiac Arrhythmia in Patients With Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators
T2  - IRANIAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Objective: Cardiac arrhythmia, a disruptor of heart rhythm, can increase hospitalizations and mortality. This study explored the impact of air pollution on arrhythmia incidence among patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in Mashhad, Iran, and its potential influence on their quality of life and risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: In 2018, a study was conducted on patients with ICDs from Imam Reza Hospital. Patients were assigned to an air pollution monitoring station based on their residential address. Arrhythmia data were collected from device interrogations during follow-up visits. A checklist was used to record meteorological data, unhealthy weather days, and levels of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). The correlation between arrhythmia and air pollutants was analyzed using time-series and spatial data analyses. Results: The study involved 194 patients (mean [SD] age =63.14 [12.34] years; 167 men and 27 women). The primary indication for ICD implantation was ischemic cardiomyopathy (70%), followed by dilated cardiomyopathy (18.6%). A total of 1163 cardiac arrhythmias were recorded, with 70% being ventricular and 30% supraventricular. A significant association was identified between the overall count of cardiac arrhythmias and the levels of NO2(P =0.034), PM5.2 (P =0.03), and CO (P =0.004). Conversely, the concentrations of SO(2 )and PM10 did not have a substantial impact on total arrhythmia occurrences. These findings imply that air pollutants such as NO2, PM2.5, and CO could potentially jeopardize cardiac health. Conclusions: We concluded that air pollutants, specifically NO2, CO, and PM2.5, influence the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia in high-risk groups such as patients with ICDs. The findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate air pollution to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in vulnerable populations.

TI  - Usefulness of telemedicine for home ventilator-dependent children
T2  - JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE
AB  - Introduction
   Medical care for ventilator-dependent children must avoid hospital confinement, which is detrimental to the patient, their family and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Our objective was to assess the role of telemedicine in facilitating early and permanent discharge of such patients to home care.
   Methods
   This was a prospective clinical study (2007-2017) in tracheotomised ventilator-dependent children. We used a Big Data Telemedicine home system (Medlinecare 2.1) from the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Specialised home-nursing services were available. Clinical events were analysed using the Chi-square test (significance p < 0.05). Families subsequently completed a satisfaction survey. The Paediatric Intensive Care Unit management indicators were analysed.
   Results
   All of our ventilator-dependent children were included (n=12). At time of discharge from the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, they all required continuous mechanical ventilation and met the criteria of groups I-III of the OTA classification. In the first two years there were 141 events; the main cause was respiratory (69.5%, p < 0.001) and telemedicine was the main care approach (86.5%, p < 0.001). Eleven events required hospitalisation (7.8%) but 38 (27.0%) hospitalisations were avoided. The emergency readmission time accounted for 0.99% of the total time. Six patients were decannulated, and one patient died due to primary cardiac arrest. All the families considered that the telemedicine had helped to avoid hospital visits, was not an intrusion into their privacy, and improved the child's safety and quality of life. An improvement in Paediatric Intensive Care Unit indicators was achieved.
   Discussion
   Telemedicine facilitated early and permanent discharge of our ventilator-dependent children to home care without affecting their quality of care.

AB  - The presented application is a cooperative game based on a theoretical model of human behavior in the Tragedy of the Commons [1], of which climate change is one of the prime examples. In this common pool resource (CPR) dilemma, climate is the common resource which bears the burden of humans extracting non-renewable energy sources. Maximizing individual resource exploitation is at odds with the group's collective profit, which is affected by the overall resource depletion. Sustainable use refers to the balance between short-term individual gains and the long term common gains while not damaging the resource. Developed at the University of Warsaw, and implemented in VR by Kiin (formerly Virtual Bodyworks), as part of the EU-funded GuestXR project, led by Dr. Mel Slater from the University of Barcelona, the game places groups of 3-5 players in a shared environment where they make critical decisions about harvesting energy cubes symbolic units of resource extraction. Players are guided by the avatar of an AI agent, GuestXR, who explains the rules and offers intermittent feedback to encourage cooperation and warn against the dangers of overuse. A mathematical model of the CPR dilemma was developed and used as the engine of the game as well as in the simulations needed to develop the Guest XR interventions. In line with economic theory, each player in our game aims to maximize their utility through resource harvesting. The dilemma of choosing the proper harvesting rate that maximizes individual total gain without external coordination poses a challenge. Based on the literature review, we identified key features that can alter the group dynamic and promote sustainable usage of the resources and included them in the model:

TI  - Neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy for resectable, locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (NIC-ESCC2019): A multicenter, phase 2 study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Optimal treatment for resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is controversial, especially in the context of potential benefit of combining PD-1 blockade with neoadjuvant therapy. This phase 2 study aimed to assess neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy in this population. Patients (clinical stage II-IVA) received two cycles of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NIC) with camrelizumab (200 mg on day 1) plus nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) in total on day 1 and day 8) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) in total on days 1-3) of each 21-day cycle. Surgery was performed approximately 6 weeks after completion of NIC. Primary endpoint was complete pathologic response (CPR) rate in primary tumor. Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate after surgery, PFS, overall survival (OS) and safety during NIC and perioperative period. Between 17 January 2020 and 8 December 2020, 56 patients were enrolled, and 51 received esophagectomy. Data cutoff date was 25 August 2021. The CPR rate was 35.3% (95% CI, 21.7%-48.9%). NIC had an ORR of 66.7% (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of low severity (grade 1-2, 75.0%; grade 3, 10.7%; grade 4-5, no). No perioperative mortality occurred. Three (5.9%) patients had tumor recurrence and one (2.0%) patient died. The 2-year PFS rate, median PFS and median OS had not been reached yet. Camrelizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable ESCC demonstrates promising efficacy with acceptable toxicity, providing a feasible and effective option. Study is ongoing for long-term survival analyses.

TI  - Association between suicide attempts and pediatric OHCA survival during the COVID-19 pandemic: Japanese cohort study
T2  - PEDIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundSuicide is a leading cause of death in children. The COVID-19 pandemic might change the characteristics, causes (medical, suicidal, accidental, and other non-medical), and outcomes of pediatric OHCA. This study aimed to investigate the impact of pediatric OHCA in age, location, and quarantine-related movement restriction subgroups.MethodsCombining the nationwide OHCA registry with the emergency medical service transportation database, we created a database with detailed information on 7657 non-neonatal, pediatric OHCA cases.ResultsThe pandemic period did not significantly alter neurologically favorable 1-month survival compared to pre-pandemic 4 years (95% confidence interval 0.73-1.00). However, the survival rate significantly decreased in the following subgroups of OHCA: school-age (0.62-0.96), outside of school or home (0.52-0.96), and cases where no quarantine-related movement restrictions were applied (0.68-0.97). There was a prominent increase in the proportion of suicide-related OHCA in these subgroups: from 30.3 to 38.1% (1.22-1.64), from 10.2 to 15.9% (1.21-2.28), and from 12.5 to 17.8% (1.30-1.77), respectively.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly alter neurologically favorable 1-month survival. However, it led to worsened survival in subgroups with higher suicide attempt rates. Prevention of suicide is likely essential in the assurance of children's lives during the pandemic.ImpactThis cohort study found that during the 2020/2021 pandemic, neurologically favorable survival decreased in school-age out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases, those not subject to quarantine-related movement restrictions, and those in locations outside of school or home.Within these three subgroups, there was a notable rise in OHCA cases related to suicide, historically known to be more challenging to manage successfully.However, survival rates for overall OHCA and medically related OHCA cases remained unchanged throughout the pandemic.Preventive measures for suicide attempts may be necessary to improve the overall survival of pediatric OHCA during the pandemic.

TI  - Cariporide minimizes adverse myocardial effects of epinephrine during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Epinephrine given during closed-chest resuscitation increases blood flow across the coronary and cerebral circuits. However, epinephrine worsens reperfusion arrhythmias and intensifies postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. We investigated whether cariporide-a selective sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 inhibitor-could ameliorate such adverse effects without diminishing its vasopressor actions.
   Design: Randomized animal study.
   Setting: University-based animal laboratory.
   Subjects: Twenty-four anesthetized male domestic pigs (29-43 kg).
   Interventions: Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced and left untreated for 8 mins. Pigs were randomized to receive after 2 mins of chest compression a 3 mg/kg bolus of cariporide (n=8), a 0.02 mg/kg bolus of epinephrine (n=8), or a combination of cariporide and epinephrine (n=8). Additional doses of epinephrine were given if the coronary perfusion pressure decreased below 15 mm Hg. Successfully resuscitated pigs were observed for 72 hrs.
   Measurements and Main Results: The averaged coronary perfusion pressure was higher in the epinephrine (34 +/- 11 mm Hg, p=.001) and cariporide/epinephrine (35 +/- 10 mm Hg, p<.001) groups compared with the cariporide group (15 +/- 6 mm Hg). All pigs in the epinephrine and cariporide/epinephrine groups but only six in the cariporide group were successfully resuscitated and survived 72 hrs. During the immediate postresuscitation period, four of eight pigs in the epinephrine group had episodes of recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia requiring additional electrical shocks (7.0 +/- 6.4) but none in the cariporide and cariporide/epinephrine groups (chi-square, p=.008). Myocardial dysfunction occurred early after return of spontaneous circulation but only in the epinephrine group.
   Conclusions: The combined administration of cariporide and epinephrine prompted adequate pressor effects during chest compression and facilitated reestablishment of cardiac activity without episodes of recurrent ventricular fibrillation or transient myocardial dysfunction as with epinephrine alone.

TI  - Choroid Plexus Enlargement in Multiple Sclerosis Correlates with Cortical and Phase Rim Lesions on 7T MRI and Predicts Progression Independent of Relapse Activity
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB  - <bold>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:</bold> In multiple sclerosis, the choroid plexus is thought to promote and sustain the disease immunopathologic inflammatory process. However, its association with cortical pathology and disease progression is still uncertain. We aimed to characterize choroid plexus enlargement and evolution in MS and its relationship with imaging markers of compartmentalized inflammation and clinical outcome. <bold>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</bold> One hundred patients with MS (74 relapsing-remitting [RRMS]; 26 secondary-progressive MS [SPMS] and 41 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent 3T MRI to measure brain volumes and 7T MRI for cortical and WM lesions, including paramagnetic rim lesion (PRL) segmentation. Choroid plexus volumes of the lateral ventricles were manually edited from FreeSurfer segmentation by 1 neurologist and normalized by total intracranial volume to estimate the choroid plexus ratio (CPR). The Expanded Disability Status Scale was assessed at baseline and longitudinally in 71 patients, 43 of whom had a follow-up MRI at 1.5 years. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm estimated the importance of CPR, alongside other imaging markers, in predicting disease phenotype (RRMS versus SPMS) and progression independent of relapse activity. <bold>RESULTS:</bold> Relative to HC, CPR was higher in patients (11.66 [3.21] versus 14.98 [4.37] x 10(-4), P = .001), both in RRMS and SPMS (P = .007, P = .003), and there was a mean similar to 4% increase per year in CPR at follow-up, though it was not significant[ (P = .14). Choroid plexus enlargement correlated with greater PRL and cortical lesion volumes (r = 0.35, P < .001). CPR did not discriminate MS phenotype but predicted progression independent of relapse activity alongside CSF subarachnoid space volume, PRL, and cortical lesion volumes (median [median absolute deviation] area under the curve 0.71 [0.12], accuracy 0.74 [0.10], sensitivity 0.81 [0.12], and specificity of 0.52 [0.22]). <bold>CONCLUSIONS:</bold> In MS, a CPR increase relates to imaging markers of compartmentalized disease activity including cortical lesions and PRLs and is a critical predictor of disease progression. Our findings could provide the rationale for implementing CPR estimation for prognosis prediction in MS.

TI  - 'Why didn't you write a not-for-cardiopulmonary resuscitation order?' Unexpected death or failure of process?
T2  - AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW
AB  - Objective. The aim of the present study was to understand the reasons for the delivery of non-beneficial cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts in a tertiary private hospital over 12 months. We determined doctors' expectations of survival after CPR for their patient, whether they had considered a not-for-resuscitation (NFR) order and the barriers to completion of NFR orders.
   Methods. Anonymous questionnaires were sent to the doctors primarily responsible for a given patient's care in the hospital within 2 weeks of the unsuccessful CPR attempt. The data were analysed quantitatively where appropriate and qualitatively for themes for open-text responses
   Results. Most doctors surveyed in the present study understood the poor outcome after CPR in the older person. Most doctors had an expectation that their own patient had a poor prognosis and a poor likely predicted outcome after CPR. This implied that the patient's death was neither unexpected nor likely to be reversible. Some doctors considered NFR orders, but multiple barriers to completion were cited, including the family's wishes, being time poor and diffusion or deferral of responsibility.
   Conclusions. It is likely that futile CPR is provided contrary to policy and legal documents relating to end-of-life care, with the potential for harms relating to both patient and family, and members of resuscitation teams. The failure appears to relate to process rather than recognition of poor patient outcome.
   What is known about the topic? Mandatory CPR has been established in Australian hospitals on the premise that it will save lives. The outcome from in-hospital cardiac arrest has not improved despite significant training and resources. The outcome for those acutely hospitalised patients aged over 80 years has been repeatedly demonstrated to be poor with significant morbidity in the survivors. There is emerging literature on the extent of the delivery of non-beneficial treatments at the end of life, including futile CPR, the recognition of harms incurred by patients, families and members of the resuscitation teams and on the opportunity cost of the inappropriate use of resources.
   What does this paper add? This is the first study, to our knowledge, that has demonstrated that doctors understood the outcomes for CPR, particularly in those aged 80 years and older, and that failure to recognise poor outcome and prognosis in their own patients is not a barrier to writing NFR orders.
   What are the implications for practitioners? Recognition of the poor outcomes from CPR for the elderly patient for whom the doctor has a duty of care should result in a discussion with the patients, allowing an exploration of values and expectations of treatment. This would promote shared decision making, which includes the use of CPR. Facilitation of these discussions should be the focus of health service review.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Traumatic Brain Injury in Modern Rodent Models: Current Status and Future Prospects
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It results in various long-term consequences, including brain atrophy, nerve damage, and significant economic costs. Traumatic brain injury is most common among working-age adults, highlighting the urgent need for improved diagnostic and treatment methods. Animal models serve as a valuable tool for studying the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and developing new treatments. These models allow researchers to control injury parameters and analyze post-traumatic effects, advancing our understanding of the condition.Abstract According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States, traumatic brain injury is among the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. The consequences of TBI include diffuse brain atrophy, local post-traumatic atrophy, arachnoiditis, pachymeningitis, meningocerebral cicatrices, cranial nerve lesions, and cranial defects. In 2019, the economic cost of injuries in the USA alone was USD 4.2 trillion, which included USD 327 billion for medical care, USD 69 billion for work loss, and USD 3.8 trillion for the value of statistical life and quality of life losses. More than half of this cost (USD 2.4 trillion) was among working-age adults (25-64 years old). Currently, the development of new diagnostic approaches and the improvement of treatment techniques require further experimental studies focused on modeling TBI of varying severity.

TI  - Pathophysiologic Mechanisms and Current Treatments for Cutaneous Sequelae of Burn Wounds
T2  - COMPREHENSIVE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Burn injuries are a pervasive clinical problem. Extensive thermal trauma can be life-threatening or result in long-lasting complications, generating a significant impact on quality of life for patients as well as a cost burden to the healthcare system. The importance of addressing global or systemic issues such as resuscitation and management of inhalation injuries is not disputed but is beyond the scope of this review, which focuses on cutaneous pathophysiologic mechanisms for current treatments, both in the acute and long-term settings. Pathophysiological mechanisms of burn progression and wound healing are mediated by highly complex cascades of cellular and biochemical events, which become dysregulated in slow-healing wounds such as burns. Burns can result in fibroproliferative scarring, skin contractures, or chronic wounds that take weeks or months to heal. Burn injuries are highly individualized owing to wound-specific differences such as burn depth and surface area, in addition to patient-specific factors including genetics, immune competency, and age. Other extrinsic complications such as microbial infection can complicate wound healing, resulting in prolonged inflammation and delayed re-epithelialization. Although mortality is decreasing with advancements in burn care, morbidity from postburn deformities continues to be a challenge. Optimizing specialized acute care and late burn outcome intervention on a patient-by-patient basis is critical for successful management of burn wounds and the associated pathological scar outcome. Understanding the fundamentals of integument physiology and the cellular processes involved in wound healing is essential for designing effective treatment strategies for burn wound care as well as development of future therapies.

TI  - Case report of dependent venous contrast pooling and layering in a patient without acute cardiogenic shock
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale: We present a case of incidental venous contrast pooling and layering in a patient without sudden cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
   Patient concerns: The patient presented with only discrete symptoms and did not suffer fatal cessation of the cardiac pump function during or shortly after the scan.
   Diagnosis: The patient showed stigmata of venous gravity-dependent pooling and layering of contrast medium, which has frequently been described as a sign of imminent cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.
   Interventions: A cardiologic consultation including echocardiography was initiated.
   Outcomes: Echocardiography confirmed valvular heart disease and biventricular heart failure. A subsequent follow-up CT acquired 8 months after the incidental finding showed no signs of dependent contrast pooling.
   Lessons: Pooling and layering of contrast medium can occur in patients not suffering acute fatal cessation of the cardiac pump function. Nonetheless, any signs of venous pooling observed in CT examinations, especially gravity-dependent layering of contrast medium, are indicative of severe heart dysfunction and should prompt immediate cardio-pulmonary monitoring and increased level of medical care.

TI  - A review of oxygen therapy in ischemic stroke
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Neuroprotective drugs have so far failed clinical trials, at high cost, and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (i.v. tPA) remains the only FDA- approved acute stroke therapy. Hyperoxia, acting via multiple direct and indirect mechanisms, may be a powerful neuroprotective strategy to salvage acutely ischemic brain tissue and extend the time window for acute stroke treatment. Of the available oxygen delivery methods, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) appears to be the most potent, while even normobaric oxygen therapy (NBO) may be effective if started promptly after stroke onset. HBO has so far failed to show efficacy in three clinical trials. The failure of these trials is probably attributable to factors such as delayed time to therapy, inadequate sample size and use of excessive chamber pressures. Previous trials did not assess long-term benefit in patients with tissue reperfusion. In this modern era of stroke thrombolysis and advanced neuroimaging, oxygen therapy may have renewed significance. If applied within the first few hours after stroke onset or in patients with imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue, oxygen therapy could be used to 'buy time' for the administration of thrombolytic or neuroprotective drugs. This article reviews the history and current rationale for using oxygen therapy in stroke, the mechanisms of action of HBO and the results of animal and human studies of hyperoxia in cerebrovascular diseases.

TI  - Upper extremity dysfunctions in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERAPY AND REHABILITATION
AB  - Background/Aims The prevalence of cardiac implantable electronic devices has risen considerably during recent years. This has revolutionised the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, which in turn reduced the incidence of sudden cardiac death. There are several complications associated with cardiac implantable electronic device implantation. Upper extremity dysfunction is one of the complications associated with this procedure and it should be addressed, since it can affect activities of daily living. This systematic review analysed the prevailing evidence pertaining to the common upper extremity dysfunctions associated with receiving a cardiac implantable electronic device.
   Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (through Cochrane) and Google Scholar for original research published in the English language. The Rayyan QCRI web application was used for study selection and the decision-making process. PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct and report this review. The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for analytic cross-sectional studies and case reports.
   Results This systematic review included eight studies with a total of 696 participants. The most common upper extremity dysfunctions associated with receiving a cardiac implantable electronic device were pain and limitation of shoulder range of motion. Limitation of range of motion could be persisted even in the long term after having a cardiac implantable electronic device implanted.
   Conclusions Contributing factors of upper extremity dysfunctions included size of the device, pectoral site of implantation and upper extremity immobilisation practices. Upper extremity dysfunction is an overlooked complication, as it received a relatively low priority, although it may negatively impact quality of life.

TI  - Effectiveness of Lay Bystander Hands-Only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation on a Mattress versus the Floor: A Randomized Cross-Over Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation increases the likelihood of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival by more than two-fold. A common barrier to the prompt initiation of compressions is moving victims to the floor, but compression quality on a "floor" versus a "mattress" has not been tested among lay bystanders.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, cross-over trial comparing lay bystander compression quality using a manikin on a bed versus the floor. Participants included adults without professional health care training. We randomized participants to the order of manikin placement, either on a mattress or on the floor. For both, participants were instructed to perform 2 minutes of chest compressions on a cardiopulmonary resuscitation Simon manikin Gaumard (Gaumard Scientific, Miami, FL). The primary outcome was mean compression depth (cm) over 2 minutes. We fit a linear regression model adjusted for scenario order, age, sex, and body mass index with robust standard errors to account for repeated measures and reported mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Our sample of 80 adults was 66% female with a mean age of 50.5 years (SD 18.2). The mean compression depth on the mattress was 2.9 cm (SD 2.3) and 3.5 cm (SD 2.2) on the floor, a mean difference of 0.58 cm (95% CI 0.18, 0.98). Compression depth fell below the 5 to 6 cm depth recommended by the American Heart Association on both surfaces. In the adjusted model, the mean depth was greater when the manikin was on the floor than the mattress (adjusted mean difference 0.62 cm; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01), and mean depth was less for females than males (adjusted mean difference -1.42 cm, 95% CI -2.59, -0.25). In addition, the difference in compression depth was larger for female participants (mean difference 0.94 cm; 95% CI 0.54, 1.34) than for male participants (mean difference -0.01 cm; 95% CI -0.80, 0.78), and the interaction was statistically significant (P 1/4 .04).
   Conclusion: The mean compression depth was significantly smaller on the mattress and with female bystanders. Further research is needed to understand the benefit of moving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims to the floor relative to the detrimental effect of delaying chest compressions.

TI  - Development, validation and assessment of the test on knowledge about basic life support and use of automated external defibrillator among schoolchildren
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Educating lay public can significantly strengthen the Chain of Survival after out of hospital cardiac arrest. Schoolchildren are an accessible population for learning basic life support (BLS) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) and can be regarded as multipliers of knowledge that can reach the whole population. This study aimed to develop and validate a test for examining levels of knowledge about BLS and AED among schoolchildren that can be used to uniformly present reliable data. Methods A knowledge test about BLS and AED consisting of 10 multiple-choice questions was developed and implemented before and after a 2-h BLS and AED course consisting of an interactive lecture and a practical workshop for 783 students in seventh and ninth grades of elementary schools in Maribor, Slovenia. Each question was analyzed and presented with descriptive statistics and educometric parameters (difficulty and discriminating indices). All variables were checked for normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and analyzed using non-parametric tests. Statistical significance of the differences in knowledge before and after intervention were calculated with chi-square statistics and effect sizes r are reported. Differences between genders, grades and previous attendance to BLS courses were compared using Mann - Whitney U test. The effect size was calculated from the Z score and reported as r value. Results After educometric analysis, questions were adjusted to meet the requirements of satisfactory functioning difficulty and discriminating indices (values between 0,40 and 0,60, and above 0,20, respectively). Only one question had to be eliminated due to inadequate difficulty and discriminating index (0,99 and 0,02, respectively). Measurement invariance across gender (p < 0,001), school grade (p < 0,001), and attendance to previous courses (p = 0,303) was assured. Conclusions A test for accurate and reliable measurement of knowledge of BLS and AED among schoolchildren was developed and validated. According to the findings it can now reliably be used to assess baseline knowledge and potential improvement in knowledge after a course on BLS and AED. Standardized data gathered with a validated tool can now be presented at legislative levels to promote BLS and AED courses implementation in school curricula.

TI  - Donation after Brain Death versus Donation after Circulatory Death: Lung Donor Management Issues
T2  - SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Lung transplantation (LTx) has traditionally been limited by a lack of suitable donor lungs. With the recognition that lungs are more robust than initially thought, the size of the donor pool of available lungs has increased dramatically in the past decade. Donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD) lungs, both ideal and extended are now routinely utilized. DBD lungs can be damaged. There are important differences in the public's understanding, legal and consent processes, intensive care unit strategies, lung pathophysiology, logistics, and potential-to-actual donor conversion rates between DBD and DCD. Notwithstanding, the short- and long-term outcomes of LTx from any of these DBD versus DCD donor scenarios are now similar, robust, and continue to improve. Large audits suggest there remains a large untapped pool of DCD (but not DBD) lungs that may yet further dramatically increase lung transplant numbers. Donor scoring systems that might predict the donor conversion rates and lung quality, the role of ex vivo lung perfusion as an assessment and lung resuscitation tool, as well as the potential of donor lung quality biomarkers all have immense promise for the clinical field.

TI  - Diaphragm Neurostimulation Assisted Ventilation in Critically Ill Patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Diaphragm neurostimulation consists of placing electrodes directly on or in proximity to the phrenic nerve(s) to elicit diaphragmatic contractions. Since its initial description in the 18th century, indications have shifted from cardiopulmonary resuscitation to long-term ventilatory support. Recently, the technical development of devices for temporary diaphragm neurostimulation has opened up the possibility of a new era for the management of mechanically ventilated patients. Combining positive pressure ventilation with diaphragm neurostimulation offers a potentially promising new approach to the delivery of mechanical ventilation which may benefit multiple organ systems. Maintaining diaphragm contractions during ventilation may attenuate diaphragm atrophy and accelerate weaning from mechanical ventilation. Preventing atelectasis and preserving lung volume can reduce lung stress and strain and improve homogeneity of ventilation, potentially mitigating ventilatorinduced lung injury. Furthermore, restoring the thoracoabdominal pressure gradient generated by diaphragm contractions may attenuate the drop in cardiac output induced by positive pressure ventilation. Experimental evidence suggests diaphragm neurostimulation may prevent neuroinflammation associated with mechanical ventilation. This review describes the historical development and evolving approaches to diaphragm neurostimulation during mechanical ventilation and surveys the potential mechanisms of benefit. The review proposes a research agenda and offers perspectives for the future of diaphragm neurostimulation assisted mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients.

TI  - Effect of non-invasive ventilation on Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
T2  - SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of prematurity, leading to long-term pulmonary morbidity. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is associated with ventilator-induced lung injury, oxygen toxicity, and inflammation, all contributing to BPD pathogenesis. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has emerged as a key strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of BPD. We examine the role of various NIV strategies in the respiratory management of premature infants. We discuss the common forms of NIV, including nasal continuous positive airway pressure, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure, highflow nasal cannula, and nasal high-frequency ventilation, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, benefits, and limitations. Several studies have demonstrated that early and appropriate NIV use can reduce the incidence of BPD, improve oxygenation, and promote lung growth. However, NIV is not without challenges, including patient selection, the timing of initiation, and potential difficulties in achieving adequate ventilation, especially in extremely low birth weight neonates. Adjunctive therapies such as early surfactant therapy, less invasive surfactant administration, and caffeine may enhance the effectiveness of NIV. In conclusion, NIV is a promising approach to decreasing BPD, yet its effectiveness relies on proper clinical application and integration with other therapies to maximize its benefits.

TI  - Implementation of basic life support education for the lay public in China: barriers, enablers, and possible solutions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Education for the lay public in basic life support (BLS) is critical for increasing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rates and improving survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite years of implementation, the BLS training rate in China has remained modest. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the implementation of BLS training programs in emergency medical service (EMS) centers in China and to identify specific barriers and enablers.Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with key informants from 40 EMS centers in Chinese cities. The participants included 11 directors/deputy directors, 24 training department leaders, and 5 senior trainers. The interview guide was based on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Thematic content analysis was used to identify themes and patterns across the interviews.Results We identified 16 factors influencing the implementation of BLS training programs encompassing the outer content, inner context, innovation and bridging factors. Some factors acted as either barriers or enablers at different EPIS stages. The main implementation barriers included limited external leadership, insufficient government investment, low public awareness, a shortage of trainers, an absence of incentives, an absence of authoritative courses and guidelines, a lack of qualification to issue certificates, limited academic involvement, and insufficient publicity. The main enablers were found to be supportive government leaders, strong public demand, adequate resources, program champions, available high-quality courses of high fitness within the local context, the involvement of diverse institutions, and effective publicity and promotion.Conclusion Our findings emphasize the diversity of stakeholders, the complexity of implementation, and the need for localization and co-construction when conducting BLS training for lay public in city EMS centers. Improvements can be made at the national level, city level, and EMS institutional level to boost priority and awareness, promote legislation and policies, raise sustainable resources, and enhance the technology of BLS courses.

TI  - Early results and operative considerations of endoventricular circular patch plasty for ischemic cardiomyopathy
T2  - JAPANESE HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Seven patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent elective endoventricular circular patch plasty (EVCPP) were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 63 years old. All seven patients had anterior left ventricular aneurysms following old myocardial infarction. Two patients were graded NYHA class II, 4 patients class III, and one patient class IV. EVCPP was performed under cardiac arrest with moderate hypothermia in five patients. The two most recent patients underwent EVCPP under on-pump beating and normothermia. Coronary artery bypass grafting was conducted in all cases and the mean number of grafts was 1.8, ranging from one to three. The mitral valve was replaced in one patient. One patient died of myonephrotic metabolic syndrome caused by ischemia of the lower limb. In the follow-up of six patients, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDI) decreased significantly from 128 +/- 31 mL/m(2) to 108 +/- 37 mL/m(2). Left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESI) decreased in five patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter remained unchanged after surgery. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 0.28 +/- 0.08 to 0.32 +/- 0.1. LVESI and LVEF did not improve in one patient with a large residual dyskinetic area at the distal LV septum. A residual dyskinetic area at the distal LV septum was observed in two of four patients who underwent EVCPP under cardiac arrest. This condition, however, was not detected in two patients who underwent EVCPP under on-pump beating conditions. In the follow-up study, the grade of NYHA functional classification improved in all six patients. In conclusion, EVCPP under on-pump beating is a realistic and effective procedure with which to complete ideal LV geometry and promote good results in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Perspectives of extremely prematurely born adults on what to consider in prenatal decision-making: a qualitative focus group study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD-FETAL AND NEONATAL EDITION
AB  - ObjectiveA shared decision-making (SDM) approach is recommended for prenatal decisions at the limit of viability, with a guiding role for parental values. People born extremely premature experience the consequences of the decision made, but information about their perspectives on prenatal decisions is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to describe their perspectives on what is important in decision-making at the limit of viability.DesignSemi-structured focus group discussions were conducted, recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were independently analysed by two researchers in Atlas.ti.ResultsFour focus groups were conducted in the Netherlands, with five to six participants each, born between 240/7 and 300/7 weeks gestation in the period between 1965 and 2002. Considering their personal life experiences and how their extremely premature birth affected their families, the participants reflected on decision-making at the limit of viability. Various considerations were discussed and summarised into the following themes: anticipated parental regret, the wish to look at the baby directly after birth, to give the infant a chance at survival, quality of life, long-term outcomes for the infant and the family, and religious or spiritual considerations.ConclusionsInsights into the perspectives of adults born extremely premature deepened our understanding of values considered in decision-making at the limit of viability. Results point out the need for a more individualised prediction of the prognosis and more extensive information on the lifelong impact of an extremely premature birth on both the infant and the family. This could help future parents and healthcare professionals in value-laden decision-making.

TI  - Unraveling the compatibility of symbiotic control antimicrobial substances with Trissolcus japonicus in the integrated pest management of Halyomorpha halys
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
AB  - Within the scope of integrated management of brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, the compatibility of symbiotic control with other strategies must be evaluated to promote biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to assess the impact of antimicrobial substances, useful in symbiotic control of H. halys, on the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus through the treatment of egg masses with fungicides (copper hydroxide, sulfur, sweet orange essential oil) and plant biostimulants (flavonoids and chestnut tannin extract), compared with one disinfectant for civil and industrial use (sodium hypochlorite/sodium hydrate/tetraborate decahydrate). Two tests were conducted: one involved exposing egg masses to T. japonicus, followed by treatment post-parasitism for a subset, and treatment after seven days post-parasitism for another subset to evaluate short/long-term effects based on treatment timing variation. Additionally, a choice test between treated and untreated egg masses was conducted to evaluate T. japonicus oviposition preference. Our results showed that all substances did not impact the emergence of parasitoids at both the treatment times, as well as on preference among treatments, choosing indifferently between all paired egg masses. The impact of these formulations should be further studied to assess their effect in the open field and confirm their sustainable use to manage H. halys proliferation.

TI  - Associations between posttraumatic stress symptoms and quality of life in cardiac arrest survivors and informal caregivers: A pilot survey study
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Aim: To estimate the proportion of significant posttraumatic stress (PTS) in both cardiac survivors with good neurologic recovery and informal caregivers, and to pilot test the hypothesis that greater PTS are associated with worse quality of life (QoL) in both cardiac arrest survivors and informal caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors.
   Methods: We distributed an online survey to survivor and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. Participants provided demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models.
   Results: We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (beta: -0.35 to -0.53, p < .05).
   Conclusions: Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in survivors and informal caregivers. Further study is needed to validate these findings in a larger, representative sample.

TI  - Exploring the Therapeutic Mechanism of Xinbao Pill in Brain Injury After Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Based on Network Pharmacology, Metabolomics, and Experimental Verification
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Background: Post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation brain injury (PBI) is essentially the cerebral ischemia reperfusion (CIR) injury, which is the main cause of death and long-term disability in patients with cardiac arrest. So far, there is no treatment for PBI; thus, it is urgent to develop new drugs or therapies for the prevention and treatment of brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although multiple constituent herbs or active ingredients of Xinbao Pill (XBP) have shown neuroprotective effects, whether XBP could play a therapeutic role on PBI is still unknown. This study aimed to illustrate the neuroprotective effect of XBP on PBI and probe the underlying mechanisms. Method: We first performed the cell and animal experiments to validate the protective effect of XBP on neurological function. We next identified the potential differential metabolites via metabolomics analysis. We further conducted a comprehensive network pharmacology analysis including overlap gene analysis, protein-protein interaction network, and gene-biological process-module function network to preliminarily investigate the specific mechanism of action (MOA) of XBP against PBI. Finally, PCR, MTT, ELISA assay, as well as Western blotting experiments were made to validate our proposed molecular mechanisms. Result: The in vitro experiment showed that XBP could increase cell viability and ameliorate cell morphological damage in PC12 cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/RO) conditions. The in vivo experiment demonstrated that XBP improved the Neurologic Deficit Score (NDS), lowered the Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) level as well as reversed the typical neuropathological changes in PBI rats, indicating its neuroprotective effect on PBI. Further metabolomics analysis identified 94 differential metabolites after XBP treatment, and multiple metabolites were highly related to CIR. Moreover, network pharmacology results revealed that the therapeutic effect of XBP on PBI may be relevant to mitochondrial quality control (MQC). Mechanistically, XBP could not only promote the expressions of marker proteins including PGC1 alpha, NRF1, TFAM, OPA1, MFN1 as well as MFN2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion but also inhibit those proteins containing DRP1, MFF, FIS1, p62, PINK1, Parkin as well as LC3 in mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Finally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor was demonstrated to play a crucial role in regulating MQC. Conclusions: Our study first determined that XBP might be an underlying anti-PBI formula, which also deciphered the potential MOAs of XBP against PBI by a network pharmacology approach combined with in vivo and in vitro experimental validation.

TI  - Independent Functional Outcomes after Prolonged Coma following Cardiac Arrest: A Mechanistic Hypothesis
T2  - ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Objective Survivors of prolonged (>2 weeks) post-cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post-CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post-CA patients.
   Methods We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17-37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post-CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.
   Results All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (similar to 4-7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time.
   Interpretation BSP with theta (similar to 4-7Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post-CA coma. ANN NEUROL 2020

TI  - Oxidative Stress as a Primary Risk Factor for Brain Damage in Preterm Newborns
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - The risk of oxidative stress is high in preterm newborns. Room air exposure of an organism primed to develop in a hypoxic environment, lacking antioxidant defenses, and subjected to hyperoxia, hypoxia, and ischemia challenges the newborn with oxidative stress production. Free radicals can be generated by a multitude of other mechanisms, such as glutamate excitotoxicity, excess free iron, inflammation, and immune reactions. Free radical-induced damage caused by oxidative stress appears to be the mOor candidate for the pathogenesis of most of the complications of prematurity, brain being especially at risk, with short to long-term consequences. We review the role of free radical oxidative damage to the newborn brain and propose a mechanism of oxidative injury, taking into consideration the particular maturation-dependent vulnerability of the oligodendrocyte precursors. Prompted by our observation of an increase in plasma Adenosine concentrations significantly associated with brain white matter lesions in some premature infants, we discuss a possible bioenergetics hypothesis, correlated to the oxidative challenge of the premature infant. We aim at explaining both the oxidative stress generation and the mechanism promoting the myelination disturbances. Being white matter abnormalities among the most common lesions of prematurity, the use of Adenosine as a biomarker of brain damage appears promising in order to design neuroprotective strategies.

TI  - Design and evaluation of portable emergency ventilator prototype with novel titration methods
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB  - Mechanical ventilation is considered to be an effective treatment in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Traditional ventilators are not suitable for prompt out-of-hospital first aid treatment due to the limitations of large size and slow titration. This study proposed a novel portable emergency ventilator prototype with compact structure and efficient titration. The prototype was realized by using a centrifugal fan suitable for volume controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation and pressure controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation modes. The new titration technique was developed based on the relationships between the PWM and flow. The validity of the new prototype was examined using a test-lung (Michigan A13) in comparison with a commercial ventilator (ResMed Stellar 150) under three simulated lung conditions - acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and normal lung. Results indicated that the new prototype could provide desired tidal volume, ventilation respiratory rate, peak inspiratory pressure, peak inspiratory flow, inspiratory time and expiratory time with satisfactory respiratory waveforms, functional per-formance, fast flow supply and accurate parameter control for all three lung conditions. The tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow values were higher than their default values at 500 ml and 33 L, respectively, and the errors were within 10 % of target. The new titration method required only 3 breaths to complete the titration process, which were fewer than the ResMed Stellar 150 that requires at least 5 breaths. The fewer breaths needed for titration may result in shorter response time and could accelerate estimating the lung compliance and airway resistance while running the ventilator. This new prototype with the new titration technique could play a role in various emergency situations for out-of-hospital, transport or in-hospital first aid.

TI  - A double-edged sword: a narrative review on steroids in sepsis and septic shock
T2  - INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening conditions characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection. Although corticosteroids, particularly hydrocortisone, promote positive effects on hemodynamic stability in septic shock, the efficacy of these drugs remains controversial. In this narrative review, we aimed at appraising the actual role of corticosteroids focusing specifically on septic shock. We conducted a comprehensive search of the recent literature, including randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and current clinical guidelines, to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the management of septic shock. Studies were evaluated to determine the impact on mortality, hemodynamics, and other clinical outcomes. The studies showed variability in dosing and time of administration as well as patient selection, which highlighted the lack of a standardized treatment approach. While corticosteroids improved short-term hemodynamic outcomes and reduced vasopressor requirement, their effect on long-term survival was minimal. These results led current guidelines to a weak recommendation for hydrocortisone use in septic shock patients with persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Corticosteroids, e.g. hydrocortisone, can be beneficial in managing septic shock, but their role remains uncertain. Further research is needed to refine treatment protocols and determine the optimal patient selection for corticosteroid therapy.

TI  - Ictal asystole in temporal lobe epilepsy before and after pacemaker implantation
T2  - EPILEPTIC DISORDERS
AB  - Events of ictal bradycardia or asystole may be of relevance in epilepsy patients presenting with ictal falls, and are a potential contributor to SUDEP. The literature on ictal bradycardia or asystole is anecdotal and consists of case reports and small case series. There are no guidelines for the care of patients with ictal arrythmias. Insertion of cardiac pacemakers may prevent life-threatening cardiac arrest, syncope and trauma.
   We report the case of a 41-year-old man who presented with refractory partial seizures resulting in syncope leading to severe head trauma, as the only ictal semiology. During presurgical video-EEG monitoring, two episodes of ictal bradycardia followed by asystole and syncope were recorded. A cardiac pacemaker was implanted. At the nine-month follow-up, the patient reported no overt seizures, syncopes or traumatic falls. Our case demonstrates that implantation of a cardiac pacemaker while continuing AEDs may render a patient free from ictal symptoms and prevent ictal syncope and subsequent trauma.

TI  - Improved survival associated with prophylactic implantable defibrillators in elderly patients with prior myocardial infarction and depressed ventricular function: A MADIT-II substudy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: We aim to evaluate the mortality benefit from defibrillator therapy in eligible elderly patients. Effective primary prevention of sudden cardiac death with implantable cardioverter defibrillators is well demonstrated in patients with coronary disease and depressed ventricular function.
   Methods and Results: Among 1,232 patients enrolled with prior infarct and left ventricular ejection fraction <= 0.30,204 were >= 75 years old. Of these 204 patients, 121 underwent defibrillator implant. Relative to the younger patients, those >= 75 years had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), widened QRS, and lower use of beta-blockers and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Relevant clinical covariates were similar in elderly patients randomized to conventional and defibrillator therapy. The hazard ratio for the mortality risk in patients >= 75 years assigned to defibrillator implant compared with those in conventional therapy was 0.56 (95 confidence interval 0.29-1.08; P = 0.08) after a mean follow-up of 17.2 months. Comparatively, the hazard ratio in patients < 75 years assigned to defibrillator implant was 0.63 (0.45-0.88; P = 0.01) after 20.8 months. Elderly patients had similar reductions in quality of life (QoL) regardless of treatment randomization. Scores through Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI) Questionnaire changes from baseline to I year were -0.22 for patients with conventional therapy versus -0.20 for patients with ICD, and -0.36 versus -0.27 at 2 years, respectively (P = NS).
   Conclusion: The implantable defibrillator is associated with an equivalent reduction of mortality in elderly and younger patients, with no compromise in the QoL in the older age subjects.

TI  - The implementation of code blue by nurses as first responders in outpatient and inpatient rooms at Malang Indonesia Hospital
T2  - HEALTHCARE IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS
AB  - Introduction: In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) is a frequent occurrence that necessitates prompt and appropriate assistance to improve survival rates. Nurses in public care rooms and outpatients are expected to be first responders to IHCA until an activated hospital code blue team arrives. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the implementation of code blue response by nurses in outpatient and hospital inpatient rooms in Malang.
   Design and Methods: This is a quantitative study that uses observational methods with a cross-sectional approach comprising of 109 inpatient and outpatient care room nurses from 9 hospitals in Malang. The implementation of code blue was measured by a simulated case of adult cardiac arrest in a hospital inpatient room.
   Results: The nurses involved were 67.0% female, where the majority have a D3 education qualification (57.7%), with more than ten years working experience (45%). Furthermore, 83.5% of nurses work in regular care rooms and 16.5% come from outpatient rooms. The results showed that the implementation of code blue by nurses in regular care and inpatient rooms was 66.7% and 65.9%, respectively in the insufficient categories. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U test obtained a p-value of 0.929.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, there was no significant difference in the implementation of code blue that occurred in the inpatient and outpatient rooms. Further studies were recommended to observe code blue events directly and take samples with balanced proportions.

TI  - Traumatic injuries of the immature hip and pelvis
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe pelvis and hip account for 0.3--4% of fractures of the immature skeleton, and generally result from high energy trauma. These fractures range in severity from apophyseal avulsions to complete disruptions of the pelvic ring. The purpose of this article is to review the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and complications of these injuries in order to inform clinicians involved in their management. There is a lack of evidence-based management protocols for fractures of the immature pelvis largely due to their rarity and lack of robust scientific literature on the topic.Recent findingsComputed tomography/MRI is essential as up to 30% of pelvis and 70% of acetabular fractures are not identified on initial radiographs. A sub-optimal outcome is common in unstable fractures treated conservatively and adequate reduction and surgical stabilization is often required to avoid long-term morbidity.SummaryA coordinated approach involves resuscitation and temporary stabilization with planned definitive fixation. It is generally accepted that these injures should be managed in paediatric trauma centres. Whilst injuries vary in pattern and severity, we present an overview that considers the evaluation and treatment of the paediatric patient with pelvic and hip fractures to ensure that these injuries are identified promptly and treated by surgeons familiar with contemporary management algorithms.

TI  - The Value of Extracellular Cold-Inducible RNA-Binding Protein (eCIRP) in Predicting the Severity and Prognosis of Patients After Cardiac Arrest: A Preliminary Observational Study
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Background: Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) acting as a novel damage-associated molecular pattern molecule promotes systemic inflammatory responses, including neuroinflammation in cerebral ischemia. We aimed to observe the changes of serum eCIRP and evaluate whether the increased serum eCIRP was associated with the severity and prognosis in patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Methods: A total of 73 patients after ROSC were divided into non-survivor (n = 48) and survivor (n = 25) groups based on 28-day survival. Healthy volunteers (n = 25) were enrolled as controls. Serum eCIRP, procalcitonin (PCT), the pro-inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL)-6 and high mobility group protein (HMGB1), the neurological damage biomarkers neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and soluble protein 100 beta (S100 beta) were measured on days 1, 3, and 7 after ROSC. Clinical data and laboratory findings were collected, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) were calculated concurrently. Cerebral performance category scores on day 28 after ROSC were recorded. Results: Serum eCIRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PCT, and HMGB1, NSE and S100 beta were significantly increased within the first week after ROSC. The increased levels of eCIRP were positively correlated with IL-6, TNF-alpha, lactate, NSE, S100 beta, CPR time, SOFA score, APACHE II score, and HMGB1 after ROSC. Serum eCIRP on days 1, 3, and 7 after ROSC could predict 28-day mortality and neurological prognosis. Serum eCIRP on day 3 after ROSC had a biggest AUC [0.862 (95% CI: 0.741-0.941)] for 28-day mortality and a biggest AUC [0.807 (95% CI: 0.630-0.981)] for neurological prognosis. Conclusions: Systemic inflammatory response with increased serum eCIRP occurred in patients after ROSC. Increased eCIRP level was positively correlated with the aggravation of systemic inflammatory response and the severity after ROSC. Serum eCIRP serves as a potential predictor for 28-day mortality and poor neurological prognosis after ROSC.

A1  - ISCHEMIA-CKD Res Grp
TI  - International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD): Rationale and design
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and stable ischemic heart disease are at markedly increased risk of cardiovascular events. Prior trials comparing a strategy of optimal medical therapy (OMT) with or without revascularization have largely excluded patients with advanced CKD. Whether a routine invasive approach when compared with a conservative strategy is beneficial in such patients is unknown.
   Methods ISCHEMIA-CKD is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded randomized trial designed to determine the comparative effectiveness of an initial invasive strategy (cardiac catheterization and optimal revascularization [percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, if suitable] plus OMT) versus a conservative strategy (OMT alone, with cardiac catheterization and revascularization [percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, if suitable] reserved for failure of OMT) on long-term clinical outcomes in 777 patients with advanced CKD (defined as those with estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73m(2) or on dialysis) and moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing. Participants were randomized in a 1: 1 fashion to the invasive or a conservative strategy. The primary end point is a composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Major secondary endpoints are a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest; angina control; and disease-specific quality of life. Safety outcomes such as initiation of maintenance dialysis and a composite of initiation ofmaintenancedialysis or deathwillbereported. Thetrial isprojected to have 80% power to detect a 22% to 24% reduction in the primary composite end point with the invasive strategy when compared with the conservative strategy.
   Conclusions ISCHEMIA-CKD will determinewhether an initial invasive management strategy improves clinical outcomes when added to OMT in patients with advanced CKD and stable ischemic heart disease.

TI  - Medical perspectives regarding goals-of-care consultations in Emergency Departments
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE
AB  - Goals-of-care discussions aim to establish patient values for shared medical decision-making. These discussions are relevant towards end-of-life as patients may receive non-beneficial treatments if they have never discussed preferences for care. End-of-life care is provided in Emergency Departments (EDs) but little is known regarding ED-led goals-of-care discussions. We aimed to explore practitioner perspectives on goals-of-care discussions for adult ED patients nearing end-of-life. We report the qualitative component of a mixed methods study regarding a 'Goals-of-Care' form in an Australian ED. Eighteen out of 34 doctors who completed the form were interviewed. We characterised ED-led goals-of-care consultations for the first time. Emergency doctors perceive goals-of-care discussions to be relevant to their practice and occurring frequently. They aim to ensure appropriate care is provided prior to review by the admitting team, focusing on limitations of treatment and clarity in the care process. ED doctors felt they could recognise end-of-life and that ED visits often prompt consideration of end-of-life care planning. They wanted long-term practitioners to initiate discussions prior to patient deterioration. There were numerous interpretations of palliative care concepts. Standardisation of language, education, collaboration and further research is required to ensure Emergency practitioners are equipped to facilitate these challenging conversations.

TI  - Standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a better strategy for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The incidence of cardiac arrest (CA) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is relatively rare. However, when it does occur, the mortality rate is extremely high. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promising survival rates for in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA), with low-flow time being an independent prognostic factor for CA. However, there is no definitive answer on how to reduce low-flow time. Methods: This retrospective study, conducted at a single center, included 39 patients who underwent ECPR during PCI between January 2016 and December 2022. The patients were divided into two cohorts based on whether standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was utilized during PCI: standby ECPR (SBE) (n = 13) and extemporaneous ECPR (EE) (n = 26). We compared the 30-day mortality rates between these two cohorts and investigated factors associated with survival. Results: Compared to the EE cohort, the SBE cohort showed significantly lower low-flow time (P < 0.01), ECMO operation time (P < 0.01), and a lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (P = 0.017), as well as peak lactate (P < 0.01). Stand-by ECMO was associated with improved 30-day survival (p = 0.036), while prolonged low-flow time (p = 0.004) and a higher SYNTAX II score (p = 0.062) predicted death at 30 days. Conclusions: Standby ECMO can provide significant benefits for patients who undergo ECPR for CA during PCI. It is a viable option for high-risk PCI cases and may enhance the overall prognosis. The low-flow time remains a critical determinant of survival.

TI  - Dysautonomia in athletes
T2  - MEDICINA DELLO SPORT
AB  - Dysautonomia is a complex syndrome involving dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is responsible for regulating many involuntary bodily functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and thermoregulation. In athletes, this condition can arise due to various interconnected factors, including physical overload and chronic stress associated with intensive training and frequent competitions. This prolonged state of stress can disrupt the autonomic balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, leading to a predominance of symptoms such as tachycardia, latent hypertension, and orthostatic intolerance. Athletes with a genetic predisposition, such as those with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, are particularly vulnerable to dysautonomia due to the fragility of connective tissue, which impairs vascular function and increases susceptibility to episodes of hypotension and reduced exercise capacity. Additionally, brain injuries, common in contact sports, can damage the nerve centers responsible for autonomic control, leading to episodes of "paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity," characterized by hypertension, excessive sweating, and other dysautonomic manifestations. The use of vasoactive drugs, often employed to manage other medical conditions, can exacerbate the symptoms of dysautonomia, further compromising an athlete's ability to maintain optimal performance. This condition not only impairs training and competition ability but also increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke and cardiac arrest, especially during intense physical activity. Therefore, it is crucial to early identify athletes with dysautonomia through tools and analyses of the ANS, such as photoplethysmographic heart rate variability analysis, to receive timely diagnosis and regular monitoring to evaluate autonomic parameters and the effectiveness of any treatments to mitigate associated risks. These include optimizing training load, lifestyle adjustments, potential pharmacological regulation, and adopting preventive measures to avoid trauma, which can significantly improve the quality of life and sports performance of these athletes and enhance long-term outcomes.

TI  - Patients' and healthcare providers' understandings of life-sustaining treatment: Are perceptions of goals shared or divergent?
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - In this cross-sectional qualitative study, researchers performed in-depth, semistructured interviews with 30 pairs of patients and their primary care providers in an outpatient clinic of a large, urban Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center in the United States. During audiotaped interviews to assess their understanding of advance directive concepts, participants were asked what "life-sustaining treatment" means to them and why they think of it in the way they do. The findings indicate that patients and providers in the United States tend to view and discuss life-sustaining treatment in terms of four goals for end-of-life care: (1) extending the length of life, (2) improving the quality of life, (3) maintaining or improving specific biological functions, and (4) assisting the body for a temporary period of time. Patients thought providers were more concerned with extending the length of life than with quality-based outcomes, and patients often discussed life-sustaining treatment as acceptable means for short-term but not long-term use. Many providers indicated that they struggle with conflicting quality-based and physiologic care goals. The findings highlight the importance of eliciting patient preferences not only for specific types of treatment, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but also for end-of-life care goals or desired health-related outcomes, such as maximizing the quantity of life. The findings also suggest that advance directives and patient-provider discussions that focus on acceptable health states and valued life activities may be better suited to patients' end-of-life care goals than those that focus on specific medical interventions.

TI  - The low frequency of futility in an adult intensive care unit setting
T2  - ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: It is widely assumed that ''futile'' treatment consumes significant health care resources. This is a prospective cohort study.
   Setting: The setting was the medical. intensive care unit of Ben Taub General Hospital, a large public hospital in Houston, Tex.
   Objective: To assess the frequency of intensive care unit patients meeting any of three broad definitions of futility.
   Subjects: Subjects consisted of 129 consecutive patients admitted to the study intensive care unit during a 6-week period in the fall of 1993.
   Main Outcome Measures: Operational definitions for three types of futility described in the literature were developed: Imminent demise futility, death imminent regardless of intervention, was assessed by using the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) scoring system to determine the likelihood of mortality at more than the 90%, 95%, and 99% probabilities. Lethal condition futility, conditions incompatible with long-term survival, included five separate disease processes. Qualitative futility, conditions with an unacceptable quality of life, was assessed as a persistent vegetative state or as meeting criteria for poor prognosis due to a hypoxic ischemic coma.
   Results: Only 2 bed-days (0.3%) were used by patients with more than 90% predicted mortality; 22 bed-days (3.6%) were used by patients with poor prognosis due to hypoxic ischemic coma; and 101 bed-days (16.4%) were used by patients satisfying criteria for the five lethal conditions.
   Conclusions: The frequency of futile interventions appears to be low unless one is willing to accept a definition that includes patients who could survive for many months. If confirmed in other settings, this suggests that concepts of futility will not play a major role in cost containment.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to coronary heart disease: A comparison of survival before and after the introduction of defribrillators in ambulances
T2  - HEART
AB  - Objective-To assess the actual impact on coronary mortality of equipping ambulances with defibrillators.
   Design-Retrospective analysis of routine medical and legal records of all those who had a cardiac arrest attributed to coronary heart disease occurring outside hospital in a defined population before and after the introduction of Heartstart.
   Setting-City of Glasgow, North of the River Clyde, 1984 and 1990.
   Patients-296 and 267 men and women aged 25-64 inclusive in 1984 and 1990 respectively who had a cardiac arrest outside hospital which was attributed to coronary heart disease (International Classification of Diseases codes 410-414, ninth revision).
   Results-The impact on coronary mortality in 1990 of equipping ambulances with defibrillators concurred with the earlier prediction of less than 1% of all coronary deaths. The circumstances of cardiac arrest were largely unchanged; most occurred outside hospital in the victim's home and the principal witnesses were members of the victim's family. A call for help before cardiac arrest was made in very few cases and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted by laypersons in less than a third of the deaths they witnessed. There was a significant increase in the number of cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts made by ambulance crews (16% v 32%, P < 0.01). Ambulance crews, however, still attended less than half of all cases (44% and 47%).
   Conclusion-The impact of equipping ambulances with defibrillators will remain small unless strategies are introduced that focus on improving the public's response to coronary emergencies by calling for help promptly and initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation before the arrival of the emergency services.

TI  - The Integration of Live Video Tools to Help Bystanders During an Emergency Call: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Simulation Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Early action by bystanders is particularly important for the survival of individuals in need of emergency care, especially those experiencing a cardiac arrest or an airway obstruction. However, only a few bystanders are willing to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The use of a live video during emergency calls appears to have a positive effect on the number of cardiopulmonary resuscitations performed by bystanders.Objective: The objective of this study is to propose and evaluate the relevance of a living lab methodology involving video calls in simulated life-threatening emergency situations.Methods: The first study aimed at analyzing the process of dealing with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at a dispatch center and identifying the needs of the dispatchers. The second study is a pretest of a living lab. The third study focuses on a living lab in which 16 situations of cardiac arrest and airway obstruction are simulated. The simulation includes both a live video and transmission of a video demonstration of emergency procedures. The measures focus on 3 areas: the impact of video tools, development of collaboration within the community, and evaluation of the method.Results: The results of the first study show that dispatchers have an interest in visualizing the scene with live video and in broadcasting a live demonstration video when possible. The initial results also show that collaboration within the community is enhanced by the shared simulation and debriefing experiences, clarifying regulation procedures, and improving communication. Finally, an iterative development based on the lessons learned, expectations, and constraints of each previous study promotes the existence of a living lab that aims to determine the place of live video tools in the sequence of care performed by dispatchers.Conclusions: Living labs offer the opportunity to grasp previously undetected insights and refine the use of the applications while potentially developing a sense of community among the stakeholders.

TI  - Identifying potentially shockable rhythms without interrupting cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective., Current versions of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) mandate interruptions of chest compression for rhythm analyses because of artifacts produced by chest compressions. Interruption of chest compressions reduces likelihood of successful resuscitation by as much as 50%. We sought a method to identify a shockable rhythm without interrupting chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Design: Experimental study.
   Setting: Weil Institute of Critical Care Medicine, Rancho Mirage, CA.
   Subjects. None.
   Interventions. Electrocardiographs (ECGs) were recorded in conjunction with AEDs during CPR in human victims. A shockable rhythm was defined as disorganized rhythm with an amplitude >0.1 mV or, if organized, at a rate of :180 beats/min. Wavelet-based transformation and shape-based morphology detection were used for rhythm classification. Morphologic consistencies of waveform representing QRS components were analyzed to differentiate between disorganized and organized rhythms. For disorganized rhythms, the amplitude spectrum area was computed in the frequency domain to distinguish between shockable ventricular fibrillation and nonshockable asystole. For organized rhythms, in victims in whom the absence of a heartbeat was independently confirmed, the heart rate was estimated for further classification. Measurements and Main Results: To derive the algorithm, we used 29 recordings on 29 patients from the Creighton University ventricular tachyarrhythmia database. For validation, the algorithm was tested on an independent population of 229 victims, including recordings of both ECG and depth of chest compressions obtained during suspected out-of-hospital sudden death. The recordings included III instances in which the ECG was corrupted during chest compressions. A shockable rhythm was identified with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 89%, yielding a positive predictive value of 91%. A nonshockable rhythm was identified with a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 93%, and a positive predictive value of 91% during uninterrupted chest compression.
   Conclusions. The algorithm fulfilled the potential lifesaving advantages of allowing for uninterrupted chest compression, avoiding pauses for automated rhythm analyses before prompting delivery of an electrical shock.

TI  - Review of Abdominal Damage Control and Open Abdomens: Focus on Gastrointestinal Complications
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL AND LIVER DISEASES
AB  - Massive trauma and abdominal catastrophes carry high morbidity and mortality. In addition to the primary pathologic process, a secondary systemic injury, characterized by inflammatory mediator release, contributes to subsequent cellular, end-organ, and systemic dysfunction. These processes, in conjunction with large-volume resuscitations and tissue hypoperfusion, lead to acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. This "lethal triad" synergistically contributes to further physiologic derangements and, if uncorrected, may result in patient death. One manifestation of the associated clinical syndrome is the development of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The development of ACS is insidious. If not recognized and treated promptly, ACS leads to multi-system organ failure (MSOF) and mortality. Improved understanding of IAH and ACS led to the development of damage control (DC)/open abdomen (OA) as surgical decompressive strategy. The DC/OA approach consists of three basic management steps. During the initial step the abdomen is opened, hemorrhage/abdominal contamination are controlled, and temporary abdominal closure is performed (Stage I). The patient then enters Stage 11 physiologic restoration with core rewarming, correction of coagulopathy and completion of acute resuscitation. After physiologic normalization, definitive management of injuries and eventual abdominal closure (Stage III) are achieved. The authors will provide an overview of the DC/OA approach, as well as the clinical diagnosis of ACS, followed by a discussion of DC/OA-associated complications, with focus on digestive system specific complaints.

TI  - Outcomes of laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease and paraesophageal hernia
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY-ULTRASOUND AND INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB  - Background: Laparoscopic fundoplication has become the standard for operative treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
   Methods: We reviewed our experience with 1,000 consecutive patients receiving laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD (n = 882) or paraesophageal hernia (n = 118) between October 1991 and July 1999. Patients with achalasia and failed fundoplication were excluded from analysis. All the patients were evaluated preoperatively by upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and barium swallow. After 1994, 24-h pH monitoring was performed selectively in patients with extraesophageal symptoms and/or those without erosive esophagitis. There were 490 men 510 women in this review. Their mean age was 49 years. Procedures performed were 360 degrees floppy fundoplication (n = 879), 360 degrees fundoplication without fundus mobilization (Rossetti) (n = 22), 270 degrees posterior fundoplication;(n = 96), and anterior fundoplication (n = 2). Esophageal lengthening procedure (Collis gastroplasty) was performed in combination with fundoplication in 15 patients. In seven patients the treatment was converted to open fundoplication.
   Outcomes: The average length of hospitalization was 2.2 days, and 136 patients stayed longer than 2 days. Major complications occurred in 21 patients: esophageal perforation (n = 10), acute paraesophageal herniation (n = 4), splenic bleeding (n = 2), cardiac arrest(n = 1), pneumonia (n = 3), and testicular abscess (n = 1). Additional operations were required to manage the complications in 14 patients (70%): Four of these procedures were performed emergently, and 10 patients underwent reoperation between 6 h and 10 days. There were three deaths, all of which involved elderly patients with paraesophageal hernia. There were 35 late failures requiring reoperation for recurrence of GERD or development of new symptoms: The treatment of 32 patients was revised laparoscopically, and 4 patients required laparotomy. Beyond 1 year (median follow-up period, 27 months), 94% of the reviewed patients were satisfied with their surgical outcome.

TI  - The Best Bypass Surgery Trial:: Rationale and design of a randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment of conventional versus off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - Background: Recent trials suggest that off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity compared with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CCAB) using cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients with a moderate- to high-risk of complications after CCAB may have additional benefit from OPCAB.
   Methods: The Best Bypass Surgery Trial is a randomized, single center trial comparing the effects of OPCAB versus CCAB. The inclusion criteria are 3 vessel coronary heart disease affecting one of the marginal arteries, age > 54 years, and EuroSCORE >= 5. The primary composite outcome measure consists of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac revascularization procedure. Follow up involves collection of data of mortality and morbidity via linkage to public registers, quality of life assessment at 3 and 12 months postoperatively and angiographic control at 12 months. The sample size of 330 patients was based on an estimated 75% one-year event free rate of the primary outcome measure in the OPCAB arm and 60% in the control arm with alpha = .05 and beta = .20. Accordingly, the trial will be able to detect an absolute risk reduction of 15% or a relative risk reduction of 37.5%. The median follow-up time is scheduled to 3 years.
   Results: Enrollment started in April 2002 and ended March 2006.
   Conclusion: The results may have implications on the treatment modality of moderate- to high-risk patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of outcomes after EMS-witnessed traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by traffic collisions
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Aim: The survival rate of patients with traumatic cardiac arrest is 3% or lower. Cardiac arrest witnessed by emergency medical services (EMS) accounts for approximately 16% of prehospital traumatic cardiac arrests, but the prognosis is unknown. We aimed to compare the 1-month survival rate of cardiac arrest witnessed by EMS with that of cardiac arrest witnessed by bystanders and unwitnessed cardiac arrest in trac trauma victims; further, the time from injury to cardiac arrest was assessed. Methods: This analysis used the Utstein Registry in Japan and included data of 3883 patients with traumatic cardiac arrest caused by trac collisions registered between 2014 and 2019 in Japan. Results: The 1-month survival rate was 10.9% in the EMS-witnessed cardiac arrest group; this was significantly higher than that in the bystander witnessed (7.2%) and unwitnessed (5.6%) cardiac arrest groups (P < 0.01). The median time from injury to cardiac arrest was 18 min (25% quartile: 12, 75% quartile: 26). Conclusion: The 1-month survival rate was significantly higher in the EMS-witnessed cardiac arrest group than in the bystander-witnessed and unwitnessed cardiac arrest groups. It is important to prevent progression to cardiac arrest in trauma patients with intact respiratory function and pulse rate at the time of contact with EMS. A system for early recognition of severe trauma is needed, and a doctor's car or helicopter can be requested as needed. We believe that early recognition and prompt intervention will improve the prognosis of prehospital traumatic cardiac arrest.

TI  - Histological efficacy of high-dose intravenous vitamin C infusion in severely burned patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR HISTOLOGY
AB  - Severe burn injuries cause increased endothelial permeability leading to systemic capillary leak and massive fluid shifts into the extravascular space. Excessive fluid resuscitation to ensure sufficient end-organ perfusion results in critical tissue oedema. The present study assessed the underlying microscopic data regarding the integrity of thin skin dermal capillary endothelial barrier and angiogenesis after high-dose vitamin C (HDVC) administration in severely burned patients at days 1, 3 and 7 postburn. Twenty severely burned patients [20% to 25% total body surface area of second deep dermal type] were enrolled in this study. Ten patients received high-dose vitamin C infusion in a dose of 10g within the first 24 h of admission (HDVC burned group) and 10 patients did not (burned group). Patients were selected from the Burn Intensive Care Unit at El-Demerdash Hospital, Ain Shams University. On the microscopic level, HDVC infusion significantly reduced inflammation as evidenced by decreased iNOS immuno-expression and inflammatory cell count, markedly improved tissue barrier function as expressed in enhanced occludin immune-reactivity, significantly decreased the mean area percentage of dermal capillaries, and promoted angiogenesis through increased immuno-expression over time in skin punch biopsies. Overall, HDVC seems promising as an adjunct therapy in burn management, but further investigation is required on clinical grounds to determine the appropriate dose for HDVC infusion and explore its long-term outcome.

TI  - Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta for Hemorrhage Control in Trauma Patients: An Evidence-Based Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA NURSING
AB  - Traditionally, resuscitative efforts for uncontrolled noncompressible torso hemorrhage are achieved by cross-clamping the proximal aorta via thoracotomy to deliver temporary hemodynamic stability during injury repair. A less commonly used method of promoting early resuscitation and hemorrhagic control in trauma patients is resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). The focus of this literature review is to examine the effectiveness of REBOA in the management of noncompressible pelvic hemorrhage when compared with traditional methods of hemorrhage control in trauma patients. A literature search was performed by using the PubMed database to explore studies that defined the efficacy of REBOA or compared the use of REBOA with resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping for hemorrhage control. Studies encompassed in the review included 3 experimental studies utilizing swine, 2 retrospective studies that reviewed data collected from procedures performed in empirical situations, and a case series that described the implementation of REBOA. Trauma patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage that is intervened with REBOA have higher mean arterial pressures and systolic blood pressures, require fewer boluses of intravenous fluids and vasopressors, avoid severe acidosis and ischemia, and have significantly lower rates of mortality, thus ensuring enhanced long-term outcomes. Evidence suggests that hemodynamic stability, physiological effects, and mortality rates are improved in patients who receive REBOA for torso hemorrhage control when compared with traditional methods.

TI  - (+)-Naltrexone is neuroprotective and promotes alternative activation in the mouse hippocampus after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB  - Despite dramatic improvement in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other techniques for cardiac arrest (CA), the majority of survivors continue to show signs of decreased memory or executive cognitive function. Such memory impairment may be due to hippocampal CA1 neuronal death, which is delayed by several days after CA/CPR. Classical microgliosis in the CA1 region may contribute to neuronal death, yet the role of a key activation receptor Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) has not been previously investigated for such neuronal death after CA/CPR. We show that (+)-naltrexone was neuroprotective after CA/CPR. TLR4 blockade was associated with decreased expression of markers for microglial/macrophage activation and T cell and B cell infiltration, as well as decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Notably, IL-10 expression was elevated in response to CA/CPR, but was not attenuated by (+)-naltrexone, suggesting that the local monocyte/microglial phenotype had shifted towards alternative activation. This was confirmed by elevated expression of Arginase-1, and decreased expression of NF kappa B p65 subunit. Thus, (+)-naltrexone and other TLR4 antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate the substantial burden of memory or executive cognitive function impairment after CA/CPR.

TI  - Can some in-hospital cardio-respiratory arrests be prevented? A prospective survey
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The hospital cardiac arrest team is summoned in response to a sudden severe deterioration in a patient's condition. However, clinical experience suggests that some calls to general wards are preceded by a more gradual, possibly treatable decline. We undertook this study to define the extent of the problem and look for features that might enable prediction and prevention of cardiorespiratory arrest. We identified patients on general medical and surgical wards for whom cardiac arrest calls had been made. Their casenotes were examined for documentation of abnormal physical signs and laboratory test results in the 24 h before the call. We noted what doctors and nurses had done after abnormalities had been found. Over a 28-week period, calls were made for 47 patients on these wards. Twenty-four (51%) had premonitory signs. These patients were also less likely to survive to hospital discharge (P=0.02). We conclude that some cardiorespiratory arrests are predictable. Wider appreciation of the significance of abnormal signs and laboratory test results could lead to prompter involvement of experienced clinicians and more aggressive therapy. Alternatively, as mortality is so high in this group of patients, more patients could be appropriately designated 'not for resuscitation'. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth: A Journey from Experience to Higher Perception Among Iranian Muslim CPR Survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
AB  - Several studies have been conducted among cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) survivors. Some studies have shown that positive and negative experiences coexist. Emotional distress and psychopathology in CPR survivors are related to the urgent need to make growth. Understanding the meaning of CPR survivors' lived experiences of growth may facilitate their growth. The aim of the study was to illuminate the meaning of CPR survivor's lived experiences of growth in southeast Iran. A qualitative design using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach influenced by Ricoeur was used in 12 CPR survivors. Three main themes emerged including: (1) opening up a new horizon in the meaning of life, (2) opening up a new horizon in the meaning of interpersonal connections and (3) opening up a new horizon in the meaning of God and spirituality. The interpreted comprehensive understanding conveyed a meaning that CPR survivors' experience of growth seems to be like opening the doors of perception to the higher reality. The finding may assist other CPR survivors to learn from participants in this study. Exposure to suitable narratives under health care provider supervision could develop profound learning. Training sessions with an emphasis on meditation education and how to use connecting to God in the adaptation process may approve the quality of life of CPR survivors.

TI  - Can an elderly woman's heart be too strong?: Increased mortality with high versus normal ejection fraction after an acute coronary syndrome. The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in women. We sought to validate previous clinical experience in which we have observed that elderly women with a very high left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are at increased risk of death compared with elderly women with acute coronary syndromes with a normal LVEF.
   Methods Data from 5,127 elderly female patients (age >65 years) enrolled in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events were collected. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on their LVEF: group I had a low ejection fraction (<55%), group II had a normal ejection fraction (55%-65%), and group III had a high ejection fraction (>65%). X(2) test and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed. The main outcome measures were death in-hospital and death, stroke, rehospitalization, and myocardial infarction at 6-month follow-up.
   Results Hospital mortality was 12% in group I. Patients in group III were more likely to die in-hospital than those in group II (P=.003). Multivariable logistic regression showed that high ejection fraction was an independent predictor of hospital death (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% CI [CI] 1.2-5.2, P=.01), 6-month death (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.4, P=.01), and cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.0, P=.01) compared with the normal ejection fraction group.
   Conclusions Having a very high LVEF (>65%) is associated with worse survival and higher rates of sudden cardiac death than an LVEF considered to be in the reference range. (Am Heart J 2010; 160: 849-54.)

TI  - Automated loss of pulse detection on a consumer smartwatch
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a time-sensitive emergency that requires prompt identification and intervention: sudden, unwitnessed cardiac arrest is nearly unsurvivable1, 2-3. A cardinal sign of cardiac arrest is sudden loss of pulse4. Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the substantial prognostic role of time3,5, but only if the false-positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized5, 6-7. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at a societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography, we show that wearable photoplethysmography measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced through an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation. On the basis of the similarity of the photoplethysmography signal (from ventricular fibrillation or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Following its development, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval of 64.32% to 70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model. These results indicate an opportunity, deployable at scale, for wearable-based detection of sudden loss of pulse while minimizing societal costs of excess false detections7.

TI  - Formation of "Nonculturable" Dormant Forms of the Phytopathogenic Enterobacterium Erwinia carotovora
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Reversible transition of the phytopathogenic gram-negative bacterium Erwinia carotovora, subsp. atroseptica, strain SCRI1043, to a dormant state was demonstrated; it was associated with a complete loss of cell ability to form colonies on the standard medium, i.e., with acquiring "non-culturability". Entering of Erwinia cells to a nonculturable state occurred after lono-term incubation (100-150 days) of the stationary-phase cell suspensions in either a fresh complete medium or in the carbon-free mineral medium or treatment with a chemical analogue of microbial anabiosis autoinducers (4 x 10(-4) M of C-12-alkylhydroxybenzene, AHB). However, confocal laser microscopy of the cells stained with the Live/Dead BacLight kit revealed that the majority of E. carotovora cells (90%) from long-incubated suspensions retained membrane integrity. In these suspensions, round cells of smaller size prevailed, with the envelope, containing an electron-dense outer layer and an underlying layer of lower density; the cytoplasm was coarse-granulated. Detection of "nonculturable" E. carotovora cells by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (Q-PCR) with specific primers by using standard procedures of sample preparation was shown to be inefficient. A special procedure including cell washing from the incubation medium in the absence of growth stimulation was developed, which promoted recovery of the colony-forming ability of the cells (up to 10% of the initial CFU number) and improved cell detection by Q-PCR from the number of genomic copies. The results provided further insight into the ways of long-term survival of phytopathogenic bacteria under environmental changes and carbon starvation.

TI  - Intra-operative hyperthermia in a cat with a fatal outcome
T2  - VETERINARY ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - History A fouryear old male neutered Domestic Short Hair cat presented for general anaesthesia for hind limb orthopaedic surgery. The cat had been anaesthetized fourdays previously with propofol and isoflurane and made an uneventful recovery. Physical Examination and Management On pre-anaesthetic examination the cat had a temperature of 38.9 degrees C and was otherwise healthy. After a premedication of acepromazine and pethidine, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen 50% and nitrous oxide 50%. Increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, end tidal carbon dioxide tension and temperature were observed, occurring sequentially, from 110 to 175minutes after anaesthetic induction. Despite ceasing all warming measures and attempting to cool the patient, body temperature continued to rapidly rise, reaching 42.5 degrees C and limb rigidity was observed. Isoflurane administration was stopped and esmolol was administered. Cardiac arrest occurred. Cardio-pulmonary cerebral resuscitation was commenced and a lateral thoracotomy was performed to allow cardiac compressions and internal defibrillation. Atropine, adrenaline, glucose and dopamine were administered and cold saline was instilled into the thoracic cavity. Follow-up Resuscitation was unsuccessful and the cat died. Conclusions A presumptive diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia was made. Malignant hyperthermia should be considered, even if prior exposure to volatile inhalational anaesthesia was uneventful, and prompt and aggressive therapy instituted.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging during untreated ventricular fibrillation reveals prompt right ventricular overdistention without left ventricular volume loss
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background - Most out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) is prolonged ( > 5 minutes), and defibrillation from prolonged VF typically results in asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Recent visual epicardial observations in an open-chest, open-pericardium model of swine VF indicate that blood flows from the high-pressure arterial system to the lower-pressure venous system during untreated VF, thereby overdistending the right ventricle and apparently decreasing left ventricular size. Therefore, inadequate left ventricular stroke volume after defibrillation from prolonged VF has been postulated as a major contributor to the development of pulseless rhythms.
   Methods and Results - Ventricular dimensions were determined by MRI for 30 minutes of untreated VF in a closed-chest, closed-pericardium model in 6 swine. Within 1 minute of untreated VF, mean right ventricular volume increased by 29 % but did not increase thereafter. During the first 5 minutes of untreated VF, mean left ventricular volume increased by 34 %. Between 20 and 30 minutes of VF, stone heart occurred as manifested by dramatic thickening of the myocardium and concomitant substantial decreases in left ventricular volume.
   Conclusions - In this closed-chest swine model of VF, substantial right ventricular volume changes occurred early and did not result in smaller left ventricular volumes. The changes in ventricular volumes before the late development of stone heart do not explain why defibrillation from brief duration VF ( > 5 minutes) typically results in a pulsatile rhythm with return of spontaneous circulation, whereas defibrillation from prolonged VF ( 5 to 15 minutes) does not.

TI  - Transplantation of a human liver following 3 days of ex situ normothermic preservation
T2  - NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - A human liver is transplanted successfully after preservation for 3 days via machine perfusion.
   Current organ preservation methods provide a narrow window (usually <12 hours) to assess, transport and implant donor grafts for human transplantation. Here we report the transplantation of a human liver discarded by all centers, which could be preserved for several days using ex situ normothermic machine perfusion. The transplanted liver exhibited normal function, with minimal reperfusion injury and the need for only a minimal immunosuppressive regimen. The patient rapidly recovered a normal quality of life without any signs of liver damage, such as rejection or injury to the bile ducts, according to a 1-year follow up. This inaugural clinical success opens new horizons in clinical research and promises an extended time window of up to 10 days for assessment of viability of donor organs as well as converting an urgent and highly demanding surgery into an elective procedure.

TI  - Seven deadly sins in trauma outcomes research: An epidemiologic post mortem for major causes of bias
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - PROMMTT Symposium held at the 71st Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma (AAST) / Clinical Congress of Acute Care Surgery
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because randomized clinical trials in trauma outcomes research are expensive and complex, they have rarely been the basis for the clinical care of trauma patients. Most published findings are derived from retrospective and occasionally prospective observational studies that may be particularly susceptible to bias. The sources of bias include some common to other clinical domains, such as heterogeneous patient populations with competing and interdependent short-and long-term outcomes. Other sources of bias are unique to trauma, such as rapidly changing multisystem responses to injury that necessitate highly dynamic treatment regimens such as blood product transfusion. The standard research design and analysis strategies applied in published observational studies are often inadequate to address these biases.
   METHODS: Drawing on recent experience in the design, data collection, monitoring, and analysis of the 10-site observational PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study, 7 common and sometimes overlapping biases are described through examples and resolution strategies.
   RESULTS: Sources of bias in trauma research include ignoring (1) variation in patients' indications for treatment (indication bias), (2) the dependency of intervention delivery on patient survival (survival bias), (3) time-varying treatment, (4) time-dependent confounding, (5) nonuniform intervention effects over time, (6) nonrandom missing data mechanisms, and (7) imperfectly defined variables. This list is not exhaustive.
   CONCLUSION: The mitigation strategies to overcome these threats to validity require epidemiologic and statistical vigilance. Minimizing the highlighted types of bias in trauma research will facilitate clinical translation of more accurate and reproducible findings and improve the evidence-base that clinicians apply in their care of injured patients.

TI  - Ruptured Heterotopic Pregnancy: A Rare Cause for Hemoperitoneum; Report of Three Cases from Kashmir, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Heterotopic pregnancy has been found in various forms but is still a rare event in the natural conception cycles, occurring in less than 1:30000 pregnancies with the incidence rising to 1:100 to 1:500 pregnancies duo to assisted reproductive technologies. Delay in diagnosing the condition can be fatal for both the mother and the fetus. Three patients aged 28, 31 and 26 years presented with amenorrhea of ten, eight and twelve weeks duration respectively with signs of peritonism and shock. Investigations revealed intra and extra uterine pregnancies in all the three cases with the rupture of the extra uterine pregnancies. All the cases were operated and first two cases were followed up postoperatively till the delivery of the term live babies. The third case is still under our follow up. A high index of suspicion by a general surgeon is needed in arriving at a prompt diagnosis of ruptured heterotopic pregnancy so that rapid resuscitation, heart sparing anesthesia and expeditious surgery is carried out for both maternal and intrauterine fetal wellbeing.

TI  - Accelerometry-Based Classification of Circulatory States During Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Objective: Exploit accelerometry data for an automatic, reliable, and prompt detection of spontaneous circulation during cardiac arrest, as this is both vital for patient survival and practically challenging. Methods: We developed a machine learning algorithm to automatically predict the circulatory state during cardiopulmonary resuscitation from 4-second-long snippets of accelerometry and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from pauses of chest compressions of real-world defibrillator records. The algorithm was trained based on 422 cases from the German Resuscitation Registry, for which ground truth labels were created by a manual annotation of physicians. It uses a kernelized Support Vector Machine classifier based on 49 features, which partially reflect the correlation between accelerometry and electrocardiogram data. Results: Evaluating 50 different test-training data splits, the proposed algorithm exhibits a balanced accuracy of 81.2%, a sensitivity of 80.6%, and a specificity of 81.8%, whereas using only ECG leads to a balanced accuracy of 76.5%, a sensitivity of 80.2%, and a specificity of 72.8%. Conclusion: The first method employing accelerometry for pulse/no-pulse decision yields a significant increase in performance compared to single ECG-signal usage. Significance: This shows that accelerometry provides relevant information for pulse/no-pulse decisions. In application, such an algorithm may be used to simplify retrospective annotation for quality management and, moreover, to support clinicians to assess circulatory state during cardiac arrest treatment.

TI  - Types and effects of feedback for emergency ambulance staff: a systematic mixed studies review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
AB  - BackgroundExtensive research has been conducted into the effects of feedback interventions within many areas of healthcare, but prehospital emergency care has been relatively neglected. Exploratory work suggests that enhancing feedback and follow-up to emergency medical service (EMS) staff might provide staff with closure and improve clinical performance. Our aim was to summarise the literature on the types of feedback received by EMS professionals and its effects on the quality and safety of patient care, staff well-being and professional development. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis, including primary research studies of any method published in peer-reviewed journals. Studies were included if they contained information on systematic feedback to emergency ambulance staff regarding their performance. Databases searched from inception were MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, HMIC, CINAHL and Web of Science, with searches last updated on 2 August 2022. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data analysis followed a convergent integrated design involving simultaneous narrative synthesis and random effects multilevel meta-analyses. ResultsThe search strategy yielded 3183 articles, with 48 studies meeting inclusion criteria after title/abstract screening and full-text review. Interventions were categorised as audit and feedback (n=31), peer-to-peer feedback (n=3), postevent debriefing (n=2), incident-prompted feedback (n=1), patient outcome feedback (n=1) or a combination thereof (n=4). Feedback was found to have a moderate positive effect on quality of care and professional development with a pooled effect of d=0.50 (95% CI 0.34, 0.67). Feedback to EMS professionals had large effects in improving documentation (d=0.73 (0.00, 1.45)) and protocol adherence (d=0.68 (0.12, 1.24)), as well as small effects in enhancing cardiac arrest performance (d=0.46 (0.06, 0.86)), clinical decision-making (d=0.47 (0.23, 0.72)), ambulance times (d=0.43 (0.12, 0.74)) and survival rates (d=0.22 (0.11, 0.33)). The between-study heterogeneity variance was estimated at sigma(2)=0.32 (95% CI 0.22, 0.50), with an I-2 value of 99% (95% CI 98%, 99%), indicating substantial statistical heterogeneity. ConclusionThis review demonstrated that the evidence base currently does not support a clear single point estimate of the pooled effect of feedback to EMS staff as a single intervention type due to study heterogeneity. Further research is needed to provide guidance and frameworks supporting better design and evaluation of feedback interventions within EMS. PROSPERO registration numberCRD42020162600.

TI  - Short-Term Effects of Hydroxyethylstarch Resuscitation on Systemic and Regional Hemodynamics and Metabolism in a Brain-Dead Canine Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background. Hydroxyethylstarch (HES) is a synthetic polymer of glucose that has been suggested for therapeutic use in long-term plasma expansion. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the infusion of a small volume of HES may provide benefits in systemic and regional hemodynamics and metabolism in a brain-dead canine model compared with large volume crystalloid resuscitation.
   Methods. Fourteen mongrel dogs were subjected to a brain-death protocol by consecutive insufflations of a balloon catheter in the epidural space. One hour after induction of brain-death, the animals were randomly assigned to two groups: NS (0.9% NaCl, 33mL/kg), and HES (6% HES 450/0.7, 17mL/Kg). Systemic and regional hemodynamics were evaluated using Swan-Ganz, ultrasonic flowprobes, and arterial catheters. Serial blood samples were collected for blood gas, electrolyte, and serum chemistry analysis. Systemic, hepatic, and splanchnic O(2)-derived variables were also calculated.
   Results. Epidural balloon insufflations induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output (MAP and CO, respectively), regional blood flow, and systemic vascular resistance. Following the hyperdynamic phase, severe hypotension with normalization of systemic and regional blood flow was observed. Fluid resuscitation induced a prompt increase in MAP, CO, and portal vein blood flow, and a significant reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. There were no differences between groups in metabolic indices, liver function tests (LFTs), or renal function tests. HES was more effective than NS in restoring cardiac performance in the first 2h after fluid resuscitation (P < 0.05). Both tested solutions partially and temporarily restored systemic and regional oxygen delivery.
   Conclusion. Small volumes of 6% HES 450/0.7 improved cardiovascular performance and provided the same regional hemodynamic and metabolic benefits of large volumes of isotonic crystalloid solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - SHock-INduced Endotheliopathy (SHINE): A mechanistic justification for viscoelastography-guided resuscitation of traumatic and non-traumatic shock
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Irrespective of the reason for hypoperfusion, hypocoagulable and/or hyperfibrinolytic hemostatic aberrancies afflict up to one-quarter of critically ill patients in shock. Intensivists and traumatologists have embraced the concept of SHock-INduced Endotheliopathy (SHINE) as a foundational derangement in progressive shock wherein sympatho-adrenal activation may cause systemic endothelial injury. The pro-thrombotic endothelium lends to micro-thrombosis, enacting a cycle of worsening perfusion and increasing catecholamines, endothelial injury, de-endothelialization, and multiple organ failure. The hypocoagulable/hyperfibrinolytic hemostatic phenotype is thought to be driven by endothelial release of anti-thrombogenic mediators to the bloodstream and perivascular sympathetic nerve release of tissue plasminogen activator directly into the microvasculature. In the shock state, this hemostatic phenotype may be a counterbalancing, yet maladaptive, attempt to restore blood flow against a systemically pro-thrombotic endothelium and increased blood viscosity. We therefore review endothelial physiology with emphasis on glycocalyx function, unique biomarkers, and coagulofibrinolytic mediators, setting the stage for understanding the pathophysiology and hemostatic phenotypes of SHINE in various etiologies of shock. We propose that the hyperfibrinolytic phenotype is exemplified in progressive shock whether related to trauma-induced coagulopathy, sepsis-induced coagulopathy, or post-cardiac arrest syndrome-associated coagulopathy. Regardless of the initial insult, SHINE appears to be a catecholamine-driven entity which early in the disease course may manifest as hyper- or hypocoagulopathic and hyper- or hypofibrinolytic hemostatic imbalance. Moreover, these hemostatic derangements may rapidly evolve along the thrombohemorrhagic spectrum depending on the etiology, timing, and methods of resuscitation. Given the intricate hemochemical makeup and changes during these shock states, macroscopic whole blood tests of coagulative kinetics and clot strength serve as clinically useful and simple means for hemostasis phenotyping. We suggest that viscoelastic hemostatic assays such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are currently the most applicable clinical tools for assaying global hemostatic function-including fibrinolysis-to enable dynamic resuscitation with blood products and hemostatic adjuncts for those patients with thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic complications in shock states.

TI  - A Case Report on Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in a Patient with Churg Strauss Syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is a rare but of one the important causes of sudden cardiac arrest and Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). It is complex and often under diagnosed. It has multifactorial aetiologies. It is predominantly seen in young women presenting with ACS, with no pre-existing history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and is commonly diagnosed via coronary angiography. It may be associated with autoimmune disease, connective tissue disorder, collagen vascular disease, Marfan syndrome, intense physical exercise and during peripartum period. The various treatment modalities for SCAD are conservative medical treatment, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), and surgery. Here, authors describe a case of 33-year-old women who presented with ACS, with no pre-existing history of CAD. Patient responded well with medical management. This condition has grave prognosis if not detected and treated promptly. So it is very important to keep SCAD as differential diagnosis in ACS among young patients.

TI  - Epinephrine's effects on cerebrovascular and systemic hemodynamics during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Despite controversies, epinephrine remains a mainstay of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Recent animal studies have suggested that epinephrine may decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygenation, possibly potentiating neurological injury during CPR. We investigated the cerebrovascular effects of intravenous epinephrine in a swine model of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary objectives of this study were to determine if (1) epinephrine doses have a significant acute effect on CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation during CPR and (2) if the effect of each subsequent dose of epinephrine differs significantly from that of the first.
   Methods: One-month-old piglets (n = 20) underwent asphyxia for 7 min, ventricular fibrillation, and CPR for 10-20 min. Epinephrine (20 mcg/kg) was administered at 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 min of CPR. Invasive (laser Doppler, brain tissue oxygen tension [PbtO(2)]) and noninvasive (diffuse correlation spectroscopy and diffuse optical spectroscopy) measurements of CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation were simultaneously recorded. Effects of subsequent epinephrine doses were compared to the first.
   Results: With the first epinephrine dose during CPR, CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation increased by > 10%, as measured by each of the invasive and noninvasive measures (p < 0.001). The effects of epinephrine on CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation decreased with subsequent doses. By the fifth dose of epinephrine, there were no demonstrable increases in CBF of cerebral tissue oxygenation. Invasive and noninvasive CBF measurements were highly correlated during asphyxia (slope effect 1.3, p < 0.001) and CPR (slope effect 0.20, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This model suggests that epinephrine increases CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation, but that effects wane following the third dose. Noninvasive measurements of neurological health parameters hold promise for developing and directing resuscitation strategies.

TI  - Estradiol rescues neurons from global ischemia-induced cell death: Multiple cellular pathways of neuroprotection
T2  - STEROIDS
CP  - FASEB Summer Research Meeting on Extra-Nuclear Steroid Receptors - Integration with Multiple Signaling Pathways
AB  - The potential neuroprotective role of sex hormones in chronic neurodegenerative disorders and acute brain ischemia following cardiac arrest and stroke is of a great therapeutic interest. Long-term pretreatment with estradiol and other estrogens affords robust neuroprotection in male and female rodents subjected to focal and global ischemia. However, the receptors (e.g., cell surface or nuclear), intracellular signaling pathways and networks of estrogen-regulated genes that intervene in neuronal apoptosis are as yet unclear. We have shown that estradiol administered at physiological levels for two weeks before ischemia rescues neurons destined to die in the hippocampal CA1 and ameliorates ischemia-induced cognitive deficits in ovariectomized female rats. This regimen of estradiol treatment involves classical intracellular estrogen receptors, transactivation of IGF-1 receptors and stimulation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which in turn maintains CREB activity in the ischemic CA1. We also find that a single, acute injection of estradiol administrated into the brain ventricle immediately after an ischemic event reduces both neuronal death and cognitive deficits. Because these findings suggest that hormones could be used to treat patients when given after brain ischemia, it is critical to determine whether the same or different pathways mediate this form of neuroprotection. We find that an agonist of the membrane estrogen receptor GPR30 mimics short latency estradiol facilitation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Therefore, we are testing the hypothesis that GPR30 may act together with intracellular estrogen receptors to activate cell signaling pathways to promote neuron survival after global ischemia.

TI  - Chest compression rate measurement from smartphone video
T2  - BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE
AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a life threatening situation where the first person performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) most often is a bystander without medical training. Some existing smartphone apps can call the emergency number and provide for example global positioning system (GPS) location like Hjelp 113-GPS App by the Norwegian air ambulance. We propose to extend functionality of such apps by using the built in camera in a smartphone to capture video of the CPR performed, primarily to estimate the duration and rate of the chest compression executed, if any.
   Methods: All calculations are done in real time, and both the caller and the dispatcher will receive the compression rate feedback when detected. The proposed algorithm is based on finding a dynamic region of interest in the video frames, and thereafter evaluating the power spectral density by computing the fast fourier transform over sliding windows. The power of the dominating frequencies is compared to the power of the frequency area of interest. The system is tested on different persons, male and female, in different scenarios addressing target compression rates, background disturbances, compression with mouth-to-mouth ventilation, various background illuminations and phone placements. All tests were done on a recording Laerdal manikin, providing true compression rates for comparison.
   Results: Overall, the algorithm is seen to be promising, and it manages a number of disturbances and light situations. For target rates at 110 cpm, as recommended during CPR, the mean error in compression rate (Standard dev. over tests in parentheses) is 3.6 (0.8) for short hair bystanders, and 8.7 (6.0) including medium and long haired bystanders.
   Conclusions: The presented method shows that it is feasible to detect the compression rate of chest compressions performed by a bystander by placing the smartphone close to the patient, and using the built-in camera combined with a video processing algorithm performed real-time on the device.

TI  - An Acute Myocardial Infarction Case that Survived An Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Which Prominent Ischemic J Waves Were Documented
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - We describe a case of a myocardial infarction, in which prominent ischemic J waves were documented during recurrent ventricular fibrillation attacks. The patient was referred to our hospital to treat an out-of hospital cardiac arrest. Although the 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained just after the first cardioversion did not show any apparent J waves, a J wave-like steep downsloping type ST-segment elevation associated with q waves in the inferior leads was documented during multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Our report revealed the appearance of J waves as an important marker for lethal arrhythmias in acute ischemia. (PACE 2012; 35:e27e30)

TI  - Chest compression without ventilation during basic life support?. Confirmation of the validity of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines 2005
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - Basic life support (BLS) refers to maintaining airway patency and supporting breathing and the circulation, without the use of equipment other than infection protection measures. The scientific advisory committee of the American Heart Association (AHA) published recommendations (online-first) on March 31 2008, which promote a call to action for bystanders who are not or not sufficiently trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and witness an adult out-of-hospital sudden collapse probably of cardiac origin. These bystanders should provide chest compression without ventilation (so-called compression-only CPR). If bystanders were previously trained and thus confident with CPR, they should decide between conventional CPR (chest compression plus ventilation at a ratio of 30:2) and chest compression alone. However, considering current evidence-based medicine and latest scientific data both the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the German Resuscitation Council (GRC) do not at present intend to change or supplement the current resuscitation guidelines "Basic life support for adults". Both organisations do not see any need for change or amendments in central European practice and continue to recommend that only those lay rescuers that are not willing or unable to give mouth-to-mouth ventilation should provide CPR solely by uninterrupted chest compressions until professional help arrives. It is also stressed that the training of young people especially teenagers as lay rescuers should be promoted and the establishment of training programs through emergency medical organizations and in schools should be encouraged.

TI  - In-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with use of non-antiarrhythmic QTc-prolonging drugs
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Aim QTc interval-prolonging drugs have been linked to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and sudden death. In this study we aimed to quantify the risk of cardiac arrest associated with the use of non-antiarrhythmic QTc-prolonging drugs in an academic hospital setting.
   Methods We performed a case-control study in which patients, for whom intervention of the advanced life support resuscitation team was requested for cardiac arrest between 1995 and 2003 in the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, were compared with controls regarding current use of non-antiarrhythmic QTc-prolonging drugs. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors.
   Results A statistically significant increased risk of cardiac arrest (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2, 3.5) was observed in patients who received QTc-prolonging drugs (42/140). The risk was more pronounced in patients receiving doses > 1 defined daily dose (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1, 5.9), patients taking > 1 QTc-prolonging drug simultaneously (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.6, 14) and patients taking pharmacokinetic interacting drugs concomitantly (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.2, 13).
   Conclusions Use of non-antiarrhythmic QTc-prolonging drugs in hospitalized patients with several underlying disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest. The effect is dose related and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions increase the risk substantially. Physicians caring for inpatients should be made aware of the fact that these non-antiarrhythmic drugs may be hazardous, so that potential risks can be weighed against treatment benefits and additional cardiac surveillance can be requested, if necessary.

TI  - The genetics underlying idiopathic ventricular fibrillation: A special role for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death. In some cases clinical investigations fail to identify the underlying cause and the event is classified as idiopathic (IVF). Since mutations in arrhythmia-associated genes frequently determine arrhythmia susceptibility, screening for disease-predisposing variants could improve IVF diagnostics.
   Methods and results: The study included 76 Finnish and Italian patients with a mean age of 31.2 years at the time of the VF event, collected between the years 1996-2016 and diagnosed with idiopathic, out-of-hospital VF. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, we aimed to identify genetic variants potentially contributing to the life-threatening arrhythmias of these patients. Combining the results from the two study populations, we identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants residing in the RYR2, CACNA1C and DSP genes in 7 patients (9%). Most of them(5, 71%) were found in the RYR2 gene, associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). These genetic findings prompted clinical investigations leading to disease reclassification. Additionally, in 9 patients (11.8%) we detected 10 novel or extremely rare (MAF < 0.005%) variants that were classified as of unknown significance (VUS).
   Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that a subset of patients originally diagnosed with IVF may carry clinically-relevant variants in genes associated with cardiac channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. Although misclassification of other cardiac channelopathies as IVF appears rare, our findings indicate that the possibility of CPVT as the underlying disease entity should be carefully evaluated in IVF patients.

TI  - Prognostic value of electrocardiographic time intervals and QT rate dependence in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main goals in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Many variables have been proposed, however the European and American guidelines do not incorporate any ECG or Hotter monitoring derived variables other than the presence of ventricular arrhythmia in their risk stratification models. In the present study we evaluated electrocardiographic parameters in risk stratification of HCM.
   Methods and results: Novel electrocardiographic parameters including the index of cardio-electrophysiological balance (iCEB), individualized QT correction (QTi) and QT rate dependence were evaluated along with established risk factors. A composite endpoint of SCD was defined as out of hospital cardiac arrest, appropriate ICD shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate predictors of SCD. Out of the 466 HCM patients, 31 reached the composite endpoint during a follow up of 75 86 months. In a multivariate model, nor iCEB, QTi or QT rate dependence were predictors of SCD. Only male gender (p < 0.01; OR 13.1; CI 1.74-98.83), negative T waves in the inferior leads (p = 0.04; OR 2.51; CI 1.03-6.13) and familial sudden death (p < 0.01; OR 3.03; CI 139-6.59) were significant predictors. On top of either the ESC risk score or the 3 traditional 'American risk factors', only male gender was a significant predictor of SCD.
   Conclusion: No ECG or Halter monitoring parameters added in risk stratification for SCD in HCM. However, male gender and negative T waves in the inferior leads are promising novel markers to evaluate in larger cohorts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein, peracetic acid (PAA) oxidation, a green and potent disinfection method, was combined with a physical nanowire-assisted electroporation (EP) to develop the synchronous EP/PAA approach, aiming to reinforce bacterial inactivation via facilitating PAA permeation from EP-induced pores for oxidative damage of cell structures. The locally enhanced electric field near nanowire tips at a low voltage of 1.5 V induced 38.4 % and 52.4 % cells with reversible and irreversible membrane damages, accompanied by 72.5 % cells inactivation and 18.3 % VBNC cells formation. The EP/PAA exhibited significant synergistic effects on removal of viable E. coli (G-), P. aeruginosa (G-), E. faecalis (G+), and S. aureus (G+) cells, especially achieving above 5-log removal (99.999 %) of these viable cells with similar to 4-log synergistic effects and similar to 5-9 times less energy consumption than the individual EP and PAA (similar to 40 %-80 %). Characterizations of cell membrane integrity and cellular morphology revealed that EP-induced membrane pores facilitated PAA permeation to destruct cell structures, thereby minimizing the risks of VBNC cell formation and resuscitation. The excellent synergistic effects and long-term stability of EP/PAA in tap water demonstrated its promising application potential to control VBNC cells in drinking water.

TI  - Brain injury after cardiac arrest
T2  - LANCET
AB  - As more people are surviving cardiac arrest, focus needs to shift towards improving neurological outcomes and quality of life in survivors. Brain injury after resuscitation, a common sequela following cardiac arrest, ranges in severity from mild impairment to devastating brain injury and brainstem death. Effective strategies to minimise brain injury after resuscitation include early intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, restoration of normal physiology, and targeted temperature management. It is important to identify people who might have a poor outcome, to enable informed choices about continuation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Multimodal prediction guidelines seek to avoid premature withdrawal in those who might survive with a good neurological outcome, or prolonging treatment that might result in survival with severe disability. Approximately one in three admitted to intensive care will survive, many of whom will need intensive, tailored rehabilitation after discharge to have the best outcomes.

TI  - First responder systems can stay operational under pandemic conditions: results of a European survey during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Background Dispatching first responders (FR) to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in addition to the emergency medical service has shown to increase survival. The promising development of FR systems over the past years has been challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19. Whilst increased numbers and worse outcomes of cardiac arrests during the pandemic suggest a need for expansion of FR schemes, appropriate risk management is required to protect first responders and patients from contracting COVID-19. This study investigated how European FR schemes were affected by the pandemic and what measures were taken to protect patients and responders from COVID-19. Methods To identify FR schemes in Europe we conducted a literature search and a web search. The schemes were contacted and invited to answer an online questionnaire during the second wave of the pandemic (December 2020/ January 2021) in Europe. Results We have identified 135 FR schemes in 28 countries and included responses from 47 FR schemes in 16 countries. 25 schemes reported deactivation due to COVID-19 at some point, whilst 22 schemes continued to operate throughout the pandemic. 39 schemes communicated a pandemic-specific algorithm to their first responders. Before the COVID-19 outbreak 20 FR systems did not provide any personal protective equipment (PPE). After the outbreak 19 schemes still did not provide any PPE. The majority of schemes experienced falling numbers of accepted call outs and decreasing registrations of new volunteers. Six schemes reported of FR having contracted COVID-19 on a mission. Conclusions European FR schemes were considerably affected by the pandemic and exhibited a range of responses to protect patients and responders. Overall, FR schemes saw a decrease in activity, which was in stark contrast to the high demand caused by the increased incidence and mortality of OHCA during the pandemic. Given the important role FR play in the chain of survival, a balanced approach upholding the safety of patients and responders should be sought to keep FR schemes operational.

TI  - Workload and main activities of consultative ICU nurses: long-term experience in a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background: Early recognition and prompt treatment of deteriorating patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU) improves hospital survival. Over the past decade, consultative services have been implemented in many institutions. This service is frequently performed by ICU nurses, while little information is available on the workload and type of activities these ICU nurses actually perform.
   Methods: In 1995, a consultative ICU nurse-driven service was introduced in a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands. In this descriptive study, we determined types of consultation, time consumed per visit, and main interventions during these activities.
   Results: During the study period, 9144 consultations in 4365 patients were performed. While the number of 'scheduled' visits (visits of patients after discharge from the ICU) was reasonably variable during the study period, the number of 'on demand' visits (visits demanded by non-ICU personnel) increased gradually, especially during the first years. At the end of the observation period, approximately half of the visits were 'on demand' in the non-ICU wards. The mean number of consultations per patient dropped gradually over the whole period, from 4.02 in 1996 to 1.54 in 2004. The total workload was approximately half an hour per day; visits were combined with regular activities of the ICU team. Tracheal suctioning was among the most frequent activities during consultation (approximately 90% of all visits).
   Conclusion: Consultative ICU nurses play a growing role in bridging the gap between the ICU and non-ICU departments in our hospital. Workload is acceptable.

TI  - Implementation of neurocritical care in Thailand
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Dedicated neurointensive care units and neurointensivists are rarely available in Thailand, a developing country, despite the high burden of life-threatening neurologic illness, including strokes, post-cardiac arrest brain injury, status epilepticus, and cerebral edema from various etiologies. Therefore, the implementation of neurocritical care is essential to improve patient outcomes. With the resource-limited circumstances, the integration of neurocritical care service by collaboration between intensivists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and other multidisciplinary care teams into the current institutional practice to take care of critically-ill neurologic patients is more suitable than building a new neurointensive care unit since this approach can promptly be made without reorganization of the hospital system. Providing neurocritical care knowledge to internal medicine and neurology residents and critical care fellows and developing a research system will lead to sustainable quality improvement in patient care. This review article will describe our current situation and strategies to implement neurocritical care in Thailand.

TI  - The anesthesiologist's perspective on emergency aortic surgery: Preoperative optimization, intraoperative management, and postoperative surveillance
T2  - SEMINARS IN VASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - The management of emergencies related to the aorta requires a multidisciplinary approach involving various health care professionals. Despite technological advancements in treat-ment methods, the risks and mortality rates associated with surgery remain high. In the emergency department, definitive diagnosis is usually obtained through computed tomog-raphy angiography, and management focuses on controlling blood pressure and treating symptoms to prevent further deterioration. Preoperative resuscitation is the main focus, followed by intraoperative management aimed at stabilizing the patient's hemodynamics, controlling bleeding, and protecting vital organs. After the operation, factors such as organ protection, transfusion management, pain control, and overall patient care must be taken into account. Endovascular techniques are becoming more common in surgical treatment, but they also present new challenges in terms of complications and outcomes. It is rec-ommended that patients with suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms be trans-ferred to facilities with both open and endovascular treatment options and a track record of successful outcomes to ensure the best patient care and long-term results. To achieve opti-mal patient outcomes, close collaboration and regular case discussions between health care professionals are necessary, as well as participation in educational programs to promote a culture of teamwork and continuous improvement. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Apitherapy in Post-Ischemic Brain Neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's Disease Proteinopathy: Focus on Honey and Its Flavonoids and Phenolic Acids
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Neurodegeneration of the brain after ischemia is a major cause of severe, long-term disability, dementia, and mortality, which is a global problem. These phenomena are attributed to excitotoxicity, changes in the blood-brain barrier, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and ultimately neuronal death. In addition, genetic factors such as post-ischemic changes in genetic programming in the expression of amyloid protein precursor, & beta;-secretase, presenilin-1 and -2, and tau protein play an important role in the irreversible progression of post-ischemic neurodegeneration. Since current treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms such as dementia and disability, the search for causative therapy that would be helpful in preventing and treating post-ischemic neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy is ongoing. Numerous studies have shown that the high contents of flavonoids and phenolic acids in honey have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-amyloid, anti-tau protein, anticholinesterase, serotonergic, and AMPAK activities, influencing signal transmission and neuroprotective effects. Notably, in many preclinical studies, flavonoids and phenolic acids, the main components of honey, were also effective when administered after ischemia, suggesting their possible use in promoting recovery in stroke patients. This review provides new insight into honey's potential to prevent brain ischemia as well as to ameliorate damage in advanced post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration.

TI  - An approach for the emergency diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in elderly individuals: a literature review
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse dysfunction of the nervous system resulting from sepsis originating outside the central nervous system. Elderly individuals (>= 65 years of age) constitute a particularly vulnerable population comprised by a high burden of underlying diseases and complications, which frequently leads to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. These patients are at increased risk of long-term or permanent central nervous system impairment, making rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment especially critical. The review is expected to promote improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of SAE in elderly patients, ultimately achieving more standardized and effi cient SAE management. METHODS: We performed a literature search in four databases-PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang-from inception to April 2025 using bilinguals (Chinese and English). RESULTS: The diagnostic criteria for SAE in elderly individuals include the following: (1) sepsis; (2) new-onset neurological dysfunction; and (3) exclusion of other causes of neurological dysfunction. Physicians should develop tailored empiric anti-infective plans for elderly SAE patients, considering comorbidities, organ function, infection site, local bacterial spectrum, and resistance. The treatment protocol can be adjusted once the pathogen is identified. Stabilizing hemodynamics and ensuring cerebral perfusion are two fluid resuscitation strategies used in elderly SAE patients. An individualized approach to fluid resuscitation using restrictive fluid volumes should be employed. Supportive treatment for elderly SAE patients focuses on improving tissue perfusion/oxygenation, controlling blood glucose levels, and correcting internal imbalances. Early rehabilitation, nutritional support, cognitive training, and family-based emotional support are important components of comprehensive care. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and management of SAE in elderly patients support early recognition and timely intervention.

TI  - Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy: Risk Stratification and Indications for Defibrillator Therapy
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically determined disease which predisposes to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The main goal of ARVC therapy is prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the most effective therapy for interruption of potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Despite its life-saving potential, ICD implantation is associated with a high rate of complications and significant impact on quality of life. Accurate risk stratification is needed to identify individuals who most benefit from the therapy. While there is general agreement that patients with a history of cardiac arrest or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia are at high risk of SCD and needs an ICD, indications for primary prevention remain a matter of debate. The article reviews the available scientific evidence and guidelines that may help to stratify the arrhythmic risk of ARVC patients and guide ICD implantation. Other therapeutic strategies, either alternative or additional to ICD, will be also addressed.

TI  - Attitude of elderly patients towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Greece
T2  - GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - AimAlthough researchers in several countries have investigated patients' points of view regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there has been no research investigating this issue in Greece. The present study aimed at identifying the attitude of older Greek patients regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   MethodsOne basic questionnaire consisting of 34 questions was used in order to identify patients' opinions regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation in five different hospitals from June to November 2011.
   ResultsIn total, 300 questionnaires were collected. Although patients' knowledge regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation was poor, most of them would like to be resuscitated in case they suffered an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Also, they believe that they should have the right to accept or refuse treatment. However, the legal and sociocultural norms in Greece do not support patients' choice for the decision to refuse resuscitation. The influence of several factors, such as their general health status or the underlying pathology, could lead patients to give a do not attempt resuscitation order.
   ConclusionsThe attitudes of older Greek patients regarding resuscitation are not different from others', whereas the legal and sociocultural norms in Greece do not support patient choice in end-of-life decisions, namely the decision to refuse resuscitation. We advocate the introduction of advanced directives, as well as the establishment and implementation of specific legislation regarding the ethics of resuscitation in Greece.

TI  - Intracellular toxicity exerted by PCBs and role of VBNC bacterial strains in biodegradation
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are xenobiotic compounds that persists in the environment for long-term, though its productivity is banned. Abatement of the pollutants have become laborious due to it's recalcitrant nature in the environment leading to toxic effects in humans and other living beings. Biphenyl degrading bacteria co-metabolically degrade low chlorinated PCBs using the active metabolic pathway. bph operon possess different genetic arrangements in gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The binding ability of the genes and the active sites were determined by PCB docking studies. The active site of bphA gene with conserved amino acid residues determines the substrate specificity and biodegradability. Accumulation of toxic intermediates alters cellular behaviour, biomass production and downturn the metabolic activity. Several bacteria in the environment attain unculturable state which is viable and metabolically active but not cultivable (VBNC). Resuscitation promoting factor (Rpf) and Rpf homologous protein retrieve the culturability of the so far uncultured bacteria. Recovery of this adaptive mechanism against various physical and chemical stressors make a headway in understanding the functionality of both environmental and medically important unculturable bacteria. Thus, this paper review about the general aspects of PCBs, cellular toxicity exerted by PCBs, role of unculturable bacterial strains in biodegradation, genes involved and degradation pathways. It is suggested to extrapolate the research findings on extracellular organic matters produced in culture supernatant of VBNC thus transforming VBNC to culturable state.

TI  - Ambulatory ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure do not specifically predict an increased risk of sudden death
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background-Ventricular arrhythmias are a frequent finding in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients and a cause of concern for physicians caring for them. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the importance of ventricular arrhythmias as predictors of sudden death in patients with CHF. This study examined the independent predictive value of ventricular arrhythmias for sudden death and all-cause mortality in PROMISE (Prospective Randomized Milrinone Survival Evaluation).
   Methods and Results-Ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed and quantified by use of prespecified criteria on baseline ambulatory ECGs from 1080 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% enrolled in PROMISE. The relationship of ventricular arrhythmias and other clinical parameters to overall. mortality and sudden death classified by an independent, blinded mortality committee was determined. There were 290 deaths, of which 139 were classified as sudden. Of the several measures of ventricular ectopy that were univariate predictors, the frequency of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) was the most powerful predictor and remained a significant independent predictor when included with other clinical variables in multivariate models of both sudden death mortality and non-sudden death mortality, However, multiple logistic analysis with models including the clinical variables with and without the NSVT variable demonstrated that the frequency of NSVT did not add significant information beyond the clinical variables.
   Conclusions-This study demonstrates that ventricular arrhythmias do not specifically predict sudden death in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Thus, the finding of asymptomatic NSVT on ambulatory ECG does not identify specific candidates for antiarrhythmic or device therapy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
CP  - Symposium on Evidence-Based Arrhythmia Management
AB  - Role of Amiodarone with ICD. Amiodarone is one of the most frequently used antiarrhythmic drugs in clinical practice. In patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom rhythm control is judged desirable, amiodarone is the most effective therapy. Amiodarone effectively prevents atrial fibrillation and may improve quality of life, but there is no evidence that it decreases mortality or severe morbidity in atrial fibrillation. In patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone may decrease mortality to a small degree, but the evidence for this benefit is incomplete. Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators frequently require antiarrhythmic drug therapy, especially to treat electrical storm. Amiodarone is useful in these patients; however, it may increase defibrillation thresholds in some patients. In patients with out-of-hospital DC shock-resistant VF, amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available to assist in resuscitation. Amiodarone is a complicated drug, and its optimal use requires careful patient surveillance with respect to potential adverse effects.

TI  - Poisoning-induced acute atraumatic compartment syndrome
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Acute Atraumatic Compartment Syndrome (AACS) can be a potentially life and limb threatening complication of either drug abuse or medication injection. Prompt recognition followed by emergency fasciotomy is required to avoid permanent disability. A better understanding of the different clinical presentations may lead to improved outcomes through more expedient diagnosis and treatment. We describe five new cases of AACS caused by illicit drug abuse within the McGill University Hospitals, with a review of all 102 similar patients previously documented in the literature between January 1970 and May 1997, The average age for all cases was 29 years, with 74% being male. The presence of edema, pain, tension, and skin changes were the most frequent symptoms and signs reported. There appear to be two distinct mechanisms of poisoning-induced AACS: (1) direct vasotoxicity and (2) limb compression caused by prolonged comatose state. Direct vasotoxicity is more likely to lead to eventual amputation, whereas prolonged limb compression is more likely to progress to systemic complications such as azotemia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and renal failure (Crush Syndrome). Long-term sequelae of motor loss, sensory disruption, and development of contracture were common in AACS of both causes. Because Compartment Syndrome is a surgical emergency, primary care and emergency physicians must have a high index of suspicion to promptly recognize and treat this problem.

TI  - V-V ECMO for severe Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia presenting with sudden cardiac arrest: A case report and literature review
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:Psittacosis, also known as parrot fever, is an infectious disease caused by Chlamydia psittaci, which can lead to C psittaci pneumonia. Clinical manifestations are highly nonspecific, which can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and even death.Patient concerns:In this case presentation, we reported one 65-year-old male case of C psittaci pneumonia who was admitted to our hospital on December 2, 2022 due to the chief complaints of poor appetite and fatigue for 3 days as the clinical manifestations. He denied contact with birds but admitted riding horses 1 week ago.Diagnoses:Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia of patient was confirmed through metagenomic sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid under bronchoscopy.Intervention:Patient was treated with V-V ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation and CRRT.Outcomes:On December 12, the patient was successfully weaned off V-V ECMO and discharged on December 20, 2022. During postoperative follow-up, CT scan in a local hospital revealed the infiltrative lesions of the lung were absent.Lessons:This case prompts that metagenomic next-generation sequencing is a feasible diagnostic tool for psittacosis, which can rapidly worsen and even cause sudden cardiac arrest. V-V ECMO might be a viable emergency therapeutic option.

TI  - Comparative efficacy analysis of mannitol and hypertonic saline in the management of traumatic brain injury: a scientific exploration of neuroprotective strategies
T2  - EMERGENCY CARE JOURNAL
AB  - In the management of severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), controlling intracranial pressure (ICP) is a pivotal therapeutic goal. Historically, mannitol has been the recommended first-line osmotic agent; however, concerns surrounding its use, including hypotension, rebound ICP elevation, and renal toxicity, have prompted a quest for alternative strategies. Hypertonic saline (HS) has emerged as a promising substitute, demonstrating efficacy in reducing ICP without compromising cerebral perfusion. This comprehensive analysis explores the comparative effectiveness of Mannitol and Hypertonic Saline in the context of severe TBIs. While Mannitol has been a longstanding choice, recent attention has shifted towards HS due to its reported superiority in ICP reduction. Concerns associated with mannitol, such as hypotension and rebound ICP, are juxtaposed against the potential advantages offered by HS. The scarcity of clinical studies focusing on TBIrelated outcomes, such as patient survival and long-term benefits, is highlighted, underscoring a critical gap in the current knowledge landscape. The review aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the comparative effectiveness of Mannitol and Hypertonic Saline, considering not only ICP control but also broader patient outcomes. By addressing the suitability of these agents in diverse clinical settings, this analysis seeks to guide clinicians in making informed decisions tailored to individual patient needs.

TI  - Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Adult: A Bridge to the State of the Art
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REVIEWS
AB  - Despite the technological advancements in the last 40 years, conditions such as refractory cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest still present a very high mortality rate in real-world clinical practice.
   In this light, we have reviewed the techniques, indications, contraindications, and results of the socalled Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Circulatory Membrane Oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the adult population to evaluate the current results of this temporary cardio-pulmonary support as salvage and/or bridge therapy in the patient suffering from refractory cardiogenic shock or cardio-circulatory arrest.
   The results are encouraging, especially in the setting of refractory cardiogenic shock and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Among a selected population, the prompt institution of a VA-ECMO may radically change the prognosis by sustaining vital functions while looking for the leading cause or waiting for the reversal of the temporary cardio-respiratory negative condition.
   The future directions aim to standardized and shared protocols, miniaturization of the machines, and possibly the institution of specialized "ECMO teams" for in and the out-of-hospital institution of the tool.

TI  - The Cochrane Library as a resource for evidence on out-of-hospital health care interventions
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
CP  - Spark of Life Conference
AB  - Study objective: Although the Cochrane Library is promoted as a rigorous source of evidence, the relevance of this evidence to the out-of-hospital setting has not been assessed. The objective of this study is to identify existing controlled trials and systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library that have been conducted in or are relevant to out-of-hospital health care. The scope of out-of-hospital care, the years and trends of out-of-hospital research publication, and the journals of publication are also examined.
   Methods: Using a search strategy developed by the Cochrane Prehospital and Emergency Health Field, 2 reviewers searched issue 4, 2005 of the Cochrane Library to identify reports of controlled trials and systematic reviews on out-of-hospital interventions. Three independent reviewers screened the titles identified by the search strategy and applied predetermined criteria to classify the reported study as out-of-hospital based or not out-of-hospital based. The out-of-hospital-based studies were then categorized as randomized or nonrandomized trials.
   Results: Screening of the 19,759 titles retrieved by the search strategy identified 4,016 studies that were potentially out-of-hospital based. Abstract and full-text analysis of the 4,016 studies identified 400 reports of trials and 13 reviews or protocols that were out-of-hospital based. Of the 400 reports of trials identified, 299 (75%) were randomized trials. The number of out-of-hospital trials published increased steadily from the 1970s to the late 1990s, with the majority of trials (63%) covering interventions related to resuscitation and cardiac care. Annals of Emergency Medicine published more out-of-hospital trials than any other journal, followed by Resuscitation and Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Conclusion: The Cochrane Library provides a useful resource of health care evidence; however, the relatively small number of out-of-hospital-based systematic reviews and trials does not comprehensively cover the broad scope of out-of-hospital health care.

TI  - Acidosis as a promising early indicator of mortality among point-of-care parameters and vital signs in non-traumatic critically ill patients
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundThe management of critically ill patients, arriving at the emergency department (ED), requires structured care in critical care facilities, particularly in the resuscitation room. This study examines the significance of initial vital signs and blood gas analysis (BGA)-derived values as clinically useful early indicators of mortality risk in critically ill patients, both during in the resuscitation room care and within the following 30 days, with a focus on evaluating the individual predictive performance of accessible clinical parameters.MethodsWe pooled data from two consecutive retrospective observational studies in a German university ED to analyze an unselected patient population of non-traumatic critically ill patients. Vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and BGA values (including pH, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate, electrolyte levels) on admission to the ED, were used to estimate the impact on both resuscitation room and 30-day mortality.ResultsIn 1,536 critically ill patients, pH, lactate and bicarbonate were found to be potential predictors of resuscitation room mortality. In contrast, vital signs showed limited reliability in predicting outcomes. Of all tested variables, pH demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) value among the analyzed markers for resuscitation room mortality (AUC 0.81 [95% CI 0.75-0.87]). However, the AUC of pH for 30-day mortality decreased to 0.64 ([0.6 - 0.68], indicating a complex interplay of factors influencing long-term outcome. A subgroup analysis based on pH showed a substantial increase in resuscitation room and 30-day mortality for patients with a pH below 7.2 as well as a second increase below 7.0.ConclusionOur study highlights important parameters for the assessment of critically ill patients at ED admission that are helpful for formulating immediate medical decisions. Acidosis on the initial BGA appears to be a relevant prognostic marker for mortality in critically ill, non-traumatic patients and may aid in early risk assessment, regardless of the underlying condition. Early detection of acidosis could facilitate rapid decision-making and timely identification of patients requiring intensive care.

TI  - Mitochondrial dysfunction in fatal ventricular arrhythmias
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA
AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remain some of the most important public health concerns worldwide. For the past 50 years, the recommendation in the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines has been that defibrillation is the only option for shockable cardiac arrest. There is growing evidence to demonstrate that mitochondria play a vital role in the outcome of postresuscitation cardiac function. Although targeting mitochondria to improve resuscitation outcome following cardiac arrest has been proposed for many years, understanding concerning the changes in mitochondria during cardiac arrest, especially in the case of VF, is still limited. In addition, despite new research initiatives and improved medical technology, the overall survival rates of patients with SCA still remain the same. Understanding cardiac mitochondrial alterations during fatal arrhythmias may help to enable the formulation of strategies to improve the outcomes of resuscitation. The attenuation of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction during VF through pharmacological intervention as well as ischaemic postconditioning could also be a promising target for intervention and inform a new paradigm of treatments. In this review, the existing evidence available from in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies regarding the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction during VF is comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition, the effects of interventions targeting cardiac mitochondria during fatal ventricular arrhythmias are presented. Since there are no clinical reports from studies targeting mitochondria to improve resuscitation outcome available, this review will provide important information to encourage further investigations in a clinical setting.

TI  - High-energy defibrillation increases the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Background The fatal outcome of victims after initially successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest has been attributed both to global myocardial ischemia during the interval of cardiac arrest and to the adverse effects of reperfusion. The present study was prompted by earlier experimental observation that the magnitude of myocardial dysfunction was in part related to the energy delivered during electrical defibrillation.
   Methods and Results Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. Precordial compression was begun together with mechanical ventilation after 4 minutes of untreated VF and continued for 6 minutes. Spontaneous circulation was restored in each animal after external defibrillation with a single stored 2-, 10-, or 20-J countershock. Cardiac index and the rate of left ventricular pressure rise at left ventricular pressure of 40 mm Hg (dP/dt(40)) and fall (negative dP/dt) during the 240-minute interval after successful resuscitation were decreased, and left ventricular diastolic pressure was increased. These decreases in myocardial function were closely related to the energy of electrical defibrillation. After a 20-J shock, animals survived for only 5+/-3 hours; after a 10-J shock, animals survived for 15+/-4 hours; and after a 2-J shock, all animals survived for >24 hours.
   Conclusions The severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is related, at least in part, to the magnitude of the electrical energy of the delivered shock.

TI  - Burden of caregiving after a child'S in-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Objective: To describe caregiver burden among those whose children survive in-hospital cardiac arrest and have high risk of neurologic disability, and explore factors associated with burden during the first year post-arrest.
   Methods: The study is a secondary analysis of the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Paediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital (THAPCA-IH) trial. 329 children who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest, chest compressions for > 2 min, and mechanical ventilation after return of circulation were recruited to THAPCA-IH. Of these, 155 survived to one year, and caregivers of 138 were assessed for burden. Caregiver burden was assessed at baseline, and 3 and 12 months post-arrest using the Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire for children < 5 years old and the Child Health Questionnaire for children > 5 years. Child functioning was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales Second Edition (VABS-II), the Paediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and Paediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scales, and caregiver perception of global functioning.
   Results: Of 138 children, 77 (55.8%) were male, 77 (55.8%) were white, and 109 (79.0%) were < 5 years old at the time of arrest. Caregiver burden was greater than reference norms at all time points. Worse POPC, PCPC and VABS-II scores at 3 months post-arrest were associated with greater caregiver burden at 12 months. Worse global functioning at 3 months was associated with greater burden at 12 months for children < 5 years.
   Conclusions: Caregiver burden is substantial during the first year after paediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest, and associated with the extent of the child's neurobehavioural dysfunction.

TI  - Associations between end-of-life discussions, patient mental health, medical care near death, and caregiver bereavement adjustment
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Context Talking about death can be difficult. Without evidence that end- of- life discussions improve patient outcomes, physicians must balance their desire to honor patient autonomy against a concern of inflicting psychological harm.
   Objective To determine whether end- of- life discussions with physicians are associated with fewer aggressive interventions.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A US multisite, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers ( n= 332 dy-ads), September 2002- February 2008. Patients were followed up from enrollment to death, a median of 4.4 months later. Bereaved caregivers' psychiatric illness and quality of life was assessed a median of 6.5 months later.
   Main Outcome Measures Aggressive medical care ( eg, ventilation, resuscitation) and hospice in the final week of life. Secondary outcomes included patients' mental health and caregivers' bereavement adjustment.
   Results One hundred twenty- three of 332 ( 37.0%) patients reported having end-of-life discussions before baseline. Such discussions were not associated with higher rates of major depressive disorder ( 8.3% vs 5.8%; adjusted odds ratio [ OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.54- 3.32), or more worry ( mean McGill score, 6.5 vs 7.0; P=. 19). After propensity- score weighted adjustment, end- of- life discussions were associated with lower rates of ventilation ( 1.6% vs 11.0%; adjusted OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08- 0.83), resuscitation ( 0.8% vs 6.7%; adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03- 0.80), ICU admission ( 4.1% vs 12.4%; adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14- 0.90), and earlier hospice enrollment ( 65.6% vs 44.5%; adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.04- 2.63). In adjusted analyses, more aggressive medical care was associated with worse patient quality of life ( 6.4 vs 4.6; F= 3.61, P=. 01) and higher risk of major depressive disorder in bereaved caregivers ( adjusted OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.12- 10.13), whereas longer hospice stays were associated with better patient quality of life ( mean score, 5.6 vs 6.9; F= 3.70, P=. 01). Better patient quality of life was associated with better caregiver quality of life at follow- up (beta=. 20; P=. 001).
   Conclusions End- of- life discussions are associated with less aggressive medical care near death and earlier hospice referrals. Aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse bereavement adjustment.

TI  - Hope in Miniature: The First Case of Implantation of a "Tiny Pacemaker" in Italy as a Successful Treatment for Congenital Atrioventricular Block in a Low Birth Weight Child
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Congenital complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) is a rare cardiac condition occurring in approximately one in 15,000 to one in 22,000 live births. Maternal autoimmune diseases, with anti-ssA (Ro) and anti-ssB (La) antibodies implicated in 56%-90% of cases, are primary causes. We present a case of a 31-year-old primigravid woman referred at 29 weeks of gestation for fetal high-grade AVB, initially diagnosed as 2:1 AVB with a ventricular rate of 45 bpm. Maternal corticosteroid therapy was initiated for suspected immune-mediated etiology, pending autoantibody test results. Upon transfer, a 3:1 AVB was detected, with fetal heart failure signs. Genetic and autoimmune evaluations ruled out primary electrical heart diseases and infections. Prompt intervention was necessitated due to fetal cardiac decompensation. Sympathomimetic drugs via placental circulation were ineffective. Cesarean section was scheduled at 30 weeks and 1 day. The neonate, weighing 1280 g, had an APGAR score of 7 and a heart rate of 40 bpm. Initial resuscitation and isoproterenol infusion resulted in a moderate heart rate increase. Temporary pacing wires were surgically placed. As permanent pacemaker implantation became necessary, traditional venous access was impractical. A "tiny pacemaker" made with modification of a Medtronic Micra MC1VR01 generator connected to an epicardial lead ensured hemodynamic stability. Approval of this off-label device from the Italian Ministry of Health was swiftly obtained. Diagnosis of CAVB typically involves fetal echocardiography and fetal magnetocardiography for precise arrhythmia diagnosis. Treatment varies, with fluorinated steroids reducing block severity in autoimmune cases. Miniaturized pacemakers offer a promising solution for neonates, addressing challenges of conventional devices. Further research is needed to evaluate their long-term efficacy and safety, potentially benefiting patients with venous and cardiac abnormalities.

TI  - Prediction, prevention, and management of delayed graft function: where are we now?
T2  - CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Delayed graft function (DGF) remains a major barrier to improved outcomes after kidney transplantation. High-risk transplant recipients can be identified, but no definitive prediction model exists. Novel biomarkers to predict DGF in the first hours post-transplant, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), are under investigation. Donor management to minimize the profound physiological consequences of brain death is highly complex. A hormonal resuscitation package to manage the catecholamine storm that follows brain death is recommended. Donor pretreatment with dopamine prior to procurement lowers the rate of DGF. Hypothermic machine perfusion may offer a significant reduction in the rate of DGF vs simple cold storage, but costs need to be evaluated. Surgically, reducing warm ischemia time may be advantageous. Research into recipient preconditioning options has so far not generated clinically helpful interventions. Diagnostic criteria for DGF vary, but requirement for dialysis and/or persistent high serum creatinine is likely to remain key to diagnosis until current work on early biomarkers has progressed further. Management centers on close monitoring of graft (non)function and physiological parameters. With so many unanswered questions, substantial reductions in the toll of DGF in the near future seem unlikely but concentrated research on many levels offers long-term promise.

T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Molecular biomarkers have revolutionalized diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, such as troponin use in myocardial infarction. Urgent need for high-fidelity biomarkers in neurocritical care has resulted in numerous studies reporting potential candidate biomarkers.
   We performed an electronic literature search and systematic review of English language articles on cellular/molecular biomarkers associated with outcome and with disease-specific secondary complications in adult patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and post-cardiac arrest hypoxic ischemic encephalopathic injuries (HIE).
   A total of 135 articles were included. Though a wide variety of potential biomarkers have been identified, only neuron-specific enolase has been validated in large cohorts and shows 100 % specificity for poor outcome prediction in HIE patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia. There are many promising candidate blood and CSF biomarkers in SAH, AIS, ICH, and TBI, but none yet meets criteria for routine clinical use.
   Current studies vary significantly in patient selection, biosample collection/processing, and biomarker measurement protocols, thereby limiting the generalizability of overall results. Future large prospective studies with standardized treatment, biosample collection, and biomarker measurement and validation protocols are necessary to identify high-fidelity biomarkers in neurocritical care.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of "The Pause" after Unsuccessful Resuscitation: Insights from Cardiac Arrest Teams"
T2  - NORDISK SYGEPLEJEFORSKNING-NORDIC NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Unsuccessful resuscitation attempts are an aspect of the cardiac arrest team's role. Nevertheless, the psychological impact of witnessing patients' death, can lead to healthcare worker burnout. This study aims, to explore the cardiac arrest team's experiences with "The Pause" (one minute of silence) after unsuccessful resuscitation in in-hospital cardiac arrests. Method: A deductive content analysis, based on focus group interviews led to the Findings: Promoting unity and equality within the team, Adding value and respect for human life, Reinstating human values within the organization, Closure and a better transition Barriers against "The Pause". Conclusion: "The Pause" offers an opportunity for healthcare professionals to acknowledge the gravity of patient death and prioritize their own emotional well-being. By fostering a respectful and supportive work culture, this practice can mitigate the negative psychological impact of such events. Nevertheless, perceived vulnerability remains a key barrier to implementation.

TI  - Do-(Not-)Mechanical-Circulatory-Support Orders: Should We Ask All Cardiac Surgery Patients for Informed Consent for Post-Cardiotomy Extracorporeal Life Circulatory Support?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Post-cardiotomy extracorporeal life support (PC-ECLS) has seen a substantial increase in use over the past 10 years. PC-ECLS can be a life-saving procedure and is mostly applied in the presence of unexpected, severe cardio-respiratory complication. Despite PC-ECLS being critical in allowing for organ recovery, it is unfortunately closely connected with an unpredictable outcomes, high morbidity, and, even in the case of cardiac function improvement, potential sustained disabilities that have a life-changing impact for the patient and his or her family. Since the decision to start PC-ECLS is made in an acute setting, there is often only limited or no time for self-determined choices. Due to the major impact of the intervention, it would be highly desirable to obtain informed consent before starting PC-ECLS, since the autonomy of the patient and shared-decision making are two of the most important ethical values in modern medicine. Recent developments regarding awareness of the impacts of a prolonged intensive care stay make this a particularly relevant topic. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop a structural strategy that takes into account the likelihood of such an intervention and the wishes and preferences of the patient, and thus the related autonomy of the patient. This article proposes key points for such a strategy in the form of a PC-ECLS informed consent, a do-(not-)mechanical-circulatory-support order (D(N)MCS), and specific guidelines to determine the extent of the shared decision making. The concept presented in this article could be a starting point for improved and ethical PC-ECLS treatment and application.

TI  - Clinical Practices Following Train-The-Trainer Trauma Course Completion in Uganda: A Parallel-Convergent Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundDespite the growth of trauma training courses worldwide, evidence for their impact on clinical practice in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is sparse. We investigated trauma practices by trained providers in Uganda using clinical observation, surveys, and interviews.MethodsUgandan providers participated in the Kampala Advanced Trauma Course (KATC) from 2018 to 2019. Between July and September of 2019, we directly evaluated guideline-concordant behaviors in KATC-exposed facilities using a structured real-time observation tool. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with course-trained providers to elucidate experiences of trauma care and factors that impact adoption of guideline-concordant behaviors. We assessed perceptions of trauma resource availability through a validated survey.ResultsOf 23 resuscitations, 83% were managed without course-trained providers. Frontline providers inconsistently performed universally applicable assessments: pulse checks (61%), pulse oximetry (39%), lung auscultation (52%), blood pressure (65%), pupil examination (52%). We did not observe skill transference between trained and untrained providers. In interviews, respondents found KATC personally transformative but not sufficient for facility-wide improvement due to issues with retention, lack of trained peers, and resource shortages. Resource perception surveys similarly demonstrated profound resource shortages and variation across facilities.ConclusionsTrained providers view short-term trauma training interventions positively, but these courses may lack long-term impact due to barriers to adopting best practices. Trauma courses should include more frontline providers, target skill transference and retention, and increase the proportion of trained providers at each facility to promote communities of practice. Essential supplies and infrastructure in facilities must be consistent for providers to practice what they have learned.

TI  - Development of cardiopulmonary - cerebral resuscitation in the twentieth century
T2  - HISTORY OF ANESTHESIA
CP  - 5th International Symposium on the History of Anesthesia
AB  - Before the renaissance, death was to be accepted as an act of God. From then on, there was a will to attempt resuscitation. The ability to reverse coma-induced airway obstruction, apnea, and pulselessness began in response to accidents caused by general anesthesia in the late 1800s. Around 1900, knowledge existed about the majority of CPR steps. This knowledge, however, was then not assembled into an effective system because of lack of communication between laboratory researchers, clinicians, and rescuers. Open-chest CPR was effectively practiced in operating rooms during the first half of the 20th century. Anglo-American anesthesiologists co-pioneered trauma resuscitation during World War II. Modem cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation (CPCR), which is now giving every person the ability to challenge death anywhere, has been developed since the 1950s. Through research in Baltimore, the chest-pressure and back-pressure ann-lift methods of artificial ventilation, taught for 100 years, were replaced by backward tilt of the head and direct mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and emergency artificial circulation by sternal compressions was rediscovered. Steps A-B-C of basic life-support were extended-to advanced and prolonged life-support. Anesthesiologists pioneered hospital ICUs almost simultaneously on three continents. In the 1960s and 1970s, several groups initiated CPR education research, the development of training aids, effective resuscitation delivery through emergency medical services (EMS) systems, and the multidisciplinary specialty of critical care medicine (CCM). Since the 1970s and 1980s, cerebral resuscitation potentials after prolonged cardiac arrest have been evaluated with ICU outcome models in large animals and in randomized clinical outcome studies. Pharmacologic strategies have given relatively disappointing results. Mechanism-oriented research escalated. Postarrest CBF promotion improved outcome in animals and patients. A breakthrough came in the 1980s and 1990s with the revival of research into therapeutic hypothermia. Mild resuscitative postarrest hypothermia (which is simple and safe) showed a breakthrough effect, extending the normothermic arrest reversibility limit from 5 to 10 min no-flow. Clinical trials of mild hypothermia are being reported now, with positive results. Animal research has begun into "suspended animation for delayed resuscitation" for temporarily unresuscitable cardiac arrest. Education research, delivery programs, and case registries for ongoing outcome evaluation should get higher priority. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Amelanotic Melanoma Invading the Heart
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - We present a case of a middle-aged woman who initially presented with shortness of breath but was ultimately found to have a large mass -like lesion in the right atrium of the heart with multi -modality imaging including cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiogram. Biopsy results were positive for amelanotic melanoma. The patient underwent extensive debridement surgery, and she was started on chemotherapy with a close follow-up with an oncologist. In the setting of an aggressive course of disease, unfortunately, the patient passed away secondary to sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac melanoma, also known as melanoma of the heart, is an extremely rare type of melanoma that originates in the heart. This case attributes to the professional growth and competency of healthcare providers involved in the care of patients with cardiac melanoma, ultimately aiming to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life. Due to its rarity and the challenges associated with its diagnosis and treatment, prognosis for cardiac melanoma is generally poor. However, advancement in cancer research and treatment may offer hope for improved outcomes in some cases.

TI  - European Society of Cardiology: cardiovascular disease statistics 2021
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Aims This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the 57 ESC member countries. Methods and results Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are similar to 30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries.

TI  - Anesthetic Management of Successful Extracorporeal Resuscitation After Six Hours of Cardiac Arrest Due to Severe Accidental Hypothermia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
AB  - Accidental hypothermia (AH) in Mediterranean countries often is underestimated. AH should be suspected in patients also in moderate climates throughout all seasons. Compared with other countries, the mortality rate due to AH in Spain is low, and hypothermia rarely is recognized and treated. The case of a patient who experienced cardiac arrest due to severe AH and was resuscitated for more than six hours using extracorporeal life support recently was published. Herein that case is reviewed, with the anesthetic management during cannulation detailed. In addition, the authors highlight how the application of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines is different in AH patients, how in-hospital (HOPE score) triage criteria should be applied, and how the establishment of clear standard operating procedures and education strategies should be promoted.

TI  - Regulatory and educational initiatives fail to promote discussions regarding end-of-life care
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
AB  - We conducted an observational cohort study to determine if hospital-based, reinforcing regulatory and educational interventions could encourage physicians to discuss end-of-life (EOL) care with their patients. Specifically, we measured the effect of (1) administrative prompts to encourage discussions about EOL care and (2) a mandatory educational seminal focusing on EOL issues. Study subjects were patients consecutively admitted to the medicine service who faced an anticipated 3-year mortality rate of at least 50 %. The main study endpoint was the frequency of documented EOL discussions between physicians and patients. In the inception cohort of 184 patients, physicians discussed EOL care with 64 patients (34.8 %), and in the follow-up cohort of 121 patients, 41 individuals (33.9 %) had documented discussions regarding EOL issues (P = 0.90). Actual "Do Not Resuscitate"(DNR) orders were written for 53 patients (28.8 %) in the inception cohort and for 33 persons (27.3 %) in the follow-up cohort (P = 0.71). We conclude that enhanced, mutually reinforcing regulatory and educational efforts focusing on EOL care proved ineffectual at promoting either discussions about EOL issues or the use of DNR orders.

TI  - 'Tell me exactly what's happened': When linguistic choices affect the efficiency of emergency calls for cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Clear and efficient communication between emergency caller and call-taker is crucial to timely ambulance dispatch. We aimed to explore the impact of linguistic variation in the delivery of the prompt "okay, tell me exactly what happened" on the way callers describe the emergency in the Medical Priority Dispatch System (R).
   Methods: We analysed 188 emergency calls for cases of paramedic-confirmed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We investigated the linguistic features of the prompt "okay, tell me exactly what happened" in relation to the format (report vs. narrative) of the caller's response. In addition, we compared calls with report vs. narrative responses in the length of response and time to dispatch.
   Results: Callers were more likely to respond with a report format when call-takers used the present perfect ("what's happened") rather than the simple past ("what happened") (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 4.07; 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 2.05-8.28, p < 0.001). Reports were significantly shorter than narrative responses (9 s vs. 18 s, p < 0.001), and were associated with less time to dispatch (50 s vs. 58s, p = 0.002).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that linguistic variations in the way the scripted sentences of a protocol are delivered can have an impact on the efficiency with which call-takers process emergency calls. A better understanding of interactional dynamics between caller and call-taker may translate into improvements of dispatch performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neo-SENSE: a non-invasive smart sensing mattress for cardiac monitoring of babies
T2  - 2019 IEEE SENSORS APPLICATIONS SYMPOSIUM (SAS)
CP  - 14th IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)
AB  - Within the first minute of life a newborn must take its first breath to make the transition from life inside the womb to the outside world. If a baby does not start breathing, its heart rate will drop and the circulation of blood carrying oxygen to the organs will be seriously affected. The damage done to a newborn who is deprived of oxygen happens so quickly that rapid response is imperative. During birth, the attending neonatal staff manually listen to the baby's heart and count the heart rate; however, this has proven inaccurate and inefficient. Nowadays, there is not a reliable method to monitor newborn heart rate promptly throughout birth. In this paper, we report the design and development of a novel smart mattress device to measure the babies' electrocardiogram and respiration non-invasively. The device is based on electrometer-based amplifier sensors combined with novel screen-printing techniques. Proof of concept tests are carried out to demonstrate the suitability of the smart-mattress for new born ECG monitoring. We perform tests with a young infant and demonstrate the potential of this sensing technology to provide a quick and reliable application as ECG readings were displayed within a time < 30 seconds. This will aid the neonatal staff to assess the success of the resuscitation technology aiming to lower the incidence of long-term consequences of poor adaptation to life outside the womb.

TI  - BRAIN-ORIENTED INTENSIVE-CARE AFTER RESUSCITATION FROM CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - The 'chain-of-survival' concept has gained general acceptance in the care of cardiac arrest victims. Most standards and guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, however, focus on the initial links in the chain. We consider appropriate in-hospital care for the survivors a logical extension of the chain of survival. In recent years extensive research activity has probed the pathophysiology and pharmacology of postischemic reperfusion. The present review discusses the current understanding of mechanisms for cerebral damage following global ischemia. Promising pharmacological principles for protection or resuscitation from cerebral ischemia are reviewed. None of them are considered ready for clinical application. Clinical guidelines are proposed, based on the reviewed data and previously published clinical observations. Cornerstones of the proposed brain-oriented intensive care protocol are: (1) hemodynamic monitoring and meticulous treatment of circulatory disturbances, (2) controlled ventilation providing normoventilation and normoxia to all comatose patients, (3) avoiding hyperglycemia and hyperthermia in comatose patients, (4) adequate analgesia and sedation, tempered by the understanding that oversedation impedes neurological evaluation without promoting recovery. An accurate prognosis can usually be made 48-72 h after resuscitation. This permits reevaluation and assignment to an appropriate level of continued hospital care.

TI  - X-linked myotubular myopathy in a family of two infant siblings: A case report and review
T2  - PEDIATRICS AND NEONATOLOGY
AB  - X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe type of congenital skeletal muscle disorder usually presenting at birth requiring extensive resuscitation. While having phenotypic variability, its diagnosis carries a poor prognosis due to high rates of hospitalization and mortality by early infancy. Management of patients with XLMTM should therefore be guided by shared decision-making with parents, considering the severity and progression of the disease, quality of life, and demands on caregivers. We describe a family unit of two half-siblings presenting with the severe neonatal form of XLMTM, with varying prognosis and outcomes. Furthermore, a novel maternally-derived c.343-1G > A variant in intron-5 of the MTM1 gene was identified in this family. Hereby, we propose an algorithm for the management of XLMTM, outlining important considerations during the antenatal and postnatal follow-up period.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of potential improvements to emergency medical services for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Study objective: To measure the incremental cost-effectiveness of various improvements to emergency medical services (EMS) systems aimed at increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Methods: We performed cost-effectiveness analysis based on (1) metaanalysis of effectiveness of the various EMS systems, (2) costing of each component of EMS systems, (3) modeling of the relationship between the proportion of cardiac arrest victims who receive CPR and the proportion of individuals trained, (4) modeling of the relationship between response time interval and the characteristics of the EMS system, (5) measurement of quality of life, and (6) decision analysis to combine the results of the first five components.
   Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a 48-second improvement in mean response time in a one-tier EMS system yielded by the addition of more EMS providers was $368,000 per quality-adjusted life year(QALY). For improved response time in a two-tier EMS system by the addition of more basic life support (BLS)/BLS-defibrillator (BLS-D) providers to the first tier, the ratio was $53,000 per QALY with pump vehicles or $159,000 per QALY with ambulances. Change from a one-tier EMS to a two-tier EMS system by the addition of initial BLS/BLS-D providers in pump vehicles as the first tier was associated with a cost per QALY of $40,000. Change from one-tier EMS to two-tier EMS by the addition of initial BLS/BLS-D providers in ambulances as the first tier was associated with a cost per QALY of $94,000.
   Conclusion: The most attractive options in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness were improved response time in a two-tier EMS system or change from a one-tier-to a two-tier EMS system. Future research should be directed toward identification of the costs of instituting the first tier of a two-tier EMS system and identification of cost-effective methods of improving response time.

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the light-regulation and circadian-rhythm of the VDE gene promoter from Zingiber officinale
T2  - PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB  - Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) is prone to photoinhibition under intense sunlight. Excessive light can be dissipated by the xanthophyll cycle, where violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) plays a critical role in protecting the photosynthesis apparatus from the damage of excessive light. We isolated similar to 2.0 kb of ginger VDE (GVDE) gene promoter, which contained the circadian box, I-box, G-box and GT-1 motif. Histochemical staining of Arabidopsis indicated the GVDE promoter was active in almost all organs, especially green tissues. beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity driven by GVDE promoter was repressed rather than activated by high light. GUS activity was altered by hormones, growth regulators and abiotic stresses, which increased with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and decreased with abscisic acid, salicylic acid, zeatin, salt (sodium chloride) and polyethylene glycol. Interestingly, GUS activities with gibberellin or indole-3-acetic acid increased in the short-term (24 h) and decreased in the long-term (48 and 72 h). Analysis of 5' flank deletion found two crucial functional regions residing in -679 to -833 and -63 to -210. Northern blotting analysis found transcription to be regulated by the endogenous circadian clock. Finally, we found a region necessary for regulating the circadian rhythm and another for the basic promoter activity.
   Key message A novel promoter, named GVDE promoter, was first isolated and analyzed in this study. We have determined one region crucial for promoter activity and another responsible for keeping circadian rhythms.

TI  - Life supporting first aid training of the public - review and recommendations
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Since the introduction around 1960 of external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) basic life support (BLS) without equipment, i.e. steps A (airway control)-B (mouth-to-mouth breathing)-C (chest (cardiac) compressions), training courses by instructors have been provided, first to medical personnel and later to some but not all lay persons. At present, fewer than 30% of out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts are initiated by lay bystanders. The numbers of lives saved have remained suboptimal, in part because of a weak or absent first link in the life support chain. This review concerns education research aimed at helping more lay persons to acquire high life supporting first aid (LSFA) skill levels and to use these skills. In the 1960s, Safar and Laerdal studied and promoted self-training in LSFA, which includes: call for the ambulance (without abandoning the patient) (now also call for an automatic external defibrillator); CPR-BLS steps A-B-C; external hemorrhage control; and positioning for shock and unconsciousness (coma). LSFA steps are psychomotor skills. Organizations like the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association have produced instructor-courses of many more first aid skills, or for cardiac arrest only-not of LSFA skills needed by all suddenly comatose victims. Self-training methods might help all people acquire LSFA skills. Implementation is still lacking. Variable proportions of lay trainees evaluated, ranging from school children to elderly persons, were found capable of performing LSFA skills on manikins. Audio-tape or video-tape coached self-practice on manikins was more effective than instructor-courses. Mere viewing of demonstrations (e.g. televised films) without practice has enabled more persons to perform some skills effectively compared to untrained control groups. The quality of LSFA. performance in the field and its impact on outcome of patients remain to be evaluated. Psychological factors have been associated with skill acquisition and retention, and motivational factors with application. Manikin practice proved necessary far best skill acquisition of steps B and C. Simplicity and repetition proved important. Repetitive television spots and brief internet movies for motivating and demonstrating would reach all people. LSFA should be part of basic health education. LSFA self-learning laboratories should be set up and maintained in schools and drivers' license stations. The trauma-focused steps of LSFA are important for 'buddy help' in military combat casualty care, and natural mass disasters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Outcomes in Early Versus Delayed Management of Pediatric Femoral Shaft Fractures
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS
AB  - Objective: There is a paucity of literature regarding the timing of treatment for pediatric femur fractures. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether early versus delayed management of pediatric femoral shaft fractures would impact outcomes regarding time to union and return to baseline function. Methods: Pediatric patients presenting with femoral shaft fractures, from January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2021, were identified using the Pediatric Trauma Database at a single Level One Trauma Center and retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, surgical details, associated injuries, length of follow-up, time to union, and return to baseline function were collected. Patients were then divided into 2 groups; the early intervention group underwent treatment within 24 hours of admission versus the delayed group, which underwent treatment after 24 hours. Patients with neuromuscular disease, pathologic fracture, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, nonambulatory, younger than 6 months old, or had follow-up of <8 weeks posttreatment were excluded. chi(2) and unpaired Student t tests were used to compare outcomes. A P value <= 0.05 was used as the threshold of statistical significance. Results: Of the 169 cases reviewed, 137 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 8.0 +/- 5.0 (6 mo to 16 y). The average follow-up time was 1.4 +/- 1.4 years. Thirty-two (19%) patients did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the study. One hundred twenty-two (89%) patients were in the early intervention group versus 15 (11%) in the delayed intervention group. There were no statistically significant differences between the early and the delayed arms in regard to time to union, quality of final reduction, and return to baseline function. Conclusion: The findings of this study support that the timing of surgical intervention of femoral shaft fractures in the pediatric population is not correlated to time to union and final function. Clinically, prompt treatment of pediatric femoral shaft fractures should not supersede medical methods of resuscitation and likely has no bearing on the final outcome.

TI  - The Impella CP device for acute mechanical circulatory support in refractory cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: Mechanical circulatory support may be considered as a therapeutic option in selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest (rCA). Animal studies suggest a potential role for the Impella left ventricular assist device in this setting, but so far no human data have been published.
   Methods: Eight patients with rCA were treated with the Impella CP device at our institution from November 2014 to October 2015. The Impella CP was used at the discretion of the treating physicians in patients with rCA and pulseless electrical activity with presumed primary left ventricular failure. These patients were compared to 12 patients with cardiogenic shock also treated with the Impella device during the same period.
   Results: All cardiac arrests were witnessed with a no-flow time of 0 min, six in-hospital and two out-of hospital. Low-flow time was 50 +/- 52 min (SD). The Impella device was successfully inserted in all patients with rCA and circulation was re-established. Survival rate to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome was similar among patients with rCA and cardiogenic shock treated with the Impella device (50% vs. 58%). Major vascular complications after Impella insertion occurred more frequently among patients with rCA compared to patients with cardiogenic shock (50% vs. 0%, P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Mechanical support with the Impella CP device is a feasible and promising treatment option for selected patients with rCA. Further studies are warranted to determine the full potential and optimal patient selection compared to other modalities of mechanical circulatory support. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Development of a prediction model for emergency medical service witnessed traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A multicenter cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FORMOSAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background/Purpose: To develop a prediction model for emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to identify trauma patients at high risk of deterioration to emergency medical service (EMS) -witnessed traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) on the scene or en route. Methods: We developed a prediction model using the classical cross -validation method from the Pan -Asia Trauma Outcomes Study (PATOS) database from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020. Eligible patients aged >18 years were transported to the hospital by the EMS. The primary outcome (EMS -witnessed TCA) was defined based on changes in vital signs measured on the scene or en route. We included variables that were immediately measurable as potential predictors when EMTs arrived. An integer point value system was built using multivariable logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test were used to examine discrimination and calibration in the derivation and validation cohorts. Results: In total, 74,844 patients were eligible for database review. The model comprised five prehospital predictors: age <40 years, systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg, respiration rate >20/minute, pulse oximetry <94%, and levels of consciousness to pain or unresponsiveness. The AUROC in the derivation and validation cohorts was 0.767 and 0.782, respectively. The HL test revealed good calibration of the model (p Z 0.906). Conclusion: We established a prediction model using variables from the PATOS database and measured them immediately after EMS personnel arrived to predict EMS -witnessed TCA. The model allows prehospital medical personnel to focus on high -risk patients and promptly administer optimal treatment. Copyright (c) 2023, Formosan Medical Association.

TI  - A Short Intervention and an Interactive e-Learning Module to Motivate Medical and Dental Students to Enlist as First Responders: Implementation Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Prompt and proficient basic life support (BLS) maneuvers are essential to increasing the odds of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, significant time can elapse before the arrival of professional rescuers. To decrease these delays, many countries have developed first responder networks. These networks are composed of BLS-certified lay or professional rescuers who can be dispatched by emergency medical communication centers to take care of those who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Many systems are, however, limited by a relatively low number of active first responders, and first-year medical and dental students may represent an almost untapped pool of potential rescuers. On top of providing an enhanced BLS coverage to the population, this could also help medical students be better prepared to their future role as certified health care providers and address societal expectations regarding health care students.
   Objective: Our objective was to describe the impact of a short motivational intervention followed by a blended BLS course (e-learning and practice session) designed to motivate first-year medical and dental students to enlist as first responders.
   Methods: A short, web-based, motivational intervention presenting this project took place, and first-year University of Geneva, Faculty of Medicine students were provided with a link to the study platform. Those who agreed to participate were redirected to a demographic questionnaire before registering on the platform. The participants were then asked to answer a second questionnaire designed to determine their baseline knowledge prior to following an interactive e-learning module. Upon completion, a web-based booking form enabling them to register for a 1-hour practice session was displayed. These sessions were held by senior medical students who had been trained and certified as BLS instructors. The participants who attended these practice sessions were asked to answer a postcourse questionnaire before receiving the certificate enabling them to register as first responders.
   Results: Out of the 529 first-year students registered at University of Geneva, Faculty of Medicine on January 14, 2021, 190 (35.9%) initially agreed to participate. Moreover, 102 (19.3%) attended the practice sessions, and 48 (9.1%) had completed all training and enlisted as first responders on the dedicated platform, Save a Life, at 6 months (July 14, 2021). Postcourse confidence in resuscitation skills was associated with a higher likelihood of registering as first responder (P=.03). No association was found between prior BLS knowledge and the probability of registering to a practice session (P=.59), of obtaining a course completion certificate (P=.29), or of enlisting as first responder (P=.56).
   Conclusions: This study shows that a motivational intervention associated with a short BLS course can convince medical students to enlist as first responders. Further studies are needed to understand the rather low proportion of medical students finally registering as first responders.

TI  - A National Survey on Interhospital Transport of Children in Cardiac Arrest
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To describe the U.S. experience with interhospital transport of children in cardiac arrest undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Design: Self-administered electronic survey.
   Setting: Pediatric transport teams listed with the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Transport Medicine.
   Subjects: Leaders of U.S. pediatric transport teams.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Sixty of the 88 teams surveyed (68%) responded. Nineteen teams (32%) from 13 states transport children undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation between hospitals. The most common reasons for transfer of children in cardiac arrest are higher level-of-care (70%), extracorporeal life support (60%), and advanced trauma resuscitation (35%). Eligibility is typically decided on a case-by-case basis (85%) and sometimes involves a short interhospital distance (35%), or prompt institution of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (20%). Of the 19 teams that transport with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 42% report no special staff safety features, 42% have guidelines or protocols, 37% train staff on resuscitation during transport, 11% brace with another provider, and 5% use mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for patients less than 18 years. In the past 5 years, 18 teams report having done such cardiopulmonary resuscitation transports: 22% did greater than five transports, 44% did two to five transports, 6% did one transport, and the remaining 28% did not recall the number of transports. Seventy-eight percent recall having transported by ambulance, 44% by helicopter, and 22% by fixed-wing. Although patient outcomes were varied, eight teams (44%) reported survivors to ICU and/or hospital discharge.
   Conclusions: A minority of U.S. teams perform interhospital transport of children in cardiac arrest undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eligibility criteria, transport logistics, and patient outcomes are heterogeneous. Importantly, there is a paucity of established safety protocols for the staff performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation in transport.

TI  - Intracerebroventricular application of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after cardiac arrest does not promote beneficial effects on cerebral recovery after cardiac arrest in rats
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Subject. Recent data demonstrated potent neuroprotective effects of growth hormones such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after focal cerebral ischaemia. In order to assess possible effects of intracerebroventricular application of G-CSF on cerebral recovery after cardiac arrest (CA) in rats, neurological testing and histological analyses were performed.
   Interventions: After 6 min of electrically induced CA, rats were resuscitated (CPR) and divided into two groups (G-CSF vs. placebo) with two different reperfusion times (7 and 14 days). G-CSF (3.84 mu g) or placebo was applied 30 min after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). At 24 h, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days, behavioural neurological testing was done (tape removal test, TRT). Neuronal degeneration of the hippocampal CA-1 sector was analyzed by TUNEL- and Nissl-staining.
   Results: Before CA all animals passed the TRT (G-CSF 7 [4-12] s, placebo 9 [6-10] s). After ROSC both groups showed a clear neurological deficit (24 h: G-CSF and placebo 180 [180-180] s), that improved with ongoing reperfusion times, without reaching baseline values (14 days: G-CSF 25 [21-59] s, placebo 34 [14-175] s). Survival rates did not differ between the groups. All animals showed massive neurodegeneration histologically without any differences between the groups 7 days after CA (TUNEL-positive: G-CSF 63.2 [53.8-72.1], placebo 72.6 [66.6-82.7]; Nissl-positive: G-CSF 2.5 [1.8-3.4], placebo 2.8 [2.0-5.1]). At 14 days, TUNEL-staining revealed no differences (G-CSF 45.2 135.0-60.0], placebo 56.0 [37.6-63.4]), while G-CSF treatment led to fewer Nissl-positive neurons (G-CSF 1.5 [1.2-2.2], placebo 3.1 [2.1-4.2]; p = 0.011).
   Conclusions: Despite promising experimental data concerning focal cerebral ischaemia, in this model of 6 min of normothermic CA no beneficial effects of G-CSF application could be demonstrated by behavioural testing and histological analyses of the hippocampal CA-I sector.

TI  - Good quality of life many years after successful resuscitation
T2  - NOTARZT
AB  - The medical care system invests a lot of energy in improving survival after cardiac arrest. As the number of survivors increases, the quality of life of patients is becoming increasingly important. Many studies usually focus on quality of life up to one year after the event.

TI  - Interventions to reduce cognitive impairments following critical illness: a topical systematic review
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background: Critical illness is associated with cognitive impairments. Effective treatment or prevention has not been established. The aim of this review was to create a systematic summary of the current evidence concerning clinical interventions during intensive care admission to reduce cognitive impairments after discharge.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycInfo and Cinahl were searched. Inclusion criteria were studies assessing the effect of interventions during intensive care admission on cognitive function in adult patients. Studies were excluded if they were reviews or reported solely on survivors of cardiac arrest, stroke or traumatic brain injury.
   Results: Of 4877 records were identified. Seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The interventions described covered strategies for enteral nutrition, fluids, sedation, weaning, mobilization, cognitive activities, statins and sleep quality improvement. Data were synthesized to provide an overview of interventions, quality, follow-up assessments and neuropsychological outcomes.
   Conclusion: None of the interventions had significant positive effects on cognitive impairments following critical illness. Quality was negatively affected by study limitations, imprecision and indirectness in evidence. Clinical research on cognition is feasible, but large, well designed trials with a specific aim at reducing cognitive impairments are needed.

TI  - Cerebral resuscitation potentials for cardiac arrest
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - Wolf Creek VI Conference
AB  - Permanent brain damage after cardiac arrest and resuscitation is determined by many factors, predominantly arrest (no-flow) time, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (low-flow) brine, and temperature. Research since around 1970 into cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitaton has attempted to mitigate the postischemic-anoxic encephalopathy. These efforts' results have recently shown outcome benefits as documented in clinically relevant outcome models in dogs and in clinical trials. Pharmacologic strategies have so far yielded relatively disappointing results. In a recent exploration of 14 drugs in dogs, only the antioxidant tempol administered at the start of prolonged cardiac arrest improved functional outcome in dogs. Cerebral blood flow promotion by hypertensive reperfusion and hemodilution has resulted in improved outcome in dogs, and brief hypertension after restoration of spontaneous circulation is associated with improved outcome in patients. Postarrest hypercoagulability of blood seems to yield to therapeutic thrombolysis, which is associated with improved cerebral outcome in animals and patients. In a clinically relevant dog outcome model, mild postarrest cerebral hypothermia (34degreesC), initiated with reperfusion and continued for 12 hrs, combined with cerebral blood-flow promotion increased from 5 to >10 mins the previously longest normothermic no-flow time that could be reversed to complete cerebral recovery. Mild hypothermla by surface cooling after prolonged cardiac arrest in patients has been found effective in recent clinical studies in Australia and Europe. Preliminary data on the recent randomized study in Europe have been reported. For presently unresuscitable cardiac arrests, research since the 1980s in dog outcome models of prolonged exsanguination cardiac arrest has culminated in brain and organism preservation during cardiac arrest (no-flow) durations of up to 90 mins, perhaps 120 mins, at a tympanic temperature of 10degreesC and complete recovery of function and normal histology, This "suspended animation for delayed resuscitation" strategy includes use of an aortic flush of cold saline (or preservation solution) within the first 5 mins of no flow. This strategy should also be explored for the larger number of patients with unresuscitable out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Suspended animation for prolonged preservation of viability could buy time for transport and repair during hypothermic no flow followed by resuscitation, or it could serve as a bridge to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass.

TI  - CORM-3 alleviates the intestinal injury in a rodent model of hemorrhage shock and resuscitation: roles of GFAP-positive glia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR HISTOLOGY
AB  - Hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR) can induce severe intestinal damages, thereby leading to sepsis and long-term complications including dysbacteriosis and pulmonary injury. The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome facilitates inflammation-associated cell recruitment in the gastrointestinal tract, and participates in many inflammatory bowel diseases. Previous studies have shown that exogenous carbon monoxide (CO) exerts neuroprotective effects against pyroptosis after HSR. We aimed to investigate whether carbon monoxide-releasing molecules-3 (CORM-3), an exogenous CO compound, could attenuate HSR-induced intestinal injury and the potential underlying mechanism.Rats were subjected to a HSR model by bleeding and re-infusion. Following resuscitation, 4 mg/kg of CORM-3 was administered intravenously into femoral vein. At 24 h and 7 d after HSR modeling, the pathological changes in intestinal tissues were evaluated by H&E staining. The intestinal pyroptosis, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial pyroptosis, DAO (diamine oxidase) content, intestine tight junction proteins including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-1 were further detected by immunofluorescence, western blot and chemical assays at 7 d after HSR. CORM-3 administration led to significantly mitigated HSR-induced intestinal injury, aggravation of intestinal pyroptosis indicated by cleaved caspase-1, IL-1 beta and IL-18, upregulation of GFAP-positive glial pyroptosis, decreased intensity of ZO-1 and claudin-1 in the jejunum, and increased of DAO in the serum. Nigericin, an agonist of NLRP3, significantly reversed the protective effects of CORM-3. CORM-3 alleviates the intestinal barrier dysfunction in a rodent model of HSR, and the potential mechanism may be associated with inhibition of NLRP3-associated pyroptosis. CORM-3 administration could be a promising therapeutic strategy for intestinal injury after hemorrhagic shock.

TI  - Hip Fracture in the Elderly Patients: A Sentinel Event
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Importance: Hip fracture in the elderly patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is great need for advance care planning should a patient fail to rehabilitate or experience an adverse event during or after recovery. This study was performed to evaluate for palliative care consultation and changes in code status and/or advance directives in elderly patients with hip fracture.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 186 consecutive patients aged 65 years and older with a hip fracture due to a low-energy fall who underwent surgery at a large academic institution between August 1, 2013, and September 1, 2014. Risk factors assessed were patient demographics, home status, mobility, code status, comorbidities, medications, and hospitalizations prior to injury. Outcomes of interest included palliative care consultation, complications, mortality, and most recent code status, mobility, and home.
   Results: About 186 patients with hip fractures were included. Three patients died, and 12 (6.5%) sustained major complications during admission. Nearly one-third (51 patients) died upon final follow-up approximately 1.5 years after surgery. Of the patients who died, palliative care consulted on 6 (11.8%) during initial admission. Eleven (21.6%) were full code at death. Three patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 1 underwent massive transfusion and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prior to changing their code status to do not attempt resuscitation.
   Conclusion: Hip fracture in elderly patients is an important opportunity to reassess the patient's personal health-care priorities. Advance directives, goals of care, and code status documentation should be updated in all elderly patients with hip fracture, should the patient's health decompensate.

TI  - Investigating the differences in nutritional status between successfully weaned and unsuccessfully weaned respirator patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Long-term respirator users admitted to intensive care units need to be transferred to a respiratory care center (RCC) for weaning. It may cause malnutrition in critical care patients, which may manifest as a reduction in respiratory muscle mass, lower ventilatory capacity, and decreased respiratory tolerance. This study aimed to assess that if the patients' nutritional status were improved, it could help RCC patients to wean from respirators. All participants were recruited from the RCC of a medical foundation in the city and Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital. The indicators include serum albumin level, respirator detachment index, maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax), rapid shallow breathing index, and body composition measurements. We recorded the length of hospital stay, mortality, and RCW (respiratory care ward) referral rate for these participants and analyzed the differences in relevant research indicators between those who were and weren't weaned off. 43 of 62 patients were weaned from respirators, while 19 failed. The resuscitation rate was 54.8%. Patients with respirator weaning had a lower number of RCC admission days (23.1 +/- 11.1 days) than respirator-dependent patients (35.6 +/- 7.8 days, P < 0.05). The PImax of successfully weaned patients had a greater reduction (- 27.09 +/- 9.7 cmH(2)O) than unsuccessful ones (- 21.4 +/- 10.2 cmH(2)O, P < 0.05). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of successfully weaned patients (15.8 +/- 5.0) were lower than those who were not (20.4 +/- 8.4, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in serum albumin levels between the two groups. In the successfully weaned patients, the serum albumin concentration was increased from 2.2 +/- 0.3 to 2.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dL, P < 0.05. Improved nutritional status can help RCC patients to wean from respirators.

T2  - TUBERCULOSIS
AB  - Diagnosis of TB at early stages of HIV infection may lead to timely intervention for improving patient outcome. Antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis recombinant RpfB protein and two immunodominant peptides of Rpf B protein were evaluated in the sera of HIV +TB+, HIV+ and HIV- pulmonary TB patients by ELISA. Serum antibodies from 90 % and 65 % of HIV+TB+ patients reacted to recombinant RpfB protein and synthetic peptide RpfP1 respectively. Overall, this study shows that resuscitation promoting factor B elicits humoral antibody response in HIV+TB+ co-infected individuals and be proposed as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of HIV+TB+ patients, however further longitudinal follow up studies are warranted.

A series of effective, low-cost interventions, based on appropriate technologies can be used to address the main causes of neonatal deaths. Among these interventions, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and thermal control of the newborn infant are very effective ones.

TI  - Mindset Moderates Healthcare Providers' Longitudinal Performance in a Digital Neonatal Resuscitation Simulator
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: Simulation education can benefit healthcare providers (HCPs) by providing opportunities to practice complex neonatal-resuscitation tasks in low-stake environments. To our knowledge, no study investigated the role of growth mindset on longitudinal performance on neonatal resuscitation before and after simulation-based training.
   Objectives: This study examines whether 1) the RETAIN digital/table-top simulators facilitate HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge gain, retention, and transfer and 2) growth mindset moderates HCPs' longitudinal performance in neonatal resuscitation.
   Methods: Participants were n = 50 HCPs in a tertiary perinatal center in Edmonton, Canada. This longitudinal study was conducted in three stages including 1) a pretest and a mindset survey, immediately followed by a posttest using the RETAIN digital simulator from April to August 2019; 2) a 2-month delayed posttest using the same RETAIN neonatal resuscitation digital simulator from June to October 2019; and 3) a 5-month delayed posttest using the low-fidelity table-top neonatal resuscitation digital simulator from September 2019 to January 2020. Three General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) repeated-measure analyses investigated HCPs' performance on neonatal resuscitation over time and the moderating effect of growth mindset on the association between test time points and task performance.
   Results: Compared with their pretest performance, HCPs effectively improved their neonatal resuscitation knowledge after the RETAIN digital simulation-based training on the immediate posttest (Est = 1.88, p < 0.05), retained their knowledge on the 2-month delayed posttest (Est = 1.36, p < 0.05), and transferred their knowledge to the table-top simulator after 5 months (Est = 2.01, p < 0.05). Although growth mindset did not moderate the performance gain from the pretest to the immediate posttest, it moderated the relationship between HCPs' pretest and long-term knowledge retention (i.e., the interaction effect of mindset and the 2-month posttest was significant: Est = 0.97, p < 0.05). The more they endorsed a growth mindset, the better the HCPs performed on the posttest, but only when they were tested after 2 months.
   Conclusions: Digital simulators for neonatal resuscitation training can effectively facilitate HCPs' knowledge gain, maintenance, and transfer. Besides, growth mindset shows a positive moderating effect on the longitudinal performance improvement in simulation-based training. Future research can be conducted to implement growth-mindset interventions promoting more effective delivery of technology-enhanced, simulation-based training and assessment.

TI  - Gastric adenocarcinoma complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess: A case report
T2  - CLINICAL CASE REPORTS
AB  - Perforated gastric adenocarcinoma is a rare and challenging complication of gastric cancer, which can lead to intra-abdominal abscesses and other complications. Management of perforated gastric adenocarcinoma with an intra-abdominal abscess requires a multidisciplinary approach, including empiric antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation, partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, and image-guided drainage. This case report highlights the complex and challenging nature of managing perforated gastric adenocarcinoma with intra-abdominal abscesses. Prompt recognition and timely intervention are essential for favorable outcomes. Postoperative care and close follow-up are also important.

TI  - Influence of bystander activation on pre-hospital emergency care response time: systematic review
T2  - EMERGENCY CARE JOURNAL
AB  - This article presents a systematic review and analysis of grey literature to identify and address gaps in knowledge regarding the role and influence of bystander activation on pre-hospital emergency care (PEC) response time. We conducted a systematic search for full-text articles published since 2000 in Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, using "pre-hospital emergency care response time" and "bystanders" as search keywords. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Our analysis included forty-six relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria. However, we observed that many studies were poorly reported, posing risks of selection and detection biases. Additionally, we identified methodological and study design weaknesses in five studies. Given the critical role of PEC services in saving lives and preventing medical complications, the timely provision of these services is paramount. Bystanders play a central role in activating emergency medical services (EMS) and providing cardiopul-monary resuscitation. Prompt calls to EMS by bystanders resulted in reduced PEC response times, improved survival chances, and better neurological outcomes, particularly among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. There is substantial evidence that prompt bystander activation of EMS significantly reduces PEC response times, thereby saving lives and strengthening existing PEC systems. However, further research is necessary to accurately assess the impact of different interventions aimed at enhancing bystander activation of EMS and reducing PEC response times.

TI  - Myocardial effects of sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation
T2  - MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND PRECONDITIONING
CP  - 17th World Heart Congress
AB  - Multiple mechanisms of cell injury are unleashed during the global myocardial ischemia of cardiac arrest, and are in part responsible for the development of myocardial abnormalities that can compromise efforts to restore cardiac activity. Among these mechanisms, activation of the sarcolemmal sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) with subsequent intramyocardial sodium overload has been identified as a prominent mechanism of cell injury. Using isolated heart and intact animal models of ventricular fibrillation, our group has identified various beneficial myocardial effects associated with selective NHE-1 inhibition. During ventricular fibrillation, NHE-1 inhibition attenuates the development of ischemic contracture and preserves the hemodynamic efficacy of chest compression. Immediately after restoration of cardiac activity, NHE-1 inhibition markedly reduces reper-fusion arrhythmias and prevents episodes of recurrent ventricular fibrillation. During the post-resuscitation phase, NHE-1 inhibition ameliorates the severity of myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction and favors hemodynamic stability and improved survival. These studies suggest that NHE-1 inhibition may represent a highly effective new form of treatment for resuscitation from cardiac arrest.

TI  - A Narrative Literature Review and Case Study Highlighting Errors in Automatic External Defibrillator Use at a Community Event
T2  - CRITICAL CARE NURSING QUARTERLY
AB  - Early basic life support and defibrillation using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are key for improving survival in those suffering an out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest. To improve survival, access to AEDs by lay responders is growing, and use is included in basic cardiac life support training. These devices are considered extremely safe, evidenced by the paucity of medical literature on AED misuse and expert opinion. However, it's crucial to point out that even medical personnel can make errors in their use. This case study of AED misuse during a community event and narrative literature review underscores the potential for errors in using an AED, which could cause considerable patient harm. To prevent errors in AED use, it is important to train on (1) equipment in use or likely to be encountered in the field, (2) how to dump an electric charge, especially when using a fully automated machine, (3) the need to follow specific machine instructions, (4) proper application of the defibrillator pads (including one-piece pads with metronome), (5) the need to assess the patient and not rely entirely on the AED prompts, which can contain false alerts and inappropriate instruction, and (6) the need for closed-loop communication, even when participating in a community event.

TI  - Predicting intrapartum fetal compromise at term using the cerebroplacental ratio and placental growth factor levels (PROMISE) study: randomised controlled trial protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Intrapartum complications are a major contributor to adverse perinatal outcomes, including stillbirth, hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury and subsequent longer term disability. In many cases, hypoxia develops as a gradual process due to the inability of the fetus to tolerate the stress of parturition suggesting reduced fetoplacental reserve before labour commences. The fetal cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) is an independent predictor of intrapartum fetal compromise, poor acid base status at birth and of neonatal unit admission at term. Similarly, circulating maternal levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) are lower in pregnancies complicated by placental dysfunction. This paper outlines the protocol for the PROMISE Study, which aims to determine if the introduction of a prelabour screening test for intrapartum fetal compromise combining the CPR and maternal PlGF level results in a reduction of adverse perinatal outcomes.
   Methods and analysis This is a single-site, non-blinded, individual patient randomised controlled trial of a screening test performed at term, combining the fetal CPR and maternal serum PlGF. Women with a singleton, non-anomalous pregnancy will be recruited after 34 weeks' gestation and randomised to either receive the screening test or not. Screened pregnancies determined to be at risk will be recommended induction of labour. Demographic, obstetric history and antenatal data will be collected at enrolment, and perinatal outcomes will be recorded after delivery. Relative risks and 95% CIs will be reported for the primary outcome. Regression techniques will be used to examine the influence of prognostic factors on the primary and secondary outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and approved by the Mater Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference: HREC EC00332) and will follow the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The study results will be disseminated at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - Differing operational outcomes with six commercially available automated external defibrillators
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Introduction: In general automated external defibrillators (AED) are handled easily, but some untrained lay rescuers may have major problems with the use of such products. This may result in delayed shock delivery and delay in basic life support (BLS) after use of the AED. To study the effect of voice prompts and design solutions we tested the time from the first shock to the initiation of BLS for six defibrillators available in Austria. Methods: Volunteers, who had no AED training, were evaluated to see when they delivered the first shock and how often BLS was started after the voice prompts were given by the defibrillators. Results: Time to first shock delivered ranged from 78 (95% CI: 68-89) to 128 (95% CI: 110-146) s. The defibrillator-type had a significant influence on the time to first shock delivered (P < 0.0001). The proportion of volunteers who started BLS after defibrillation ranged from 93 to 33% and differed significantly between the AEDs used (P < 0.03). Conclusions: We demonstrated that there are significant differences between AEDs, concerning important operational outcomes like time to first shock and the start of BLS. Further research and development is urgently required to optimise user-friendliness and operational outcomes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ablation Versus Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure Results From the CABANA Trial
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF), several clinical trials have reported improved outcomes, including freedom from AF recurrence, quality of life, and survival, with catheter ablation. This article describes the treatment-related outcomes of the AF patients with heart failure enrolled in the CABANA trial (Catheter Ablation Versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation).
   METHODS: The CABANA trial randomized 2204 patients with AF who were >= 65 years old or <65 years old with >= 1 risk factor for stroke at 126 sites to ablation with pulmonary vein isolation or drug therapy including rate or rhythm control drugs. Of these, 778 (35%) had New York Heart Association class >II at baseline and form the subject of this article. The CABANA trial's primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest.
   RESULTS: Of the 778 patients with heart failure enrolled in CABANA, 378 were assigned to ablation and 400 to drug therapy. Ejection fraction at baseline was available for 571 patients (73.0%), and 9.3% of these had an ejection fraction <40%, whereas 11.7% had ejection fractions between 40% and 50%. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the ablation arm had a 36% relative reduction in the primary composite end point (hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.41-0.99]) and a 43% relative reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33-0.96]) compared with drug therapy alone over a median follow-up of 48.5 months. AF recurrence was decreased with ablation (hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.42-0.74]). The adjusted mean difference for the AFEQT (Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life) summary score averaged over the entire 60-month follow-up was 5.0 points, favoring the ablation arm (95% CI, 2.5-7.4 points), and the MAFSI (Mayo Atrial Fibrillation-Specific Symptom Inventory) frequency score difference was -2.0 points, favoring ablation (95% CI, -2.9 to -1.2).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF enrolled in the CABANA trial who had clinically diagnosed stable heart failure at trial entry, catheter ablation produced clinically important improvements in survival, freedom from AF recurrence, and quality of life relative to drug therapy. These results, obtained in a cohort most of whom had preserved left ventricular function, require independent trial verification.

TI  - Is there any room for shortening hands-off time further when using an AED?
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) play a very important role in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The mandatory hands-off time imposed by current AEDs is not short enough to bring about the full benefits of rapid defibrillation with an AED into light. The aim of this study is to examine whether a change in the process of charging the capacity and removing explanations from the prompts of the AEDs shortens hands-off time.
   Methods: The operating steps and the voice prompts of the current AEDs were reviewed and the time intervals between the steps and the voice prompts were measured. We modified an AED to fully precharge the capacitor and to contain more concise voice prompts.
   Results: We had 42 expert rescuers and 50 lay-person rescuers perform 2-rescuer CPR with the modified AED and the old AED, respectively. Using the modified AED significantly reduced hands-off times by 9.95 s (95% CI: 9.67-10.23) in 2-rescuer CPR and by 10.68 s (95% CI: 9.75-11.61) in 1-rescuer CPR (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Full precharging of the capacitor and exclusion of explanations from the voice prompts of AEDs can shorten the hands-off time in both I and 2-rescuer CPR. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cognitive screening and rehabilitation after cardiac arrest: only a few hurdles to take
T2  - NETHERLANDS HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Dutch and European guidelines recommend systematic screening for cognitive and emotional impairments in cardiac arrest survivors. We aimed to clarify opinions on cognitive screening and rehabilitation, identify barriers and facilitators for implementation in the Netherlands, and arrive at recommendations in this field. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders using the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases checklist. There is broad-based acknowledgement of the relevance of cognitive impairment and a positive attitude regarding early cognitive screening among health professionals and patients. Barriers to implementation include a lack of practical recommendations on how, where and when to screen, insufficient knowledge of cognitive consequences of cardiac arrest, insufficient collaboration and knowledge sharing among different specialties within hospitals, insufficient resources, and insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of screening and therapy to justify financial compensation. Most of the identified barriers to implementation are solvable: national guidelines need practical recommendations and knowledge gaps among healthcare workers can be bridged by in-hospital collaboration. Fulfilling these requirements should be sufficient for the implementation of simple screening and tailored advice. More extensive cognitive rehabilitation therapy needs stronger evidence of efficacy in order to warrant stronger guideline recommendations and financial reimbursement.

TI  - SPONTANEOUS CORONARY-ARTERY DISSECTION - A REPORT OF 3 CASES AND REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - We describe the clinical course of three patients who developed spontaneous coronary artery dissection. All patients were young women, one 9 weeks pregnant. All presented with chest pain; one died suddenly proving refractory to resuscitation, another developed unstable angina culminating in myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock and death, and the third patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting following diagnosis of a spontaneous coronary dissection of the left anterior descending artery at angiography. Pathological findings in the two fatal cases are reported.
   This condition, although rare, is a prominent cause of ischaemic coronary events in young women, when it is frequently associated with pregnancy or the puerperium. Most patients die suddenly, but a clinical spectrum is seen including stable and unstable angina, myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. The left anterior descending artery is most frequently affected. The classical histological finding is that of a large haematoma occupying the outer third of the media resulting in complete compression of the true lumen.
   The cause of spontaneous dissection remains unclear but theories of aetiology include a medial eosinophilic angiitis, pregnancy-induced degeneration of collagen in conjunction with the stresses of parturition, and rupture of the vasa vasorum.
   The diagnosis must be considered when a patient presents with a suggestive clinical profile. Urgent angiography should be undertaken to establish the diagnosis and consideration given to the need for coronary artery bypass grafting, which has been successfully employed in a number of patients. The uneventful long-term survival of cases treated conservatively has been reported.

TI  - Dynamics of the T cell response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosR and Rpf antigens in a Colombian population of household contacts of recently diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients
T2  - TUBERCULOSIS
AB  - Immune response to DosR and Rpf antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) seems to be important for latency maintenance. Little is known about the dynamics of the immune response to these antigens in an endemic community. Thus, the IFN gamma response and cytokine production in response to PPD, Esat6-Cfp10 (E6-C10), DosR and Rpf antigens in healthy HHC of tuberculosis (TB) patients over a 12 (T-12) months period (short-term, stLTBI) was investigated. This response was compared with a group of LTBI, who have remained healthy for 5-7 years (long-term, ItLTBI). According to the IFN gamma response, two groups of HHCs were identified in stLTBI in response to E6-C10. At T-12, E6-C10(+) HHCs displayed a decrease in the IFN gamma levels and a generalized decrease in cytokines production. The E6-C10(-) HHC showed an increase in the IFN gamma response and cytokine levels. In stLTBI, the responses to E6-C10, DosR, and Rpf may be interpreted as a protective immune response controlling Mtb infection and may be leading to a state of latent infection. Comparing the response of stLTBI and ItLTBI, we observed significant changes in the proportions of CD45RO(+)CD27(+) T cells to specific DosR and Rpf, which may indicate a persistent immune response to Mtb antigens in ItLTBI.

TI  - Neurologic prognosis and withdrawal of life support after resuscitation from cardiac arrest
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Objective: To study the impact of neurologic prognostication on the decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies (LST) in comatose patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest. Methods: The authors prospectively studied a consecutive series of post-resuscitation comatose patients referred for neurologic prognostication at a single center for 4 years. For most patients, neurologic prognostication was not sought due to early death or rapid return to consciousness. Prognostication was based on Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and Brainstem Reflex Score (BRS), with EEG and cortical evoked potentials (CEP), which were graded as benign, uncertain, and malignant. The outcomes were as follows: survivors (Group S), brain or cardiac death (Group D), and death from withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (Group W). In Group W, the time interval to withdrawal of LST was analyzed by EEG and CEP grades. Results: Of 58 patients studied, 10 were in Group S, 8 in Group D, and 40 in Group W. Initial median GCS and BRS was similar for all groups with significant improvement noted in Group S, but not in Group D or Group W. In Group W, CEP grade correlated with the median duration of continued therapy before a decision to withdraw LST: 7 days for benign CEP, 2 days for uncertain CEP, and 1 day for malignant CEP, p = 0.0004. Conclusion: In patients with poor neurologic recovery early after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, physicians appear to use the cortical evoked potential grade to estimate prognosis. Cortical evoked potential grade correlated with the waiting time until life sustaining therapies were withdrawn after no improvement in neurologic examination was seen.

TI  - 'Stand still ... , and move on', an early neurologically-focused follow-up for cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers: a process evaluation
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: A cardiac arrest can lead to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury which can result in cognitive and emotional impairments and may negatively affect daily functioning, participation in society and quality of life. Furthermore, the impact on the family of the patient can be high. We designed an intervention called 'Stand still ... , and move on', which is a concise, individualised, semi-structured intervention for survivors of cardiac arrest and their caregivers, consisting of between one and six face-to-face consultations provided by a trained nurse. The intervention is directed at early detection of cognitive and emotional problems, provision of information, promotion of self-management and referral to specialised care if necessary. The effectiveness of the intervention is being examined in a randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN74835019]. Alongside this trial we performed a process evaluation which aims to investigate the feasibility of the intervention by assessing: 1) the attendance and dose delivered; 2) performance according to protocol; and 3) the opinion of patients, caregivers and nurses on the intervention.
   Methods: Participants of this process evaluation were 97 patients allocated to the intervention group of the RCT, their 91 caregivers, and six nurses who conducted the intervention. Measurement instruments used were evaluation forms for patients and caregivers, registration and evaluation forms for nurses, and semi-structured interviews with nurses.
   Results: Seventy-nine of the patients (81%) allocated to the intervention group and 65 caregivers (71%) participated in the intervention. The mean (SD) number of consultations per patient was 1.8 (1.0), and most consultations were conducted at the patients' home. The intervention was performed largely according to protocol, except that the intervention usually started later than intended, consultations were longer than expected, and the topic of self-management was not regularly addressed. Patients marked the quality of the intervention with a mean score of 7.5 and the performance of the nurse with an 8.0 out of ten. Overall, the intervention was positively evaluated by patients, caregivers and nurses.
   Conclusions: The intervention 'Stand still ... , and move on' is a promising intervention which was performed largely according to protocol and seems feasible for implementation after some adaptations, if it is found to be effective.

TI  - Electrographic Seizures in the Critically Ill
T2  - NEUROLOGIC CLINICS
AB  - A clinician's goal in treating a critically ill patient is to orchestrate a meaningful and fast recovery with minimal long-term sequelae, thereby improving their quality of life at best or preventing deterioration at worst. The path to achieving this goal becomes increasingly complex and foggy when seizures and IIC patterns are present. The first step is identifying patients at risk for seizures and determining the timing and duration of EEG monitoring. 2HELPS2B or other risk stratification schemes may help, but the ultimate goal should be overcoming the logistical and technical barriers that prevent near-uniform EEG monitoring during critical illness, much in the same way that elec-trocardiogram monitoring is currently used. Status epilepticus can cause secondary neurologic injury but the effects of discrete seizure burden and IIC patterns is still under investigation. The ambiguous nature of these EEG patterns necessitates ancillary testing where possible, such as NSE, neuroimaging with MRI, FDG-PET, or SPECT to better understand their malignant fea-tures. Treating status epilepticus, seizures, and IIC patterns is a delicate balance where the benefits and drawbacks of escalating IV anesthetic agents and ASM must be continually weighed. In addition to treating the EEG pattern, the clinician should focus on reversible causes such as metabolic disarray, offending drugs, infec-tion, or inflammation and surgically remediable causes such as subdural hemorrhage. The optimal order and combination of ASMs and IV anesthetics is still lacking, given the complex dynamic interplay of the forces in neurocritical care. Still, one can advo-cate for rational polypharmacy-that is, using antiseizure medications with different mechanisms of action and compatible pharmacokinetics. Weaning of ASMs in the acute and recovery stage of critical illness is also in need of further clarification. Answering these management questions will require an expanded use of multi-modal ancillary testing, multicenter collaboration with data harmonization and inno-vate trial designs for a data-driven approach to neurocritical care EEG with the goal of arresting neurologic deterioration and improving neurologic recovery.

TI  - Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation: Substrates, Mechanisms and Treatment
T2  - ARRHYTHMIA & ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Idiopathic VF is a complex clinical entity that is characterised by an evolving scope over time. Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and electrical diseases represent a significant proportion of diagnoses attributed during follow-up in patients with an initial diagnosis of idiopathic VF. Stepwise diagnostic workup and management are of paramount importance. We proposed that idiopathic VF can be split into two distinct phenotypes, with potential overlap in an individual patient. In patients with Purkinje-related idiopathic VF, short-coupled ventricular ectopy can be documented, and ablation of the culprit tissue is a reasonable strategy to avoid recurrence. In patients with microstructural idiopathic VF, localised myocardial alterations can be unveiled by thorough electro-anatomical mapping and are amenable to a substrate-elimination strategy. Idiopathic VF is also a dynamic and evolving field, with promising research, new diagnostic tools and ablation techniques being developed in the near future.

TI  - Successful Use of Targeted Temperature Management After Repair of Myocardial Rupture from Blunt Chest Trauma: A Case Report
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Targeted temperature management (TTM) improves survival and neurological outcome after nontraumatic cardiac arrest. However, TTM is not used widely after traumatic cardiac arrest because of concerns that it might exacerbate bleeding. We report the use of postarrest TTM after repair of blunt myocardial rupture. A 48-year-old man was admitted after being rescued from a major traffic accident by the local emergency service. Focused sonography showed pericardial fluid without cardiac tamponade. Computed tomography showed a large hematoma in the anterior mediastinum associated with hemopericardium. The patient developed cardiac arrest during the operative preparations. Repeat bedside sonography revealed a large pericardial effusion and signs of cardiac tamponade. Spontaneous circulation was restored after ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3. The patient was transported promptly to the operating room and underwent median sternotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass. A rupture of the junction of the superior vena cava/right atrium and left atrial appendage was detected and was closed by direct suturing. Immediately after return to the intensive care unit, we performed TTM (target body temperature 34.5 degrees C) using a surface-cooling device at 4 hours postarrest. TTM was maintained for 24 hours and controlled gradual rewarming was then initiated. He regained consciousness 36 hours postrewarming with limited speech ability. The patient recovered with no further cardiac events and was discharged 3 weeks after admission, with no other serious complications. The patient was neurologically intact (cerebral performance category 1) at 6 months of follow-up. This case demonstrates the potential benefit and applicability of postarrest TTM in patients after repair of blunt myocardial rupture.

TI  - Psychiatric sequelae of cardiac arrest
T2  - DIALOGUES IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - This manuscript summarizes the literature on mental health outcomes after cardiac arrest. Survivors of cardiac arrest show high rates of mental illness with more than 40% suffering from anxiety, 30% from depression, and 25% from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health outcomes may differ depending on the setting in which the cardiac arrest occurred. A major problem is reduced neuropsychological functioning. Between 30% and 50% of survivors of cardiac arrest suffer from cognitive deficits. Deficits of attention, declarative memory, executive function, visual-spatial abilities, and verbal fluency have been observed. As a result of numerous psychopathological symptoms (depression in 14% to 45%, anxiety in 13% to 61%, and PTSD in 19% to 27%) and reduced cognitive functioning (about 20% to 60%), relevantly reduced quality of life is observed in about 20% of cardiac arrest survivors.

TI  - Pediatricians' attitudes toward resuscitation in children with chronic illnesses
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) orders are becoming more common in children with chronic illnesses. In this study, we compare pediatricians' attitudes about DNAR orders in four venues. Our hypotheses are: 1) venue matters: acceptance of DNAR varies by where the arrest occurs; 2) specialty affiliation matters: acceptance of DNAR varies by pediatric specialization; and 3) the personal influences the professional: pediatricians are more likely to respect and recommend a DNAR if they would choose DNAR for their own child.
   Methods: Surveys were sent to 150 pediatricians in each of four sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics: children with disabilities, critical care, emergency medicine, and school health. The survey included four hypothetical vignettes about DNAR in various venues (pediatric intensive care unit, chronic care facility, emergency department, and school) followed by three questions: 1) would you respect the family's choice for DNAR? 2) Would you recommend DNAR to the family? 3) Would you choose DNAR for your own child? Results were analyzed using SPSS software.
   Results: Two hundred seventy-nine of 560 eligible surveys (50%) were returned. The majority of respondents were men (62%), white (85%), Christian (61%), and fellowship trained (70%). In three of the scenarios (pediatric intensive care unit, emergency department, and school), most pediatricians were willing to respect (>90%), recommend (>85%), and choose a DNAR for their own child (>75%). For a ventilator-dependent child living in a chronic care facility, respondents were significantly less likely to respect (81 %, p < 0.001), recommend (76%, p < 0.001), or want a DNAR for their own child (68%, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, no demographic characteristic consistently correlated with physicians' decisions. However, pediatricians' preferences for ONAR for their own child correlated with recommending DNAR (p < 0.001) for their patients.
   Conclusion: DNAR decisions have become well accepted in the pediatric community for both end-of-life and poor quality of life cases. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2009; 10:369-374)

TI  - An Unusual Presentation of Type B Aortic Dissection as Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Complicated by Spinal and Renal Ischaemia Along With Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Severe Therapeutic Dilemma
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Aortic dissection (AD) is a catastrophic cardiovascular problem that can be challenging to diagnose sometimes. Despite diagnostic challenges, it requires a high degree of suspicion and prompt treatment is vital to its successful management. AD can be divided into type A aortic dissection (TAAD) and type B aortic dissection (TBAD). TAAD is characterised by dissection in the ascending aorta whereas TBAD does not have dissection in the ascending aorta. THAD is usually managed conservatively, and patients receive medical therapy such as antihypertensive medications, analgesia, and rehabilitation. This, however, is complicated by malperfusion of certain organs, which can be life-threatening. Patients who have malperfusion of certain organs should be managed aggressively and endovascular aortic repair should be considered in such cases. We present a case of a 63-year-old patient who presented with out-of-hospital pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. An electrocardiogram showed new-onset atrial fibrillation with ST-segment depression and a coronary angiogram showed severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery. A computed tomography scan of the thorax and abdomen showed TBAD with an occluded right renal artery and the patient was conservatively managed. The patient was discharged home after prolonged hospital admission and was conservatively managed for TBAD. This case was complicated by the fact that the patient had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and a coronary angiogram showed severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery. The patient also had new-onset atrial fibrillation, which made his clinical management very challenging. It is important to avoid unnecessary coronary intervention that can create more challenges in managing such patients.

TI  - Multidisciplinary pediatric trauma simulation curriculum in conjunction with a trauma resuscitation cognitive aid improves resident performance
T2  - GLOBAL SURGICAL EDUCATION - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR SURGICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background Trauma is the leading cause of mortality among children and adolescents. While often high acuity, these events are lower frequency compared to adult trauma activations. Therefore, it is critical that trauma teams are prepared for the unique elements of pediatric trauma resuscitation. Though the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires a minimum of 40 non-operative resuscitations and 20 pediatric surgeries prior to completion of surgical residency, no minimum is placed on pediatric trauma resuscitations. Through the implementation of a multidisciplinary pediatric trauma resuscitation simulation curriculum, we aimed to promote Pediatric Readiness at our institution. By increasing trainee exposure to these low-frequency events, we sought to improve their ability to respond to complex and high-acuity pediatric traumas. Methods This pilot curriculum, conducted as monthly one-hour sessions, occurred in the emergency department pediatric resuscitation bays. Clinical scenarios varied each month with increasing complexity throughout the year. The multidisciplinary teams, led by General Surgery and Emergency Medicine residents, were tasked with completing a full assessment during the resuscitation of a pediatric trauma patient, including any indicated bed side procedures. The initial trauma simulation was followed by a debriefing session with supplemental simulation-specific education before roles were redistributed within the teams and the simulation was repeated. During each simulation, Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Emergency Medicine faculty used a structured observation tool to evaluate overall group performance and to assess indicated elements of the resuscitation surveys that were most frequently performed, delayed, or omitted. Results A total of ten simulations were conducted with an average of twelve participants per simulation session. The sessions had an average of four surgical residents, one emergency medicine resident, three emergency room nurses, one respiratory therapist, and two medical students. Between the initial and repeat simulations, teams' overall completion of indicated elements on the trauma resuscitation observational tool improved by 25% (p < 0.01). The most improvement was seen in the implementation of the first pauses (26% to 72%; p < 0.01) and second pause (35% to 61%; p < 0.01). Significant improvement was also seen between initial and repeat simulations in the management of blood products (p = 0.01) and assessment of the patients' height and weight (p = 0.01). Conclusion Implementation of a pediatric trauma simulation curriculum effectively supplements resident exposure to pediatric trauma resuscitations and leads to improvement in trauma survey completion. Future study is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of simulation-based curricula on clinical outcomes.

TI  - Feasibility of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Measured on Initial Brain Computed Tomography as an Early Neurologic Outcome Predictor After Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - ObjectivesFew parameters are available to predict neurologic outcome of post-cardiac arrest patients in the early stage of treatment. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been used to indirectly assess intracranial pressure. This study evaluated whether ONSD, an additional parameter in initial brain computed tomography (CT) scans, can be an early predictor of neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients.
   MethodsA total of 112 cardiac arrest patients between November 2012 and October 2013 were identified. Ninety-eight comatose cardiac arrest patients were evaluated with brain CT. Of these patients, after exclusion of patients whose brain CT scans were done too late or with poor baseline neurology (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 3), 91 patients were included for this study. The parameters of initial brain CT, i.e., gray matter-to-white matter ratio (GWR) and ONSD, were measured after clinical care as part of a retrospective reanalysis of images. ONSD on brain CT was bilaterally measured 3 mm behind the eyeball at fixed window width and level and averaged to yield the mean value. The performance of ONSD to predict poor neurologic outcome (CPC = 3 to 5) was analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and cross-tabulations.
   ResultsTwenty-three patients showed good neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge. Mean (SD) ONSD was 5.6 (0.3) mm in the good outcome group versus 6.3 (0.5) mm in the poor outcome group (p < 0.001). After basic clinical covariates were controlled for, i.e., age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (3 vs. 4-15), and time from collapse to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), ONSD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 3.9) and GWR (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4 to 0.9) were found to be significant factors for predicting poor neurologic outcome. ROC curve analysis showed that ONSD and GWR had areas under the ROC curve of 0.931 (95% CI = 0.87 to 0.98) and 0.922 (95% CI = 0.86 to 0.97), respectively. Combining the cutoff values of ONSD (6.21 mm, sensitivity = 56%; 95% CI = 43% to 68%) and GWR (1.23, sensitivity = 84%; 95% CI = 73% to 92%) to have 100% specificities, the sensitivity was improved to 92% (95% CI = 84% to 98%). Intrarater and interrater intraclass correlation coefficients between the investigators measuring ONSD were 0.888 and 0.833, respectively.
   ConclusionsOptic nerve sheath diameter on initial brain CT correlated closely with the neurologic outcome of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and had good reliability. Additional prospective work may be justified evaluating the standardization and diagnostic performance in real time use as a predictive tool for neurologic outcome following cardiac arrest.
   Resumen
   ObjetivosSe dispone de escasos parametros para predecir el resultado neurologico de los pacientes tras una parada cardiaca en la primera etapa del tratamiento. El diametro de la vaina del nervio optico (DVNO) se ha utilizado para evaluar indirectamente la presion intracraneal. Este estudio evaluo si el DVNO, un parametro adicional en las imagenes de la tomografia computarizada (TC) craneal inicial, puede ser predictivo del resultado neurologico en los pacientes tras una parada cardiaca.
   MetodologiaSe identificaron 112 pacientes con parada cardiaca entre noviembre de 2012 y octubre de 2013. Se evaluaron 98 pacientes en coma por parada cardiaca con TC craneal. De estos pacientes, se incluyeron 91 para este estudio tras la exclusion de los pacientes cuya TC craneal fue realizada demasiado tarde o con un rendimiento neurologico basal pobre (categoria de rendimiento cerebral [CPC] 3). Los parametros de la TC craneal inicial, como por ejemplo la relacion entre la materia gris y la materia blanca (RGB) y el DVNO, se midieron tras la atencion clinica como parte de un reanalisis retrospectivo de las imagenes. El DVNO en la TC craneal se midio bilateralmente 3 mm detras del globo ocular con un nivel y ancho de ventana fijado y realizando un promedio para alcanzar el valor medio. Se obtuvieron los datos demograficos y clinicos. El rendimiento del DVNO para predecir el resultado neurologico pobre (CPC 3-5) se analizo mediante un analisis de regresion logistica multiple, analisis de la curva ROC y tablas de contingencia.
   ResultadosVeintitres pacientes mostraron un buen resultado neurologico al alta hospitalaria. El DVNO fue 5,6 mm (DE +/- 0,3mm) en el grupo con buen resultado vs. 6,3 mm(DE +/- 0,5 mm) en el grupo con pobre resultado (p< 0.001). Tras ajustar por covariables clinicas basicas (por ejemplo, edad, puntuacion de la Escala de Coma de Glasgow [3 vs 4-15] y el tiempo desde la parada hasta la restauracion de la circulacion espontanea, el DVNO (odds ratio [OR] 2,1; IC 95% = 1,1 a 3,9) y la RGB (OR 0,6; IC 95% = 0,4 a 0,9) fueron finalmente factores significativos de un resultado neurologico pobre. El analisis de la curva ROC mostro que el DVNO y la RGB tuvieron un area bajo la curva de 0,931 (IC 95% = 0,87 a 0,98) y 0,922 (IC 95% = 0,86 a 0,97), respectivamente. La combinacion de los puntos de corte de DVNO (6,21mm, sensibilidad 56%; IC 95% = 43% a 68%) y la RGB (1,23, sensibilidad 84%; IC 95% = 73% a 92%) fijados para tener especificidades de un 100%, hicieron mejorar la sensibilidad a un 92% (IC 95% = 84% a 98%). El coeficiente de correlacion intraclase inter e intraobservador entre los investigadores con la medicion del DVNO fue de 0,888 y 0,833, respectivamente.
   ConclusionesEl DVNO se correlaciono estrechamente con el resultado neurologico de la encefalopatia isquemica hipoxemica y tuvo una buena fiabilidad. Por lo tanto, un trabajo prospectivo adicional puede estar justificado para evaluar la estandarizacion y el rendimiento diagnostico en el uso a tiempo real como una herramienta predictiva para el resultado neurologico tras una parada cardiaca.

TI  - Optimizing timing of ventricular defibrillation
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Our intent was to evolve a prognosticator that would predict the likelihood that an electrical shock would restore a perfusing rhythm. Such a prognosticator was to be based on conventional electrocardiographic signals but without constraints caused by artifacts resulting from precordial compression. The adverse effects of "hands off" intervals for rhythm analyses would therefore be minimized. Such a prognosticator was further intended to reduce the number of electrical shocks and the total energy delivered and thereby minimize postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.
   Design: Observational study.
   Subjects. Medical research laboratory of a university-affiliated research and educational institute.
   Subjects: Domestic pigs.
   Interventions. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in an established porcine model of cardiac arrest. Recordings of scalar lead 2 over the frequency range of 4-48 Hz were utilized. The area under the curve representing the amplitude and frequency was defined as the amplitude spectrum area (AMSA).
   Measurements and Main Results. A derivation group of 55 animals yielded a threshold value of AMSA that uniformly predicted successful resuscitation. A separate group of 10 animals, a validation group, confirmed that an AMSA value of 21 mV-Hz predicted restoration of perfusing rhythm after 7 of 8 electrical shocks and failure of electrical conversion in 21 of 23 electrical shocks, yielding sensitivity and specificity of about 90%. The negative predictive value of AMSA was 95% and statistically equivalent to that of coronary perfusion pressure, mean amplitude, and median frequency. The positive predictive value that would prompt continuation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation without interruption for an unsuccessful defibrillation attempt was greatly improved with AMSA (78%) as compared with coronary perfusion pressure (42%), mean amplitude (32%), and median frequency (29%).
   Conclusion: AMSA has the potential for guiding more optimal timing of defibrillation without adverse interruption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation or the delivery of unsuccessful high energy electrical shocks that contribute to postresuscitation myocardial injury.

TI  - Global prevalence of basic life support training: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background and Aims: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest exerts a large disease burden, which may be mitigated by bystander cardiopulmonary resus-citation and automated external defibrillation. We aimed to estimate the global prevalence and distribution of bystander training among laypersons, which are poorly understood, and to identify their determinants.Methods: We searched electronic databases for cross-sectional studies reporting the prevalence of bystander training from representative popu-lation samples. Pooled prevalence was calculated using random-effects models. Key outcome was cardiopulmonary resuscitation training (training within two-years and those who were ever trained). We explored determinants of interest using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.Results: 29 studies were included, representing 53,397 laypersons. Among national studies, the prevalence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation train-ing within two-years and among those who were ever trained, and automated external defibrillator training was 10.02% (95% CI 6.60-14.05), 42.04% (95% CI 30.98-53.28) and 21.08% (95% CI 10.16-34.66) respectively. Subgroup analyses by continent revealed pooled prevalence estimates of 31.58% (95%CI 18.70-46.09), 58.78% (95%CI 42.41-74.21), 18.93 (95% CI 0.00-62.94), 64.97% (95%CI 64.00-65.93), and 50.56% (95%CI 47.57-53.54) in Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, and Oceania respec-tively, with significant subgroup differences (p < 0.01). A country's income and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training (ever trained) (p = 0.033) were positively correlated. Similarly, this prevalence was higher among the highly educated (p<0.00001).Conclusions: Large regional variation exists in data availability and bystander training prevalence. Socioeconomic status correlated with preva-lence of bystander training, and regional disparities were apparent between continents. Bystander training should be promoted, particularly in Asia, Middle East, and low-income regions. Data availability should be encouraged from under-represented regions.

TI  - Pharmacological Manipulation of Trk, p75NTR, and NGF Balance Restores Memory Deficit in Global Ischemia/Reperfusion Model in Rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Long-term memory impairment is reported in more than 50% of cardiac arrest survivors. Monosialoganglioside (GM1) provided neuroprotection in experimental models of stroke but failed to replicate its promise clinically for unknown reasons. GM1 stimulates the release of nerve growth factor (NGF), which is synthesized as a precursor protein (pro-NGF) that either mediates apoptosis through the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) or is cleaved by the protease furin (FUR) to yield mature NGF, the latter supporting survival through tropomyosin kinase receptor (Trk). The flavanol epicatechin (EPI) inhibits p75NTR-mediated signaling and apoptosis by pro-NGF. The aim of the current work is to test whether these two drugs affect, or communicate with, each other in the setting of CNS injuries. Using the two-vessel occlusion model of global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), we tested if pharmacological modulation of Trk, p75NTR, and NGF balance with GM1, EPI, and their combination, can correct the memory deficit that follows this insult. Finally, we tested if FUR insufficiency and/or p75NTR-mediated apoptosis negatively affect the neurotherapeutic effect of GM1. Key proteins for Trk and p75NTR, FUR, and both forms of NGF were assessed. All treatment regiments successfully improved spatial memory retention and acquisition. A week after the insult, most Trk and p75NTR proteins were normal, but pro/mature NGF ratio remained sharply elevated and was associated with the poorest memory performance. Pharmacological correction of this balance was achieved by reinforcing Trk and p75NTR signaling. GM1 increased FUR levels, while concomitant administration of EPI weakened GM1 effect on pro-survival Trk and p75NTR mediators. GM1 neuroprotection is therefore not limited by FUR but could be dependent on p75NTR.

TI  - WARM GLUTAMATE ASPARTATE ENRICHED BLOOD CARDIOPLEGIC SOLUTION FOR PERIOPERATIVE SUDDEN-DEATH
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - This report describes an initial experience applying warm glutamate/aspartate substrate-enriched blood Cardioplegic solution to resuscitate hearts in 14 patients with witnessed perioperative arrest Ten patients were in stable hemodynamic condition in the catheterization laboratory (n = 3) or intensive care unit when sudden irreversible fibrillation developed. It progressed to electromechanical arrest in six patients. In patients with preoperative or postoperative arrest, conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation were unsuccessful and extracorporeal circulation was started 22 to 150 minutes after arrest. The left ventricle was vented, the aorta clamped, and warm (37-degrees-C) aspartate/glutamate blood cardioplegic solution was given at a rate of 150 ml/min for 20 minutes. All bypass grafts were open with good flows in patients who had had coronary bypass, and coronary bypass was done in the three patients who had preoperative arrest Eleven of 14 hearts resumed normal sinus rhythm after aortic unclamping, only two electrocardiographically proved infarctions occurred, and 13 patients had complete hemodynamic recovery with improved ejection fraction. Three patients died: one of progressive cardiogenic shock, another of mediastinitis, and the third of irreversible neurologic damage. Eleven patients were discharged from the hospital and are well after a follow-up period between 3 and 9 months. We conclude that witnessed perioperative arrest with intractable ventricular fibrillation should be treated aggressively by administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation during prompt transfer to the operating room for total vented bypass and delivery of warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution. This treatment may salvage hearts thought to be damaged irreversibly and may be a feasible approach to intractable witnessed cardiac arrest, provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation maintains satisfactory cerebral perfusion pressure.

TI  - Long term left ventricular systolic function assessment following CABG -: A prospective, randomised study.: Blood versus cristalloid cardioplegia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Background In an effort to define the role of blood cardioplegia delivered in antegrade/retrogade fashion in patients with either good or poor left ventricular function undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery, we initiated a prospective randomised study in which postoperative hemodynamics besides clinical data were compared in patients administered antegrade/retrograde crystalloid cardioplegia,
   Methods. To compare the efficiency of two methods of myocardial protection - cold crystalloid ante/retro cardioplegia and cold blood ante/retro cardioplegia in two groups of patients with high and low LVEF - we randomised 122 patients for CABG, The potential improvement in left ventricular systolic function assessed by echocardiography and the same clinical data were the end points of the study, Patients were divided into group 1(47 patients, LVEF < 40%) and group Il (75 patients, LVEF > 40%), Pathologic antecedents and preoperative clinical conditions were similar in both randomised subgroups Ia, IIa (crystalloid cardioplegia) and subgroups Ib, IIb (blood cardioplegia), The following parameters were measured: left atrium diameter CLA), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular wall motion score index (WMSI), and area asynergy (AA). All patients underwent echocardiography: A - prior the CABG, B - 2-6 weeks postoperatively, C - 3 months postoperatively, D - 6 months postoperatively, E - 1 year postoperatively,
   Results, The results of clinical assessment in both groups showed improvement of quality of Life. The constant improvement of LVEF and WMSI was observed in group I in contrast to group II. There were no significant differences in postoperative left ventricular systolic function between subgroups Ia and Ib or IIa and IIb,
   Conclusions. The use of blood cardioplegia, instead of crystalloid cardioplegia, when used in the ante/retrograde fashion during CABG has no influence on postoperative left ventricular systolic function, The improvement in left ventricular systolic function following CABG is greater in patients with low LVEF in contrast to patients with high LVEF.

TI  - Bystanders' Views on the Use of Automated External Defibrillators for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Implications for Health Promotions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Despite the widespread availability of automated external defibrillators, not everyone is enthusiastic about using them. The aim of this study was to examine the reasons for not using an automated external defibrillator (AED) and predictors of the reasons. The study had a cross-sectional design using an online survey. Data were collected in eighteen districts in Hong Kong to be representative of the city. The questionnaire consisted of questions on demographics, knowledge and attitude towards AED use, reasons for not using AED, and whether the kind of victim could affect the decision of the bystanders. There was a high significant correlation between knowledge and attitude, with r = 0.782 and p < 0.001. Of the respondents, 53.3% agreed that the kind of victim would affect their willingness to operate an AED. A binary logistic regression model revealed that a higher education (OR 6.242, 95% CI: 1.827-21.331), concern about the kind of victim involved (OR 2.822, 95% CI: 1.316-6.052), and a younger age were significant predictors of worrying about taking on responsibility in using AED. Other than knowledge, other barriers included a desire to avoid legal liability, and the kind of victim they encountered. Life experiences in adulthood could possibly affect the social responsibility and influence the behaviors of adults to operate AEDs.

TI  - The Use of Automated External Defibrillators in Infants A Report From the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objective Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have been used successfully in many populations to improve survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. While ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia are more prevalent in adults, these arrhythmias do occur in infants. The Scientific Advisory Council of the American Red Cross reviewed the literature on the use of AEDs in infants in order to make recommendations on use in the population.
   Methods The Cochrane library and PubMed were searched for studies that included AEDs in infants, any external defibrillation in infants, and simulation studies of algorithms used by AEDs on pediatric arrhythmias.
   Results There were 4 studies on the accuracy of AEDs in recognizing pediatric arrhythmias. Case reports (n = 2) demonstrated successful use of AED in infants, and a retrospective review (n = 1) of pediatric pads for AEDs included infants. Six studies addressed defibrillation dosages used. The algorithms used by AEDs had high sensitivity and specificity for pediatric arrhythmias and very rarely recommended a shock inappropriately. The energy doses delivered by AEDs were high, although in the range that have been used in out-of-hospital arrest. In addition, there are data to suggest that 2 to 4 J/kg may not be effective defibrillation doses for many children.
   Conclusions In the absence of prompt defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, survival is unlikely. Automated external defibrillators should be used in infants with suspected cardiac arrest, if a manual defibrillator with a trained rescuer is not immediately available. Automated external defibrillators that attenuate the energy dose (eg, via application of pediatric pads) are recommended for infants. If an AED with pediatric pads is not available, the AED with adult pads should be used.

TI  - Management of macroscopic haematuria in the emergency department
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Macroscopic haematuria is a commonly seen condition in the emergency department ( ED), which has a variety of causes. However, most importantly, macroscopic haematuria has a high diagnostic yield for urological malignancy. 30% of patients presenting with painless haematuria are found to have a malignancy. The majority of these patients can be managed in the outpatient setting. This review of current literature suggests a management pathway that can be used in the ED. A literature search was done using Medline, PubMed and Google. In men aged >60 years, the positive predictive value of macroscopic haematuria for urological malignancy is 22.1%, and in women of the same age it is 8.3%. In terms of the need for follow-up investigation, a single episode of haematuria is equally important as recurrent episodes. Baseline investigation in the ED includes full blood count, urea and electrolyte levels, midstream urine dipstick, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin, and formal microscopy, culture and sensitivities. Treatment of macroscopic haematuria aims at RESP - Resuscitation, Ensuring, Safe and Prompt. Indications for admission include clot retention, cardiovascular instability, uncontrolled pain, sepsis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, severe comorbidity, heavy haematuria or social restrictions. Discharged patients should drink plenty of clear fluids and return for further medical attention if the following occur: clot retention, worsening haematuria despite adequate fluid intake, uncontrolled pain or fever, or inability to cope at home. Follow-up by a urological team should be promptly arranged, ideally within the 2-week cancer referral target.

TI  - Novel Approaches to Risk Stratification of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
T2  - CURRENT CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review This review aims to discuss strategies for patient risk stratification of in-hospital cardiac arrest and their challenges and limitations.
   Recent Findings In-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant cause of inpatient mortality, but survival to discharge rates remain low and have not significantly improved in the last three decades. As most patients are in a monitored setting and commonly show clinical deterioration prior to cardiac arrest, early intervention is thought to be the best way to both prevent and improve survival from cardiac arrest. However, detection of an impending cardiac arrest has proven to be particularly challenging.
   Summary Contemporary methods often rely on score-based early warning systems based on intermittently collected vitals and laboratory values that have seen some success in preventing in-hospital cardiac arrest but are neither sensitive enough to detect impending arrest without significant false alarms nor have the ability to uncover the underlying cause of an imminent arrest. Machine learning-derived early warning systems that utilize temporal trends in vital signs as well as continuous telemetry data are currently being developed. These new approaches show promise in addressing the issue of sensitivity and positive predictive value but require further clinical research and technological advancements.

TI  - Regional Differences in Cerebral Glucose Metabolism After Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation in Rats Using [18F]FDG Positron Emission Tomography and Autoradiography
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Cardiac arrest is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Brain injury severity and prognosis of cardiac arrest patients are related to the cerebral areas affected. To this aim, we evaluated the variability and the distribution of brain glucose metabolism after cardiac arrest and resuscitation in an adult rat model.
   Ten rats underwent 8-min cardiac arrest, induced with a mixture of potassium and esmolol, and resuscitation, performed with chest compressions and epinephrine. Eight sham animals received anesthesia and experimental procedures identical to the ischemic group except cardiac arrest induction. Brain metabolism was assessed using [F-18]FDG autoradiography and small animal-dedicated positron emission tomography.
   The absolute glucose metabolism measured with [F-18]FDG autoradiography 2 h after cardiac arrest and resuscitation was lower in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices of cardiac arrest animals, showing, respectively, a 36% (p = 0.006), 32% (p = 0.016), 36% (p = 0.009), and 32% (p = 0.013) decrease compared to sham group. Striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum showed no significant changes. Relative regional metabolism indicated a redistribution of metabolism from cortical area to brainstem and cerebellum.
   Our data suggest that cerebral regions have different susceptibility to moderate global ischemia in terms of glucose metabolism. The neocortex showed a higher sensibility to hypoxia-ischemia than other regions. Other subcortical regions, in particular brainstem and cerebellum, showed no significant change compared to non-ischemic rats.

TI  - Clinical paper Facilitators and barriers to the delivery of the PARAMEDIC2 trial
T2  - RESUSCITATION PLUS
AB  - Background: PARAMEDIC2 was a medicines trial comparing adrenaline with placebo in out -of -hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). At the time, United Kingdom (UK) Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) were inexperienced in delivering such research. Aim: To identify barriers and facilitators to delivery of the PARAMEDIC2 (Adrenaline) trial by five UK NHS EMS. Methods: This qualitative study took a grounded theory approach to thematic analysis of workshop data. Members of the trial teams from each service attended a workshop in November 2018 and discussed their experiences in answer to two prompt questions. Data were coded and themes presented. Results: Three main themes were identified: professionalism, organisational investment and unique features of EMS . The study provided an opportunity for recruiting paramedics and research paramedics to demonstrate their professionalism . Research paramedics felt it was part of their professional duty to initiate discussions with the patient/family regarding the trial rather than leave this task to the hospital teams as would usually happen. Organisational investment was reflected by prioritising trial training and further development of research paramedics. By these means, research culture was developed. The unique features of EMS such as geographical challenges were often addressed with technological solutions and through building relationships with internal teams. Conclusion: Barriers to trial delivery included infrequent exposure to the condition of interest and lack of continuity in research paramedic roles. Facilitators identified included flexibility of the research protocol, and organisational investment in the development of research paramedics. Participating in PARAMEDIC2 was challenging for the EMS involved, but ultimately strengthened their research culture.

TI  - Uterine Transplantation: Advances, Challenges, and Future Perspectives
T2  - DISEASES
AB  - Background: Infertility is a multifactorial condition with medical, psychological, demographic, and economic impacts. Around 3-5% of cases are due to uterine dysfunction. Absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI) refers to infertility caused entirely by the absence or abnormality of the uterus, which prevents embryo implantation or pregnancy viability. Uterus transplantation (UTx) has emerged as a promising treatment for AUFI and has been successfully performed in over 10 countries. Objectives: This study aims to conduct a systematic review of uterus transplantation, evaluating its efficacy and safety, as well as maternal, neonatal, and long-term outcomes. It also explores current challenges and future directions. Methods: The methodology was registered on the PROSPERO platform. A literature search was performed in January 2025 across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for articles published from January 2002 to December 2024 in English or Portuguese. The query was: "uterus/transplantation AND (pregnancy OR complications OR newborn OR premature OR diseases)". Study quality was assessed by journal impact factor (IF). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results: A total of 10 studies were included: four from Sweden, three from the DUETS group, two from the Czech Republic, and one multi-institutional American study. The UTx success rate was 74.0%; clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rates (LBR) per embryo transfer (ET) were 36.3% and 22.0%, respectively. No significant increase in congenital or neurological complications was observed. Adverse psychological outcomes were associated with transplant failure or pregnancy loss. Conclusions: UTx is a promising treatment for AUFI, showing favorable pregnancy and birth outcomes without major fetal or neonatal risks.

TI  - High-dose erythropoietin during cardiac resuscitation lessens postresuscitation myocardial stunning in swine
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - We investigated the metabolic and functional myocardial effects of erythropoietin (EPO) administered during resuscitation from cardiac arrest using an open-chest pig model of ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation by extracorporeal circulation, after having reported in rats a reversal of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction associated with activation of mitochondrial protective pathways. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 16 male domestic pigs and left untreated for 8 minutes, after which extracorporeal circulation was started and maintained for 10 additional minutes, adjusting the extracorporeal flow to provide a coronary perfusion pressure of 10 mmHg. Defibrillation was accomplished and the extracorporeal flow was adjusted to secure a mean aortic pressure of 40 mmHg or greater during spontaneous circulation for up to 120 minutes. Pigs were randomized 1:1 to receive EPO (1200 U/kg) or 0.9% NaCl before starting extracorporeal circulation. Severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction developed in both groups. However, recovery of myocardial function-comparing baseline with 120 minutes postresuscitation-was better in pigs treated with EPO than NaCl, as shown for left ventricular ejection fraction (from 45 +/- 8% to 36 +/- 9% in EPO, not significant; and from 46 +/- 8% to 26 +/- 8% in NaCl, P < 0.001) and for peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume (from 2.7 +/- 0.8 mmHg/mL to 2.4 +/- 0.7 mmHg/mL in EPO, not significant; and from 3.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg/mL to 1.8 +/- 0.6 mmHg/mL, P < 0.001 in NaCl). The EPO effect was associated with significantly higher myocardial O-2 consumption (12 +/- 6 mL/min/unit of tissue vs 6 +/- 2 mL/min/unit of tissue, P < 0.017) without effects on myocardial lactate consumption. Thus, EPO administered during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation lessened postresuscitation myocardial stunning-an effect that could be useful clinically to help promote postresuscitation hemodynamic stability.

TI  - Effects of a medical emergency team on reduction of incidence of and mortality from unexpected cardiac arrests in hospital: preliminary study
T2  - BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives To determine whether earlier clinical intervention by a medical emergency team prompted by clinical instability in a patient could reduce the incidence of and mortality from unexpected cardiac arrest in hospital.
   Design A non-randomised, population based study before (1996) and after (1999) introduction of the medical emergency team.
   Setting 300 bed tertiary referral teaching hospital.
   Participants All patients admitted to the hospital in 1996 (n=19 317) and 1999 (n=22 847).
   Interventions Medical emergency team (two doctors and one senior intensive care nurse) attended clinically unstable patients immediately with resuscitation drugs, fluid, and equipment. Response activated by the bedside nurse or doctor according to predefined criteria.
   Main outcome measures Incidence and outcome of unexpected cardiac arrest.
   Results The incidence of unexpected cardiac arrest was 3.77 per 1000 hospital admissions (73 cases) in 1996 (before intervention) and 2.05 per 1000 admissions (47 cases) in 1999 (after intervention), with mortality being 77% (56 patients) mid 55% (26 patients), respectively. After adjustment for case mix the intervention was associated with a 50% reduction in the incidence of unexpected cardiac arrest (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.73).
   Conclusions In clinically unstable inpatients early intervention by a medical emergency team significantly reduces the incidence of mid mortality from unexpected cardiac arrest in hospital.

TI  - Postabortal septic shock masquerading as haemorrhagic shock
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
AB  - A multiparous woman in her mid-30s presented with 8 days of vaginal bleeding following an unplanned, unsupervised pregnancy. She had a history of trauma and expulsion of tissue per vaginum at 12 weeks of gestation but did not seek medical care. On arrival, she was in haemorrhagic shock with severe anaemia (haemoglobin 5.9 g/dL), thrombocytopenia and hypotension. Initial management included fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite stabilisation, persistent tachycardia, abdominal tenderness and a rising respiratory rate raised concern for sepsis. A clinical diagnosis of septic shock was made, prompting emergency laparotomy, which revealed pyoperitoneum. Cultures identified Streptococcus pyogenes; antibiotics were escalated to meropenem and vancomycin. The patient required intensive care unit care with mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. She recovered well postoperatively, developed a minor surgical site infection managed conservatively and was discharged in stable condition. Follow-up confirmed full recovery, and appropriate contraceptive counselling was provided.

TI  - Administration of inhaled noble and other gases after cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A systematic review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Inhalation of noble and other gases after cardiac arrest (CA) might improve neurological and cardiac outcomes. This article discusses up-to-date information on this novel therapeutic intervention.
   Data sources: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, online published abstracts from conference proceedings, clinical trial registry clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant papers were systematically searched from January 1960 till March 2019.
   Study selection: Preclinical and clinical studies, irrespective of their types or described outcomes, were included.
   Data extraction: Abstract screening, study selection, and data extraction were performed by two independent authors. Due to the paucity of human trials, risk of bias assessment was not performed DATA SYNTHESIS: After screening 281 interventional studies, we included an overall of 27. Only, xenon, helium, hydrogen, and nitric oxide have been or are being studied on humans. Xenon, nitric oxide, and hydrogen show both neuroprotective and cardiotonic features, while argon and hydrogen sulfide seem neuroprotective, but not cardiotonic. Most gases have elicited neurohistological protection in preclinical studies; however, only hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide appeared to preserve CA1 sector of hippocampus, the most vulnerable area in the brain for hypoxia.
   Conclusion: Inhalation of certain gases after CPR appears promising in mitigating neurological and cardiac damage and may become the next successful neuroprotective and cardiotonic interventions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress disorder in the wake of heart disease: Prevalence, risk factors, and future research directions
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
AB  - Background: There is increasing recognition that patients after a cardiac event may be at risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present article reviews studies looking at PTSD as a sequel of heart disease with a focus on prevalence, risk factors, and future research directions. Methods: We conducted a search on PsychInfo and MEDLINE from 1980 to the present. Studies were included in the review if they looked at PTSD after a cardiac event, reported on the number of cases with PTSD, and had been published in English. Results: We identified 25 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 7 reported on the follow-up of previously published studies. The prevalence of PTSD after heart disease varied from 0% to 38% across studies. PTSD has been most rigorously researched after myocardial infarction with the best-powered studies finding a prevalence rate of 15%. Studies including control groups showed that cardiac patients were at risk of developing PTSD. Risk factors included sociodemographic and psychological characteristics and aspects related to the cardiac event. Conclusion: Despite substantial heterogeneity in the methodology of studies and differences in prevalence across studies, this review indicates that subgroups of patients are at risk of PTSD after a cardiac event. Future studies investigating PTSD as a sequel of heart disease should be more systematic, use a prospective study design with multiple assessments, and include sufficiently large samples. PTSD should not be ignored as a sequel of heart disease, given preliminary evidence that PTSD may be associated with nonadherence with medication and an increased risk of clinical adverse events.

TI  - Coronary artery spasm following mannitol administration during partial nephrectomy: A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Rationale:Coronary vasospasm (CAS) is often triggered by autonomic imbalance and can lead to severe cardiac events, particularly in patients with undiagnosed variant angina. Mannitol, commonly used for renal protection, may inadvertently activate the sympathetic nervous system, potentially leading to CAS in susceptible patients. This rare case highlights the potential cardiac risks of mannitol-induced CAS during robotic-assisted surgery.Patient concerns:A 66-year-old male with no known cardiac history underwent robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy. Approximately 40 minutes after receiving a high-dose mannitol infusion (75 g), he developed frequent ventricular premature contractions followed by sudden ventricular fibrillation.Diagnoses:During the operation, post-resuscitation transthoracic echocardiography showed regional wall motion abnormalities. After the operation, emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis. A coronary spasm provocation test performed 10 days later confirmed the diagnosis of variant angina due to significant CAS.Interventions:In the operating room, prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 3 rounds of defibrillation successfully restored circulation. Following emergent transthoracic echocardiography and coronary angiography, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further evaluation and management.Outcomes:The patient recovered without neurologic sequelae. Calcium channel blocker therapy was initiated, and regular follow-up was arranged at the outpatient department.Lessons:This case underscores the potential cardiac risks associated with high-dose mannitol in patients with coronary hyperreactivity, highlighting the importance of personalized perioperative management and close cardiovascular monitoring. In high-risk patients, alternative strategies for renal protection should be considered to mitigate the risk of life-threatening cardiac events.

TI  - Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator in a Patient with Pectus Excavatum
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest in young healthy adults has concerned the medical and social communities due to its fatal effect. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been demonstrated to be an effective measure for prevention of sudden death in patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmia. Subcutaneous ICD has been developed to overcome some problems associated with transvenous leads in the conventional ICD. In this case report, we describe the use of completely subcutaneous ICD for a young patient with pectus excavatum following presentation with out-of-hospital VF arrest with no complication in device or lead positioning.

TI  - TNF-α antagonists differentially induce TGF-β1-dependent resuscitation of dormant-like Mycobacterium tuberculosis
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
AB  - TNF-alpha- as well as non-TNF-alpha-targeting biologics are prescribed to treat a variety of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. The well-documented risk of tuberculosis progression associated with anti-TNF-alpha treatment highlighted the central role of TNF-alpha for the maintenance of protective immunity, although the rate of tuberculosis detected among patients varies with the nature of the drug. Using a human, in-vitro granuloma model, we reproduce the increased reactivation rate of tuberculosis following exposure to Adalimumab compared to Etanercept, two TNF-alpha-neutralizing biologics. We show that Adalimumab, because of its bivalence, specifically induces TGF-beta 1-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resuscitation which can be prevented by concomitant TGF-beta 1 neutralization. Moreover, our data suggest an additional role of lymphotoxin-alpha-neutralized by Etanercept but not Adalimumab-in the control of latent tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, we show that, while Secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A antibody, does not revert Mtb dormancy, the anti-IL-12-p40 antibody Ustekinumab and the recombinant IL-1RA Anakinra promote Mtb resuscitation, in line with the importance of these pathways in tuberculosis immunity.
   Author summary
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the world's leading infectious killer. Multi-cellular immune structures called granulomas may constitute a latent form of Mtb infection and a potential reservoir for future cases. Post-marketing surveillance data suggested that Mtb protective immunity is unequally impacted by different TNF-alpha-targeting drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders. We used an in-vitro granuloma model to reproduce these clinical observations and gain mechanistic insights and, in addition, to assess the risk of tuberculosis reactivation associated with the use of other immunomodulatory drugs. These results may inspire pharmacologists to design future drug-development strategies of biologics in particular, while immunologists and microbiologists will find a relevant experimental approach to disentangle the complex interactions involved in Mtb protective immunity and immunopathogenesis.

TI  - Cardiac metastasectomy with cardiopulmonary bypass in a case of mediastinal osteosarcoma metastasis with left atrial invasion
T2  - TURK GOGUS KALP DAMAR CERRAHISI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - The most common organ to which osteosarcomas metastasize is the lungs. Extrapulmonary osteosarcoma metastases are being observed in increasingly more patients, particularly after pulmonary metastases, and becoming less sensitive to chemotherapy with shorter survival. Surgical resection is advocated for prolonging survival and improving quality of life when the primary tumor is under control. In this article, we present a case of mediastinal osteosarcoma metastasis with left atrium invasion in a 25-year-old female patient. During her seven-year oncologic follow-up, patient was performed two right, two left thoracotomies for pulmonary metastasectomies and one right Dartevelle incision for metastasis located in the right upper lobe extending through the clavicle and the first rib. She was also performed a median sternotomy for resection of a mediastinal metastasis adjacent to both atria. Patient received radiotherapy and several courses of adjuvant chemotherapy throughout her therapy. On patient's final computed tomography scan, mediastinal tumor recurrence was detected which was invading the left atrium. Considering that surgical resection would be the most appropriate therapeutic approach to prolong survival, patient was performed metastasectomy under cardiopulmonary bypass support and cardiac arrest with partial left atrial resection and bovine pericardial patch. Keywords: Cardiopulmonary bypass; metastasectomy; osteosarcoma.

TI  - Outcome and prognostication after cardiac arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB  - The outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has historically been grim at best. The current overall survival rate of patients admitted to a hospital is approximately 10%, making cardiac arrest one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The situation is improving with the incorporation of therapeutic temperature modulation, aggressive prevention of secondary brain injury, and improved access to advanced cardiovascular support, all of which have decreased mortality and allowed for better outcomes. Mortality after cardiac arrest is often the direct result of active withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy based on the perception that neurological recovery is not possible. This reality highlights the importance of providing accurate estimates of neurological prognosis to decision makers when discussing goals of care. The current standard of care for assessing neurological status in patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy emphasizes a multimodal approach that includes five elements: (1) neurological examination off sedation, (2) continuous electroencephalography, (3) serum neuron-specific enolase levels, (4) magnetic resonance brain imaging, and (5) somatosensory-evoked potential testing. Sophisticated decision support systems that can integrate these clinical, imaging, and biomarker and neurophysiologic data and translate it into meaningful projections of neurological outcome are urgently needed.

TI  - Structural Insight on GPR119 Agonist as Potential Therapy for Type II Diabetes: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a long-term metabolic condition that is characterized by excessive blood glucose. DM is the third most death-causing disease, leading to retinopathy, nephropathy, loss of vision, stroke, and cardiac arrest. Around 90% of the total cases of diabetic patients have Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Among various approaches for the treatment of T2DM. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 119 have been identified as a new pharmacological target. GPR119 is distributed preferentially in the pancreas beta-cells and gastrointestinal tract (enteroendocrine cells) in humans. GPR119 receptor activation elevates the release of incretin hormones such as Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP1) and Glucose Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) from intestinal K and L cells. GPR119 receptor agonists stimulate intracellular cAMP production via G alpha s coupling to adenylate cyclase. GPR119 has been linked to the control of insulin release by pancreatic beta-cells, as well as the generation of GLP-1 by enteroendocrine cells in the gut, as per in vitro assays. The dual role of the GPR119 receptor agonist in the treatment of T2DM leads to the development of a novel prospective anti-diabetic drug and is thought to have decreased the probability of inducing hypoglycemia. GPR119 receptor agonists exert their effects in one of two ways: either by promoting glucose absorption by beta-cells, or by inhibiting alpha-cells' ability to produce glucose. In this review, we summarized potential targets for the treatment of T2DM with special reference to GPR119 along with its pharmacological effects, several endogenous as well as exogenous agonists, and its pyrimidine nucleus containing synthetic ligands.

TI  - Integration of cardiovascular regulation by the blood/endothelium cell-free layer
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - The cell-free layer (CFL) width separating red blood cells in flowing blood from the endothelial cell membrane is shown to be a regulator of the balance between nitric oxide (NO) production by the endothelium and NO scavenging by blood hemoglobin. The CFL width is determined by hematocrit (Hct) and the vessel wall flow velocity gradient. These factors and blood and plasma viscosity determine vessel wall shear stress which regulates the production of NO in the vascular wall. Mathematical modeling and experimental findings show that vessel wall NO concentration is a strong nonlinear function of Hct and that small Hct variations have comparatively large effects on blood pressure regulation. Furthermore, NO concentration is a regulator of inflammation and oxygen metabolism. Therefore, small, sustained perturbations of Hct may have long-term effects that can promote pro-hypertensive and pro-inflammatory conditions. In this context, Hct and its variability are directly related to vascular tone, peripheral vascular resistance, oxygen transport and delivery, and inflammation. These effects are relevant to the analysis and understanding of blood pressure regulation, as NO bioavailability regulates the contractile state of blood vessels. Furthermore, regulation of the CFL is a direct function of blood composition therefore understanding of its physiology relates to the design and management of fluid resuscitation fluids. From a medical perspective, these studies propose that it should be of clinical interest to note small variations in patient's Hct levels given their importance in modulating the CFL width and therefore NO bioavailability.

TI  - THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES DURING CARDIAC ARREST CARE: A SURVIVOR- AND FAMILY-LED SCOPING REVIEW PROTOCOL
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY NURSING
AB  - Introduction: Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death. Family members often witness the event and attempt resuscitation. The physiological and psychological impact of a loved one's death, witnessed or unwitnessed, can be significant and long-lasting. However, little is known about the care needs of families during the cardiac arrest care of a loved one. This scoping review protocol was designed with, and will be performed in partnership with, persons with lived experience of sudden cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and nonsurvivors alike). Methods: The review will be performed in accordance with accepted methods such as the Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework and the Levac extension. We will search multiple databases, and Google Scholar for both qualitative and quantitative scientific literature. Articles will be screened, extracted, and analyzed by a team with lived experience of cardiac arrest. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data extraction independently. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data. Discussion: This protocol outlines a planned literature review to systematically examine the nature of existing evidence to describe what the care needs of families experiencing the cardiac arrest of a loved one are. Such evi-dence will contribute to the development of strategies to meet identified care needs. Persons with lived experience partici-pated in the creation of this protocol, and they will also partici-pate in the execution of this review as partners and coinvestigators, not as research subjects or participants. The results of the scoping review will be disseminated upon completion of the work described in this protocol.

TI  - Adverse perinatal outcomes related to pregestational body mass index
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGIA & PREVENZIONE
AB  - BACKGROUND: a high body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of complications and adverse outcomes for both mother and infant. OBJECTIVES: to analyse the main adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with maternal excess weight and obesity. DESIGN: retrospective epidemiological study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data extrapolated from the Birth Attendance Certificate information flow of the Autonomous Province of Trento (Northern Italy) between 2015 and 2019. A total of 20,756 women with data regarding maternal height and weight at the start of pregnancy were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: gestational outcome variables studied were gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, premature birth, and still births. Outcomes considered during labour and delivery were type of delivery, induction, episiotomy and post-partum haemorrhage. Neonatal outcomes were birth weight, Apgar score, need for resuscitation, and hospitalisation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Lastly, exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was analysed. RESULTS: considering the population of pregnant women, 68.3% of women were classified as normal-weight, 9.5% as underweight, 16.0% as overweight, and 6.3% as obese. Maternal excess weight and obesity were seen to be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, caesarean section, induction, post-partum bleeding, foetal macrosomia, and the need for neonatal resuscitation and hospitalisation in the NICU. Infants born to overweight and obese mothers were also less likely to be breastfed. CONCLUSIONS: excess weight and obesity are important risk factors for health and contribute to the onset of complications during pregnancy and adverse perinatal and long-term outcomes. Programming and implementing public health promotion schemes aimed at preventing excessive weight gain in the reproductive age could significantly improve maternal and foetal health.

TI  - Management of out-of hospital cardiac arrest patients with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 2021
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
AB  - Introduction
   Over the last decade, eCPR programs have become more and more popular, at least amongst high-volume centers. Despite its rise in popularity and promising outcome, strategies concerning pre- and post-implantation of VA-ECMO remain at least debatable. Besides, integrating the appropriate set-up, managing anticoagulation, implementing LV-venting, and predicting neurological outcome play important roles in caring for thise highly selective patient-collective. We sought to present our institutional ' s techniques for establishing an eCPR program and managing patients peri- and post implantation in eCPR-runs.
   Areas covered
   This manuscript covers the majority of clinical concerns and parameters for establishing an eCPR program and its recent advantages. We will describe a safe way of cannulation, setting anticoagulation goals, strategies for LV-venting and ICU-treatment. Also included, an elaboration on neurological and cardiac prognostication
   Expert Opinion
   We advocate ultrasound-guided cannula placement in eCPR patients. Also, we emphasize the importance of using stiffer wires and smaller arterial cannula sizes due to the different physiological parameters of OHCA patients. After cannulation, we aim for lower flow goals, the concept of 'partial VA-ECMO,' and lower anticoagulatory targets. LV-venting with Impella should remain an individual case to case decision.

TI  - Association of the COVID-19 pandemic with the incidence of suicidal/self-harm emergencies in Japan: dependence of trend on the regional length of movement restriction
T2  - INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - ObjectivesReportedly, coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID 19) was associated with an increased rate of emergency department visits related to suicide in youth. This study analyzed the influence of the pandemic on the incidence of emergency transportation associated with suicide attempts and self-harm.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used the Nationwide Emergency Medical Services Transportation Database between 2016 and 2021 for main analyses and extended database for resuscitation-attempted out-of-hospital cardiac arrests cases for secondary analyses.ResultsWe analyzed 204,081 cases with suicidal/self-harm emergencies. Compared with corresponding periods of 4 pre-pandemic years, the incidence of suicidal/self-harm emergencies increased after the end of the first nationwide declaration of emergency and remained high in youth (incidence rate ratio; 95% lower/upper interval, 1.29; 1.22-1.37 and 1.33; 1.28-1.39,), particularly in females (1.35; 1.27-1.46 and 1.40; 1.33-1.48) during the remaining pandemic period (Phase I (June 2020 to December 2020) and Phase II (2021), respectively). Compared with other emergencies, suicidal/self-harm emergencies were associated with a much higher proportion of outpatient deaths regardless of the pandemic. Suicidal out-of-hospital cardiac arrests cases were associated with much poorer outcomes.ConclusionThe incidence of suicidal/self-harm emergency transportation in youth considerably increased during COVID 19 after the end of the first state of emergency declaration in Japan. This pandemic's impact varied among sex and region, appearing most prominently in young females. Rapid accumulation of suicidal/self-harm emergency transportation incidences may serve as an early warning sign for mental health problems and suicidality in Japan.

TI  - Video case review for quality improvement during cardiac arrest resuscitation in the emergency department
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are a leading global cause of mortality. The American Heart Association (AHA) promotes several important strategies associated with improved cardiac arrest (CA) outcomes, including decreasing pulse check time and maintaining a chest compression fraction (CCF) > 0.80. Video review is a potential tool to improve skills and analyse deficiencies in various situations; however, its use in improving medical resuscitation remains poorly studied in the emergency department (ED). We implemented a quality improvement initiative, which utilised video review of CA resuscitations in an effort to improve compliance with such AHA quality metrics. Methods A cardiopulmonary resuscitation video review team of emergency medicine residents were assembled to analyse CA resuscitations in our urban academic ED. Videos were reviewed by two residents, one of whom was a senior resident (Postgraduate Year 3 or 4), and analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for numerous quality improvement metrics, including pulse check time, CCF, time to intravenous access and time to patient attached to monitor. Results We collected data on 94 CA resuscitations between July 2017 and June 2020. Average pulse check time was 13.09 (SD +/- 5.97) seconds, and 38% of pulse checks were <10 seconds. After the implementation of the video review process, there was a significant decrease in average pulse check time (P = .01) and a significant increase in CCF (P = .01) throughout the study period. Conclusions Our study suggests that the video review and feedback process was significantly associated with improvements in AHA quality metrics for resuscitation in CA amongst patients presented to the ED.

TI  - Hydrocephalus-induced neurogenic stunned myocardium and cardiac arrest in a child: completely reversed with CSF diversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB  - Neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM) is a potentially fatal cause of sudden cardiogenic dysfunction due to an acute neurological event, most commonly aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in adults. Only two pediatric cases of hydrocephalus-induced NSM have been reported. Here the authors report a third case in a 14-year-old boy who presented with severe headache, decreased level of consciousness, and shock in the context of acute hydrocephalus secondary to fourth ventricular outlet obstruction 3 years after standard-risk medulloblastoma treatment. He was initially stabilized with the insertion of an external ventricular drain and vasopressor treatment. He had a profoundly reduced cardiac contractility and became asystolic for 1 minute, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation when vasopressors were inadvertently discontinued. Over 1 week, his ventricles decreased in size and his cardiac function returned to normal. All other causes of heart failure were ruled out, and his impressive response to CSF diversion clarified the diagnosis of NSM secondary to hydrocephalus. He was unable to be weaned from his drain during his time in the hospital, so he underwent an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and has remained well with normal cardiac function at more than 6 months' follow-up. This case highlights the importance of prompt CSF diversion and cardiac support for acute hydrocephalus presenting with heart failure in the pediatric population.

TI  - Background EEG Suppression Ratio for Early Detection of Cerebral Injury in Pediatric Cardiac Arrest
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Our objective was to assess the utility of the 1-h suppression ratio (SR) as a biomarker of cerebral injury and neurologic prognosis after cardiac arrest (CA) in the pediatric hospital setting. Methods: Prospectively, we reviewed data from children presenting after CA and monitored by continuous electroencephalography (cEEG). Patients aged 1 month to 21 years were included. The SR, a quantitative measure of low-voltage cEEG (<= 3 mu V) content, was dichotomized as present or absent if there was > 0% suppression for one continuous hour. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed including age, sex, type of CA (i.e., in-hospital or out-of-hospital), and the presence of SR as a predictor of global anoxic cerebral injury as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: We included 84 patients with a median age of 4 years (interquartile range 0.9-13), 64% were male, and 49% (41/84) had in-hospital CA. Cerebral injury was seen in 50% of patients, of whom 65% had global injury. One-hour SR presence, independent of amount, predicted cerebral injury with 81% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) (66-91%) and 98% specificity (95% CI 88-100%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that SR was a significant predictor of both cerebral injury (beta = 6.28, p < 0.001) and mortality (beta = 3.56, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The SR a sensitive and specific marker of anoxic brain injury and post-CA mortality in the pediatric population. Once detected in the post-CA setting, the 1-h SR may be a useful threshold finding for deployment of early neuroprotective strategies prior or for prompting diagnostic neuroimaging.

TI  - Videoscopic Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation for Patients With Recurrent Ventricular Fibrillation/Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Syndromes Besides Congenital Long-QT Syndrome
T2  - CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Background-Treatment options for patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias refractory to pharmacotherapy and ablation are minimal. Although left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) is well established in long-QT syndrome, its role in non-long-QT syndrome arrhythmogenic channelopathies and cardiomyopathies is less clear. Here, we report our single-center experience in performing LCSD in this setting.
   Methods and Results-In this institutional review board-approved study, we retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients (N=91) who had videoscopic LCSD at our institution from 2005 to 2011. Data were analyzed for the subset (n=27) who were denervated for an underlying diagnosis other than autosomal dominant or sporadic long-QT syndrome. The spectrum of arrhythmogenic disease included catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (n=13), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (n=5), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (n=4), left ventricular noncompaction (n=2), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=1), ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=1), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (n=1). Five patients had LCSD because of high-risk assessment and beta-blocker intolerance, none of whom had a sentinel breakthrough cardiac event at early follow-up. Among the remaining 22 previously symptomatic patients who had LCSD as secondary prevention, all had an attenuation in cardiac events, with 18 having no breakthrough cardiac events so far and 4 having experienced >= 1 post-LCSD breakthrough cardiac event.
   Conclusions-LCSD may represent a substrate-independent antifibrillatory treatment option for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia syndromes other than long-QT syndrome. The early follow-up seems promising, with a marked reduction in the frequency of cardiac events postdenervation. (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol. 2012;5:782-788.)

TI  - Metabolic resuscitation in pediatric sepsis: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - Sepsis, defined as infection with associated organ dysfunction, accounts for most childhood deaths due to infection globally. Evidence for the optimal support of children with septic shock refractory to the initial sepsis management bundle remains minimal. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions. Administration of hydrocortisone in children with septic shock might fasten shock resolution, and has been shown to dampen the systemic host immune response, augment adrenergic effects, and support the stress response. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is one of the most powerful naturally occurring antioxidants and has beneficial effects on multiple pathways which are severely deranged during septic shock. A regimen combining hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine termed "metabolic resuscitation" or "HAT therapy" has been tested in large trials in critically ill adults with sepsis with conflicting results. Available information on intravenous ascorbic acid indicates an excellent safety profile even at very high doses both in adults and children. Given the pharmacological properties and beneficial effects shown both in vitro and in animal studies, and its safety profile, ascorbic acid either as a single therapy or as part of HAT treatment represents a promising candidate for future pediatric sepsis treatments. While pediatric age groups may be more susceptible to ascorbic acid deficiency during sepsis, there is a lack of high-quality trial data on HAT therapy in this age group. A single centre retrospective study identified potential for mortality benefit in children with septic shock, and the results from a randomized controlled pilot trial are being awaited. It is imperative for pediatric research on ascorbic acid and HAT in children with sepsis to critically investigate key questions related to pharmacology, dosing, timing, feasibility, safety, effects on short-and long-term outcomes, and generalisability in view of the global burden of sepsis.

TI  - Inadvertent ligation of pulmonary artery during surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus in two cats
T2  - JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY OPEN REPORTS
AB  - Case series summary An 8.5-month-old female British Shorthair (case 1) and a 2-month-old female domestic shorthair (case 2) were referred for dyspnoea and lethargy. Echocardiography was compatible with unrestrictive patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with continuous left-to-right shunting and concomitant iso-systemic pulmonary hypertension (PH) (case 1) and restrictive PDA with mild PH (case 2). Radiography showed cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings and diffuse interstitial-alveolar pattern consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF) in both cats. After testing for pulmonary vascular reactivity (case 1) and treatment for acute CHF (case 2), surgical ligation of the PDA was attempted. In case 1, PDA ligation led to severe hypotension and asystole, prompting loosening of the ligature because of suspected intolerance to PDA closure. Cardiac massage was initiated and successfully restored the sinus rhythm. The procedure was aborted after partial PDA attenuation. Postoperative echocardiography raised suspicion of pulmonary artery ligation and supra-systemic right ventricle. No surgical revision was performed as the cat remained clinically stable; however, she died 10 days after surgery. In case 2, severe bradycardia developed 20 mins after duct ligation, followed by cardiorespiratory arrest unresponsive to resuscitation. Anatomopathological examination revealed main pulmonary artery and PDA ligation (case 1), and complete left pulmonary artery (LPA) ligation (case 2).Relevance and novel information Inadvertent ligation of the pulmonary artery has been reported in human medicine, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in cats. Prompt recognition and correction of such errors are critical for a favourable immediate perioperative outcome and improved long-term prognosis.

TI  - Surgical management of lumbosacral and sacral fractures: roles of the pelvic and spinal surgeons
T2  - EFORT OPEN REVIEWS
AB  - . In young patients, lumbosacral fractures result primarily from high-energy traumas. Life-threatening lesions (e.g. visceral organs) are frequently associated with these fractures. Management consists of medical intensive care for adequate resuscitation and specialized surgical input.
   . Lumbosacral junction represents a frontier between the spine and pelvic ring. Any injury in this area implies a thorough examination of both spine and pelvis through clinical examinations and CT scans. Patients must be assessed specifically for neurological and bladder/bowel symptoms. Several surgical classifications may be required to describe the entire fracture pattern.
   . In unstable fracture with large displacements, definitive surgical fixation is often recommended. Various pelvic and spine surgery techniques can be used depending on the fracture pattern, surgeon's experience, and available equipment. The use of intraoperative navigation may enhance placement of instrumentation, especially in cases of complex fractures, percutaneous fixations, and/or atypical patients' anatomy.
   . The fracture itself can cause debilitating complications with long-term consequences such as pain, neurological deficits, and bladder/bowel impairments. Wound infection remains the most common postoperative complication and prominent posterior instrumentation is frequently a source of pain. Irrespective of the treatment, leg discrepancy can be problematic in the case of malunion.
   . Management of lumbosacral fractures requires a thorough understanding of both lumbar spine and pelvic injuries. Surgical treatment may involve a combination of spine and pelvic surgery techniques. Therefore, this implies for the surgeon to be trained specifically for these fractures, or else a close cooperation between the pelvic surgeon and the spine surgeon in managing the patients.

TI  - Association between a quantitative CT scan measure of brain edema and outcome after cardiac arrest
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Background: Cerebral edema is one physical change associated with brain injury and decreased survival after cardiac arrest. Edema appears on computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain as decreased Xray attenuation by gray matter. This study tested whether the gray matter attenuation to white matter attenuation ratio (GWR) was associated with survival and functional recovery.
   Methods: Subjects were patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest at a single institution between 1/1/2005 and 7/30/2010. Subjects were included if they had non-traumatic cardiac arrest and a non-contrast CT scan within 24 h after cardiac arrest. Attenuation (Hounsfield Units) was measured in gray matter (caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, and cortex) and in white matter (internal capsule, corpus callosum and centrum semiovale). The GWR was calculated for basal ganglia and cerebrum. Outcomes included survival and functional status at hospital discharge.
   Results: For 680 patients, 258 CT scans were available, but 18 were excluded because of hemorrhage (10), intravenous contrast (3) or technical artifact (5), leaving 240 CT scans for analysis. Lower GWR values were associated with lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale motor score. Overall survival was 36%, but decreased with decreasing GWR. The average of basal ganglia and cerebrum GWR provided the best discrimination. Only 2/58 subjects with average GWR < 1.20 survived and both were treated with hypothermia. The association of GWR with functional outcome was completely explained by mortality when GWR < 1.20.
   Conclusions: Subjects with severe cerebral edema, defined by GWR < 1.20, have very low survival with conventional care, including hypothermia. GWR estimates pre-treatment likelihood of survival after cardiac arrest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance improves medical students' adherence to guidelines in simulated cardiac arrest A randomised cross-over study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUNDThe 2010 Resuscitation Guidelines require high-quality chest compression and rapid defibrillation for patients with ventricular fibrillation with rhythm analysis and defibrillation repeated every 2min. A lack of adherence to the guidelines by medical students was observed during simulated resuscitation training.OBJECTIVESTo assess whether real-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance, including an audiovisual countdown timer, a metronome, a display of the chest compression quality and voice prompts, might improve adherence to the guidelines by medical students.DESIGNRandomised cross-over simulation study.SETTINGStudienhospital Munster, Faculty of Medicine University Munster, GermanyPARTICIPANTSOne hundred and forty-one medical students (fifth year) in 47 teams.INTERVENTIONSimulated resuscitation with and without real-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe preshock pause, postshock pause, fraction of time without chest compression and defibrillation intervals. Observed quality parameters were chest compression depth and chest compression rate.RESULTSWith real-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance, there were improved mean (SD) chest compression rates (1058 vs. 121 +/- 12bpm; P<0.005), fewer inappropriate shock intervals [median (interquartile range) 0 (1 to 5) vs. 4 (1 to 7); P<0.005], a smaller fraction of time without chest compression (18.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 22.5 +/- 7.0%; P<0.005) and shorter postshock pauses (2.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2s; P<0.005).CONCLUSIONReal-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance significantly increased adherence to the guidelines by medical students treating simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Using a simple tool such as a countdown timer makes it possible to reduce the number of inappropriate shock intervals and time without chest compression.

TI  - Clinical Effectiveness of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Prediction Model for Cardiac Arrest in General Ward-Admitted Patients: A Non-Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Background: Ward patients who experience clinical deterioration are at high risk of mortality. Conventional rapid response systems (RRS) using track-and-trigger protocols have not consistently demonstrated improved outcomes. This study evaluated the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based cardiac arrest prediction model. Methods: This 1-year, prospective, non-randomized interventional trial assigned hospitalized patients with AI-based software as a medical device (AI-SaMD) high-risk alerts to groups based on their subsequent clinical response; those reassessed or treated within 24 h comprised the AI-SaMD-guided cohort, while the remainder formed the usual care cohort. Alerts prompted an optional but not mandatory treatment review. The primary outcome was ward-based cardiac arrest; the secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders. Results: Of 35,627 general ward admissions, 2906 triggered an AI-SaMD alert. Among these, 1409 (48.4%) were allocated to the AI-SaMD-guided cohort. The incidence of cardiac arrest significantly decreased from 2.07% to 1.06% (adjusted risk ratio (RR), 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.88; p < 0.01). In-hospital mortality also significantly declined (adjusted RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; p < 0.05). Conclusions: AI-SaMD-guided alerts were associated with reductions in cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality without requiring additional resources, supporting their integration into current clinical workflows to improve patient safety and optimize RRS performance.

TI  - Survival and functional outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the intensive care unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Purpose: Comparatively less is known about the outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with those not in an ICU. In this study, we evaluated survival rates, functional status, and predictors of good outcomes after in-ICU CPR.
   Methods: We used the Project IMPACT (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Mo) database to conduct a retrospective cohort study of adults who underwent in-ICU CPR in the United States from 2001 to 2008. We characterized survival rates and functional outcomes and identified predictors of better prognosis using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Of 362 074 ICU admissions, 6518 (1.8%) received in-ICU CPR with 15.7% (n = 1025) surviving to hospital discharge. Survival decreased with age, more comorbidities, and for certain admitting diagnoses, such as sepsis. Patients who survived incurred significant functional morbidity. Of survivors, only 33.6% were discharged home, and only 20.1% were functionally independent on hospital discharge. A total of 63.4% had a decrease in functional status compared with admission. Only 3.3% of all patients (21.7% of survivors) were both functionally independent and discharged home (" optimal" functional outcome). Among survivors, the risk-adjusted odds of having an optimal functional outcome decreased with age (P <= .022) and with failure of 3 or more organs during ICU stay (P = .006).
   Conclusions: Only 1 of 6 adults receiving in-ICU CPR survives to hospital discharge, and less than 5% are discharged home with independent function. Among survivors, most show large decreases in functional status compared with hospital admission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wait a Minute or More (WAMM): a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomised implementation trial assessing the effect of a quality improvement programme on the proportion of infants achieving delayed cord clamping more than 60 s in infants <37 weeks' gestation in up to 20 maternity hospitals
T2  - BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN
AB  - Introduction Delayed cord clamping (DCC) is an evidence-based intervention that reduces mortality, anaemia and disability in infants born <37 weeks' gestation who do not require immediate resuscitation. However, it is neither reliably recorded nor routinely implemented in Australia. The Wait a Minute or More (WAMM) study aims to reduce this gap between the evidence and practice by integrating timely sharing of cord clamping data with Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality methods to increase the proportion of preterm infants receiving DCC for 60 s or longer (DCC60). Methods The WAMM study is a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT), informed by the Integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. Up to 20 Australian maternity hospitals will participate in this pragmatic SW-CRT to evaluate if in (Population) infants <37 weeks' gestation who do not need resuscitation, does (Intervention) the WAMM intervention (sharing of anonymised data on DCC60, together with a locally adapted quality improvement (QI) programme), compared with (Control) sharing of anonymised data on DCC60 alone, increase (primary Outcome) the proportion of infants receiving DCC60? At the end of 72 weeks, all sites will complete an 8-week period without the WAMM intervention to evaluate if implementation of DCC is sustained. Alongside the SW-CRT, an embedded process evaluation will assess the fidelity, acceptability, mechanisms of action and contextual barriers and enablers of the WAMM intervention. Discussion Using the stepped wedged design and guided by an explicit implementation framework (i-PARIHS), WAMM will provide information on the effectiveness and transferability of a locally adapted QI method to improve DCC60. If proven effective, ultimately scaling up the WAMM intervention globally will greatly improve childhood anaemia, death, disability and long-term costs.Trial registration number ACTRN12624000035527.

TI  - Reactionary hemorrhage in gynecological surgery
T2  - JSLS-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC SURGEONS
AB  - Background: Bleeding is a major complication in contemporary gynecological surgery. We discusses this rare, albeit potentially serious, unexpected complication. The authors mean by "reactionary," hemorrhage that occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery. More or less, all gynecological surgeons have had to deal with this situation at some stage of their career. The seriousness of this complication stems from the fact that often the surgeon is no in the immediate vicinity to promptly step in and treat the patient. Neverthless, the key to successful management is prompt diagnosis, immediate resuscitation, and operative intervention.
   Methods: By using the collective hospital database, we reviewed 719 patient records. The authors operated on these patients between November 1990 and March 2007 (inclusive) in one hospital, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, the main teaching hospital in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The procedures performed in the 719 patients comprised 476 vaginal hysterectomies and 243 laparoscopic hysterectomies. Both public and private patients were included. The objective of the review was to establish the incidence of postoperative reactionary hemorrhage following the initial operation, as defined by the number of patients returning to the operating theatre (OT) because of postoperative hemorrhage within 24 hours of the initial hysterectomy.
   Results: Of the 719 patients, 6 experienced reactionary postoperative hemorrhage, 3 each in the vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopic hysterectomy groups. That would make the incidence of postoperative reactionary hemorrhage 0.6% in the vaginal hysterectomy and 1.2% in the laparoscopic hysterectomy group. None of these 6 patients had any preoperative hemorrhagica diatheses. There was neither ureteric, bladder, intestinal, nor any other injuries in the whole series. No long-term complications or mortalities occurred.
   Conclusion: Reactionary postoperative hemorrhage is a rare, albeit serious, complication of contemporary gynecological surgery; this complication may occur despite meticulous surgical technique. The key to successful management is prompt diagnosis, urgent resuscitation, and return to the OT to arrest the bleeding.

TI  - The effect of dapagliflozin on ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or sudden death in people with heart failure: a tick in another box for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Introduction Despite the progress made in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in recent years, the prognosis of the disease remains poor, with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) contributing significantly to increased mortality. Areas covered A recently published post hoc analysis of the DAPA-HF trial evaluated the effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) dapagliflozin versus placebo on the incidence of VA, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death among people with HFrEF. During a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the composite primary outcome occurred in 140 (5.9%) people who received dapagliflozin compared to 175 (7.4%) participants in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.79; 95 confidence interval 0.63-0.99, P = 0.037). Animal studies suggest that SGLT2i could ameliorate the deleterious effects of myocardial injury, through various mechanisms, including reduced sympathetic activity, improved oxidative stress, tissue oxygenation, autophagy, heart energy metabolism, and promotion of cardiac remodeling. Expert opinion Taken together, the above findings indicate a place for SGLT2i in future trials investigating novel treatments to improve survival in patients with acute cardiovascular episodes. This is primarily applicable for acute decompensated HF; however, their use could also be evaluated in other conditions that induce VA, such as acute coronary syndromes.

TI  - Emerging applications of nanotechnology for the diagnosis and management of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-NANOMEDICINE AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - An estimated 16 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease (CAD), and approximately 325,000 people die annually from cardiac arrest. About two-thirds of unexpected cardiac deaths occur without prior recognition of cardiac disease. A vast majority of these deaths are attributable to the rupture of 'vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques'. Clinically, plaque vulnerability is typically assessed through imaging techniques, and ruptured plaques leading to acute myocardial infarction are treated through angioplasty or stenting. Despite significant advances, it is clear that current imaging methods are insufficiently capable for elucidating plaque composition-which is a key determinant of vulnerability. Further, the exciting improvement in the treatment of CAD afforded by stenting procedures has been buffered by significant undesirable host-implant effects, including restenosis and late thrombosis. Nanotechnology has led to some potential solutions to these problems by yielding constructs that interface with plaque cellular components at an unprecedented size scale. By leveraging the innate ability of macrophages to phagocytose nanoparticles, contrast agents can now be targeted to plaque inflammatory activity. Improvements in nano-patterning procedures have now led to increased ability to regenerate tissue isotropy directly on stents, enabling gradual regeneration of normal, physiologic vascular structures. Advancements in immunoassay technologies promise lower costs for biomarker measurements, and in the near future, may enable the addition of routine blood testing to the clinician's toolbox-decreasing the costs of atherosclerosis-related medical care. These are merely three examples among many stories of how nanotechnology continues to promise advances in the diagnosis and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.

AB  - During cardiac surgery or cardiac transplantation, the heart is subjected to varying periods of global ischemia. The heart must be protected during this ischemic period to avoid additional injury, and techniques have been developed that delay ischemic injury and minimize reperfusion injury. Almost universally, this involves using a hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution and these solutions have become the gold standard for myocardial protection for more than 20 years. Despite the extensive and continued research aimed at improving these basic hyperkalemic cardioplegic solutions, patients undergoing surgery almost invariably experience some degree of postoperative dysfunction. It is likely that this relates to the depolarizing nature of hyperkalemic solutions, which results in ionic imbalance caused by continuing transmembrane fluxes and the consequent maintenance of high energy phosphate metabolism, even during hypothermic ischemia. A potentially beneficial alternative to hyperkalemic cardioplegia is to arrest the heart in a "hyperpolarized" or "polarized" state, which maintains the membrane potential of the arrested myocardium at or near to the resting membrane potential. At these potentials, transmembrane fluxes will be minimized and there should be little metabolic demand, resulting in improved myocardial protection. Recent studies have explored these alternative concepts for myocardial protection. The use of compounds such as adenosine or potassium channel openers, which are thought to induce hyperpolarized arrest, have demonstrated improved protection after normothermis or short periods of hypothermic ischemia when compared to hyperkalemic (depolarized) arrest. Similarly, studies from our own laboratory, in which the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, was used to induce polarized arrest (demonstrated by direct measurement of membrane potential during ischemia) was also shown to provide better recovery of function after 5 hours of long-term hypothermic (7.5 degrees C) storage. These promising initial studies need to be consolidated before experimental promise becomes clinical reality. (C) 1999 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

TI  - AMBULATORY ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS AT THE TIME OF FATAL CARDIAC-ARREST
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The relation between arrhythmias at cardiac arrest and the outcome of arrest is poorly understood. The Holter monitor tracings of 13 patients were reviewed after they sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. All had a prior cardiac arrest or cardiac syncope. Twelve patients had ventricular tachycardia (VT) as their initial arrest arrhythmia and 1 patient had bradycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation (VF). VT degenerated to VF in 10 to 12  patients after a mean interval of 96 .+-. 31 seconds (.+-. standard error of the mean). The number of VT runs increased significantly during the hour immediately preceding arrest (p = 0.004). Despite prompt resuscitation efforts in 12 patients, only 6 survived. The 6 survivors and 6 nonsurvivors were not different with regard to age, ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery narrowing and time to first defibrillation. However, degeneration to VF within 30 seconds of arrest (5 of 6 nonsurvivors  and 1 of 6 survivors, p = 0.04) and a slower rate of VT at the onset of arrest (166 beats/min in nonsurvivors and 227 beats/min in survivors, p = 0.02) were associated with unsuccessful resuscitation.

TI  - Pharmaco-proteomics opportunities for individualizing neurovascular treatment
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Neurovascular disease often involves multi-organ system injury. For example, patent foramen ovale (PFO) related ischemic strokes involve not just the brain, but also the heart, the lung, and the peripheral vascular circulation. For higher-risk but high-reward systemic therapy (e.g., thrombolytics, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), PFO closure) to be implemented safely, very careful patient selection and close monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy are imperative. For example, more than a decade after the approval of therapeutic hypothermic and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, they both remain extremely underutilized, in part due to lack of clinical tools for patient selection or to follow therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, in understanding the complexity of the global effects of clinical neurovascular diseases and their therapies, a systemic approach may offer a unique perspective and provide tools with clinical utility. Clinical proteomic approaches may be promising to monitor systemic changes in complex multi-organ diseases - especially where the disease process can be 'sampled' in clinically accessible fluids such as blood, urine, and CSF. Here, we describe a 'pharmaco-proteomic' approach to three major challenges in translational neurovascular research directly at bedside - in order to better stratify risk, widen therapeutic windows, and explore novel targets to be validated at the bench - (i) thrombolytic treatment for ischemic stroke, (ii) therapeutic hypothermia for post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and (iii) treatment for PFO related paradoxical embolic stroke. In the future, this clinical proteomics approach may help to improve patient selection, ensure more precise clinical phenotyping for clinical trials, and individualize patient treatment.

TI  - Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation induces a neuroprotective phenotype in activated microglia and improves neuronal survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) causes hippocampal neuronal death that frequently leads to severe loss of memory function in survivors. No specific treatment is available to reduce neuronal death and improve functional outcome. The brain's inflammatory response to ischemia can exacerbate injury and provides a potential treatment target. We hypothesized that microglia are activated by CA and contribute to neuronal loss. We used a mouse model to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of the proinflammatory microglial enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) after CA alters microglial activation and neuronal death. The sEH inhibitor 4-phenylchalcone oxide (4-PCO) was administered after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The 4-PCO treatment significantly reduced neuronal death and improved memory function after CA/CPR. We found early activation of microglia and increased expression of inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta in the hippocampus after CA/CPR, which was unchanged after 4-PCO treatment, while expression of antiinflammatory IL-10 increased significantly. We conclude that sEH inhibition after CA/CPR can alter the transcription profile in activated microglia to selectively induce antiinflammatory and neuroprotective IL-10 and reduce subsequent neuronal death. Switching microglial gene expression toward a neuroprotective phenotype is a promising new therapeutic approach for ischemic brain injury.

TI  - Sports and Exercise Cardiology in the United States Cardiovascular Specialists as Members of the Athlete Healthcare Team
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - In recent years, athletic participation has more than doubled in all major demographic groups, while simultaneously, children and adults with established heart disease desire participation in sports and exercise. Despite conferring favorable long-term effects on well-being and survival, exercise can be associated with risk of adverse events in the short term. Complex individual cardiovascular (CV) demands and adaptations imposed by exercise present distinct challenges to the cardiologist asked to evaluate athletes. Here, we describe the evolution of sports and exercise cardiology as a unique discipline within the continuum of CV specialties, provide the rationale for tailoring of CV care to athletes and exercising individuals, define the role of the CV specialist within the athlete care team, and lay the foundation for the development of Sports and Exercise Cardiology in the United States. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology launched the Section of Sports and Exercise Cardiology. Membership has grown from 150 to over 4,000 members in just 2 short years, indicating marked interest from the CV community to advance the integration of sports and exercise cardiology into mainstream CV care. Although the current athlete CV care model has distinct limitations, here, we have outlined a new paradigm of care for the American athlete and exercising individual. By practicing and promoting this new paradigm, we believe we will enhance the CV care of athletes of all ages, and serve the greater athletic community and our nation as a whole, by allowing safest participation in sports and physical activity for all individuals who seek this lifestyle.

TI  - A Systematic Review on Outcomes of Patients with Heatstroke and Heat Exhaustion
T2  - OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Heatstroke (HS) is a severe form of heat-related illness (HRI) associated with high morbidity and mortality, representing a condition that includes long-term multiorgan dysfunction and susceptibility to further heat illness. Methods: In a systematic review searching Medline PubMed from the studies conducted between 2009 and 2020, 16 papers were identified. Results: A hallmark symptom of heat stroke is CNS dysfunction (a hallmark sign of HS) which manifests as mental status changes, including agitation, delirium, epilepsy, or coma at the time of the collapse. Acute kidney injury (AKI), gut ischemia, blood clots in the stomach and small intestine, cytoplasmic protein clumps in the spleen, and injury of skeletal muscle (rhabdomyolysis) are all characteristics of peripheral tissue damage. Severe heat stroke tends to be complicated by rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients with exertional heat stroke. Rhabdomyolysis may lead to systemic effects, including the local occurrence of compartment syndrome, hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, and/or lethal disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Untreated heat stroke might exacerbate psychosis, lactic acidosis, consumptive coagulopathy, hematuria, pulmonary edema, renal failure, and other metabolic abnormalities. Core body temperature and level of consciousness are the most significant indicators to diagnose the severity of heat stroke and prevent unfavorable consequences. Heatstroke is a life-threatening illness if not promptly recognized and effectively treated. Discussion: This review highlighted that core body temperature and white blood cell count are significant contributing factors affecting heat stroke outcomes. Other factors contributing to the poor outcome include old age, low GCS, and prolonged hospital stay. The prevalence of both classic and exertional heatstroke can be reduced by certain simple preventive measures, such as avoiding strenuous activity in hot environments and reducing exposure to heat stress.
