AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in young athletes and a rare but devastating event in youth, often caused by undiagnosed structural cardiac anomalies, cardiomyopathies, or heritable channelopathies. Early detection, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are critical for improving survival and neurological outcomes. Contributions to Practice: Grassroots organizations like Project ADAM, founded in 1999 at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, have been instrumental in raising awareness and guiding schools and communities in developing cardiac emergency response plans (CERPs) over the past two decades. Project ADAM was successfully implemented within Miami‐Dade County Public Schools. In under 2 years, 100% of schools in the district achieved Heart Safe School recognition, with eight cardiac arrest incidents reported on Project ADAM‐affiliated campuses. Seven victims survived without neurological impairment due to the prompt activation of Cardiac Emergency Response Teams (CERT). Implications for School Health Policy, Practice, and Equity: Annual implementation of CERPs, including hands‐on, in‐person drills supported by school administrators, can significantly improve survival rates during cardiac emergencies. Conclusions: The successful implementation of Project ADAM within Miami‐Dade County Public Schools highlights the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, strategic planning, and ongoing education to overcome challenges and ensure long‐term program sustainability.

AB  - Heart disease at an early or middle age is critical, especially when accompanied by an acute cardiac event with or without sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Owing to this situation, patients describe changes in their health-related quality of life as well as in their future plans and goals. This study examined changes in ideas of a good life due to heart disease treated in an acute hospital. In our study, 16 patients aged 30–59 years were included. Among them, four had SCA, seven myocardial infarction, and five other serious cardiac conditions, such as cardiac arrhythmia. Advanced chronic heart failure was noted in five, and four had implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Phenomenological semi-structured interviews of 50–100 min each were conducted with a purposive sample and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The ideas of a good life and changes in future lifestyle following a serious heart disease were reported by patients. These experiences were summarized into five superordinate themes: "My bodily trust is gone," "Simply living a modest life," "Actively shaping my life again," "Being more in contact with relevant people," and "Grateful for the gift of my new life." Living a more modest life and actively shaping life again are two new aspects of the ideas of a good life. Further studies should be conducted in cardiac patients with lower disease burden and young patients with congenital heart disease, with a focus on sex-specific issues.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence of suicide and fatal overdose, and the morbidity associated with these forms of bereavement, little is known about the loss-related needs of adults bereaved by these two causes, including whether survivors' needs differ from those losing significant persons to other forms of sudden death and how these needs may relate to psychiatric symptomatology. Using a newly validated measure (the Sudden Bereavement Needs Inventory) and an online survey design, the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of adults (N = 403) who have experienced the suicide or fatal overdose of a close other within the past five years, to compare these needs with those of individuals bereaved by a sudden natural death, and to explore how the importance of specific need categories relates to psychiatric symptomatology. Results showed great overlap between adults bereaved by suicide and fatal overdose across all bereavement need categories, with notable differences between these two groups and those bereaved by a sudden-natural loss (e.g., cardiac arrest). Further, among the suicide and overdose bereaved, the self-rated importance of specific need categories accounted for much of the variation in symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression, with relational needs and meaning-based needs emerging as most strongly related to psychiatric symptoms. Study results may suggest the importance of addressing specific needs in therapy among overdose and suicide bereaved individuals to promote adaptive outcomes.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the serum glucose/potassium ratio (GPR) for sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day mortality in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest in the emergency department (ED) were included. Routine laboratory parameters were obtained from the first blood sample collected during CPR in the ED. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated by dividing the absolute number of neutrophils and platelets, respectively, by the absolute number of lymphocytes. The GPR was calculated as serum glucose divided by potassium levels. Results: The 30-day mortality rate was 82.2% (n = 291). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified lactate, NLR, PLR and GPR as independent predictors of mortality. Among these markers, lactate exhibited the highest predictive power for mortality, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.817, compared to NLR (AUC: 0.676), PLR (AUC: 0.679) and GPR (AUC: 0.688). The optimal cut-off values for predicting mortality were 7.83 for lactate (sensitivity: 75.3%, specificity: 89.4%), 1.68 for NLR (sensitivity: 78.8%, specificity: 71.7%), 199.26 for PLR (sensitivity: 76.4%, specificity: 92.3%) and 57.81 for GPR (sensitivity: 71.8%, specificity: 84.1%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that GPR is a promising prognostic marker for predicting mortality in patients with IHCA.

AB  - Background: Women are less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) compared to men. This study aims to identify the factors influencing the willingness to perform CPR on women, providing insights to improve training and public awareness. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among medical and non-medical populations in southeastern China. The questionnaire assessed demographics, CPR training experience, and attitudes toward gender-related CPR concerns. A total of 450 responses were collected, with 433 valid responses included after quality control. Statistical analyses were performed using R4.3.2 to evaluate the impact of gender, age, occupation, and education on CPR willingness. Results: Women exhibited a higher willingness to perform CPR on female victims compared to men. Many male respondents hesitated due to concerns about physical contact, particularly regarding removing clothing during resuscitation. Younger individuals (18-35 and 36-50 years) showed greater willingness to provide CPR than older respondents (51-75 years), who were more cautious due to privacy concerns and traditional beliefs. Healthcare professionals and non-medical workers were more likely to perform CPR than medical students, who, despite receiving CPR training, expressed hesitation due to a lack of confidence and practical experience. Higher education levels were associated with increased willingness to perform CPR on women, with postgraduate respondents being the most willing. Additionally, most participants had never practiced on female CPR mannequins, despite widespread support-especially among women-for incorporating female models into training. Conclusion: The lower likelihood of women receiving CPR is influenced by gender bias, societal norms, and training limitations. Addressing this issue requires public education to eliminate gender-based hesitation, improvements in CPR training programs to include female mannequins, and enhanced legal protections to reduce rescuer concerns. These measures can be combined with other key factors such as community-wide CPR training programs and increasing the availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to help promote equity in access to life-saving interventions. Targeted interventions can promote gender equity in emergency response, ultimately improving survival outcomes for women.

AB  - Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) remains a significant challenge, marked by high mortality and disability rates due to persistent neuroinflammation. This study explored the neuroprotective potential of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LITUS) in mitigating brain damage after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using a murine model and in vitro assays. LITUS treatment improved 24-h survival rates and neurological recovery in cardiac arrest (CA) mice, as evidenced by behavioral assessments and reduced neurological deficit scores. Proteomic analyses revealed modulation of Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, characterized by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that LITUS enhanced Piezo1 and Dkk3 activation, promoting calcium influx and anti-inflammatory responses. The Piezo1 antagonist GsMTx4 abrogated these effects, underscoring Piezo1’s specific role. Additionally, in vitro experiments using oxygen/glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated BV2 microglial cells confirmed that LITUS reduced inflammatory responses and enhanced cellular recovery via the Piezo1-Dkk3 axis. These findings highlight LITUS as a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy to ameliorate PCABI by modulating neuroinflammation through the Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt pathway. This work provides a basis for translational research and potential clinical applications in improving outcomes for CPR survivors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of global mortality, for which timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical intervention. However, public competence in CPR remains low. Grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study investigated the factors influencing CPR implementation among college freshmen by examining their behavioral intention. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among college freshmen undergoing a basic entrance physical health screening at Fuzhou First General Hospital between September 2 and 9, 2024. Participants were randomly selected to complete an electronic questionnaire, which included a general information sheet and the validated Public Behavior Intention Scale for Performing CPR, adapted with input from emergency medicine experts. Statistical analyses included correlation, regression, and mediation analysis. Results: Among 4,929 valid questionnaires analyzed, a higher willingness to perform CPR was associated with undergraduate enrollment, good personal and family health status, prior CPR performance, and no history of transient loss of consciousness. Multiple linear regression identified behavioral attitude (β = 0.439), subjective norm (β = 0.272), CPR knowledge (β = 0.027), and perceived behavioral control (β = 0.070) as significant predictors of CPR behavioral intention (all <i>P</i> < 0.01). Mediation analysis further revealed that CPR knowledge influenced behavioral intention primarily through its effects on behavioral attitude (79.43% of the total effect), subjective norm (61.31%), and perceived behavioral control (43.67%). Conclusion: Behavioral attitude serves as the principal pathway through which CPR knowledge translates into intention to act. These findings underscore that targeted CPR training in universities should address both knowledge and psychosocial factors to strengthen students' willingness to act.

AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest constitutes a critical medical emergency necessitating swift intervention to reinstate normal heart rhythm and prevent harm to vital organs. The pivotal role of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in influencing survival rates is well recognized. With older adults being the most common group to witness such events, it's curcial to understand their attitudes and knowledge about performing CPR. Additionally, understanding if health status has an influence can help in tailoring education for specific seniors needs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was sent to University of the Third Age (UTA) students. The survey comprised sections focusing on demographic data, CPR knowledge, automated external defibrillator (AED) knowledge, first aid training, and readiness to perform CPR and use AEDs. Participants' health conditions were also assessed through multiple-choice options. Results: We received 456 responses. Significant awareness of emergency numbers and cardiac arrest recognition was revealed. However, knowledge gaps persisted, particularly in compression rates. Most participants comprehended AED usage, yet training primarily relied on theoretical approaches. Health conditions notably affected CPR readiness, with associations between specific chronic diseases and willingness to perform CPR. Conclusions: Addressing knowledge gaps and tailoring education for elderly needs are crucial for improving survival rates. Future research should explore barriers to bystander CPR during out-of-hospital cardiac arrests to further enhance survival prospects.

AB  - The health status of long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was studied six months after the event. Although Sickness Impact Profile scores for arrest survivors were higher (worse) than scores of enrollees in a prepaid closed panel health plan, in most cases problems of survivors were not incapacitating. Approximately three-fifths of survivors reported same or better memory function and stair climbing ability compared to that at time of arrest. Three-fifths of those who had been working continued to do so.

AB  - Introduction: Different organizations have recommended changes in life support in the COVID-19 pandemic, just when maintaining the competence in cardiopulmonary resuscitation is compromised because on-site training must be avoided. We developed a pilot teaching-learning experience to promote cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills acquisition in this situation. The aim of this study was to describe that tool and to analyze its usefulness. Methods: The experience consisted of three phases: first, reviewing the scientific literature; second, defining written local recommendations and recording a short video simulating the initial attention to a cardiac arrest in this COVID-19 context; third, creating a test to be answered by hospital health professionals. Results: The final sample was 121 subjects; 66.1% were women; the mean age was 45.8 years (SD = 10.24). Among them, 43% were doctors, 43% nurses, 4.1% nursing assistants, and 9.9% others. 89.3% participants had received prior training in life support. In the test, questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were answered correctly by more than 80%; questions 3 and 4 were answered correctly by 57.9% and 41.3%, respectively. All participants expressed that the video helped them to refresh their knowledge and skills in life support. Discussion: When on-site training is not possible, distance learning—as in our teaching-learning innovation because of the COVID-19 pandemic—may be a valid option to acquire/refresh cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills.

AB  - Objectives. Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest is a key area in which to study the dual problem of the poorer health status of minority populations and their poorer access to the health care system. We proposed to examine the relationship between race (Black/White) and survival. Methods. We determined the incidence and outcome of cardiac arrests in Seattle for which medical assistance was requested. Results. Over a 26-month period, the age-adjusted incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was twice as great in Blacks than in Whites (3.4 vs 1.6 per 1000 aged 20 and over). The initial resuscitation rate was markedly poorer in the Black victims (17.1% vs 40.7%), and rates of survival to hospital discharge were also lower in Blacks (9.4% vs 17.1%). Both effective initial resuscitation and survival were significantly related to White race following adjustment for other covariates. Conclusions. The differences in outcomes were not fully explained by features of the collapse or relevant service factors. Possible explanations include delays in instituting therapy, less bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, poorer levels of health, and differences in the underlying cardiac disorders.

AB  - New graduate nurses report critical hands-on skills are not taught in school and contribute to the increased stress they feel when managing a life-threatening patient condition (Bennett et al., 2017). In the United States, approximately 290,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur annually (Andersen et al., 2019). The current Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) curriculum at a large university in northern New Jersey does not include the implementation of a high-fidelity cardiac arrest simulation. This project was designed to enhance classroom didactic education of nursing care during an emergency cardiac arrest by exposing traditional senior-level BSN students to a high-fidelity cardiac arrest simulation conducted in a controlled environment. This type of simulation allows students to experience, understand, and practice the necessary nursing response while caring for a patient suffering a life-threatening emergency prior to becoming licensed nurses. This initiative will prepare them to respond promptly and with confidence as novice licensed registered nurses when faced with an emergency in the clinical practice setting.

AB  - Background: Locations concentrated with High School (HS) students tend to have lower out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival rates. Mobile applications (apps) have the capability to augment cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skill retention as a low-cost, accessible training method. Methods: An iterative process to develop an app to reinforce CPR skills emphasizing hand placement, compression rate, real-time feedback, and recurring tips is described. The app was tested on HS students to measure its impact on quality and comfort of CPR using Likert surveys and skills assessments before and after one month of usage. CPR Score and compression rate were measured using the Laerdal™ Little Anne Manikin QCPR software. Results: Fourteen HS students participated in a prospective observational study. It was found that the use of the developed app was associated with improved CPR performance (80.43% v. 87.86%, p=0.01-0.02, 95% CI=2.20-12.66) after one month. Additionally, improvements were demonstrated in compression rate accuracy (21.43% v. 64.29%, p=0.041, 95% CI=0.132-0.725), increased comfort performing CPR (3.86 v. 4.79, p<0.001, 95% CI =0.99-1.00) and comfort performing CPR on strangers (2.71 v. 4.42, p<0.001, 95% CI=1.24-2.19). In addition, for every time the app was used, CPR performance increased by 0.5668% (p=0.0182). Conclusion: Findings suggest that mobile apps may have promising implications as augmentative tools for CPR curriculums.

AB  - Study objective: Although the Cochrane Library is promoted as a rigorous source of evidence, the relevance of this evidence to the out-of-hospital setting has not been assessed. The objective of this study is to identify existing controlled trials and systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library that have been conducted in or are relevant to out-of-hospital health care. The scope of out-of-hospital care, the years and trends of out-of-hospital research publication, and the journals of publication are also examined. Methods: Using a search strategy developed by the Cochrane Prehospital and Emergency Health Field, 2 reviewers searched issue 4, 2005 of the Cochrane Library to identify reports of controlled trials and systematic reviews on out-of-hospital interventions. Three independent reviewers screened the titles identified by the search strategy and applied predetermined criteria to classify the reported study as out-of-hospital based or not out-of-hospital based. The out-of-hospital-based studies were then categorized as randomized or nonrandomized trials. Results: Screening of the 19,759 titles retrieved by the search strategy identified 4,016 studies that were potentially out-of-hospital based. Abstract and full-text analysis of the 4,016 studies identified 400 reports of trials and 13 reviews or protocols that were out-of-hospital based. Of the 400 reports of trials identified, 299 (75%) were randomized trials. The number of out-of-hospital trials published increased steadily from the 1970s to the late 1990s, with the majority of trials (63%) covering interventions related to resuscitation and cardiac care. Annals of Emergency Medicine published more out-of-hospital trials than any other journal, followed by Resuscitation and Journal of the American Medical Association. Conclusion: The Cochrane Library provides a useful resource of health care evidence; however, the relatively small number of out-of-hospital-based systematic reviews and trials does not comprehensively cover the broad scope of out-of-hospital health care.

AB  - BackgroundBystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves the likelihood of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), yet it is performed in only 30% of cases. The 2010 guidelines promote chest-compression-only bystander CPR—a change intended to increase willingness to provide CPR.Objectives1) To determine whether the Canadian general public is more willing to perform chest-compression-only CPR compared to traditional CPR; 2) to characterize public knowledge of OHCA; and 3) to identify barriers and facilitators to bystander CPR.MethodsA 32-item survey assessing resuscitation knowledge, and willingness to provide CPR were disseminated in five Canadian regions. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize response distribution. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess shifts in intention to provide CPR.ResultsA total of 428 completed surveys were analysed. When presented with a scenario of being a bystander in an OHCA, a greater proportion of respondents were willing to provide chest-compression-only CPR compared to traditional CPR for all victims (61.5% v. 39.7%, p<0.001), when the victim was a stranger (55.1% v. 38.8%, p<0.001), or when the victim was an unkempt individual (47.9% v. 28.5%, p<0.001). When asked to describe an OHCA, 41.4% said the heart stopped beating, and 20.8% said it was a heart attack. Identified barriers and facilitators included fear of litigation and lack of skill confidence.ConclusionsThis study identified gaps in knowledge, which may impair the ability of bystanders to act in OHCA. Most respondents expressed greater willingness to provide chest-compression-only CPR, but this was mediated by victim characteristics, skill confidence, and recognition of a cardiac arrest.

AB  - • This is the first study evaluating respiratory and physical function and healing after chest wall injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. • Despite a few cases unhealed fractures, no pain was reported by the patients. • Decreased lower lung function and thoracic expansion were reported after chest wall injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. • Only minor differences were seen after manual vs. mechanical CPR or with and without flail chest. There is a lack of studies focusing on long-term chest function after chest wall injury due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate long-term pain, lung function, physical function, and fracture healing after manual or mechanical CPR and in patients with and without flail chest. Patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between 2013 and 2020 and transported to Sahlgrenska University Hospital were identified. Survivors who had undergone a computed tomography (CT) showing chest wall injury were contacted. Thirty-five patients answered a questionnaire regarding pain, physical function, and quality of life and 25 also attended a clinical examination to measure the respiratory and physical functions 3.9 (SD 1.7, min 2-max 8) years after the CPR. In addition, 22 patients underwent an additional CT scan to evaluate fracture healing. The initial CT showed bilateral rib fractures in all but one patient and sternum fracture in 69 %. At the time of the follow-up none of the patients had persistent pain, however, two patients were experiencing local discomfort in the chest wall. Lung function and thoracic expansion were significantly lower compared to reference values (FVC 14 %, FEV1 18 %, PEF 10 % and thoracic expansion 63 %) (p < 0.05). Three of the patients had remaining unhealed injuries. Patients who had received mechanical CPR in additional to manual CPR had a lower peak expiratory flow (80 vs 98 % of predicted values) (p =0.030) =0.030) and those having flail chest had less range of motion in the thoracic spine (84 vs 127 % of predicted) (p = 0.019) otherwise the results were similar between the groups. None of the survivors had long-term pain after CPR-related chest wall injuries. Despite decreased lower lung function and thoracic expansion, most patients had no limitations in physical mobility. Only minor differences were seen after manual vs. mechanical CPR or with and without flail chest. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although cardiac arrest during airline flights is relatively uncommon, the unusual setting, limited resources, and the variability of the skills in medical volunteers present unique challenges. Survival in patients who suffer a witnessed arrest with a shockable rhythm who are treated promptly has improved since the advent of widely available automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In general, the chances of survival from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are greater when ventricular fibrillation (VF) is seen as the initial rhythm or if there is return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Not all in-flight cardiac arrests are witnessed because cabin crew or fellow passengers might simply assume that the victim is sleeping. Based upon a review of the literature on resuscitation after OHCA, we recommend that automatic external defibrillators be carried on all commercial airline flights, regardless of duration. Patients presenting with shockable rhythm (e.g., VF, unstable ventricular tachycardia) have the best prognosis for survival and usually require diversion of the aircraft for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Because diversion may require interruption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and may impact flight safety, the volunteer rescuer, cabin crew, flight crew, and medical consultation services should discuss the possible outcome and operational considerations before recommending a diversion for a patient with a nonshockable rhythm. The recommendations in this article were developed by members of the Air Transport Medicine and Aerospace Human Performance Committees and approved by the Council of the Aerospace Medical Association.

AB  - Background This paper reviews the relevant literature related to the distribution of take-home naloxone. Methods A Medline search was conducted on articles published between January 1990 and June 2004 to identify scientific literature relevant to this subject. Those publications were reviewed, and from them other literature was identified and reviewed. Results The prevalence, pathophysiology and circumstances of heroin overdose, and also bystander response are included in this review. Naloxone peer distribution has been instituted to varying degrees in the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. Conclusion At this point the evidence supporting naloxone distribution is primarily anecdotal, although promising. Although the distribution of naloxone holds promise for further reducing heroin overdose mortality, problems remain. Naloxone alone may be insufficient in some cases to revive the victim, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially rescue breathing, may also be needed. A second dose of naloxone might be necessary. Complications following resuscitation from overdose may infrequently need in-hospital care. Mortality from injecting without anyone else present will be unaffected by take-home naloxone. Take-home naloxone should be studied in a rigorous scientific manner. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of student-athlete mortality, often described interchangeably as sudden cardiac death (SCD). For persons aged ≤35 years, structural heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is historically the most common etiology. Regarding individuals aged >35 years, coronary artery disease is the main contributor to SCD during exercise. Indications: Though some athletes may endure prodromal symptoms prior to a SCA, approximately 25% to 50% do not. Up to 23,000 people aged <18 years die from SCA annually. SCA athlete deaths are reported to be the most common medical cause of death and the second most common overall behind motor vehicle accidents in this population. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge SCA prevalence and identify at-risk competitors. Technique Description: If a SCA is suspected, first assess surroundings for safety and athlete response to commands. Should there be no pulse, activate code. If necessary, an athlete's shirt may be removed or cut to better access the bare chest for the automated external defibrillator (AED) pads. Apply pads and commence compressions. Refer to the AED for a shockable rhythm between compression cycles. Establish intravenous access as appropriate and if feasible. After 1 cycle of compressions, a shock is administered when a shockable rhythm is detected. Resume compressions if a pulse is not reestablished. If a pulse is reestablished, the athlete should then be immediately transported to the hospital. Results: A literature review yields illustration of the multifactorial criteria that comprise return-to-sports guidelines, including activity intensity, extent of cardiac disease, and psychological/physical benefit from sport. SCD incidence is higher in competitive versus recreational athletes. In general, consolidation of these investigations makes it apparent that utilizing a shared decision-making process and a progressive exercise program is warranted prior to play resumption in most cases. The greatest SCA/SCD survival determinant is collapse to defibrillation time. Discussion/Conclusion: The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology recommend preparticipation cardiac screening to identify cardiac conditions that predispose to SCA/SCD risk. SCD prevention in athletes hinges on the prompt availability of quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and AEDs.

AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a notable public health issue with negative outcomes, such as high mortality and aftereffects. Additionally, the adverse effects of extreme temperatures on health have become more important under climate change; however, few studies have investigated the relationship between temperature and OHCA. In this study, we examined the association between temperature and OHCA and its underlying risk factors. We conducted a two-stage time-series analysis using a Poisson regression model with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) and meta-analysis, based on a nationwide dataset from South Korea (2008–2018). We found that 17.4% of excess OHCA was attributed to cold, while 0.9% was attributed to heat. Based on central estimates, excess OHCA attributed to cold were more prominent in the population with hypertension comorbidity (31.0%) than the populations with diabetes (24.3%) and heart disease (17.4%). Excess OHCA attributed to heat were larger in the populations with diabetes (2.7%) and heart disease comorbidity (2.7%) than the population with hypertension (1.2%) based on central estimates. Furthermore, the time-varying excess OHCA attributed to cold have decreased over time, and although those of heat did not show a certain pattern during the study period, there was a weak increasing tendency since 2011. In conclusion, we found that OHCAs were associated with temperature, and cold temperatures showed a greater impact than that of hot temperatures. The effects of cold and hot temperatures on OHCA were more evident in the populations with hypertension, diabetes, and heart diseases, compared to the general population. In addition, the impacts of heat on OHCA increased in recent years, while those of cold temperatures decreased. Our results provide scientific evidence for policymakers to mitigate the OHCA burden attributed to temperature.

AB  - Background: Education of schoolchildren is an important issue in promoting the involvement of the lay public in improving survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For this quality training it is necessary to know what schoolchildren know to establish what they need to learn about it. For this reason, the objective of this research was to evaluate the knowledge in SVB of schoolchildren in the 5th and 6th grades of Primary Education and students in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades of Secondary Education. Methods: During the first quarter of the 2021/2022 academic year, a survey was conducted of 947 Primary (n=308) and Secondary (n=639) schoolchildren between the ages of 10 and 17 from four schools supported with public funds from the Xunta de Galicia. Results: 62.81% of the students surveyed received prior training. 92.30% responded incorrectly to the correct sequence of action before a person with possible cardiac arrest and 93.14% did so to the correct order of execution of the AED for an effective shock. 82.40% of schoolchildren know the emergency telephone number. Secondary Education students and those who received prior training have better knowledge than Primary Education students (p < 0.001) and those who do not (p < 0.001), although in both cases they do not reach 5 points out of 10. Conclusions: Galician schoolchildren in Primary and Secondary Education have little knowledge of Basic Life Support, so they do not contribute to the “Children Save Lives” initiative.

AB  - When planning a two‐arm group sequential clinical trial with a binary primary outcome that has severe implications for quality of life (e.g., mortality), investigators may strive to find the design that maximizes in‐trial patient benefit. In such cases, Bayesian response‐adaptive randomization (BRAR) is often considered because it can alter the allocation ratio throughout the trial in favor of the treatment that is currently performing better. Although previous studies have recommended using fixed randomization over BRAR based on patient benefit metrics calculated from the realized trial sample size, these previous comparisons have been limited by failures to hold type I and II error rates constant across designs or consider the impacts on all individuals directly affected by the design choice. In this paper, we propose a metric for comparing designs with the same type I and II error rates that reflects expected outcomes among individuals who would participate in the trial if enrollment is open when they become eligible. We demonstrate how to use the proposed metric to guide the choice of design in the context of two recent trials in persons suffering out of hospital cardiac arrest. Using computer simulation, we demonstrate that various implementations of group sequential BRAR offer modest improvements with respect to the proposed metric relative to conventional group sequential monitoring alone.

AB  - [Purpose] We report the case of a patient with myxedema who was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation (MV) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to coma. [Participant and Methods] A 48-yearold woman restarted spontaneous circulation within 20 minutes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the patient suffered from post-resuscitation encephalopathy accompanied by myxedema coma, and required intensive care with MV. [Results] On the 22nd day of hospitalization, when the patient was being treated with manually assisted respiration in a supine position to promote ventilation, apnea was frequently observed. Our multidisciplinary medical team conducted intensive respiratory care, promoted bed leaving, and gradually trained the respiratory muscles. The patient was successfully weaned from MV on the 43rd day, and transferred to another hospital on the 50th day of hospitalization. [Conclusion] The results of this case suggest that respiratory rehabilitation with accurate characterization of the underlying metabolic disease and proper respiratory care is essential for weaning from MV.

AB  - Background. Cardiac arrest is among the major causes of sudden deaths globally. Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurs more commonly, in-hospital cardiac arrest is still a major health problem. Critical care areas provide care to critically ill patients who are at risk of cardiac arrest. It is important that nurses are knowledgeable and competent in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to optimise the patient's chances of survival and quality of life after cardiac arrest. Objective. To investigate specialist practice nurses' knowledge of evidence-based guidelines for CPR. Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was utilised. We sampled all critical care registered nurses (N=96) currently working in the adult emergency departments and intensive care units at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. A self-administered instrument, the 'evaluation questionnaire on CPR knowledge for health personnel from emergency services' was used. Data were analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics. Results. The mean CPR knowledge score was 46%. A score of 84% was considered adequate for a pass, and no respondents achieved this score. The majority of the respondents (80.85%; n=76) were specialists in the field of intensive care nursing. Conclusion. The CPR knowledge of specialist practice nurses was suboptimal for the care required in high-risk settings. Further training is indicated.

AB  - We describe a case of a myocardial infarction, in which prominent ischemic J waves were documented during recurrent ventricular fibrillation attacks. The patient was referred to our hospital to treat an out-of hospital cardiac arrest. Although the 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained just after the first cardioversion did not show any apparent J waves, a J wave-like steep downsloping type ST-segment elevation associated with q waves in the inferior leads was documented during multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Our report revealed the appearance of J waves as an important marker for lethal arrhythmias in acute ischemia. (PACE 2012; 35:e27-e30) ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - ANTIARRHYTHMICS P001 THE ANTI‐ARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS OF STATINS IN PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS Panattoni G; Papavasileiou LP; Della Rocca DG; Cioè R; Magliano G; Topa A; Sergi D; Santini L; Forleo GB; Romeo F Cardiology Department, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy Introduction: A few studies have suggested that statins may have anti‐arrhythmic effects in patients with coronary artery disease. One proposed mechanism for the antiarrhythmic effect of statins is their antioxidant properties. The aim of our study was to determine whether statin therapy could reduce mortality, the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and appropriate or inappropriate intervention of the device in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Methods: We investigated 244 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease who received ICDs at our institution between April 2003 and November 2010. Patients were subdivided into "statin" (n = 177, 153 males, age 67.4 ± 10.2 years) and "no‐statin" (n = 67, 56 males, age 71.4 ± 8.2 years) groups based on the use of statins. Results: Mean follow‐up was 20,6 ± 17,2 months and the two groups were homogeneous regarding antiarrhythmic therapy and ejection fraction. The overall incidence of non‐sustained (NSVTs) was lower among the statin group when compared with the no‐statin group (44 vs 31 patients, p = 0.02). No significant differences were found in the overall mortality (25 vs 12 patients, p = ns). The use of statin did not reduced significantly the occurrence of appropriate or inappropriate intervention of the device (31 vs 20 patients, p = 0.09 and 9 vs 3 patients, p = ns respectively) and of therapy. Conclusions: In our study statin therapy is associated with a lower incidence of non‐sustained ventricular tachycardias in patients with coronary artery disease and ICDs but does not influence overall mortality and appropriate or inappropriate intervention of the device. P002 QUINIDINE: AN "ENDANGERED SPECIES" DRUG APPROPRIATE FOR MANAGEMENT OF ELECTRICAL STORM IN BRUGADA SYNDROME Theofilogiannakos EK; Paraskevaidis S; Kamperidis V; Chatzizisis Y; Tsilonis K; Dakos G; Vassilikos V; Styliadis IH 1st Cardiology Department, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University Medical School, Thessalon The clinical manifestation of Brugada Syndrome (BS) varies from asymptomatic form to electrical storm and sudden cardiac death. We report two cases of BS that were presented with electrical storm. A 38‐year‐old man, who was treated with ICD implantation two years ago presented to our emergency department with electrical storm (i.e. three episodes of ventricular tachycardia in the same day) provoking shocks from the ICD. On admission, the patient was on a febrile status due to pneumonia that may was the predisposing factor that lead to the electrical instability. The second patient was a 75‐year‐old man, who was treated with ICD implantation nine years ago, was admitted for seven episodes of ventricular fibrillation within 24 hours that was successfully treated with ICD shocks. There was no predisposing factor that could lead to the electrical instability. Since the ICD implantation both patients did not receive any medication. Both patients were started on oral hydroquinidine (600 mg twice daily), remaining electrical stable for the rest of their hospitalization. After six months of hydroquinidine treatment the patients were also asymptomatic without any recorded ICD therapy. Recently, a discussion was initiated among electrophysiologists concerning quinidine shortage in the drug market. Quinidine is effective medical treatment for patients with short QT syndrome, BS and a subgroup of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Electrical storms in patients with the above syndromes should be treated with ICD. However, since ICD does not prevent the occurrence of arrhythmias, oral quinidine could be a reasonable choice for long‐term prevention of life‐threatening tachyarrhythmias. P003 SMALL NUMBER OF CANDIDATES FOR ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS IDENTIFIED BY DATA FROM IMPLANTED PACEMAKERS Fisher JD; Yedlapati N; Rosal‐Greif V Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA Background: Modern pacemakers (pacers) quantify atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes and overall burden (% of time in AF). Many AF episodes are asymptomatic but still can be stroke risks. Records of 742 consecutive pacer checks were reviewed by a single investigator (JDF). Objective: To determine see how many patients (pts) had AF and might be candidates for antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Methods: Charts were reviewed on or near the day of the in‐office pacer check. Pts were considered potential candidates for AAD therapy if they had dual chamber pacers (DDD), and electrograms showing AF or flutter burden between 1% and 99%, confirmed after 1 more month. 80% of patients had dual chamber pacers. Patients with single chamber pacers were excluded because in our practice these are used in AF patients when there is no intention of restoring sinus rhythm. Other exclusions were: Severe Co‐Morbidities – 9; Demented, aged – 10;Already on AAD – 8; MDs refused – 4;Patient refused – 17; AF disappeared – 8Chronic AF – 2; Language barrier – 13;Died – 1; SVT not AF – 2; Lost – 4; Moved – 2; Too Recent implant – 1 There were 11.3% non‐excluded DDD Patients with 1–99% AF. The Average% AF (Burden)was 24%. Conclusion: AF can be detected and quantified in DDD pacemaker patients, but only a low percentage go on to have appropriate antiarrhythmic drugs administered. P004 CHRONIC USE OF AMIODARONE IN ICD RECIPIENTS Santini L; Cioè R; Magliano G; Viele A; Minni V; Forleo GB; Mahfouz K; Sergi D; Topa A; Romeo F Department of Cardiology, University of Rome "Tor Vergata," Rome, Italy Purpose: Amiodarone is one of the most studied and used drug to treat life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of use of amiodarone on the outcomes of patients receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Methods: We enrolled 428 consecutive patients (358 males, mean age 66,8 ± 11.3 years) who underwent ICD implantation at our Institute between September 2003 and January 2011. We subdivided patients in two groups regarding the used of amiodarone in chronic treatment. The Amiodarone + group (n = 161 patients, 139 males, 68.2 ± 10.6 years) and the Amiodarone‐ (n = 267, 219 males, 66.0 ± 11.6 years). Results: Groups resulted to be homogenous regarding age, sex, ejection fraction and underlying heart disease. After a mean follow‐up of 22,1 ± 18.0 months, 38 patients (23.6%) in Amiodarone + group experienced appropriate discharges versus 46 patients (17.2) in the Amiodarone − group (p = ns); while the incidence of inappropriate discharges was 5% (8 pts) and 6.7% (18 pts) respectively (p = ns). The incidence of TVNS was 26% (42 pts) vs 34% (91 pts) respectively (p = ns). No significant difference was found about mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (10/161 pts vs 18/267, p = ns). Conclusions: As reported by major clinical trials only the use of ICD influence mortality when compared to antiarrhythmic treatment. The chronic use of amiodarone in ICD recipients does not influence occurrence of major arrhythmic events, nevertheless reduces total number of events per patient. P005 ATRIAL TACHYARRHYTHMIA DECREASES VENTRICULAR MICROPERFUSION DURING AMIODARONE BUT NOT DURING DRONED‐ ARONE TREATMENT Hammwohner M; Bukowska A; Sixdorf A; Roehl FW; Lendeckel U; Goette A St.Vincenz Hospital Paderborn, Germany Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk for acute coronary syndromes. AF‐induced ischemia seems to be related to disturbance of ventricular microcirculation. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dronedarone (DRO) and amiodarone (AMIO) infusion on ventricular macro‐ and microperfusion during rapid atrial pacing (RAP). Coronary flow reserve (CFR, microvascular perfusion marker) and fractional flow reserve (FFR, epicardial coronary artery flow marker) were determined in the left anterior descending artery in 30 pigs using a sensortipped thermodilution and pressure guidewire. Measurements were conducted at baseline, and after 6h of RAP with 600 bpm and/or DRO/AMIO infusion. RAP alone was performed in 6 pigs, 6 animals underwent RAP with DRO i.v. (10mg/kg) and 5 with AMIO i.v. (5mg/kg). 6 pigs were instrumented without intervention (Sham), 7 animals received DRO alone. FFR measurement (baseline = 100%) revealed a decreased FFR only in RAP and AMIO animals after 6h compared to all other groups (RAP:93 ± 6%; RAP + AMIO:82 ± 20%; p < 0.05). However, FFR did not drop below <0.8 in any animal. DRO infusion increased FFR compared to RAP after 6h (DRO:105 ± 5% vs RAP:93 ± 6%; p < 0.05). RAP and AMIO significantly decreased CFR (baseline = 100%) when compared with any other group (RAP:57 ± 11%; RAP + AMIO:54 ± 18% vs Sham:103 ± 14% vs RAP + DRO:96 ± 13% vs DRO:110 ± 17%; p < 0.05). DRO infusion abolished RAP induced decrease in CFR with a tendency towards an increased CFR compared to baseline (+10%). DRO infusion did not alter QTc compared to Sham. QTc increased in the DRO group (baseline Qtc 372 ± 10ms vs 6h DRO 408 ± 36ms). There were no significant differences in cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameters between all groups. RAP impaires left ventricular microcirculation. DRO but not AMIO exerted vasodilatory effects in coronary arteries and improved microcirculation, thus abolishing RAP‐induced microvascular flow disturbances. P006 CONVERSION EFFICACY OF PROPAPHENONE IBOUTILIDE AND AMIODARONE IN MEN AND WOMEN WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION OF RECENT ONSET Panageas V; Zika A General Hospital of Pyrgos Introduction: We aimed to determine whether the efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents is associated with sex, in patients with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation of 3–48h. duration (PAFib). Methods used: We have observed 94 patients (64 men and 30 women). with PAFib. Patients were treated with Propaphenone (PR.), Ibutilide (IB) or Amiodarone (AMIO). If sinus rhythm was not restored with the first drug we used another one. Successful cardioversion was defined as arrhythmia termination within 48 hours. The results were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Summary of Results: Of 94 patients 89 were restored (95%). 60 men (93,75%) and 29 women (96,77%) were restored (p‐value = 1). As regards Propaphenone we used it as a 1st choice in 32 men (efficacy: 81,25%) and in 15 women (efficacy: 93,34%)(p = 0,6599). Propaphenone was never used as a 2nd choice). Amiodarone was used in 21 men as a 1st choice, with 90,5% efficacy and in 4 men as a 2nd choice, with 75% efficacy. In women it was used only as a 1st choice in 5 cases with 80% efficacy. (Amiodarone: p = 0,5153 as a first choice and 1,0000 as a 2nd choice). Finally, Iboutilide was used in 11 men and 10 women as a first choice and in 4 men and 1 women as a 2nd choice with efficacy 100% (in all of theme) (so p = 1,0000). Conclusions: In Southern‐West Greece the association between the gender and the conversion rate of antiarrhythmic drugs is not statistically significant. P007 ATRIAL EXCITATION PATTERNS OF REFRACTORY AND NON REFRACTORY TO PROPAPHENONE RECURRENT PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Dakos G; Vassilikos V; Chouvarda I; Chatzizisis I; Mantziari L; Kamberidis V; Paraskevaidis S; Tsilonis K; Maglaveras N; Styliadis I 1st Cardiology Dept., Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece The aim of this study was to associate the effects of propaphenone on the atrial excitation patterns of the recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), with P wave wavelet analysis. Methods: Thirty‐three PAF patients (20 males, mean age 60 ± 11 years) who received propaphenone, were divided into 2 Groups, after were followed for 2.3 ± 0.4 years. Nine patients (5 males, mean age 61 ± 7years) with multiple AF recurrences (>5 /year) were consisted Group A, while twenty‐four patients (15 males, mean age 60 ± 12 years) with less than 2 recurrences/year were consisted Group B. Two consecutive recordings were obtained, before and 37 ± 6 days after propaphenone administration with a 3 – channel digital recorder for 10 minutes and digitized with a 16–bit accuracy at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The P wave was analyzed using the Morlet wavelet and wavelet parameters expressing the mean and max energy of P wave were calculated in the three orthogonal leads (X, Y, Z) and in the vector magnitude (VM), in three frequency bands (1st: 200–160 Hz, 2nd: 150–100 Hz and 3rd: 90–50 Hz). The P wave duration was also measured in these axes and in the VM. Paired‐samples T‐test was used for comparing continuous variables. Results: After propaphenone administration, Group A patients showed higher mean and max energy values in the 2nd and 3rd frequency bands at Z axis, while Group B patients had shorter P wave duration at Z axis along with higher max energy values in the 1st and 3rd frequency bands at X axis and mean and max energy values in all frequency bands at Y axis. Conclusion: The refractory and non refractory to propaphenone recurrent PAF are associated with specific effects of propaphenone on the atrial excitation patterns, that can be revealed with P wave wavelet analysis. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION P008 LONG‐TERM RESULTS OF BALOON CRYOISOLATION OF PULMONARY VEINS IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL OR PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Misikova S; Stancak B; Spurny P; Komanova E; Olexa P; Machacova Z; Sedlak J; Sudzinova A East Slovakia Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kosice, Slovakia Introduction: Balloon cryoisolation of pulmonary veins is a novel method for treatment of atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study is to evaluate it's mid‐ and long term effectiveness in reducing the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Patients and methods: We evaluated 95 patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (mean age 58,6 ± 5,1 years, 62 men, 33 women) who underwent cryoisolation of pulmonary veins with 28 mm and 23 mm balloon size. The ablation protocol consisted of application of cryoenergy with duration of 900–1200 s into the ostium of each vein and check for the isolation with normal lasso or special microcircular catheter. The ambulatory evaluation via 24 Holter monitoring was repeated in 6 and 12 months. Results: We successfully isolated 361 (95%) pulmonary veins, veins without reach of balloon catheter were 19 (5%). Fluoroscopy time was 25 ± 10 min., procedural time 174 ± 79 min, average ACT during the ablation was 281 ± 38 s. The freedom of atrial fibrillation based on Holter data and patient's reports in 6 and 12 months was 68% and 65% respectively with more success in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation group. The phrenic nerve palsy was found in 5 patients, in 4 of them resolved within 6 months. Small pericardial effusion without the need of intervention was found in 1 patient, and femoral pseudoaneurysm managed by vascular surgeon in 1 patient. Conclusion: Balloon cryoisolation of pulmonary veins is fast, effective and safe ablation method. Long‐term success rate is comparable with conventional radiofrequency ablation especially in paroxysmal forms of atrial fibrillation. P009 PREVENTION OF POST OP ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH SURGICAL PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION Ayala‐Paredes FA; Lavallee L; Lessard N; Teijeira J CHUS Universite de Sherbrooke Background: Post operative atrial fibrillation (Afib) is highly prevalent after CABG surgery; surgical pulmonary vein isolation, would reduce the risk of post operative AFib in patients (pts) with high risk. Methods & Results: Pts at least 65 years old with either hypertension or diabetes, but not previous Afib were randomized (1:1) to a CABG only (controls) or CABG + Cardioblate BP2 (Medtronic) to isolate four pulmonary veins (PV isolation) during the bypass surgery, plus left atrial appendage exclusion. A Reveal XT was implanted for long term monitoring. End point was any Afib lasting 2 min or longer before discharge. 42 pts were studied to date (from 50 expected), 88% men; with no complications and non significant changes in surgical times due to the addition of PV isolation. There were no differences in basal characteristics, diabetes or hypertension rates; beta –blockers or ACE/Ang II inhibitors use, but a marked reduction of new atrial fibrillation in patients with pulmonary vein isolation. In hospital Afib was present in 68.4% of controls versus 26.09% of PV isolation pts (p = 0.06). At 30 days Afib rate was 21.1% in controls versus 8.6% in PVI pts (p = 0.2). Most of patients (64.8%) with post op AFib received amiodarone for at least 30 days (47.4% group control vs 17.4%; (p = 0.049). Total surgical times were similar in both groups 206 (± 57 min) for controls versus 198.7 (± 30.3 min) in PVI pts (p = 0.8) as total hospital stay 8.21 (± 4.3 days) in controls versus 8.7 (± 3.9 days) in PVI pts (p = 0.7). Conclusion: A simple and time efficient surgical technique could significantly decrease the incidence of post operative atrial fibrillation, in pts with no history of atrial fibrillation, but high risk profile. This could decrease time to discharge and need of anti‐arrhythmic or anticoagulant therapy. This approach merits a wide scale validation as it could change the way CABG pts are managed. P010 PREVALENCE OF RIGHT ATRIAL THROMBUS ON THE TRANSEPTAL SHEATHS DETECTED BY INTRACARDIAC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY DURING CATHETER ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WHILE ON THERAPEUTIC COUMADIN Di Biase L; Santangeli P; Bai R; Sanchez J; Mohanty P; Horton R; Lakkireddy DJ; Raviele A; Burkhardt JD; Natale A Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David's Medical Center, Austin, Texas, USA Introduction: The reported prevalence of left atrial thrombus formation on the transseptal sheath detected by ICE ranged from 5 to 10.3% in patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF). Aim of our study was to report the prevalence of thrombus on the transeptal sheath placed in the right atrium (RA) before the transeptal access in patients undergoing PVI. Methods: Data from 4 centers performing catheter ablation of AF under ICE guidance and utilizing an open irrigated catheter have been collected. Before transeptal, a bolus of i.v. Heparin (10000 UI) was administered. Sheaths were continuously irrigated with heparinized saline and ACT was kept above 300 sec with additional bolus of i.v. heparin when required. Before administration of i.v. heparin, we assessed the prevalence of thrombus attached to the transeptal sheath placed in the RA. Results: Data from 2773 patients were analyzed. 1749 patients underwent PVI without Coumadin discontinuation with a mean INR of 2.46 + 0.32 while 1024 patients underwent PVI after Coumadin discontinuation 3 days preceding the PVI. In all patients the right thrombus was detected by ICE during transeptal access or immediately after the first transeptal puncture. The prevalence of right thrombus on the transeptal sheath was found in 9% (158 pts) of patients on 'therapeutic" Coumadin before PVI and in 8.6% (88 pts) of patients off Coumadin before PVI (p > 0,001). In all cases the right thrombus have not been aspirated but only monitored during the whole procedure by ICE. No parameter included in the baseline characteristics of the patients was found to be a predictor of this finding. Conclusions: Our study shows that thrombus on the transeptal sheaths is detected by ICE in about 9% of the patients undergoing PVI despite a therapeutic "INR". These results suggest that administration of i.v. heparin before transeptal access is required even in patients with "therapeutic" INR. P011 LEFT ATRIAL SPONTANEOUS ECHO CONTRAST IS CLINICAL PREDICTOR FOR THE RECURRENCE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AFTER CATHETER ABLATION? Kim M‐N; Park S‐M; Shim W‐J; Choi J‐I; Park S‐W; Kim Y‐H Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine Background: Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast (LASEC) is known as one of markers of thrombogenic milieu in patients with atrial fibrillation(AF). But it was not examined that SEC has a influence on the recurrence of AF after catheter ablation. Method: 229 patients with non‐valvular AF who underwent catheter ablation for AF were enrolled and performed trans‐thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and trans‐esophageal echocardiography (TEE) before procedure. SEC was diagnosed by TEE as the presence of smoke‐like echogenic materials which swirled in the cavities. And other 2D‐echocardiography parameters were measured. Result: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of patients with (+) SEC was mildly decreased than in patients without SEC (55.5 ± 5.8% vs. 56.4 ± 3.7%, P = 0.003). E/e' ratio, the marker of diastolic function of the LV was larger in patients with (+) SEC than in patients without SEC (10.8 ± 5.9 vs. 8.7 ± 2.9, P = 0.004). Ablation time was longer in patients with (+) SEC than in patients without SEC (91 ± 59 min vs. 88 ± 34 min, p < 0.001). Patients with (+) SEC had a non‐significant, but higher incidence of AF recurrence after ablation (25.9 vs. 20.1%, P = 0.45). Conclusion: LASEC was closely associated with LV systolic and diastolic function as well, however, was not significantly related to clinical outcome after catheter ablation of AF. Further study including large number of the patients is warranted. P012 LONG TERM RESULTS OF ABLATION FOR LONE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION VIA RIGHT MINITHORACOTOMY: TOWARDS A RATIONAL REVISION OF TREATMENT PROTOCOLS Nasso G; Bonifazi R; Romano V; Visicchio G; Fiore F; Speziale G GVM Care & Research, Bari, Italy Objective: Despite continued technical improvements, the results of transcatheter radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation may be suboptimal in some patients subgroups. The short‐term follow‐up results of the minimally invasive epicardial ablation of lone atrial fibrillation were encouraging. Methods: One‐hundred‐four patients with drug‐refractory lone atrial fibrillation underwent minimally invasive surgical ablation with a right 3–4 cm minithoracotomy by isolation of the pulmonary veins, and were followed‐up for average 17 months. Previous failed transcatheter ablation was not an enrolment criterion for this procedure in the last phase of our experience. Results: The procedure is confirmed to be safe (one case of procedure‐related morbidity, no operative deaths) and effective (89% overall freedom from recurrent arrhythmia at follow‐up with 96 freedom from arrhythmia for paroxysmal AF Type and 80% free for persisting AF).The results tend to improve with the expansion of the surgical experience. Cox hazards regression and Kaplan‐Meier analysis identified persisting type of atrial fibrillation and enlarged left atrium as the major predictors of recurrent atrial fibrillation at follow‐up. Health‐related quality‐of‐life is confirmed improved at the end of the follow‐up vs. baseline in the majority of the SF‐36 domains. Conclusions: The minimally invasive epicardial ablation of lone atrial fibrillation yields stable and gradually improving results. Earlier referral of patients to surgery is justifiable after a careful cardiologic work‐up. In order to define the relative roles of the minimally invasive ablation and the transcatheter ablation, which may be considered in the future as alternative therapies, a randomized trial of these two procedures is advisable. P013 A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF CATHETER ABLATION VERSUS MEDICAL TREATMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN HEART FAILURE (THE CAMTAF TRIAL) Hunter RJ; Berriman TJ; Diab I; Baker V; Richmond L; Abrams D; Dhinoja M; Earley MJ; Sporton S; Schilling RJ Cardiology Research Department, St Bartholomew's Hospital Introduction: We sought to compare the impact of a catheter ablation strategy (CA) to a medical rate control strategy (MED) in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). Methods: Patients with persistent AF, symptomatic HF, and a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) < 50%, were randomised to CA or MED. HF medication and anticoagulation were optimised prior to baseline observations. For those with recurrent AF in the CA group, a repeat procedure was performed at the end of the 3 month blanking period and follow up re‐started. The primary end‐point was the difference in LV EF between groups on echocardiography at 6 months. Echocardiographic data were anonymized and core reported by a blinded collaborating centre. Results: 54 patients were randomised, but 5 were excluded (LV normalised during optimisation of medications prior to baseline tests in 2, and 3 withdrew un‐happy with their treatment allocation). Patients were 58 ± 11 yrs and 96% were male. Baseline EF was 31 ± 10% in the CA group and 33 ± 9% in the MED group. NYHA class was 2.5 ± 0.5 in both groups. Patients underwent 1.6 ± 0.7 procedures. There were 2 complications: 1 stroke and 1 tamponade. In the CA group 1 patient withdrew after a procedural stroke, and in the MED group 1 patient died. All 21 remaining in the MED group, and the 24 of 26 in the CA group that had reached 6 months follow‐up were included in the analysis of the primary end‐point. Freedom from AF was achieved in 21/24 (88%) off antiarrhythmic drugs. LV EF in the CA group at 6 months was 39 ± 10% compared to 32 ± 13% in the MED group (p < 0.05). NYHA class was also significantly lower in the CA group (1.7 ± 0.8 compared to 2.3 ± 0.6 in the MED group; p < 0.05). Conclusions: CA is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF and HF, and improves LV function and heart failure symptoms compared to medical treatment alone. P014 A NOVEL APPROACH TO MINIMALLY‐INVASIVE ABLATIVE MAZE SURGERY FOR REFRACTORY LONE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Benussi S; Pozzoli A; Taramasso M; Dorigo E; Calabrese M; Nascimbene S; Anzil F; Alfieri O San Raffaele University Hospital, Cardiothoracic Surgery Department Purpose: One of the main limitations of the Maze is the requirement of median sternotomy. This, has limited the popularity for the surgical treatment of lone atrial fibrillation (AF) despite its recognized superior efficacy. We evaluated the outcomes of an original technique, devised to perform a complete MazeIII procedure with bipolar radiofrequency (RF), through a minimally‐invasive approach. Methods: The procedure was carried out through right minithoracotomy. Cardiopulmonary by‐pass was instituted through peripheral venous and arterial cannulation. After cross‐clamping, all Maze III ablations were performed using a new glidepath‐guided, articulated bipolar RF clamp, including a complete box around the 4 pulmonary veins. If needed, mitral and tricuspid connecting ablations, were completed using cryoenergy. Results: 14 patients were included (13 male; mean age 53 ± 9.6 years). All patients had highly symptomatic persistent (5/14 patients, 35%) or long‐standing persistent (9/14 patients, 65%) lone AF, refractory to a median number of 3 percutaneous ablations (min 1, max 5). The mean duration of AF before surgery was 117 ± 68.4 months, and mean hospital stay was 12 ± 6.7 days. Procedural success rate was 93% (13/14). There was no operative mortality or major complications. No patient required a permanent pacemaker. Follow‐up was complete for all patients, with a mean period of 13 ± 7.7 months and 13/14 patients were in stable sinus rhythm at latest follow‐up. Three months after surgery, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly (from 55.2%± 5.9% to 63%± 3.8%, p = 0.007). Furthermore, after surgery, EHRA score decreased by ≤ 2 in 9 patients (64%) and NYHA functional class also improved by ≥ 1 in 11 cases (78%). Conclusions: A MazeIII procedure can be reproducibly performed through right minithoracotomy using an articulated bipolar RF clamp and cryoenergy, with excellent mid‐term results. Maze surgery with bipolar RF can thus be performed through minithoracotomy safely, without compromising efficacy. P015 EVALUATION OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES SENSITIVITY FOR GUIDING TRANSEPTAL PUNCTURE Ardashev AV; Zhelyakov EG; Rybachenko MS; Konev AV; Kuzovlev OP; * Belenkov YuN 83 Clinical Hospital of FMBA, * Lomonosov State University, Moscow, Russia Objective: to compare the sensitivity of transthoracic (TTE), transesophageal (TEE) and intracardiac (ICE) echocardiography for guiding transeptal puncture. Methods: The study concluded of 208 pts (48 female, mean age was 56.4 ± 11.3 years) who underwent RFA of left atrium because of atrial fibrillation. Transeptal puncture was performed after interatrial septum (IAS) visualization using TTE in 32 (15.4%), TEE – in 26 (12.5%), ICE – in 150 (72.1%) pts. ICE was preformed using the electronic phased‐array intracardiac ultrasound catheter sector imaging system (AcuNav, Siemens). Optimal contact of transeptal needle with IAS was defined as a tension of septum using echocardiographic techniques. Verification of tenting and following transeptal puncture with LA catheterization defined as a true positive result. Lack of visualization of tenting with successful transeptal puncture under fluoroscopy was defined as a false negative result. Results: Clear visualization of the IAS using TTE technique was demonstrated in 2 (6%) cases, and the sensitivity amounted for 6.7%. Obvious verification of IAS by TEE was revealed in 20 (77%) pts, and sensitivity of this technique was 86.9%. ICE control of septum puncture was performed in 127 pts. ICE allowed visualizing septum and tenting in 125 pts and the tension of septum was unable to be determined in 2 cases despite of the efforts of specialists. ICE sensitivity for IAS verification was 98.4%. Conclusion: In our study we estimated that ICE is the most sensitive ultrasound technique for obvious verification of optimal location of the transeptal needle in the region of IAS comparing with TTE and TEE. P016 ABLATION OF LONG‐LASTING PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION BY INTRAPROCEDURAL USING OF IBUTILIDE TO IDENTIFY PERSISTENT CFAES: RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED STUDY COMPARING TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES Rebecchi M; de Ruvo E; Sciarra L; De Luca L; Pitrone P; Guarracini F; Zuccaro LM; Dottori S; Verlato R; Calò L Policlinico Casilino, Rome, Italy. Introduction: Ablation of long‐lasting (LL)‐persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly variable, with different strategies and outcome. We sought to compare RF ablation of CFAEs in right (RA) and left atrium (LA) identified by using endovenous low‐dose of ibutilide plus pulmonary veins isolation (PVI) with linear lesions in LA plus PVI. Methods: Fifty‐four symptomatic patients with LL‐persistent AF, refractory to AADs, were randomized to two different ablation approach. Twenty‐seven patients (group A; mean age 58.7 ± 7.4 years, 14 males) underwent PVI plus bi‐atrial ablation of CFAEs areas identified prior and post endovenous low‐dose of ibutilide (0.5 mg) administration. The remaining 27 patients (group B; mean age 58.6 ± 9.4 years, 14 males) underwent PVI and linear lesions (roof and mitral isthmus) in the LA. Results: All patients completed ablation procedure without complications. In the group A, the prevalence of CFAEs before ibutilide administration was higher in the LA than in the RA (35.4% vs 21.2% P = 0.016). After ibutilide administration, AF cycle lenght significantly decreased if compared with baseline (264.2 ± 51.9 vs 153.4 ± 33.9, P = 0.0001) and CFAEs prevalence was globally reduced of 69.4% (P = 0.001) in LA and of 81.7% (P = 0.001) in RA. Complete PVI was performed in all patients of both groups. Complete mitral isthmus and roof conduction block was observed in 15 (55%) and in 24 (88%) patients of group B, respectively. After a mean follow up of 13 ± 8 months, 22 (81.4%) patients of group A and 9 (33.3%) patients of Group B were free from AF recurrences (P = 0.001). Conclusion: In patients with LL‐persistent AF, PVI plus bi‐atrial ablation of CFAEs after ibutilide administration is safe and more effective in term of success rate if compared with PVI plus linear lesions approach. This study suggests the utility of intraprocedural use of ibutilide to perform ablation of persistent CFAEs that could be critical for the maintenance of AF. P017 CRYOBALLOON‐ABLATION TO TREAT PARO‐ XYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION USING ELECTROANATOMICAL VOLTAGE MAPPING: WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF PULMONARY VENOUS ISOLATION? Catanzariti D; Maines M; Angheben C; Cirrincione C; Vaccarini C; Vergara G Division of Cardiology, S. Maria del Carmine Hospital, Rovereto (TN) – Italy Background: Balloon‐based technology and cryoenergy were recently introduced to increase the safety of procedure and to reduce discontinuity of circular lesions around pulmonary veins (PVs), by avoiding a major role in the outcome of the operatory dexterity. However relatively unknown remains the exact level of PVs isolation induced by cryoballoon‐ablation (CBA). Methods: In 22 consecutive patients undergoing CBA for paroxysmal or short standing persistent atrial fibrillation after prior MRI data acquisition, 3D reconstruction of the LA could be generated using the EnSite Verismo Software incorporating the 3D reconstruction of the LA created by MRI. This software was also used for measuring distances and the diameter of various anatomical structures and for reconstructing the complete "true" 65533 anatomy of PVs antra. Using preselected amplitude voltage limits of 0.05–0.5 mV and differential pacing techniques, the topographic extension of PVs isolation was assessed after CBA. Results: All 80 PVs of patients study were isolated by CBA (including 9 left common trunk and 1 right middle accessory veins). An antral level of isolation was observed in the vast majority of PVs with severe reduction of voltage outside the tubular portion of PV and at various extent proximal to the PV ostium. Indirect approaches to CBA were preferred in 42% of cryofreezes to enlarge the perivenous atrial lesions, while the coaxial approach was reserved in the remaining cases. Conclusion: CBA exerts its effects on electrical isolation at the antral level of PV ostia largely resorting to indirect approaches for achieving mechanical occlusion during cryoenergy delivery. P018 PVI IN 2011: IS IT NECESSARY TO PERFORM A DETAILED TIME CONSUMING ELECTROPHYSICAL MAPPING OR SHOULD WE FOCUS ON A RAPID AND SAFE THERAPY? A COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT ABLATION TOOLS Maagh P; Butz T; van Bracht M; Trappe HJ; Meissner A Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Cologne gGmbH, Hospital Merheim/Germany Background: PVI is an established treatment option in the field of drug refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). Different ablation tools are available, comparisons between procedure duration (PD) and fluoroscopy time (FT) are lacking. Objective: We compared PD and FT using I) the High Density Mesh Mapper (HDMM) with irrigated‐tip radiofrequency (RF) for antral ablation, and II) the single device RF technique of the High Density Mesh Ablator (HDMA), and III) the "single shot" device of the Arctic Front Cryoballoon with cryothermal energy. Methods: In our single center between August 2007 and March 2010, a series of 111 PVI procedures were performed in paroxysmal AF (PAF) and persistent AF (persAF) patients (mean age 59.7 ± 9.9 years with a 6.4 ± 4.4 years history of PAF (67 patients, 60.4%) and persAF (44 patients, 39.6%)). PD and FT were entered into a retrospective database. Results: The procedures included 42 PVIs with the HDMM (37.8%), 47 with the HDMA (42.3%) and 22 with the cryoballoon (19.8%). Comparing the 30 first procedures in groups of 10 in the HDMM and HDMA group, PD and FT fell in the HDMM group (257.5 to 220.9 min and FT from 80.5 to 67.3 min (both p < 0.005) as well as in the HDMA group (182.9 to 147.2 min and FT from 41.02 to 29.1 min). In the cryoballoon group, there was a steep learning curve with a steady state after the first 10 procedures (PD and FT decreased from 189.5 to 151.0 min and 36.9 to 33.0 min, p values 0.005 and 0.05 respectively). Severe complications did not occur. Conclusion: The cryoballoon technology had the shortest PD and FT. The strongest indicators of quality of ablation should include PD and FT as well as the efficacy to prevent AF recurrence. Further studies will show if we should adopt a "wait‐and‐see" attitude referring the AF recurrence or if the time for correct mapping of the PV potentials is a price we should be willing to pay. P019 INITIAL RESULTS OF PURSE‐STRING PV BOX ISOLATION PROCEDURE FOR NON‐MITRAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Imai K; Sueda T; Bagus H; Katayama K; Takahashi S; Takasaki T; Kurosaki T; Uchida N Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital Introduction: Although less invasive procedure for atrial fibrillation (AF) such as catheter ablation or minimally invasive surgery diminished AF with high success rate, several problems still remain unsolved, including repeat sessions or uncertainly of ablation tools. We have performed surgical PV Box isolation (PVBI) for AF combined with mitral valve disease (MVD) with good success rate, however, PVBI for non‐MVD is invasive because of its incision line. We have developed less invasive surgical procedure, purse‐string PBVI with certain ablation line for non‐MVD AF. Method: Seven non‐MVD paroxysmal AF (pAF) cases (3 ASD, 2 AVR 1 TVR and 1 OPCAB) that have indication for surgical intervention, were received PVBI. Box ablation line was created by using bipolar radiofrequency surgical device which can create a long (about 7 cm) continuous transmural lesion. At first, bilateral epicardial PV isolation line was made and second, upper and lower connecting line was added without incision of left atrial wall using purse‐string technique: one‐half of ablation jaw was inserted into the left atrium through a purse‐string suture on the right PVs toward the left PVs. All patients were received continuous monitor ECG (in hospital) and Holter ECG of every 6 month (after discharge), AF recurrence was estimated by more than 5 minutes duration. Result: No complications or death were procedure related. At discharge, freedom from AF was 86%. In the patients of AF free at discharge, 100% of patients were free from pAF at averaged 13 months follow‐up. Conclusion: Purse‐string PVBI can be a less invasive and effective procedure for non‐MVD pAF. P020 PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION WITH THE PULMONARY VEIN ABLATION CATHETER VERSUS CONVENTIONAL POINT‐BY‐POINT ABLATION USING THE CARTO SYSTEM: A LARGE, COMPARATIVE, SINGLE CENTRE STUDY De Greef Y; Segers V; Schwagten B; De Keulenaer G; Stockman D Department of Cardiology, Antwerp Cardiovascular Institute Middelheim, Belgium Aim: To compare pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using the pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) with conventional PVI guided by CARTO. Methods: Two‐hundred consecutive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and left atrial (LA) diameter of <50 mm underwent either CARTO‐ (N = 100) or PVAC‐guided (N = 100) PVI. Follow‐up (symptoms and Holter) was performed at 1 month and every 3 months thereafter. Repeat ablation was guided by a circular catheter and CARTO to describe PV reconnection characteristics. Results: Clinical characteristics were similar. Successful PVI was obtained in 378 out of 390 (97%) veins in the PVAC vs. 393 out of 393 (100%) in the CARTO group. At 1 year follow up, 73 patients in the PVAC group were free of AF compared to 67 of CARTO patients (P NS). Procedure time was significantly shorter in the PVAC group (126 ± 44min vs. 201 ± 44, p < 0.0001). At repeat, the N (total (%)/per patient) of reconnected PV's was similar after PVAC (19 patients; 50 (66%)/2.7 ± 1.1) and CARTO (20 patients; 50 (63%)/2.4 ± 1.4) (P NS). Neither the N (total/per patient (PVAC N 44; 2.3 ± 0.9 vs CARTO N 59; 3.0 ± 1.6, P NS) nor spatial distribution of conduction gaps differed between both groups. PV stenosis occurred more significantly after PVAC (4 vs. 0, p < 0.05) while pericardial injury (8 vs. 0, p < 0.05) and LA tachycardia (9 vs. 3, p < 0.05) were more frequent after CARTO. Conclusions: Pulmonary vein isolation using the PVAC catheter is as efficient but significantly faster than the conventional approach. Whereas findings at repeat were similar, their safety profile differs significantly. P021 CATHETER ABLATION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN PATIENT WITH MECHANICAL MITRAL VALVE: PVAI VS. TRIGGER ABLATION Bai R; Di Biase L; Mohanty P; Santangeli P; Mohanty S; Pump A; Sanchez J; Burkhardt JD; Horton R; Natale A Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David's Medical Center, Austin, Texas, USA Background: It has not been reported whether trigger ablation prevents more arrhythmia recurrences than standard pulmonary vein antra isolation (PVAI) in patients with mechanical mitral valve (MMV) undergoing ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: 109 patients with MMV who underwent ablation for either persistent (N = 70) or paroxysmal (N = 39) AF were divided into 2 groups: standard PVAI was performed in Group 1 (N = 45); in Group 2 (N = 64), in addition to PVAI, an isoproterenol challenge up to 30μg/min was performed and ectopic atrial beats or tachycardias (trigger activities) arising from extra‐PV foci were abolished. RF was delivered with a 3.5mm open irrigated‐tip catheter guided by CARTO map. The endpoint of procedure was complete PVAI (for both Groups 1 and 2) as well as elimination of all potential trigger sites (for Group 2). Patients were followed‐up by ECGs, transtelephonic monitoring, 7‐day Holters and office visit. Results: All patients (51 males; age 62 ± 10yrs) underwent the procedure successfully. INR on the day of ablation was 2.6 ± 0.3. There were 2 groin hematomas and 1 pericardial effusions in Group 2; while 1 diaphragmatic paralysis, 1 tamponade and 2 AV fistulae in Group 1. All except one patient in Group 2 had extra‐PV triggers. At 1‐year follow up, 39 (61%) patients in Group 2 and 7 (15%) patients in Group 1 were in sinus rhythm off AAD with single procedure (p < 0.0001). 85% of patients in Group 1 underwent redo ablation due to early recurrence of AF. Very late recurrence (32 ± 4 months) was observed in 12 (19%) patients in Group 2 and consisted of focal atrial tachycardia in 9 and atypical atrial flutter in 3 patients, which were treated with repeat ablation. Conclusion: Catheter ablation of AF in patients with MMV is feasible and safe. Trigger ablation in addition to standard PVAI was associated with less arrhythmia recurrence at follow‐up. Focal atrial tachycardia appeared to be the predominant cause of very late recurrences. P022 A FAST EVALUATION OF THE LEFT ATRIUM BEFORE ABLATION: ICETEE (INTRACARDIAC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY PROBE USED FOR TRANSOESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY) Schuster P; de Bortoli A; Chen J; Hoff PI Haukeland University Hospital, Department of Heart Disease, Bergen, Norway Aim: In high risk patients before atrial fibrillation (AF) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) we used nasogastrically an expired resterilized intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) probe (AcuNav, Siemens; 10 F) as a a simplified transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) procedure and registered the time consumption. Method: 25 patient (mean age 59 ± 9 years, 4 female) were examined without any form of sedation or anaesthesia using the ICEETEE method to exclude atrial thrombi and to determine left atrial (LA) appendage flow. 17 patients because of high CHADS2 score (>2), four paroxysmal AF patients not using preprocedural Warfarin, three patients admitted to RFA with AF unknown duration, one with unknown duration of a fast AFL and the purpose of DC conversion. Results: Due to previous painful and difficult gastroscopi one patient refused a conventional TEE before the RFA procedure. Despite good sedation, local anesthesia and an experienced operator including help of a gastroenterologist conventional TEE had failed in another patient. No difficulties during the nasogastric insertion of the probe were experienced in any patient. In all patients a good overview of the LA excluding thrombi and an acceptable LA appendage Doppler flow were demonstrated. The duration of the ICEETEE examination was 8 ± 2 min and a mean of 11 ± 5 loops were recorded. In the 24 RFA patients the ICEETEE procedure lasted 8 ± 3 min of the 208 ± 73 min of total procedure duration. No thrombembolic complications occurred during the RFA procedures. Conclusion: A simplified and fast risk stratification using an ICE probe nasogastrically as TEE is feasible and only 8 min (4%) of the total RF procedure time are needed to perform an ICEETEE examination. P023 EFFECT OF GENDER AND AGE ON RESULTS OF ABLATION OF PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Rafla S; Kamal A; Kautzner J* Alexandria Univ. Cardiology Dept, Egypt and IKEM institute, Prague, Czech Republic* This analysis assesses the effect of gender and age on the results of ablation of paroxysmal AF. Methods: We studied 150 patients (pts) (86 males and 64 females) having a mean age of 51.3 yrs, who suffered from symptomatic drug refractory paroxysmal AF. Cardiac MSCT image integration to the 3D electroanatomic LA map was used in 106 pts (70.6%, however all of them underwent intracardiac echo guided imaging during the ablation procedure. 40 pts underwent manual RF ablation using CARTO, 40 pts underwent ablation using NavX system, 70 pts underwent robotic ablation using Sensui system. Pulmonary vein isolation was done to all pts using either pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation in 116 (77.3%) or circumferential pulmonary vein ablation in 34 pts (22.7%). Circumferential PV ablation was usually associated with posterior wall ablation. Additional roof line was done in 28 pts (18.6%). All pts were followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: 34 patients (22.6%) developed early recurrence of AF after an initial blanking period of 3 months. We had 16 patients(10.6%) with treatment failure at short term follow up, this number increased to 18 patients (12%) at midterm follow up and further small increase to 20 patients(13.3%) at long term follow up, recurrences were any episode of AF and /or AFL/AT > 30 seconds after the blanking period. ECG during follow up: Normal SR 32 (80%), Atrial Tachycardia 4, PAF 2, A flutter 2. Complications rate: None in 92,5%, air embolism zero, cardiac tamponade zero, trivial pericardial effusion 1, groin hematoma 5%. There was no difference between males and females in success of ablation or complications. Those below age 50 and above 50 were not different in incidence of maintenance of SR or complications. Conclusions: Neither gender nor age had influence on success of ablation of AF or on incidence of complications. P024 A MIDTERM FOLLOW‐UP RESULT OF SIMPLIFIED MAZE PROCEDURE BASED ON RADIOFREQUENCY PV BOX ISOLATION Imai K; Sueda T; Bagus H; Katayama K; Takahashi S; Takasaki T; Kurosaki T; Uchida N Department of Cardiovascular Surgery Introduction: It has been reported that some less invasive modified Cox‐maze procedures were effective for limited patients. We report a midterm follow‐up result of our simplified procedure based on PV Box isolation for permanent/chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) combined with several type of organic heart disease. Methods: Among a total of 194 cases, we extracted 93 cases that received modified maze procedures; pulmonary vein box isolation (PVBI) or hybrid procedure (HBP). The HBP consisted of 1) circumferential isolation of four pulmonary veins (this is "PVBI") with monopolar or bipolar device, 2) radiofrequency ablation (RF) between PVBI‐line and mitral annulus (with monopolar or bipolar), 3) RF for RA isthmus (bottom line of Koch's triangle and between RA incision and coronary sinus orifice with monopolar or pen type bipolar) and 4) RF from IVC to RA incision line. We divided the patients based on their etiological background and analyzed the operative results in overall, every groups and between groups retrospectively. Results: Overall freedom from recurrent AF was 80% at latest follow up. The significant (p < 0.01) predicting factor of AF recurrence were AF duration, amplitude of V1‐f wave and LAD. In the patients of bi‐atrial strain (mitral regurgitation + tricuspid regurgitation), the AF free rate in the HBP group was significantly higher than that in PVBI (91% vs. 68%, p = 0.0307) without any differences of their backgrounds. Conclusions: For further improvement of operative outcomes with lesser invasion, it may be necessary to choose the tailored procedure based on the etiology. P025 USE OF PARTIALLY WITHDRAWN CORONARY SINUS CATHETER TO EVALUATE CAVOTRICUSPID ISTHMUS BLOCK DURING RADIOFREQUENCY CATHETER ABLATION Marinskis G; Aidietis A; Kaireviciute D; Jurkuvenas P; Bagdonas K Clinic of Cardiac and Vascular Diseases, Vilnius University Purpose: to assess feasibility of verification of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) block by evaluation of low right atrial activation sequence using coronary sinus (CS) electrode withdrawn to the inferior vena cava (IVC) orifice. Methods: in 167 patients (pts) who underwent CTI ablation for typical atrial flutter, presence of cavotricuspid block has been verified by halo catheter or evaluation of low lateral right atrial activation sequence by ablation catheter, and comparison of His bundle electrogram (HBE) and proximal coronary sinus (PCS) atrial activation timing. In all pts, decapolar CS catheters with 5 mm inter‐electrode space and 10 mm space between electrode pairs have been introduced using femoral approach. After prolongation of CTI conduction times, CS electrode was withdrawn to the IVC orifice and timing of atrial activation on the proximal (5th) pair and the 4th pair of electrodes has been compared. Results: when complete CTI block has been achieved, pacing lateral to ablation line has been accompanied by "bracketing" of low right atrial activation – activation on the proximal pair (closer to ablation line) was later than activation on the 4th pair. That was seen in 127 of patients with CTI block (sensitivity 76%, specificity 100%). In 40 pts with complete CTI block after extensive ablation close to CS ostium, either the signals on the proximal pair could not be appreciated, or atrial activation on this pair was the earliest. Conclusion: evaluation of low right atrial activation sequence by coronary sinus catheter partially withdrawn to the inferior vena cava helps to confirm cavotricuspid isthmus block after ablation. P026 SERUM n‐3/n‐6 POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID RATIO IS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF SINUS RHYTHM MAINTENANCE AFTER CATHETER ABLATION OF PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Nakanishi H; Hirata A; Okada M; Kashiwase K; Nishio M; Asai M; Nemoto T; Matsuo K; Konishi S; Ueda Y Cardiovascular Division, Osaka Police Hospital, Osaka, Japan Purpose: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Despite advances in rhythm control including catheter ablation (CA), the effect on secondary prevention of AF is not completely established. There have been some evidences that the n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anti‐arrhythmic effects, however, these effects are controversial. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of the serum n‐3/n‐6 PUFA ratio on the rate of SR maintenance after CA of paroxysmal AF (pAF). Methods: We assessed 38 patients with pAF. The serum n‐3/n‐6 PUFA ratio was defined as an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) / arachidonic acid (AA) ratio. All the serum samples were obtained before admission. In the procedure, all patients underwent bilateral extensive encircling pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. Additional procedures (left atrial (LA) linear [1 patient], complex fractionated atrial electrograms [3 patients], non‐PV foci [2 patients], or cavo‐tricuspid isthmus [15 patients]) were performed as necessary. The definition of AF recurrence was one more than 3 months after the procedure. In this study, no patients were taking purified EPA ethyl ester agent. Results: 27 patients maintained SR, while 11 patients had recurrence of AF. SR maintenance group had significant higher serum EPA/AA ratio (0.50 ± 0.20 vs. 0.29 ± 0.11, p = 0.002) than AF recurrence group. There were no significant differences between two groups in age (64.0 ± 10.6 vs. 59.3 ± 14.0 yrs, p = NS), gender (15 (56%) vs. 7 (64%) males %, p = NS), LA diameter (39.5 ± 4.4 vs. 42.5 ± 6.4 mm, p = NS), left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (67.7 ± 5.9 vs. 68.3 ± 6.6%, p = NS), LV end‐diastolic dimension (49.1 ± 5.2 vs. 51.3 ± 4.2 mm, p = NS), CHADS2 score (0.7 ± 0.7 vs. 1.3 ± 1.1, p = NS), follow up period (11.7 ± 6.0 vs. 15.6 ± 7.8 mths, p = NS), and antiarrhythmic drugs after procedure (8 (30%) vs. 4 (36%), p = NS). Conclusions: Serum n‐3/n‐6 PUFA ratio is important for secondary prevention after CA of pAF. P027 RATIONALE AND DESIGN OF VATCAT: VIDEO‐ASSISTED THORACOSCOPIC PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION VERSUS PERCUTANOUS CATHETER ABLATION IN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION TRIAL Velthuis BO; Stevenhagen J; Storm van Leeuwen RPH; Speekenbrink RGH; van der Palen J; Scholten MF; VATCAT Medisch Spectrum Twente Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that radiofrequency isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVI) and surgically video‐assisted thorascopic pulmonary vein isolation (VATS‐PVI) are acceptable or even superior alternatives to anti‐arrhythmic drug therapy in patients with symptomatically paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data comparing effectiveness in both interventions are limited. Objective: The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of PVI and VATS‐PVI. The secondary objective is the comparison of duration and costs of hospitalization, discomfort during admission, experienced AF burden during follow‐up and time to recurrence. Methods: The Video‐Assisted Thoracoscopic pulmonary vein isolation versus percutaneous Catheter Ablation in atrial fibrillation Trial (VATCAT) is a prospective single center study. 160 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF will be randomized to percutaneous PVI or VATS‐PVI. After a stabilization period of 90 days, which allows for a second procedure, 7‐day Holter‐ECG will be done at 3, 6 and 12 months. Treatment failure will be defined as reoccurrence of AF exceeding 30 seconds. Results: Inclusion started in August 2010, currently 40 patients are included. 22 patients were treated of which 9 received VATS therapy. Conclusion: This study should provide data on the effectiveness of either PVI strategy based on intensive rhythm observation. It is unique because, to the best of our knowledge, no previous randomized trial comparing both strategies has been published. P028 USEFULNESS OF CONTRAST INTRACARDIAC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN PERFORMING PV BALLOON OCCLUSION DURING CRYO‐ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Maines M; Catanzariti D; Angheben C; Cemin C; Giovanelli C; Vergara G Division of Cardiology, S. Maria del Carmine Hospital, Rovereto (TN) Introduction: Cryoballoon ablation (CBA) has proven very effective for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (PVI) if complete mechanical occlusion is achieved and conventionally assessed by angiographic injection of contrast within PV lumen. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of saline contrast intracardiac echocardiography (CE) in guiding CBA. Methods: Twenty consecutive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were assigned to fluoroscopy plus CFD (n = 10; group 1: iodinated medium as both an angiographic and an echographic contrast) versus CE plus CFD (n = 10; group 2: saline contrast) for guidance of CBA. CFD‐guidance was used only in pull‐down approaches (16% in the study) in both groups. Results: We evaluated 227 occlusion of 71 PVs. CE‐guided assessment of occlusion, defined as the loss of echocontrastographic back‐flow to the left atrium after saline injection regardless of the visualization of PV antrum, showed a high level of agreement with the angiographic diagnosis of occlusion. PVI rate was similar in both groups and effectively guided by CE (PVI using ≤ 2 double cryofreezes: 89% of PVs in gr. 1 vs 91% in gr. 2; P = n.s.). Group 2 patients (CE guidance) had significantly shorter procedure (128 ± 17 minutes vs 153 ± 18; P < 0.05) and fluoroscopy times (30 ± 11 minutes vs 42 ± 9, P < 0.05) and used lower iodinated contrast (90 ± 25 mL vs 191 ± 45, P < 0.05). Conclusion: PV occlusion and PVI during cryoablation can be effectively predicted by CE. This technique reduces radiological exposure and iodinated contrast use. P029 NO DIFFERENCE IN TRIGGER INDUCIBILITY DURING ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION PERFORMED WITH GENERAL ANESTHESIA Mountantonakis SE; Kondapalli L; Marchlinski F; Hutchinson M Electrophysiology Section, Division of Cardiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA Background: General anesthesia (GA) has been increasingly utilized during catheter ablation of AF. When AF ablation is performed under GA, many operators do not intentionally elicit AF triggers with catecholamine infusion due to concern for either excessive medication‐induced hypotension or autonomic‐dependence of trigger induction. We sought to determine whether patients undergoing AF ablation with GA had fewer provocable triggers than patients whose procedures were performed under conscious sedation alone. Methods: 23 patients who underwent AF ablation under GA (Group 1) were matched for age, gender, ejection fraction, left atrial size and type of atrial fibrillation with 23 patients who underwent catheter ablation under conscious sedation (Group II). Patients in Group 1 were maintained under general anesthesia with intravenous propofol; those in Group 2 were anesthetized with boluses of midazolam and fentanyl without airway support. Both groups received escalating doses of isoproterenol (ISO) until either: 1) a maximal dose of 20 mcg/min was achieved or 2) AF was induced. We included only pulmonary vein or non‐pulmonary vein triggers which initiated AF in the analysis. If necessary, intravenous phenylephrine was administered via bolus (25 mcg) and/or continuous infusion (up to 200 mcg/min) to maintain a mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg. The incidence of AF triggers between the two groups was compared. Results: AF triggers were identified in 19/23 patients from Group I and 18/23 patients from Group II (83% vs. 78%; p = 0.9). There was no difference in trigger site or the total ISO required between the 2 groups (15.8 vs 14.8mcg/min, p 0.624). The use of phenylephrine was more frequent in Group I (83% vs. 52%, p = 0.028). Conclusion: The use of GA does not appear to inhibit the provocation of AF triggers. Although ISO‐induced hypotension is more often required in patients under GA, effective doses of ISO can be reliably achieved with phenylephrine infusion. P030 RADIOFREQUENCY CATHETER ABLATION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN RETIREED PATIENTS Ardashev AV; Konev AV; Zhelyakov EG; Rybachenko MS; *Belenkov YuN 83 Clinical Hospital of FMBA, * Lomonosov State University, Moscow, Russia Aim: To assess effectiveness and safety of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) in elderly pts with paroxysmal, persistent and permanent AF. Methods: Study was conducted on 214 pts who underwent primary RFA of AF. 76 of them were older than 60 years of age and underwent 93 procedures. The mean age was 68 ± 3.5 years (22 females). The mean duration for AF was 8.7 ± 6.5 years. 36 had paroxysmal, 19 had persistent AF and 21 had permanent AF despite use of 1.7 ± 0.4 antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD). All pts were divided into two groups. First group consisted of 60 pts ranged from 60 to 70 years old (mean age – 65.7 ± 3.5 years), second group concluded of 16 pts ranged from 71 to 83 years old (mean age – 73.7 ± 2.4 years). The ablation strategy consisted of wide‐area circumferential lines around pulmonary veins, roof lines and extensive RFA of the left atrial substrate modification using a three‐dimensional mapping system. Follow up consisted of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months out‐patient clinical visiting after de‐novo RF‐procedure and included of repetitive 24 hour Holter monitoring. Results: There were no complications associated with RFA. 24 (40%) pts of the first group vs 5 (31%) pts of the second subgroup had arrhythmia of the blanking period (p = 0.84) 10 (17%) pts of the first group vs 5 (31%) pts of the second group underwent redo procedures because of atypical atrial flutter, focal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation in period from 6 to 12 months after primary RFA (p = 0.009) because of failure to sinus rhythm control using combined RFA and AAD approach. The incidence of stable sinus rhythm in the first/second groups were 60%/69%, 72%/69%, 83%/81% and 92%/75% at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Conclusion: RFA is a safe and effective treatment for elderly patients with AF. One year arrhythmia free survival rate was higher in patients ranged from 60 to 70 years old. P031 EVALUATION OF ESOPHAGEAL DISPLACEMENTS DURING PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION IN PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A; Kamlofsky M; Banega R Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Purpose: Catheter ablation represents a substantial achievement in AF treatment but this technique is not free from complications. Atrio esophagic fistula has been described as an infrequent but lethal complication. The aim of this study is describe esophagus position shifts using the shadow function. Methods: Single‐center prospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent ablation of atrial fibrillation and received a MSCT‐64 prior to ablation between May 2009 and May 2011. A multislice 64 computed tomography was optimized for imaging of pulmonary veins. We performed the tridimensional reconstruction of the esophagus. We designed the left atrium shell and the esophagus position with a quadripolar EP catheter inside the esophagus lumen. We obtain the fiducially points from the pulmonary vein ostium and transport passively the esophagus acquired points obtained during shell construction. If esophagus tract fit with 3D Esophagus reconstruction its position was assessed by using the Nav X Shadow tool during the entire procedure. Significant displacements were defined as those presenting a more than 3 mm shift between the esophagus passive fusion and the 'in vivo' position determined by the shadow function. Results: 153 patients were included with a mean age 61 ± 9.7 yrs, 90% male and a mean BMI of 26.5 ± 6.4 kg/m2. 142 (93%) patients were in sinus rhythm at time of MSCT‐64. We determine the esophagus tract in 146 patients (95%). In 17 patients it was impossible to perform the reconstruction because of technique problems in acquisition image. Significant displacements were observed in 21 patients (15%) and 125 (85%) showed no significant position shifts (p value <0.05). Conclusions: The present study suggests that the Esophagus does not present significant position shifts during PVI. Shadows tool confirm that initial assessment of esophagus position after 3D reconstruction is safe and precisely to guide PVI procedure. P032 CONTINUATION OF VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS AS ACCEPTABLE ANTICOAGULATION REGIMEN IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION Oude Velthuis B; Stevenhagen YJ; van Opstal JM; Scholten MF Medisch Spectrum Twente Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that radiofrequency isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVI) is an effective treatment for symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Based on these positive results, non‐ pharmacological therapy has been incorporated in the guidelines for drug refractory atrial fibrillation, resulting in an increased popularity. The prevention of thromboembolic complications remains an important issue. Methods: In January 2010, we adopted an anticoagulation strategy based on continuation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and selective use of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). We retrospectively analyzed the results of this strategy in all patients referred for PVI treatment. VKAs were started for all patients 2 months prior to treatment. Discontinuation of oral anticoagulation was considered 3 months after treatment based on thromboembolic and bleeding risk profile. Bleeding and thromboembolic complications were registered during outpatient clinic follow‐up up until 3 months. Results: We performed 151 PVI procedures from January 2010 to March 2011. All patients were seen 6 weeks after discharge. No transient ischemic accident or ischemic cerebrovascular incident occurred pre‐, peri‐ or postprocedure. Four (2.7%) procedures were complicated by tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. Conclusions: Our data support the increasing evidence for continuation of periprocedural administration of VKAs complemented by a selective TEE approach as a safe therapy for thromboembolic complications. P033 EFFECTIVNESS OF AF ABLATION STRATEGIES IN "YOUNG" AF‐ABLATION CENTER Chasnoits A; Goncharik D; Halianishcha V; Kovalenko O; Persidskikh Y; Plaschinskaya L Republican Scientific and Practical Center "Cardiology", Minsk, Belarus Purpose of the study: to estimate effectiveness and time consumption of 3 different strategies of ablation in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in condition of first starting AF‐ablation center. Methods: 35 consecutive patients underwent Carto XP Merge endocardial ablation procedure. Follow up period was 3 – 18 month. Data presented as Median (Q25; Q75). Summary: Patient divided into 3 groups: 1) ganglionary plexi (GP)‐ablation (n = 11 (4 females), age 55.0 (50.0, 58.0). AF duration 6,50 (4,0; 8,0) years; left atrium (LA) size 41,50 (36,50; 47,00) mm). 2) pulmonary vein (PV)‐isolation (n = 18 (5 females), age 52,50 (48,0; 62,0) years, AF duration 2,00 (1,00; 2,00) years, LA size 41,00 (40,0; 42,0) mm). 3) PV + GP ablation group. (n = 6 (1 female), age 54 (44,0; 59,0), AF duration 4,0 (3,0; 8,0) years, LA size 42,0 (37,0; 42,0) mm). Time of procedure does not significantly differ between groups 4,0 (5,0; 6,0) hour, 3,5 (4,88; 5,5) hour, and 4,0 (4,0; 6,0) hour respectively. After at least 3 month post procedure in GP‐group 5 patient out of 11 were in sinus rhythm (45,45%); in PV‐group 12 out of 18 were in sinus rhythm (66,66%); and in PV + GP‐group – all 6 patients (100%) were in sinus rhythm. Average effectiveness resulted as follows: 23 patients out of 35 (65,71%) were in sinus rhythm. Statistical analysis by Kruskal‐Wallis, Mann‐Whitney and Fisher exact p, two‐tailed tests showed significantly better effectiveness (p < 0,05) only in PV + GP‐group than in GP‐group. GP‐ablation and PV‐isolation groups do not differ in effectiveness by this number of patients. Conclusion: Effectiveness of GP‐ablation and PV isolation does not significantly differ in firs starting AF‐ablation center, but results in group PV + GP are significantly better than in just GP‐group, what is connected to size of myocardial critical mass, involved by PV + GP ablation. It does not take additional time to perform GP‐ablation, doing PV‐isolation. We suggest performing a GP + PV ablation technique. P034 SEQUENTIAL APPROACH FOR TREATMENT OF LONGSTANDING PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Revishvili A; Matsonashvili G; Labartkava E; Serguladze S; Shmul A; Kvasha B Bakoulev Scientific Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, Moscow, Russia Nowadays surgical ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF) is thought to be the most effective approach. But still postablative atrial tachycardias (PAT) can be observed in a short period after intervention because of incomplete lesions. Subsequent percutaneous ablation can improve success rate by precise elimination of critical gap‐zones. From May 2007 to June 2011 55 consecutive patients (40 patients with concomitant valvular pathology and 15 patients with failed prior to surgery percutaneous ablations) with symptomatic PAF (mean arrhythmia duration 6 ± 2 years, mean age 56 ± 4 years, mean left atrial volume 180 ± 22 ml., mean EF 58 ± 5%), refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy, underwent bipolar modification of MAZE procedure (MAZE IV) using the Atricure system. Within 14 days after surgery PAT was observed in 7 cases (14%). These patients underwent electrophysiological (EP) study and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). During mean follow up of 14 ± 2 months 49 patients (98%) had stable sinus rhythm, 1 patient (2%) required dual chamber pacemaker implantation because of symptomatic sinus bradycardia. No peri‐operative complications were observed. In 7 patients with PAT during EP study next observations were registered: 1 patient with left atrial ectopic tachycardia because of restoration of conduction from left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV), 1 patient with typical atrial flutter with cycle length (CL) 235 ms and 5 patients with left atrial flutter (mean CL 240 ± 15 ms). During mapping critical sites of left atrial (LA) flutters were found at LA ridge (3 patients) and at LSPV‐LA roof junction(2 patients). All arrhythmias were successfully ablated and during mean follow‐up of 2 ± 1,2 years no evidence of any tachycardia was registered on repetitive Holter monitoring. Two‐step approach can improve long term success for maintaining sinus rhythm and can increase effectiveness of invasive methods of treatment of PAF. P035 DETECTION OF ATRIAL EXCITATION CHAN‐ GES FOLLOWING CIRCUMFERENTIAL PULMONARY VEINS ISOLATION USING WAVELET ANALYSIS Vassilikos V; Dakos G; Chouvarda I; Paraskevaidis S; Mantziari L; Hatzizisis I; Tsilonis K; Maglaveras N; Styliadis I 1st Cardiology Dept, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece The aim of this study was to investigate differences in P wave duration and excitation characteristics following circumferential pulmonary veins (CPV) isolation using P wave wavelet analysis. Methods: We studied 33 patients (20 males, mean age 52.5 ± 7 years) which underwent CPV isolation because of non‐responsive to drugs atrial fibrillation. The recordings were obtained during sinus rhythm before and after PV isolation with a 3 – channel digital recorder for 10 minutes and digitized with a 16–bit accuracy at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The PVs were isolated in pairs using the Nav‐X mapping system. The P wave was analyzed using the Morlet wavelet and wavelet parameters expressing the mean and max energy of P wave were calculated in the three orthogonal leads (X, Y, Z) in three frequency bands (1st: 200–160 Hz, 2nd: 150–100 Hz and 3nd: 90–50 Hz). Nonparametric Wilcoxon matched‐pairs signed‐rank test was used for comparing continuous variables, while p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Following CPV isolation, P wave duration at X, Y and Z axes was significantly shorter (96.8 ± 18 vs 86.7 ± 12msec, p < 0.001, 99.3 ± 14.7 vs 89.9 ± 13.8msec, p = 0.001 and 99.5 ± 17 vs 91.3 ± 15msec, p = 0.001, respectively), while mean and man energy in all frequency bands at X and Y axes along with mean energy in all frequency bands at Z axis were significantly lower. Conclusions: P wave wavelet analysis demonstrates significant differences in atrial conduction patterns following CPV isolation, as suggested by the shortening of P wave duration and the lower wavelet energies. P036 TNT DEMONSTRATES COMPARABLE IMPACT OF CIRCULAR MULTIELECTRODE AND IRRIGATED COOL TIP CATHETERS IN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION Herstad J; Hoff PI; de Bortoli A; Solheim E; Lizhi S; Chen J; Schuster P Haukeland University Hospital, Department of Heart Disease, Bergen, Norway Aim: Comparing the level of myocardial injury by measuring TnT using non‐irrigated circular multielectrode or irrigated cool tip catheters. Method: 40 patients (mean age 53 ± 12 years, 10 females) underwent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for paroxysmal (n = 36) or persistent (n = 4) atrial fibrillation. A multielectrode low energy phased radiofrequency catheter (PVAC, Medtronic Ablation Frontiers Inc, USA; n = 20, group 1) or 3‐D mapping system, irrigated cool tip catheter and circular mapping catheter for demonstrating PVI (n = 20, group 2) were used. TnT (ng/L) was measured 15–22 hours post procedural. Results: No significant differences in age or sex were demonstrated between the groups and no complications were observed. In group 1 procedure time was significantly lower (150 versus 193 min, p < 0,05) and X‐ray duration shorter (26 versus 36 min, p < 0,05). The applied RF energy (43 min (group 1) versus 55 min (group 2), p = ns) resulted in a not significant different release of TnT between the groups (720 ± 352 versus 1397 ± 1134, p = 0,06). The time corrected TnT release per minute ablation (21 ± 12 versus 26 ± 17, p = ns) was similar. Conclusion: Signal controlled PVI using multielectrode radiofrequency catheters compared to irrigated cool tip catheters results in a similar myocardial injury suggesting comparable impact in shorter procedure time and shorter X‐ray duration. P037 THE LONG‐TERM SAFETY OF ANTICOAGULATION STRATEGY AFTER RADIOFREQUENCY CATHETER ABLATION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Park JH; Ko KJ; Han PK; Lim RS; Jang JK; Park HC; Kim YH Korea University Arrhythmia Center Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of standard anticoagulation (SA) over 3 months after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) in comparison with the early‐stopped warfarinization (EW) within 3 months. Methods and Results: We compared safety between SA (n = 50) and EW (n = 59) group in 109 patients who underwent RFCA of AF (78 males, 55.9 ± 11 years old, paroxysmal AF 59.6%, CHADS2 score 1.5 ± 0.9, duration of follow up 693.1 ± 234.6 days, duration of AF 46.7 ± 42.5 months). Results: There was no significant difference in CHADS2 score (1.5 ± 0.9 vs 1.4 ± 0.8, P = NS) between SA and EW group. Compared to EW group, uninterrupted preprocedural warfarinization (70.6% vs 39.4%, P = 0.014) was greater in SA group, therefore, INR value (1.47 ± 0.51 vs 1.14 ± 0.28, P = 0.002) at the procedure was higher. However, the incidence of hemorrhagic complications (11.9% vs 6.0%, P = NS) or the thromboembolic events (1.7% vs 0.0%, P = NS) was not different between two groups. Conclusion: In patients with low to intermediate risk of thromboembolism (mean CHADS2 1.5) early stopped warfarinization within 3 months after catheter ablation of AF had comparable safety with warfarinization over 3 months. Further prospective study in large scale is warranted to determine long‐term safety of each anticoagulation strategy. P038 INCIDENCE OF SUPERIOR VENA CAVA ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY DURING ATRIAL FIBRILLATION RADIOFREQUENCY TREATMENT Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Introduction: It is widely known that almost 94% of atrial fibrillation triggers are located in pulmonary veins and only few are located in extrapulmonary vessels. Nevertheless, new ablation techniques including superior vena cava (SVC) isolation have demonstrated higher success rates. Objective: To determine the incidence of SVC electrical activity in patients elegible for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as a methodological approach to understand atrial fibrillation (AF) pathophisiology in a huge cohort of patients. Method: Single‐center analysis of consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary vein isolation ablation between may 2009 and january 2011. Electrical activity in SVC was assessed by placing a circular multipolar catheter (Optima, St. Jude medical) inside the vessel. The SVC electrical activity was defined as the registry of potentials inside this structure (impulse conduction between right atrium and SVC) as far as 5 cm by the Optima catheter during sinus rhythm or AF. Results: A total of 107 patients were included. Electrical activity in SVC was assessed in only 42 patients; 90.47% male; Mean age 48 ± 8,4 years; 73.80% presented as paroxysmal AF. A total of 16 patients (38.09%) showed SVC electrical activity. Conclusion: This study confirms a high prevalence, almost 40%, of SVC electrical activity in patients referred for PVI. If this finding become in a new goal in AF treatment has to be determine in future trials. P039 PREVALENCE, CHARACTERISTICS AND PREDICTORS OF PULMONARY VEIN NARROWING AFTER PVAC ABLATION De Greef Y; Tavernier R; Raeymaeckers S; Schwagten B; Desurgeloose D; De Keulenaer G; Stockman D; Duytschaever M Department of Cardiology, Antwerp Cardiovascular Institute Middelheim, Belgium Background: The risk and determinants of pulmonary vein narrowing (PVN) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using a novel multi‐electrode ablation catheter (PVAC) are unknown. Methods and Results: PV diameters (PVD) and left atrial (LA) volume were compared by computed tomography before and 3 months after PVI using duty‐cycled phased RF energy (2:1 or 4:1 bipolar/unipolar ratio) in 50 patients. PVD was measured in a coronal and axial view at three levels (A = ostium, B = 1cm more distal, C = 2cm more distal). Moderate PVN was defined as a PVD reduction of 25–50%, severe PVN as > 50%. Axial PVD shortened by 17 ± 16%, 14 ± 16% and 8 ± 22% at level A, B and C respectively (p < 0,001 for all); coronal PVD decreased by 16 ± 14%, 13 ± 17% and 7 ± 19% (p < 0,001 for all). Moderate PVN occurred in 55/200 PVs (28%) in 36 patients (72%); severe PVN occurred in 8/200PVs (4%) in 7 patients (14%). The left superior PV and the number of 2:1 applications were predictors for PVN. LA volume decreased by 10 ± 18% (p < 0,001). Conclusions: PVAC ablation results in a consistent moderate reduction of the PVD predominantly at the ostium. PV narrowing occurred more frequently in the LSPV and was related to the number of 2:1 applications. Severe PVN in 14% of patients, raises concerns about the risk for clinical PV stenosis. P040 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION TREATED WITH PULMONARY VEINS ABLATION:PATIENTS PROFILE AND LIFE QUALITY Fernandez‐Oliver AL(1); Mgueraman‐Jilali R; (1) ELECTROPHISIOLOGY AND ARRHYTHM UNIT Universitary Hospital Virgen de la Victoria. Malaga. Spain Purpose. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent arrhythmia with significant impact on patients' life quality. Pulmonary veins ablation (PVA) offer new treatment expectations. Purposes: 1. To assess daily living activities changes, the patient quality of life as a result of arrhythmia, and changes after PVA. 2. To get the profile of patients with AF those who perform PVA. Method. Quantitative, retrospective, descriptive study. Sample of 44 patients (56 procedures) underwent PVA (March 2008–August 2009). We custom‐assessment interview prior to the procedure and post‐ablation to 3,6 and 9 months for assessing the impact it was on issues as respiratory distress, palpitations, difficulty performing daily activities. Were also given to patients health questionnaire EQ‐5D to responses objectively. Also we discussed Holter records evaluation to verify presence of sinus rhythm or AF recurrence. Results. Mean age 51 years (19‐72), 66% men; 65% of patients improved significantly their quality of life, refer unwell without pain /discomfort, assessing their current health status markedly improved (39% according rating scale). 50% following a 15% to more than one and 19% waiting for a new procedure; 12% were asymptomatic before PVA. We obtained a profile highlighting: Overweight ‐ Obesity (86.3%) and Hypertension (43.2%). Emphasize that 22.7% have no CVRF, 29.5% have one, 31.8% two, 13.6% three, and 2.2% four CVRF. Detected greater success 72.4% males vs. 40% women (p = 0.03). Conclusions. Despite the information given on CVRF remains high prevalence assessing the need for modification, corrective strategies and approach to heart‐healthy living habits. We need to plan a continuity care program, information and control of CVRF. Care plans implementation and data transmission between hospital and primary health care centers increases the efficacy and safety of the PVA treatment, while increasing the patient perception of safety, quality and continuity of care. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT P041 MANAGEMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN EMERGENCY ROOMS OF 23 MIDDLE EASTERN HOSPITALS: FINDINGS FROM GULF RACE Zubaid M; Rashed W; Alsheikh‐Ali AA; AlMahmeed W; Shehab A; Sulaiman K; Al‐Zakwani I; Al Qudaimi A; Asaad N; Amin H; Gulf SAFE Registry Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Kuwait Purpose: To study emergency room (ER) management strategies of patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Middle East. Methods: We used data from the Gulf Survey of Atrial Fibrillation Events (Gulf SAFE), a prospective multinational registry of consecutive AF patients presenting to ERs of 23 hospitals in the Gulf region of the Middle East between October 2009 and June 2010. Results: Of 2043 patients enrolled, we analyzed data from 923 patients whose primary reason for ER visit was AF (age 52 ± 16, age ≥ 75 (9%), 56% male, 26% with diabetes, 48% with hypertension, 12% with history of heart failure, 6% with prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 17% with history of significant valvular disease). Types of AF were: first attack 46%, paroxysmal 26%, persistent 11%, permanent 16% and not known 1%. Majority of patients (75%) presented to ER within 48 hours of symptom onset. While in ER, 98 patients (11%) had spontaneous cardioversion. Out of the remaining 825 patients the ER management strategy was rate control in 482 patients (59%) and rhythm control in 341 patients (41%). Cardioversion was attempted during ER stay in 226 patients (27%). Electrical cardioversion was used in 24 patients (11%) and pharmacological cardioversion in 202 patients (89%). The remaining 115 patients were admitted to hospital for cardioversion. Among those cardioverted pharmacologically in ER amiodarone was the drug used in the majority of patients (64%), propafenone was used in about one third of patients and all other antiarrhythmic drugs were used in only 5% of the patients. Majority of patients (76%) were admitted to hospital independent of the management strategy used and even after successful cardioversion in ER. Conclusions: Despite being relatively young with a short history of AF duration, most patients Admitted to ER Primarily for AF were not cardioverted and a majority got admitted to hospital. P042 HOW BENIGN IS ATRIAL FIBRILLATION? A LOOK AT THE ONSET (THE FIRST EPISODE) Fraile A; Goicolea L; Perea JA; Villanueva A; Kallmeyer C; Galán L; González‐Panizo J; González A; Zorita B; García‐Cosío F Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Madrid. Spain Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) is often considered a benign arrhythmia in which attempts to recover and maintain of sinus rhythm might be deleterious, however some studies suggest a poor prognosis at the outset of the arrhythmia. Objective: To study the prognosis of patients after a first episode of AF in an industrial city in the center of Spain, 250000 in population, served by one public hospital. Methods: We registered all patients seen in the emergency room (ER) during the year 2010, with a previously undetected AF. Clinical evolution of admitted patients was obtained from clinical records. Discharged patients were followed in a dedicated clinic 15 ± days post discharge. Results: We registered 75 patients with a first episode of AF, 21 (28%) needed hospitalization: in 6 (28.6%) due to congestive heart failure, 4 chest pain (19′1%), respiratory insufficiency in 2 (9.5%), cerebrovascular accident in 2 (9.5%), poor ventricular rate control in 2 (9'5%), and in 5 (23.8%) other causes nonrelated to cardiovascular disease. The reason for ER visit among those discharged was: palpitations in 23 (42.6%), dyspnea in 7 (13%), chest pain in 6 (11.1%) and neurological symptoms in 6 (11.1%). In 10 patients (18.5%) AF was an incidental finding, and 2 (3.7%) patients consulted for other reasons. As compared to those discharged from the ER, hospitalized patients were older (71.2 vs. 63.9 y, p 0.043) with more associated disorders: hypertension (76.2% vs. 50%, p 0.011); valvular heart disease (23.1% vs. 16%, p 0.005); cerebrovascular accidents (19% vs. 9.2%, p 0.019). Two patients died during hospitalization: one from respiratory distress syndrome and another of aspiration pneumonia. Conclusions: The initial episode of AF prompts hospitalization in 28% of the cases. Advanced age, hypertension, structural heart disease and neurological complications are the factors associated with the more severe clinical pictures. Death is not rare during this first episode of AF (1.5%). P043 EFFECTS OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODE ABLATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION CANDIDATE FOR CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Moghaddam M; Bagher Zadeh A; Moshkani Farahani M Jam Hospital, Tehran, Iran Objectives: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an important advance for the treatment of end stage heart failure (HF). The aims of this study were (i) to assess the clinical benefit of CRT in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and (ii) to evaluate the impact of Atrioventricular junctional (AVJ) ablation on the outcome of AF patients undergoing CRT. Method: A total of 68 permanent AF patients were included in this prospective study and CRT implantation. The patients randomized in 2 groups, 34 Patients received optimal medication to control ventricular rate and other 34 patients underwent an AVJ ablation and were followed up for 21 ± 11 months. Clinical parameters and echocardiographic parameters were compared at baseline and after a follow‐up of 1 and 6 months after and every 6 months thereafter. Patients were evaluated for the occurrence of cardiac death, hospitalization for HF, and responsiveness to CRT (improvement of 1 (NYHA) class at 6 months). Results: Although EF and NYHA class was improved with marginal significance, QRS duration and severity of Mitral Regurgitation was not significantly changed in Medical Therapy group but all of these parameters were significantly improved in AVJ ablation group. Although the clinical characteristics was somewhat improved in both groups after CRT implantation, the improvement was much higher in AVJ ablation group. Conclusion: Beneficial effects of CRT could be noticed in a significant number of AF patients, therefore these patients should not be excluded from CRT implantations. AF without AVJ ablation was an independent predictor of hospital admissions and non‐responsiveness to CRT. Performing AVJ ablation in AF patients undergoing CRT seems crucial to attain maximal clinical benefit. P044 SLEEP QUALITY IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Kayrak M; Gul EE; Alibaşiç H; Abdulhalikov T; Gunduz M; Aribas A; Yazici M; Ozdemir K; Cardiology/Arrhythmia Selcuk University, Meram School of Medicine, Cardiology Department, Konya, Turkey Background: Although, AF was related with impaired quality of life (QoL), decreased functional physical activity, and elevated levels of anxiety and depression in clinical investigation, little is known about the level of sleep quality (SQ) in patients with AF. We aimed to examine self reported SQ of patients with AF. Methods‐Materials: Ninety‐one patients with a history of asymptomatic non‐valvular AF (mean age 62 ± 10 years) and 110 age and gender‐matched patients with sinus rhythm were recruited. Patients with heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, severe valvular heart disease, and cerebrovascular accident were excluded from the study. Echocardiography was performed in all study population. SQ was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI scoring yielded seven components: subjective SQ (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), sleep efficiency (C4), sleep disturbances (C5), use of sleep medications (C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). A global PSQI score > 5 indicated ''poor sleepers". Main Results: Demographic features were comparable between groups. Also, echocardiographic measurements were similar in two groups. The prevalence of '' poor sleepers" was significantly higher in patients with AF compared to patients with sinus rhythm (76% vs. 45%, p < 0.001). In addition, patients' global PSQI score was also increased in AF group compared with control group (9.4 ± 4.6 vs. 5.8 ± 4.1, p < 0.001, respectively). In a multivariate regression model, predictors of poor SQ was found as HT (odds: 1.9 (1.2–3.6 with 95% CI)) and AF (odds: 3.7 (1.9–6.8 with 95% CI)). However, age, gender, and BMI did not predict a poor SQ in this model. Nevertheless the effect of diabetes on SQ was in a trend of significance (p = 0.06). Conclusion: Poor SQ is a potentially important problem in patients with AF and may be determined with PSQI score, a simple screening tool. P045 CORRELATION BETWEEN WARFARIN PRESCRIPTION AND STROKE RISK AMONG MIDDLE EASTERN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: DATA FROM THE GULF SURVEY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION EVENTS (GULF SAFE) Zubaid M; Rashed W; Alsheikh‐Ali AA; AlMahmeed W; Shehab A; Sulaiman K; Al‐Zakwani I; Al Qudaimi A; Asaad N; Amin H; Gulf SAFE Registry Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Kuwait Purpose: To describe anticoagulation use among patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Middle East and its relation to stroke risk. Methods: We used data from the Gulf Survey of Atrial Fibrillation Events (Gulf SAFE), a prospective multinational registry of consecutive AF patients presenting to emergency rooms of 23 hospitals in the Gulf region of the Middle East between October 2009 and June 2010. Results: Of 2043 patients enrolled, we analyzed data from 846 patients with previous history of non‐valvular AF (age 62 ± 15, 50% female, 37% with diabetes, 68% with hypertension, 35% with history of heart failure, 16% with prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 3% with history of major bleed and 8% with renal impairment). Among these patients, 17% had CHADS2 score of 0, 24% had CHADS2 score of 1 and 59% had a CHADS2 score of 2 or more. Warfarin prescription increased with higher stroke risk categories: 27% in patients with CHADS2 score of 0, 38% in patients with CHADS2 score of 1 and 52% in patients with CHADS2 score of 2 or more (P‐trend < 0.01). However, warfarin was inappropriately used and underused in a large number of patients. About one in four patients considered at low risk for stroke (CHADS2 score 0) were prescribed warfarin (27%) while a substantial proportion of high risk patients (CHADS2 score of 2 or higher) were not prescribed warfarin (48%). Conclusions: There is significant misuse and underuse of warfarin among Middle Eastern patients with AF. Future studies should aim to understand determinants of anticoagulation patterns for stroke prevention among Middle Eastern patients with AF and strategies to improve them. P046 REVERSE BIATRIAL REMODELING IN PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AFTER CARDIOVERSION van Bracht M; Christ M; Plehn G; Prull M; Meissner A; Butz T; Trappe HJ Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Marienhospital Herne, Ruhr University Bochum, Herne, Germany Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Approximately 25% of those over forty will experience atrial fibrillation at least once in their life. It is well known that "atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation" due to morphological and electrophysiological remodeling. In cardiac magnetic resonance imaging biatrial volumes and function can be measured with great accuracy. Our aim was to evaluate changing of atrial volumes and ejection fraction in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation after cardioversion. Methods: We examined 15 patients (8m,7f) with persistent atrial fibrillation directly after cardioversion and in a 4 weeks follow up. All scans were done in sinus rhythm. The images were performed with a 1,5 T Siemens Sonata scanner. SSFP sequences with a slice thickness of 5 mm and no gap were used. Image analysis was performed offline using CMR Tools (Imperial College London, UK). Results: Enddiastolic volumes (EDV) after cardioversion in the right atrium: 69,4 ml ± 15,1 (m), 67,9 ml ± 32 (f). At the four week follow up volumes decreased to 61,8 ml ± 31,7 (m), 60,5 ± 17,4 (f). Ejection fraction of the right atrium measured after cardioversion 19,4%± 11,1 (m), 20,7%± 8,6 (f), four weeks later 30,7%± 13,2 (m) and 27%± 16,9 (f). In the left atrium EDV decreased from 99,3 ml ± 32,5 (m) 96 ml ± 25,1 (f), to 99,2 ml ± 29,6 (m), 90,3 ml ± 27,4 (f) and ejection fraction increased from 22,4%± 12,6 (m), 17,6%± 6,4 (f) to 36,2%± 10,8 (m), 27%± 16,9 (f). Conclusion: Already 4 weeks after cardioversion the biatrial dilatation in persistent atrial fibrillation decreases and the atrial ejection fraction increases. Structural remodeling in persistent atrial fibrillation seems to be to some extent reversible. P047 ANATOMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEFT ATRIUM AND LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE IN PATIENTS WITH STROKE/TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK Park HC; Park YM; Ban JE; Park JH; Choi JI; Park SW; Kim YH Arrhythmia center, Korea University, Seoul, Korea Background: The left atrial appendage (LAA) has been identified as a frequent source of cardiac thrombus associated with systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to identify morphological characteristics of the LA and LAA that may confer higher stroke/TIA risk. Methods: We enrolled 119 patients with AF who underwent 3D‐CT examination. We assessed LA and LAA anatomy and categorized LAA morphology and LAA position, and counted the number of LAA lobes. Thirty one patients had a history of stroke/TIA (S group) and the others (88 patients) were free (NS group). There were no significant differences in age between two groups (63.0 ± 6.3 years in S, 63.5 ± 6.1 years in NS group, NS). Results: The LA size (41.9 ± 6.1 mm) and LA volume (108.2 ± 40.5 mm3) in S group were similar to those of NS group (42.3 ± 6.6 mm and 98.0 ± 35.8 mm3, p = 0.7 and p = 0.2, respectively). There were no significant differences in LAA volume (p = 0.8) and LAA neck diameter (p = 0.2) between two groups (22.3 ± 4.2 mm3 and 10.1 ± 3.4 mm in S, 22.6 ± 5.1 mm3 and 11.1 ± 5.0 mm in NS group). There were no significant differences in LAA morphology, LAA position and the number of LAA lobes between two groups. Conclusions: Morphological and dimensional characteristics of the LA and LAA did not determine the risk of stroke/TIA in patients with AF. Keywords: stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), 3D contrast‐computed tomography P048 INCIDENCE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AFTER ATRIAL FLUTTER RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Introduction: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (F) are frequently associated arrhythmias. Cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation for typical F is a proven effective treatment; nevertheless, AF can still be developed after this procedure. Objective: To determine the incidence of AF after CTI ablation in a cohort patients eligible for Atrial Flutter ablation, whether they presented or not prior AF. Method: Patients eligible for CTI ablation were included. Prior history AF was assessed. Telephonic follow up and Holter monitoring was performed to determine AF incidence after ICT ablation. Results: A total of 179 patients (77.09% male; Age 66 ± 8 years) were analyzed. Prior AF was observed in 80 patients (44.61%) of which 76 (95%) developed AF during the follow up. There was no history of prior AF in 99 patients (55.30%) of which 37 (37, 37%) presented AF after CTI ablation. Both groups' variables were analyzed. Atrial fibrillation predictors after CTI ablation were: Prior history of AF (p = 0.001); Male sex (p = 0.03); Valvular Heart disease (p = 0.04); Coronary heart disease (p = 0.01) and hypertensive heart disease (p = 0.003). Antiarrhythmic drug therapy with Class IC / III drugs was higher in the group with prior AF (90.01% vs. 24.6%). Conclusion: Atrial Flutter is a major risk factor to predict Atrial Fibrillation recurrence after CTI ablation. It occurs predominantly in males, with higher prevalence of cardiomyopathy. Radiofrequency treatment of atrial flutter may not be a suitable technique to reduce AF incidence in patients with these characteristics. Difference between real lone Atrial Flutter vs Atrial Fibrillation under Class I drugs treatment must be posed as differential entities. We emphasize the global treatment of this kind of patients. P049 PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND IS ASSOCIATED INFECTION IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION RECURRENCES RATE IN LONE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION PATIENTS Hatzinikolaou‐Kotsakou E; Latsios P; Kotsakou M; Reppas E; Beleveslis T; Moschos G; Tsakiridis K Electrophysiology Department, Saint Luke's Hospital‐Thessaloniki, Greece Background: Depression is common after the first recurrence in lone atrial fibrillation (AF) patients (pts). While there is evidence that major depression (MD) is related to reduced natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and enhanced cytokine production in healthy individuals. Its effect on recurrences rate in Lone AF pts is unknown. We examined the role of hostility, depression, somatic symptom, anxiety, overall psychological distress and associated infectious illness on long‐term recurrences in pts with lone AF. Methods: The study included 355 pts with lone AF, mean age 57 ± 14 years, after the cardioversion for the first recurrence episode of AF, followed prospectively with annual Kellner Symptom psychometric questionnaire at 8 weeks interviews. NKCC was measured by 3‐hour chromium release assay. We calculated the incidence rate of AF by quartiles of psychometric scores. We estimated the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), to represent the association between depression, anxiety, somatic symptom, and hostility scores and risk of AF. Results: After adjusting for non psychological risk factors, of AF, higher anxiety, depression hostility somatic symptom and total psychological distress were significantly associated with risk recurrences of AF. A higher quartile group was associated with a significant increase in risk. For each higher quartile group, adjusted odds ratio for total psychological distress was 2. 4 (CI, 1.4–4.3). Compared to those without psychological distress, depressed pts had diminished NKCC (22.1 ± 12 vs 13.4 ± 9.8%, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Among patients with lone AF, psychological distress in general is associated with reduced NKCC, increased infectious illness and with a dose‐response increase in the long‐term risk of AF recurrence rate. Cognitive behavioral therapy may hold promise for improving depression and for reducing AF recurrences in this population. P050 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AFTER ISOLATED CORONARY SURGERY: COMPARISON BETWEEN OP‐ CABG AND CPB‐ CABG. INCIDENCE, TREATMENT AND LONG TERM EFFECTS Rostagno C; Blanzola C; Sclafani G; Codecasa R; Carone E; Giunti G; Rapisarda F; Stefano PL; Cardiologia Generale 1, Cardiochirurgia AOU – Careggi – Firenze Background: The effects of operative technique (off‐pump versus conventional cardiopulmonary assisted revascularization) on post‐operative AF is still unclear. Aim of present investigation was to compare the incidence of POAF and its prognostic role in patients undergoing respectively OP‐CABG and CPB –CABG. Methods and Results: We conducted a prospective study on 229 patients undergoing isolated CABG between January 1 2007 and December 31 2007. Patients with PO AF were followed up for an average period of 522 days (end of the study June 31 2008). The two groups did not show significant baseline difference with the exception that OP‐CABG were significantly older than CPB‐CABG patients (70.5 vs 64.9 years). 52/229 (22.7%) developed AF after coronary surgery. Incidence of POAF was not significantly different in patients undergoing CPB‐CABG (20/90‐ 22.2%) in comparison to those undergoing OP –CABG (32/139 – 23%). Hospital mortality was 0.4%(one death for cardiogenic shock after CPB‐CABG). Only in patients with POAF after CPB‐CABG length of hospitalization was significantly higher (7.55 days versus 5.9 in patients with PO‐AF after OP‐CABG P <.001). During follow up AF recurred in 6 patients, 3 for both groups, within 2 months after surgery. Hospitalization was required in 3. Three patients recovered SR after amiodarone, 1 required electrical cardioversion, 1 had spontaneous recovery of SR while in the last one AF persisted. Only one patient died during follow up. No strokes were recorded. Conclusions: Although we did not find any difference in the incidence of postoperative AF between OP‐ and CPB‐CABG however OP‐CABG patients were significantly older than CPB‐patients. Early and late mortality did not show relation with POAF probably due to immediate treatment with recovery of sinus rhythm before hospital discharge. Recurrence of AF occurred in 6/52 patients (11.5%) however only in one AF persisted. P051 THE USE OF ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH PACEMAKER DETECTED ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Music L; Boskovic A Clinical Center of Montenegro Euro Heart survey have already demonstrated the suboptimal use of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent generations pacemakers demonstrated the ability to detected episodes of AF by recording electrogram (egm). The aim of the study is to reveal appropriate use of anticoagulations in patients with AF episodes diagnosed by pacemaker EGM during routine pacemaker interrogation. These AF episodes are quantified on the basis of their duration. The medication regime was noted and control at the next scheduled pacemaker interrogation. Two hundred patients with dual chamber pacemaker were included in the study. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 79 (40%). Anticoagulation by vitamin K antagonist was prescribed 51 (63%) with new detected AF on the risk factor – based point scoring system CHA2DS2VASc and antiplatelet agent prescribed in 30 (27%) Among patients with prescribed anticoagulation therapy, 35 (43%) had optimal value of international normalized ratio (INR) during regular control of 3 months and 6 months, 4 (5%) gave up because of discomfort of checking value of INR, 41 (52%). Patients had suboptimal value of INR. The majority of patients in this study received anticoagulation therapy according the current guidelines. But the values of INR were not satisfactory. Pacemakers provide the important information on cardiac rhythm and represent a useful tool of detecting subclinical AF. The rate of appropriate anticoagulation prescription and control of optimal INR may be improved through specific treatment recommendations and better compliance with patients and anticoagulation drugs. P052 THE EFFECT OF SINUS RHYTHM RESTORATION WITH ELECTRICAL CARDIOVERSION ON SELF REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Kayrak M; Gul EE; Alibaşiç H; Abdulhalikov T; Yildirim O; Aribas A; Yazici M; Ozdemir K; Cardiology/Arrhythmia Selcuk University, Meram School of Medicine, Cardiology Department, Konya, Turkey Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice and associated with impaired quality of life. In patients with AF, sinus rhythm maintenance after electrical cardioversion or direct current cardioversion (DCC) provides improvement in functional capacity and decrease in symptoms. However, the effect of DCC on the sleep quality (SQ) is still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of sinus rhythm restoration after successful DCC on the SQ in patients with AF. Methods‐Materials: DCC was performed in eligible 53 patients with persistent AF. Electrical cardioversion was performed successfully (i.e., sinus rhythm restoration) in 48 patients. To eliminate the placebo effect of DCC, patients were divided into two groups; patients with sinus rhythm maintenance (n = 34) and recurrent AF patients (n = 14) according to sixth months follow up. SQ was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before DCC and sixth month later. The PSQI scoring yielded seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleeps efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. Patients with global PSQI score > 5 was defined as "poor sleepers." Thus increase in global PSQI score was considered as a marker of worsened SQ. Main Results: Demographic features and baseline PSQI scores were comparable in two groups. In sinus rhythm maintenance group, baseline global PSQI score was significantly improved compared to sixth month follow‐up (8.7 ± 4.1 vs. 7.2 ± 3.8, p < 0.001, respectively). However, global PSQI score did not change in AF recurrence group compared to baseline value (Table). The difference of intergroup change reached to statistical significance in repeated ANOVA analysis (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Maintenance of sinus rhythm after DCC may have favorable effect on SQ in patients with AF. P053 MINIMAL EXTRACORPOREAL CIRCULATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE OCCURRENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Jakubova M; Sabol F; Stancak B; Luczy J; Kolesar A; Hermely A; Torok P East Slovakia Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kosice, Slovakia Introduction: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia after cardiac surgery. The pathogenesis of postoperative atrial fibrillation is multifactorial. It has been hypothesized that atrial fibrillation might be related to extracorporeal circulation. Objectives: The aim of the study was to monitor preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors and their relationship to the occurrence and duration of AF. Methods: 196 patients with coronary heart disease (152 men, age 62,7 ± 10,1 years) underwent surgical revascularization. Extracorporeal circulation was used in 64 patients and minimal extracorporeal circulation was used in 75 patients. 57 patients underwent surgery without using ECC. During the first 3 postoperative days, patients were monitored for the incidence and duration of AF. Laboratory markers of inflammation (CRP, leukocytes), and serum potassium were routinely measured. Results: Patients' preoperative characteristics did not differ between groups. The incidence of AF was 56% (110 patients). The highest incidence was in the ECC subgroup. The incidence of AF in patients operated using minimised circuit or operated off pump was significantly lower (75% vs. 47% vs. 46%, p < 0,001). The longest duration of AF was in patients operated with ECC, patients in group with minimal extracorporeal circulation and without extracorporeal circulation fibrillated significantly shorter (9,7 ± 11,6 vs. 4,9 ± 8,3 vs. 3,1 ± 5,2, p ≤ 0,001). The incidence of postoperative AF significantly correlated with elevation of inflammatory markers (Leukocytes and CRP) compared to patients free of AF (p ≤ 0,001, p ≤ 0,05). Conclusion: The use of minimal extracorporeal circulation lowers the incidence of postoperative AF in comparison to classical ECC. P054 THE ANTIARRHYTHMIC IMPACT OF RANOLAZINE IN PATIENTS WITH SICK SINUS SYNDROME AND PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Leftheriotis D; Flevari P; Rigopoulos A; Rizos I; Anastasiou‐Nana M "Attikon" University Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Athens, Greece Background: It has been reported that Ranolazine (Ran) suppresses atrial fibrillation (AF), but its efficacy in patients with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and paroxysmal AF is not clear. Besides, pacemakers that detect and store AF episodes can be useful tools for revealing asymptomatic AF recurrence. Therefore, we studied the antiarrhythmic impact of Ran on patients with paroxysmal AF, who had such pacemakers due to SSS. Methods: We studied 22 patients with SSS, paroxysmal AF under no antiarrhythmic medication, and stable coronary artery disease who had a dual chamber pacemaker with the capability to detect and store AF episodes (Altrua DR, Boston Scientific, MA, USA, and Sensia DR, Medtronic, MN, USA). The number and total duration of AF episodes within the last 6 months and QTc duration were assessed at baseline. Subsequently, Ran was administered (375 mgr, twice daily) for six months and AF episodes, total time in AF, and QTc were reassessed. Side‐effects related to Ran were reported. Results: Two patients missed their six‐month reevaluation. Among the remaining 20 patients, 7 (35%) discontinued Ran within the first three months due to side effects: constipation (3), abdominal pain (2), dyspnea and dizziness (1), and decreased urination (1). Compared to baseline, treatment with Ran was associated with a non significant trend towards a decrease in the number of AF episodes (16.5 ± 2.6 vs 15.9 ± 2.8, p = 0.3) and a significant decrease in the total AF duration (4.8 ± 2.9 vs 3.7 ± 2.5 hours, p = 0.01) without QTc prolongation (457 ± 2 vs 459 ± 3 ms, p = 0.2). Conclusions: In clinically stable patients with a pacemaker due to SSS, paroxysmal AF and coronary artery disease, Ran did not significantly reduced AF episodes, but it shortened the total time in AF. Although QTc was not significantly prolonged, a high rate of Ran discontinuation was observed, due to its side effects. P055 PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF CARDIOEMBOLIC STROKE PREVENTION IN PATIENTS ELIGIBLE AND UNELIGIBLE FOR WARFARIN THERAPY Timcenko M; Volceka D; Skorodumovs A; Sipacovs P; Kenina V; Miglane E; Millers A Paul Stradin's Clinical University Hospital Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy of warfarin (Wn) therapy in CS prevention and eligibility of Wn substitution with antiplatelet therapy (a/p) for CS secondary prevention if one is contraindicated. Methods: The trial is ongoing unicenter prospective. 94 cases of acute stroke classified as CS had been analysed. First, clinical record analysis was done. Then patient's telephone inquiry was used to recognize incidence of primary outcome (PO) (death, stroke, systemic embolism, hospitalization) or haemorrhage within 90 days from the stroke onset. 76 patients had completed trial. Results: None of patients used Wn prior stroke. Main source of embolism was atrial fibrillation (AF) in 86,2% of cases. In 77.8% of cases CHADS2 score prior stroke was >1. At discharge Wn was recomended in 55 (58,5%) cases, a/p was recommended in 35 (37,2%). Wn was avoided by these reasons: patient's incompliance in 30,8% (12), INR control inaccessibility in 15,4% (6), hemorrhagic risk in 28,2% (11), severe stroke in 25,6% (10). 90 days after discharge: Wn was continued in 35 cases (46,1%), but 41 patients (53,9%) were on a/p therapy. There was PO in a/p group in 18 (43,9%; confidence interval (CI) 29,9–59,0%), in Wn group in 2 (5,7%; CI 1,6–18,6%) (p = 0,0002); major haemorrhage in a/p group in 0 (0%; CI 0–8,6%), in Wn group 2 (5,7%; CI 1,6–18,6%) (p = 0,209); minor haemorrhage in a/p group in 1 (2,4%; CI 0,4–12,6%), in Wn group 5 (14,3%; CI 6,3–29,4%) (p = 0,0889); death in a/p group in 14 (34,2%; CI 21,6–49,5%), in Wn group in 0 (0%; CI 0–9,9%) (p = 0,0001) cases. Conclusion: Wn is used insufficiently for primary CS prevention. The incidence of PO and death within 90 days after CS is significantly higher in group of patients unable to use Wn for secondary CS prophylaxis. Wn is contraindicated after CS in almost half of cases, but risk of haemorrhage isn't the main contraindication. Wn is more effective in PO and death prevention in CS patients compared to a/p. P056 CLINICAL FLOW OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION DEPENDING ON CONCOMITANT THYROID FUNCTION Lyzohub SV; Sychov OS; Romanova OM; Frolov OI; Mogilnitskiy YV NSC «Institute of Cardiology named after N.D.Strazhesko» of AMS of Ukraine Objective: To estimate amount of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with concomitant thyroid pathology (TP); to study frequency of new cases of TP in the patients receiving amiodarone; to study morphological and functional indices of cardio‐vascular system in the groups of patients with hyper‐ and hypothyroid function. Methods: We included 763 patients. All patients underwent clinical examination, including thyroid function evaluation, EchoCG, ECG HM, 24‐hours BP monitoring. Results: In thre patients with AF 90% had normal thyroid function, 10% (77 patinets) had thyroid disorders, including hypothyroid status in 29 patients (4%), and hyperthyroid status in 48 patients (6%). In hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism groups patients did not significantly differ in age, concomitant CAD ot myocardiofibrosis, but significantly differed by concomitant CHF status – 4% in hyperthyroidism group compared to 41% in hypothyroidism group. We observed difference in appreciation of paroxysms severity by patients according to EHRA scale depending on thyroid function. Thus, in normal thyroid function group 50% had class II, while only 8% had class IV. In the groups with thyroid function impairment we observed increase of patients with class III to IV according to EHRA scale, which is probably connected to cardiovascular system function alterations and deepened by CNS dysfunction. Conclusion: • TP was found in 10% of patients. Hyperthyroidism was present in 6%, hypothyroidism – in 4% of patients.• Patients with concomitant hypothyroidism significantly differed from those with hyperthyroidism by lower LV EF, lower mean, maximal and minimal HR during 24 hrs, lower quantity of AF paroxysms, as well as higher amount of ventricular extrasystoles according to ECG HM data.• Significant difference in patients perception of AF paroxysms severity according to EHRA scale depending on thyroid function was observed, which is due both to hemodynamics and CNS alterations. P057 THE ROLE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTABLE CARDIO‐ VERTER‐DEFIBRILLATOR Panattoni G; Papavasileiou LP; Della Rocca DG; Forleo GB; Topa A; Cioè R; Magliano G; Sergi D; Santini L; Romeo F Cardiology Department, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy Purpose: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) and could lead to inappropriate shocks due to AF misclassification. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of AF on ICDs outcomes. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 428 consecutive patients (358 males, mean age 66.8 ± 11.3 years) who underwent ICD implantation at our institution. We excluded 322 patients without history of AF. Patients were divided in two groups: 45 patients (38 males, mean age 73.0 ± 8.8 years) with permanent AF (group A); 61 patients (48 males, mean age 69.4 ± 11.0 years) with history of paroxistical (83.3%) and persistent (16.7%) AF (group B). During follow‐up the occurrence of appropriate or inappropriate device therapy as well as mortality was noted. Results: During a mean follow–up of 24.8 ± 20.1 months, no significant differences were found in the overall mortality (12 vs 7 pts, p = ns). The presence of AF did not increase significantly the risk of appropriate therapy (13 vs 12 pts, p = ns) or of inappropriate therapy (5 vs 4 pts, p = ns). Type of treatment, with ATP or shock did not result to be statistically significant between groups (ATP: 7/13 vs 10/12 p = ns, shock: 6/13 vs 2/12, p = ns). Conclusion: In our study type of AF does not influence significantly the occurrence of appropriate or inappropriate device therapy and mortality. P058 PREVALENCE OF RISK FACTORS IN PATIENTS WITH A FIRST EPISODE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Gonzalez A; Hinojar R; Perea JA; Zorita B; Goicolea L; Fraile A; Palma J; Romero R; Ruiz‐Polaina M; García‐Cosio F Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Madrid, Spain Background: Therapeutic failures in atrial fibrillation (AF) has turned the attention of clinical researchers toward chronic subclinical remodeling related to risk factors causing chronic atrial overload, in the hope that "upstream" therapy might improve prognosis. Objective: To study AF risk factors present in patients with a first episode of AF, who do not have significant structural heart disease, attending a public Spanish hospital that provides care to a population of 250000 people. Methods: From January 2008 to December 2010, patients attending the emergency room for a first episode of AF were registered. We excluded patients admitted to the hospital for coexistent structural heart disease. Follow‐up was done 10–20 days after discharge. Results: 170 patients were diagnosed and discharged, of which 50,6% were men. The mean age was 63.9 ± 13.9 years. 79 patients (46.5%) had hypertension, 11 (6.5%), were obese, 29 (17.1%), were diabetic, 10 (5.9%) had coronary artery disease, 11 (6.5%) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 5 (2.9%) obstructive sleep apnea. Two patients (1.2%) practiced high level sports, 2 (1.2%) consumed alcohol in excessive quantities and 8 (4.7%), had history of hyperthyroidism. In 53 patients (31.2%), no risk factors were present. One risk factor was present in 47 patients (27.6%), 2 in 40 (23.5%), and 3 or more in 30 (17.7%). Conclusions: Most patients presenting with a first episode of atrial fibrillation have risk factors that could be corrected with the purpose of maintaining sinus rhythm once it has been achieved. A high percentage of patients have no risk factors and follow‐up should reveal if they have a better prognosis for AF control. In patients with no risk factors and recurrence of AF, it seems important to rule out triggering arrhythmias which could be treated with an ablation such as atrio‐ventricular tachycardias and arrhythmogenic foci in pulmonary veins. P059 INTERLEUKIN‐18 AMONG ATRIAL FIBRILLATION PATIENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF STRUCTURAL HEART DISEASE Guo Y; Luan Y; Li S; Yu B; Li S; Li N; Tian Z; Cheng J; Tian Y Department of Cardiology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086 Background: Inflammation plays a role in the genesis and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Interleukin (IL)‐18 is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine with a central role in the inflammatory cascade. We hypothesize that the circulating IL‐18 concentration is elevated in AF patients. Methods: In a case‐control study design, 56 cases with AF and 26 controls were enrolled. All AF cases were categorized into paroxysmal and persistent AF, or lone AF and AF with hypertension. Circulating levels of IL‐18, tumor necrosis factor‐α, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐9 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase‐1 were measured. Results: In adjusted analyses, only age, MMP‐9 and IL‐18 were independently associated with AF, in which IL‐18 had the most significant association [p = 0.0011, STB = 1.76, OR = 1.02; 95% CI (1.01–1.03)]. IL‐18 levels in persistent AF patients were higher than those in paroxysmal ones(p = 0.0011). Patients who developed AF within 24 hours prior to sampling displayed a higher level of IL‐18 than those with sinus rhythm (p = 0.0027). IL‐18 was positively correlated with left atrial diameter (LAD) (r = 0.33, p = 0.0117). Conclusions: This study is the first to document elevated IL‐18 in AF patients. IL‐18 may be superior to other inflammatory markers which are known to be elevated in AF. Keywords: Atrial fibrillation, inflammation, interleukin‐18, MMP‐9, hs‐CRP. P060 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY AND NONVALVULAR AF Demir M; Uyan U; Günay T; Özmen G; Keçeoğlu S; Doğanay K; Melek M Bursa Yüksek İhtisas Education and Research Hospital Cardiology Clinic Bursa/Turkey Aims: The role of vitamin D (vitD) deficiency suggests cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, heart failure and hypertension.VitD deficiency actives renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system which affects cardiovascular system.For this reason, could be suggested relationship between vitD deficiency and atrial fibrillation (AF). In our study we compared 25‐ OH vitD levels, between nonvalvular‐valvular AF and control groups in sinus rhythm. Method: Patients with replacement therapy of vitD and who has a disease affect vitD levels were excluded. 102 patients with nonvalvular chronic AF without any other cardiovascular disease (42 male; average age 62,51 ± 5.88; Group I) and 96 patients with AF which is associated with mitral valve disease (38 male; mean age 61,51 ± 5; Group II) were included in our study. 100 age‐matched healthy people with sinus rhythm were accepted as control groups (40 male; mean age 61,35 ± 5,44). All groups underwent transthoracicechocardiography. Routine biochemical parameters, 25‐OH vitD and parathormon (PTH) levels were performed. Results: Baseline characteristics of the study groups were comparable. Group I patients had a lower vitamin D level than Group II and control group (6,51 ± 4,89; 9,24 ± 7,39 and 11,18 ± 6,98 ng/ml, p < 0.001, respectively). In Group I and Group II patients left atrium (LA) diameter and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) is higher than the control groups. In nonvalvular AF patients, LA diameter (OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1,850–2,984, p < 0.001)and 25 OH VitD level (0.86, 95% CI: OR: 0,786–0.940, p = 0.001) were found independent predictors for AF. In patients with valvular AF, LA diameter, SPAP and right atrium diameter were predictors for AF. Conclusion: As a result of our study revealed relationship between vitD deficiency with nonvalvular AF. But the vitD level were found similar in valvular AF patients with mitral valve disease and control group. This situation suggests that vitD deficiency may cause nonvalvular AF. P061 AGE RELATED PREDICTION OF RECURRENCE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN METABOLIC SYNDROME PATIENTS Borrello F; Nardi S; Cassadonte F; Pirrotta S; Ciconte VA; Maglia GP Cardiology and ICU Pugliese Hospital Catanzaro, Italy Background: Metabolic Syndrome (MS), already known as a concurring condition in atrial fibrillation (AF), is a worldwide cluster of multiple cardiovascular risk factors. To establish the recurrence of AF is important for selecting patients who will be undergoing catheter ablation, several studies respectively evaluated the risk factor of the recurrence of AF post‐ablation. Objective: To investigate the factors predicting the recurrence of AF after catheter ablation in MS population. To assess the specific weight of each risk factor contributing MS in each decades. Methods: Out of 500 patients undergone AF catheter ablation in 2 years in Catanzaro and Terni, 100 (53 ± 26 years, 56 male) fulfilled the criteria for MS, including 59 paroxysmal AF and 41 persistent AF who were studied. Clinical data before, during, at 6, and 12 month follow‐up were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the factor weight predicting late recurrence of AF (LRAF). Results: There were 38 patients who experienced LRAF at 12 month follow‐up. Metabolic syndrome was statistically associated with recurrence of LRAF in all the subpopulation examined (< 45 yrs, 45–65, 65–75 yrs). From 75 years of age on, recurrence of AF was independent from the presence of MS. In addition, in patients younger than 65 yrs of age, the more risk factors of MS, the more the recurrence of AF. Conclusion: Our data suggest that MS is associated with LRAF in paroxysmal and non‐paroxysmal AF in patients younger than 75 yrs of age. Below such age, the more risk factors determining MS, the higher the risk of AF recurrence. P062 AUTONOMIC OUTFLOW DURING PROVOCATIVE MANEUVERS IN PAROXYSMAL LONE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Oliveira M; Laranjo S; Tavares C; Xavier R; Geraldes V; da Silva N; Santos S; Ferreira R; Rocha I Autonomic Nervous System Unit, Institute of Molecular Medicine; Cardiology, Sta Marta Hospital Autonomic dysfunction appears to play a role in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), but the mechanisms linking autonomic nervous system activity with PAF are incompletely understood. Aim: to assess the RR‐intervals (RRI) and systolic blood pressure (BP) variability in lone PAF patients (P) during standard autonomic tests. Methods: 16P with PAF (8 men; 55 ± 17 years) and 16 healthy individuals (HI) (8 men; 54 ± 10 years) while on sinus rhythm. RRI and BP were continuously assessed and LF (low‐frequency), HF (highfrequency) and LF/HF calculated in response to head‐up tilt (HUT), handgrip (HG), cold pressure (CPT) and deep breathing (DB), by using the wavelets transform analysis. Results: In baseline RRI and BP were similar for both groups. HI showed larger mean RRI and maximum RRI during DB. During HUT, two BP profiles were observed: an increase in PAF P and a decrease followed by an increase and further recovery in HI. HG and CPT provoked an increase of BP with a delayed pattern in PAF P. DB elicited a modulation of systolic and diastolic BP in both groups, but a significant decrease occurred only in HI. PAF P showed lower LF in HUT, and decreased HF in basal and during tilting movement in RRI variability analysis, without differences regarding systolic BP variability. LF of BP variability increased earlier in PAF P, with higher values during the second minute of HG. During the CPT, LF for BP variability analysis increased significantly only in HI. There were no differences between groups for RRI variability during DB. Conclusions: P with PAF present modified cardiovascular responses during maneuvers evoking autonomic outflow. These data underscore the presence of autonomic disturbances in PAF. P063 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NEUTROPHIL/LYMPHOCYTE RATIO AND RECURRENCE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AFTER SUCCESSFUL ELECTRICAL CARDIOVERSION Kayrak M; Gul EE; Demir K; Duman C; Alibaşiç H; Akıllı H; Aribas A; Ozdemir K; Gok H; Cardiology/Arrhythmia Selcuk University, Meram School of Medicine, Cardiology Department, Konya, Turkey Background: Current evidence links Atrial Fibrillation (AF) to the inflammatory state. Inflammatory indexes such as C‐reactive protein, interleukin‐6, and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) have been related to the development and persistence of AF. More recently, the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, which can be easily derived from the WBC count and determines the state of inflammation (reflecting neutrophil) and poor general health (lymphopenia), has emerged as a potentially useful prognostic parameter and was related with postoperative AF. We hypothesized that an elevated N/L ratio would be associated with an increased incidence of AF recurrence after successful electrical cardioversion. Methods‐Materials: One hundred and forty nine patients with a history of symptomatic AF (mean age 62 ± 10 years) underwent cardioversion. Echocardiography, complete blood count, and hs‐CRP assay were performed prior to cardioversion.During a follow‐up period of sixth months, AF recurred in 46 patients (31%). Main Results: Baseline hs‐CRP levels were greater in patients with AF recurrence compared to those with sinus rhythm (8.0 ± 5.1 mg/dl vs. 5.1 ± 3.7 mg/dl, p = 0.007, respectively). Overall, baseline N/L ratio was comparable between groups (AF recurrence 2.9 ± 2.0 and SR 2.8 ± 1.5, p = 0.96). Duration of AF was significantly longer in AF recurrence group than SR group (19 ± 12 months vs. 12 ± 9 months, p = 0.012, respectively). In addition, left atrial diameter was enlarged in AF recurrence group compared to SR group (p = 0.002). There was no correlation between N/L ratio and echocardiographic parameters. There was a weak positive correlation between hs‐CRP levels and N/L ratio (r = 0.22, p = 0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggest N/L ratio was failed to predict of AF recurrence. It needs to future investigation to determine the role of N/L ratio in AF development and recurrence. P064 ANTI‐COAGULATION USE FOR STROKE PROPHYLAXIS IN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN A MULTI – ETHNIC POPULATION Neo S; Francis PJ; Li A; Chia P‐L; Foo D Department of Cardiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital Aims: We evaluate the patterns and prevalence of anti‐coagulation amongst patients of different ethnic backgrounds presenting with atrial fibrillation (AF) to a tertiary hospital. Methods: We identified 588 patients with AF admitted to our institution between years 2006 to 2010 and performed a retrospective review of their medical records. Baseline demographics, stroke and bleeding risk stratification scores and anti‐coagulation use were evaluated. Results: The mean age was 63 ± 14 years and 33% were aged ≥75. 77.6% were Chinese, 4.8% Indians, 11.7% Malays. Hypertension (67.7%) was the commonest associated co‐morbid condition, with no statistically significant difference amongst the ethnic groups. The mean composite CHA2DS2‐VASc score was 3.1 ± 2.0. The mean composite HAS‐BLED score was 1.8 ± 1.3. 62.9% had no contraindications to anti‐coagulation. Although 45.1% had composite CHA2DS2‐VASc scores ≥2 and HAS‐BLED scores ≤2, only 26.7% received warfarin. The commonest reasons for physicians not starting warfarin were patients' refusal due to fear of adverse effects of bleeding and increased fall risks in the elderly. There was no statistical difference regarding lack of anti‐coagulation across the different ethnic groups. Patients with permanent AF have higher odds of receiving anti‐coagulation compared to those with paroxysmal AF (OR 2.3; 95% CI, 1.51‐ 3.36; p < 0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of anti‐coagulation in elderly is low in our multi‐ethnic population. Both physician and public education is of importance to prevent increased health care costs and AF related stroke mortality and morbidity. P065 THE FEATURES OF AUTONOMIC HEART RATE CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN RESPONSE TO ACTIVATION OF SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM Mamontov OV; Berngardt ER; Parmon EV; Treshkur TV; Shlyakhto EV Almazov Federal Heart, Blood and Endocrinology Centre, Saint‐Petersburg, Russia Background: Assessment of autonomic heart rate (HR) regulation in patients suffering from permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an unresolved problem. Most methods are based on evaluation of dynamics of sinus rhythm (SR). At the same time, alteration of autonomic cardiac nerve tone in patients with AF can be realized by modification of atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate features of autonomic HR modulation in patients suffering from permanent AF in response to activation of sympathetic nervous system. Methods: The study enrolled 43 patients suffered from heart failure II‐IV functional class (NYHA), mean age 53,8 ± 7,2 yrs. 20 pts had ischemic, 16–nonischemic and 7–mixed cardiomyopathy. 30 pts had SR and 13 ones had permanent AF. All patients underwent a handgrip test (HGT) during which blood pressure (BP) was measured by continuous noninvasive method (Finometer, FMS) and high resolution ECG was recorded simultaneously. BP and HR were estimated initially and in 3 min from starting of the HGT. Results: During the HGT comparable augmentation of BP was registered in both groups: dBP systolic in AF and SR patients was 20.5 ± 11.4 and 19.5 ± 10.7 mmHg, respectively, p > 0.05; dBP diastolic (dBPD) 14.3 ± 5.2 and 11.2 ± 6.4 mmHg, p > 0.05 resp. HR increase significantly greater in AF group than in SR one: dHR 11.7 ± 7.0 and 5.7 ± 4.0 bpm, resp., p < 0.005. In AF group dHR was strongly correlated with dBPD (r = 0.62, p < 0.005) but in SR group this correlation was less significant (r = 0.36, p > 0.05). The difference in HR increase and its relation with dBPD between SR and AF groups explains the difference in intensity of modulating impact of arterial baroreflex on sinus node and AV conjunction that opposes sympathetic activation. Conclusions: Parallel with BP augmentation strongly marked HR is observed in patients with AF during a simpathotonic HGT. That may indicate weak limitative influence of vagal feedback on AV conduction. BASIC SCIENCE: FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE P066 CHANGES IN THE AGING‐ASSOCIATED OF L‐TYPE CALCIUM CHANNEL OF THE LEFT ATRIA OF THE CANINES Tianyi G; GuoJun X; Xianhui Z; Baopeng T; Xia G; Yaodong L Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China Introduction: Action potential (AP) contours vary considerably between normal adult and aged left atrial fibers. The ionic and molecular bases for these differences remain unknown. So we investigate whether the L‐type calcium current (ICa.L) an L‐type calcium channel of left atria may be altered with age. Methods: We used whole‐cell patch‐clamp to record action potential (AP) and ICa.L in left atrial (LA) cells dispersed from normal adult (2–2.5 years) and older canines (>8 years).The a1c (Cav1.2) subunit of L‐type calcium channel mRNA and protein expression were assessed by real‐time quantitative RT‐PCR and Western blotting respectively. Results: Whereas resting potential, AP amplitude and Vmax did not differ with age, the plateau was more negative and AP duration was max longer in old tissue. Aged LA cells have lower peak ICa.L current densities than Adult LA cells (P < 0.05). In addition, Compared to the adult group,the Cav1.2 mRNA and protein expression of LA were decreased in aged group. Conclusions: The lower plateau potential of AP and the decreased ICaL of LA in aged canines may contribute to the slow conduction and discontinuous conduction of LA. While the decreased expression of Cav1.2 with age may be the basis of the decrease of ICaL with age.

Background: Collagen turnover and atrial fibrosis have been implicated in the generation and perpetuation of AF. Methods: Serum C‐terminal propeptide of collagen type I (CICP) and C‐terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP) were measured in 98 patients with AF before and two months after CV. Results: All patients were successfully cardioverted to sinus rhythm (SR) although in 27 of them AF recurred. Baseline CICP levels were comparable in patients in sinus rhythm 60 days after CV and in those who experienced a relapse of AF (82.464 ± 16.65 ng/ml vs. 86.45 ± 10.95 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.18). Baseline CITP levels were significantly higher in patients with AF recurrence compared to those who remained in SR (0.47 ± 0.15 ng/ml vs. 0.33 ± 0.19 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.001). The restoration and maintenance of SR resulted in a decrease of CICP but not of CITP levels. In the 75 patients who maintained SR, CICP levels were significantly lower at the end of the study as compared to baseline, (61.89 ± 14.18 ng/ml vs. 82.464 ± 16.65 ng/ml p < 0.001), while there was no difference in plasma CITP levels, (0.35 ± 0.20 ng/ml vs. 0.33 ± 0.19 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.477). Conclusions: AF can result in alterations in atrial structure and architecture that make the atrial myocardium more susceptible to the maintenance of the arrhythmia. Sinus rhythm restoration could affect the fibrotic process occurring or exacerbating during AF course. P068 ASSESSMENT OF VENTRICULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AT PERI‐INFARCT ZONE OF POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN THE RABBITS FOLLOWING STELLATE GANGLION BLOCK Gu Y; Wang X; Wang L; Tang Y Cardiovascular Research Institute of Wuhan University Background: To investigate the characteristics of ventricular electrophysiology following stellate ganglion block at peri‐infarct zone in the rabbits with MI. Method and Results: Sixty‐four rabbits were randomly assigned into two groups: MI group (n = 32), ligation of the anterior descending coronary; SO, sham operation group (n = 32), without coronary ligation. Both MI group and SO group were divided into four subgroups according to the right or left SGB and the corresponding control (n = 8, each). After eight weeks, 90% of monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90) of epicardium, midmyocardium and endocardium, transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR), effective refractory period (ERP), ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) were measured at the infarct border zone (MI group) and corresponding zone (SO group) following SGB. For SGB, 0.5ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was used.As compared with the corresponding control group, in both of the MI group and SO group, LSGB prolonged the MAPD90 of three layers, reduced the TDR, increased the ERP and the VFT (P < 0.05). However, RSGB shortened the MAPD90, increased the TDR, reduced the ERP and the VFT(P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results demonstrated that LSGB can increase the electrophysiological stability of ventricular myocardium. Keywords: Stellate ganglion block; transmural dispersion of repolarization; effective refractory period; ventricular fibrillation threshold; Myocardial infarction. P069 ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WENXIN GRANULE IN RABBITS WITH CON‐ GESTIVE HEART FAILURE IN VIVO Tang YH; Liu MX; Lian ZM; Wang Xi; Wang T; Hu P Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, china To observe the effect of Wenxin Granule on electrophysiology in rabbits with congestive heart failure(HF). 32 rabbits were randomly divided into four groups, they are sham‐operated no‐drug group (sham group), sham‐operated Wenxin Granule group (SHAM‐Wenxin group), HF no‐drug group (HF group) and HF Wenxin Granule group (HF‐Wenxi Group). HF model was successfully produced by volume overload combined with pressure overload. The rabbits were feed by Wenxin Granule 8 weeks. Sinusatrial node function, atrial and ventricular myocardium monophasic action potential duration (MAPD), effective refractory period (ERP), transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) were record by monophasic action potential (MAP) technique. Results: 1. sinusatrial node conduction time (SACT), sinusatrial node recovery time (SNRT), cSNRT were all prolonged in HF group (P < 0.05). SACT was shorter in HF‐Wenxin group (P < 0.05). 2. Compared with sham group, MAPD50 and MAPD90, ERP were prolong in sham‐Wenxin group and HF‐Wenxin group (P < 0.05). But there were no significant difference between HF group and HF‐Wenxin group (P>0.05).3. Compared with sham group and HF‐Wenxin group, the MAPD90 of the middle layer myocardium of left ventricular was prolonged and TDR was larger in HF group (P < 0.05 respectively). 4. Compared with HF group, VFT were remarkably increased in HF‐Wenxin Granule group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Wenxin Granule had no more negative effects on sinus node dysfunction in heart failure rabitts. APD became conformity in three layers myocardium of heart failure by using Wenxin Granule, to decrease TDR in left ventricular, Wenxin Granule can increase VFT of heart failure rabitts, there was protective function in heart failure accompaning with arrhythmia. P070 SINUS NODE DYSFUNCTION AND HYPER‐ POLARIZATION‐ACTIVATED (HCN) CHANNEL SUBUNIT REMODELING ASSOCIATED WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Tianyi G; GuoJun X; Xianhui Z; Baopeng T; Xia G Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, China Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently associated with Sinoatrial node (SAN) dysfunction. But underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.The hyperpolarization‐activated cation current contributes significantly to sinoatrial node pacemaker function and possibly to ectopic arrhythmogenesis. This study examined the hypothesis that AF impair SAN function by altering hyperpolarization‐activated (HCN) channel expression and AF may lead to HCN channel of atria remodeling. Methods: We assessed expression of HCN1, 2, 4 and beta‐subunit minK in sinus rhythm (SR) beagle canines and canines subjected to 8‐week atrial tachypacing‐induced atrial fibrillation (AF). Realtime RT‐PCR and Western blot were used to quantify HCN subunit and beta‐subunit minK mRNA and protein expression in the right atrium (RA) and sinoatrial node. Results: AF canines have longer sinus node recovery time than SR canines, which reflects impaired SAN function.HCN2 and HCN4 expression was greater at both protein and mRNA levels in sinoatrial node than RA. AF significantly decreased sinus node HCN2,4 and beta‐subunit minK expression at both mRNA and protein levels,while increased HCN2,4 and beta‐subunit minK expression of RA. Conclusions: The decreased expression of HCN2,4 and beta‐subunit mink of sinoatrial node contribute to AF‐induced sinus node dysfunction; while upregulation of atrial HCN2,4 and beta‐subunit minK may help to promote maintaining of AF. Keywords: Atrial fibrillation; sinoatrial node; HCN channel; remodeling. BRADYARRHYTMIAS P071 PREDICTIVE VALUE OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY AND ELECTOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES AFTER CORE VALVE‐MEDTRONIC AORTIC VALVE IMPLANTATION‐ PRELIMINARY RESULTS Kostopoulou A; Karyofillis P; Livanis E; Voudris V 2nd Cardiology Department, Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Athens, Greece Aim: Surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with complete heart block (CHB) requiring permanent pacing in 3 to 6%. Reports have shown a higher incidence of conduction disease in patients (pts) undergoing percutaneous aortic valve implantation (PAVI). The purpose of our study was to assess the value of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electrophysiology study (EPS) as predictors of conduction abnormalities after PAVI. Methods: Twenty seven consecutive pts mean aged 81 ± 6 years with severe aortic stenosis and normal or slightly impaired left ventricular function (mean LVEF 53 ± 10%) who underwent Core Valve‐Medtronic implantation were included. The baseline 12‐lead surface ECG was analyzed for the recording of basic rhythm and conduction abnormalities. A basic EPS study was performed a day before for the measurement of the basic intervals PA, AH, HV, the effective refractory period (ERP) of the atrioventricular (AV) node and the Wenckebach cycle length (WCL). Results: At baseline evaluation 21 pts were in sinus rhythm and 6 in chronic atrial fibrillation. The mean PR and QRS were 185 ± 25 msec and 118 ± 27 msec. Six pts had a LBBB and 3 LAH. The basic EPS measurements were: AH 93 ± 17 msec, HV 51 ± 11 msec (34–90 msec), AV‐ERP 288 ± 59 msec, and WCL 386 ± 72 msec. All pts, except 1, had HV intervals <70 msec. Nine pts (33%) required permanent pacing due to CHB after PAVI. Seven pts developed LBBB during the first 4 days. Four of the 9 pts that had a pacemaker implantation had restored normal rhythm at first‐month follow‐up. Student's T test showed that in pts with pacemakers compared to those without, the AH interval was prolonged at significant levels. The HV interval and AV‐ ERP measurements were higher but not significantly whereas the QRS width did not differ. Conclusions: Preliminary data show that patients with pre‐existing conduction abnormalities revealed in an EPS study may be susceptible to development of complete AV block after PAVI. P072 HIGH PREVALENCE OF AMYLOID DEPOSITION IN SUBCUTANEOUS FAT TISSUE IN PATIENTS WITH BRADYARRHYTHMIA Omi W; Hanaoka R; Takatori O; Saeki T; Kasashima S; Kawashima A; Sakagami S Department of Cardiology, Kanazawa Medical Center, National Hospital Organization Background: Most of cases with amyloidosis progress asymptomatically, and is diagnosed when cardiac involvement is already at end stage. Additionally, the diagnosis is sometimes cumbersome and accompanied with complication. These factors make early diagnosis difficult. Aim: To assess the usefulness of subcutaneous fat sampling during pacemaker implantation and to validate the prevalence of systemic amyloidosis in patients with bradyarrhythmia who required permanent pacemaker. Patients and Methods: We enrolled 15 consecutive patients (79 ± 12 years old, 7 males) who required pacemaker implantation (containing 4 patients, generator exchange). Four patients had sick sinus syndrome and 11 had atrioventricular block. In all cases, echocardiography did not show typical findings suggesting cardiac amyloidosis. Pacemaker was inserted to infraclavicular precordia. Subcutaneous fat tissues were taken during surgery and specimens were evaluated by the pathologists. Results: Pacemaker implantation and subcutaneous fat sampling were performed successfully and safely in all cases, and interstitial amyloid deposition was confirmed in 9 cases (60%). Gastro and/or colon endoscopy were performed in 4 patients of them, and intestinal amyloid deposition was confirmed in 2 patients. Conclusion: Subcutaneous fat sampling during pacemaker implantation was safety and helpful for diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Our data suggests that systemic amyloidosis could be more frequent than we supposed, and that contribute to bradyarrhythmia even in the absence of other typical manifestation. P073 CASE REPORT: COMPLETE HEART BLOCK FOLLOWING PARAPHENYLENE DIAMINE (PPD) HAIR DYE POISONING Suliman AAA; Ibrahim GIA Alshaab Teaching Hospital – Khartoum‐Sudan Introduction: Paraphenylene diamine (PPD) [C6H4 (NH2)2] is an aromatic amine not found in nature and it is produced commercially by many industrial companies. It is widely used in industrial products. PPD is the most common constituent of hair dye formulations. PPD is commonly used in its raw form for cosmetic purposes in Africa, Middle East and Indian subcontinent while it is rarely used in the West. In Sudan, PPD is mixed with henna leaves of Lawsonia Alba, which is a non toxic herb used to decorate the hands and feet in special social events. PPD intoxication is a life threatening condition, commonly manifested as acute upper respiratory tract obstruction and acute kidney injury but seldomly affects the heart. Case Presentation: We are reporting this case of a 26 year old female from Aljazeera State in Sudan, who presented complaining of dizzy spells and severe fatigue following swallowing of hair dye intentionally (suicide attempt). She was seen initially at her local hospital where she was found to be bradycardic. Her HR was 40 bpm and she was referred to our cardiology department at AlShaab Teaching Hospital. Upon arrival, the patient looked fatigued but was fully conscious, BP 110/50, HR 40/min and her systemic examination was unremarkable. ECG showed complete heart block with wide complex escape rhythm of 38 bpm. Her blood tests showed mildly elevated renal profile and CPK with normal cardiac biomarkers. Echo showed normal systolic function. Temporary pacemaker wire was immediately inserted and kept under monitoring. Over the next two weeks she remained in complete heart block with intrinsic HR of 38bpm. After two weeks of temporary pacing, a DDDR pacemaker was inserted. Two years after initial presentation, the patient still remains in complete heart block and is pacemaker dependent. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of permanent complete heart block, requiring PPM implantation, following PPD intoxication without evidence of of myocardial injury. P074 BRADYCARDIA AS A CAUSE OF ANGINATHE NEW BRADYANGINA SYNDROME Duque M; Herrera AM; Múnera JS; Medina E; Marín J; Uribe W School of Medicine, Universidad CES – Department of Cardiology, Clínica CES, Medellín, Colombia Background: Angina is defined as a sensation of pressure or retrosternal pain with a rather specific pattern of irradiation, with physical or emotional stress, or even at rest, and secondary to a decrease in myocardial oxygen supply. Bradycardia is defined as a persistent or transitory decrease in heart rate below 60 beats per minute, due to primary, secondary, and reversible or irreversible causes. There is an association between heart rate and cardiac output. Could it be possible that a reduction in the heart rate results in a decrease in cardiac output to a point that it is responsible for myocardial ischemia, and as such, angina?Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective – prospective study of patients with angina of unknown origin and sinus bradycardia diagnosis that were admitted in our cardiology service between august 1st 2007 and august 31st 2009. Diagnostic approach included coronariography, or non invasive measures as stress echocardiography or myocardial perfusion test with radiotracers. Patients were treated with pacemaker implantation, discontinuation of medications with negative chronotropic effect and/or follow up in those with transitory or non pharmacologic causes of bradycardia. After performing the interventions, all patients were followed up and evaluated in search of the presence of angina or bradycardia, and persistence of symptoms. Results: A total of 60 patients were evaluated, 70% were men. Mean age of 52.5 ± 16.3 (SD) years. Pacemaker implantation was performed in 78.3% of patients. Medication associated with bradycardia was discontinued in 11.7% of patients. During follow up, 100% of patients did not report having new episodes of angina after the intervention was performed. Conclusion: With coronary disease discarded, the study of rhythm anomalies as a potential etiology of the symptomatology should be performed. The association between bradycardia and angina could be newly defined as "Bradyangina syndrome". P075 SINUS OF VALSALVA ANEURYSM AS A REVERSIBLE CAUSE OF COMPLETE HEART BLOCK (A CASE REPORT) Alasti M; Omidvar B; Mali S; Majidi S Department of Cardiology, Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran A 43 year old lady was referred to our center for temporary intravenous pacemaker insertion. She had a history of dizziness and one episode of syncope since two days ago. She did not have any risk factor of coronary artery disease. There was no significant past medical illness. Laboratory data including serum potassium and cardiac enzyme levels and sedimentation rate were within normal limits. The ECG showed complete AV block with ventricular escape rate of 30–35 beat/min. The QRS complexes were wide with LBBB morphology pattern (Figure 1‐A). Transthoracic echocardiography showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with normal contractility, mild aortic regurgitation and an aneurysm of sinus of valsalva eroding into the upper part of interventricular septum (Figure 2‐A). 64‐slice CT scan disclosed a large sinus of valsalva aneurysm originating from right sinus of valsalva (Figure 2‐B). Right sided heart catheterization and selective coronary angiography showed normal pulmonary artery and wedge pressures and normal epicardial coronary arteries. Aortography in LAO and RAO projections showed a large aneurysm of right coronary sinus of valsalva and mild aortic regurgitation (Figure 3‐A&B). The patient underwent surgery and the mouth of aneurysm was closed with a Gortex patch. In addition, an epicardial pacemaker was implanted. The ECG taken two weeks later disclosed sinus rhythm with prolonged AV interval and bifascicular block and no pacing (Figure 1‐B). In rare cases, the aneurysm erodes into the interventricular septum. Direct pressure by the expanding aneurysm and low grade inflammation can lead to atrioventricular conduction defects. It is interesting in our patient that the rhythm returned to sinus after surgical decompressing of interventricular septum. It looks reasonable that unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm eroding into the interventricular septum is operated as soon as possible, preventing development of complications such as heart block. CARDIAC IMAGING P076 CLINICAL IMPLICATION OF EVALUATING LEFT ATRIAL ARTERY AND LEFT ATRIAL RIDGE BEFORE CATHETER ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH MULTIDETE‐ CTOR‐ROW CT Kimura R; Inoue K; Toyoshima Y; Doi A; Masuda M; Sotomi Y; Iwakura K; Fujii K Sakurabashi Watanabe Hospital Objective: The anatomy of the left atrial ridge (LAR) is important for deciding strategy of catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation (AF). The branch of the left atrial circumflex artery (AC) runs within LAR, and it could exert the cooling effect during CA. We studied the morphology of LAR and AC with multidetector‐row CT (MDCT). Methods: Twenty‐six patients (age 60 ± 12 years, male 16) undergoing CA for AF (13 with paroxysmal AF and 13 with persistent AF) were enrolled. MDCT was performed prior to CA. Results: The left atrial volume (LAV) (98.6 ± 46.8 ml vs. 58.9 ± 21.9 ml, P < 0.05) and the thickness of the LAR (3.15 ± 0.60 mm vs. 2.54 ± 0.85 mm, P < 0.05) was significantly greater in persistent AF group. AC was observed by MDCT in 4 cases (30.7%) in proximal AF group and in 2 cases (15.4%) in persistent AF group. There were no significant differences in LAV and the thickness of LAR between groups with and without visible AC. The time (21.7 ± 11.4 min vs. 18.2 ± 8.61 min) and the number of CA (37 ± 23 vs. 31 ± 13) for left pulmonary vein isolation were greater in the patients with visible AC, but this difference did not reach statistical difference. Conclusion: The evaluation of the LAR with MDCT was useful for deciding strategy of AF ablation. The clinical implication of AC in AF ablation needs further investigation. P077 MULTIDETECTOR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY CAN DETECT LEFT VENTRICULAR MECHANICAL DYSSYNCHRONY IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Kimura R; Koyama Y; Inoue K; Toyoshima Y; Doi A; Masuda M; Sotomi Y; Iwakura K; Fujii K Sakurabashi Watanabe Hospital Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is widely accepted as the adjuvant treatment of patients with severe heart failure. However, approximately 30% of patients receiving CRT are non‐responders. In order to improve the efficacy of CRT, the selection of appropriate patients based on the preoperative evaluation of the extent of left ventricular dyssynchrony is important. Several echocardiographic indices for the evaluation of dyssynchrony are proposed, but recent study shows their limitations. Objective: We sought to determine the feasibility of MDCT (Multidetector CT) to detect left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony in heart failure patients. Methods: Eight patients with heart failure (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 22.8%) who were the candidates for CRT underwent electrocardiogram‐gated contrast‐enhanced 64‐slice MDCT (Philips Brilliance 64, EBW Workstation) and axial multiphase reformats were constructed. With visual observation, patients are divided into two groups: group D (with apparent left ventricular dyssynchrony, 4 patients), and group N (without apparent dyssynchrony, 4 patients). The short‐axis image of the left ventricle at the level of papillary muscle was divided into 6 segments. We determined the time from R wave to maximal wall motion for each 6 segments and defined the maximum difference in time‐to‐maximal wall motion of all 3 pairs of opposing segments as wall motion delay (WMD). Echocardiographic measurements including septal‐to‐posterior wall motion delay (SPWMD) were performed in all patients. Results: WMD was significantly greater in group D compared with group N (32.5 ± 9.6% RR vs. 10.0 ± 7.1% RR, P < 0.05). SPWMD was greater in group D, but it did not reach statistical significance (233 ± 60 ms vs. 161 ± 93 ms, p = 0.12). Conclusion: MDCT is useful for the observation and the evaluation of left ventricular dyssynchrony with its ability to clearly visualize the cross‐sectional moving images of left ventricle. P078 COMBINED USE OF THREE‐DIMENSIONAL ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAM OF LEFT ATRIUM AND CIRCULAR MULTI‐ELECTRODE ABLATION CATHETER FOR PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION Tang M; Gerds‐Li J‐H; Kriatselis C; Zhang S Department of Arrhythmia, Fuwai Cardiovascular Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing Background: A novel circular pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) has been introduced for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Accurate delineation of left atrium‐pulmonary vein (LA‐PV) anatomy is important for this technique. The aim of this study was to test the 3‐dimensional rotational angiogram of left atrium (3D RTA) can facilitate PVI using PVAC technique. Methods: Twenty patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) were enrolled in this study. The 3D RTA was reconstructed and registered with live fluoroscopy in all the patients. AF ablation was performed with PVAC catheter in the navigation of registered 3D RTA. Results: The 3DRTA image was successfully reconstructed and registered with the live fluoroscopy in all patients (100%). The LA‐PV anatomy was delineated clearly in all patients. Navigation of the PVAC inside the registered 3D RTA, ensured accurate placement within the atrium to perform ablation, and the PVAC was correctly placed inside the PV ostium to verify the PVI. All the PVs were isolated. Total procedural time was 87.5 ± 12.1 minutes, and fluoroscopy time was 20.1 ± 6.3 minutes. Follow‐up after 7.1 ± 1.5 months showed freedom from AF in 70% (14/20) patients. No PV stenosis was observed. Conclusions: Intraprocedurally reconstructed and registered 3D RTA can clearly delineate the LA‐PV anatomy in real‐time, this study demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of combining use of 3DRA and PVAC in AF ablation procedure. CARDIAC RESYNCHRONISATION THERAPY P079 LONG TERM OUTCOMES IN ISCHEAMIC VERSUS NON‐ISCHEAMIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY AFTER CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Mantziari L; Vassilikos V; Kamperidis V; Paraskevaidis S; Dakos G; Chatzizisis Y; Giannakoulas G; Karvounis H; Styliadis IH First Cardiology Department, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with heart failure. Response to CRT and long term survival may be affected by a plethora of factors, heart failure aetiology being one of them. Aim of this study was to assess differences between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and non‐ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) treated with CRT. Methods: Data from CRT implantations for standard indications were retrospectively analysed. Differences in baseline characteristics, clinical and echocardiographic response to CRT and long term outcomes were sought between ICM and DCM. Results: A total of 166 patients were included, 51% with ICM and 49% with DCM. Mean baseline EF was 24 ± 5% and baseline NYHA class 3.0 ± 0.2 and did not differ between ICM and DCM. DCM patients were younger (61 ± 11 vs 69 ± 9 years, P < 0.001) and included more females (24% vs 2%, P < 0.001). QRS duration was similar between ICM and DCM (169 ± 24 vs 163 ± 25, p = 0.162) but left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology was more frequent in DCM (89% vs 77%, p = 0.035). Atrial fibrillation prevalence and LV lead implantation site were similar. At 6 months, clinical improvement, defined as reduction ≥1 NYHA class, was 76% in both groups, and LVEF increased ≥15% in 75% of DCM vs 70% of ICM patients (p = 0.770). After a mean follow up of 24 ± 21 months DCM patients showed better survival (log rank p = 0.006) and a trend for better event‐free survival (log rank p = 0.055). After adjusting for age, gender and QRS morphology, DCM remains an independent predictor of better survival. Conclusions: Patients with DCM treated with CRT are younger, are more frequently female and have higher prevalence of LBBB. Even though short‐term response to CRT is similar between ICM and DCM, long term survival is better for DCM patients. P080 MORLET WAVELET ANALYSIS OF THE QRS COMPLEX AS A NOVEL TOOL FOR PREDICTING RESPONSE TO CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Vassilikos V; Mantziari L; Dakos G; Kamperidis V; Kalpidis P; Paraskevaidis S; Maglaveras N; Chouvarda I; Karvounis H; Styliadis IH First Cardiology Department, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece Background: Among eligible patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), those with wider QRS and left bundle branch block (LBBB) are more likely to respond. The wavefront pattern of myocardial ventricular activation in LBBB may differ between responders and non responders. Aim of the present study was to explore the differences in the QRS complex components between responders and non‐responders. Methods: We conducted a pilot prospective study in 39 consecutive patients (age 64 ± 10 years, 31 males) with heart failure and LBBB treated with CRT according to established guidelines. Signal averaged electrocardiograms were recorded before implantation and QRS decomposition was performed using the Morlet wavelet transformation. Wavelet parameters expressing the mean and maximal (max) energy were calculated in three orthogonal axes (x,y,z) and in the vector magnitude (vm), in each of three frequency bands. Response was defined as clinical improvement by one or more NYHA classes at 6 months follow up. Results: Baseline QRS duration was 166 ± 23 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 26 ± 7% and LV end systolic volume (LVESV) 163 ± 49 ml. Thirty patients (77%) were identified as responders and had wider baseline QRS (171 ± 22 vs 142 ± 11ms, p = 0.005) and lower mean and max energies in all frequency bands on x axis as compared to non‐responders. Wavelet parameters on x lead could predict response to CRT with 76–79% sensitivity and 83% specificity. Conclusions: This pilot study showed that wavelet transformation of the amplified QRS complex may contribute in discriminating among patients who are more likely to benefit from CRT. A larger prospective study is deemed necessary to validate our findings. P081 DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF CARDIAC RESYNCHRONISATION THERAPY (CRT‐D/CRT‐P) RECEIPIENTS AT OUR CENTRE – FIVE YEARS (2006–2011) EXPERIENCE Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT‐D/CRT‐P) is the emerging and proven modalities of treatment in patients (pts) with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Our center evaluated demographic profile of CRT in our pts over five years. Objective: To evaluate demographic profile of pts being referred for CRT‐D/CRT‐P in our center. Population/Methods: We studied 352 pts with severe LV dysfunction who were implanted CRT‐P/CRT‐D from 2006–2011. We analysed distribution by% of pts who received CRT‐D/CRT‐P, their age, gender selection, NYHA class, QRS duration (QRSd), etiology and comorbid conditions. In pts with QRSd (120–150 msec), we analysed mechanical dyssynchrony with Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI). Indices chosen were atrioventricular (AV), interventricular and intraventricular dyssynchrony. Pts with 2/3 dyssynchrony indices were included. Results: Out of 352 pts (85.6% males, 14.4% females); mean age of pts 62.9 ± 17 yrs, with no statistical difference in mean age (59.3 ± 11.6 yrs for males vs 57.9 ± 10.4 yrs for females). 79% were diabetic and 60% hypertensive. CRT‐P was given to 79%, CRT‐D to 21%. 69.6% had ischemic etiology, 30.4% idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Mean ejection fraction (EF) 22 ± 9%, mean QRSd 146 ± 18 msec. 2% in NHYA class II, 68% in NYHA class III and 30%in ambulatory NYHA class IV as a group, in females 46% were in NYHA class III and 54%in ambulatory class IV and in diabetics 43% were in NYHA class III and 57% in ambulatory class IV. Conclusion: We analysed demographic profile of pts who received CRT‐D/CRT‐P. The rate of implantation in females in our center is lower than expected. Also, females were older with higher NYHA class. The guidelines must be implemented carefully to avoid gender selection biases. We also concluded that diabetics were older with higher NYHA class vs non‐diabetics and hypertensives. In this study 2% population got CRT in NYHA classII in accordance with recent European guidelines for CRT. P082 LEFT VENTRICULAR PACING USING ACTIVE FIXATION LEADS IN CHALLENGING CORONARY SINUS ANATOMY Ahmad Fazli AA; Azlan H; Surinder K; Zunida A; Tay GS; Noor Ashikin S; Razali O National Heart Institute, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Introduction: The placement of leads in the distal coronary sinus is required for left ventricular stimulation in cardiac resynchronization therapy as well as for ventricular pacing whereby the right ventricle is inaccessible. Challenging coronary sinus anatomy may lead to instability, lead dislodgements and phrenic stimulations. We hypothesise that usage of an active fixation lead mechanism will overcome these limitations with stable lead performances. Methods: Patients who had implantation of 4F active fixation leads (SelectSecure Model 3830, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, USA) due to failed conventional left ventricular leads from May 2009 until July 2011 were selected for the study. Pacing parameters were tested at implantation and if found unreasonable, the lead is then unscrewed and fixed at a new location until the pacing parameters were satisfactory. We analysed pacing parameters at implantation and follow up as well as monitoring for lead related complications in these patients. Results: A total of 28 patients received implantation of the 4F active fixation leads. Among these, 71.4% were due to lead instability, 14.3% were selected for recurrent dislodgements, and 14.3% for phrenic stimulations. All 28 patients had successful implantations. Pacing threshold at implantation was 1.37 ± 0.59V and lead impedance was 809 ± 393 ohms. There were no significant difference in the pacing thresholds and lead impedances at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months follow up. The lead thresholds were 1.35 ± 0.86V, 1.33 ± 0.77V and 1.65 ± 0.98 V respectively (p = NS). Impedances were 624 ± 188 ohms, 666 ± 252 ohms and 624 ± 202 ohms respectively (p = NS). No lead related complications were encountered. Conclusions: Obstacles in lead placement for left ventricular stimulation due to challenging coronary sinus anatomy can be safely overcome by the use of 4F active fixation leads with stable pacing parameters. P083 AV NODE ABLATION IS NOT A PREDICTOR OF MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION TREATED WITH CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Trucco E; Tolosana JM; Borras R; Calvo N; Arbelo E; Berruezo A; Sitges M; Castel MA; Brugada J; Mont L Hospital Clinic, Thorax Institute, Cardiology Department, Barcelona, Spain Background: There is a controversy about whether the AVJ node ablation (AVJ) improves the response and reduces the mortality of patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The aims of our study were: 1) to analyze if AVJ ablation reduced the mortality of patients in AF treated with CRT; 2) to analyze the predictors of mortality in this group of patients. Methods: This is a prospective and observational study. A cohort of 154 consecutive patients with permanent AF treated with CRT from 2000 to 2010 in our center was analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1: patients with AVJ ablation or need for continuous ventricular pacing due to complete AV block and group 2: those without AVJ ablation and non AV block. Patients were seen at the outpatient clinic at 6‐month intervals and at any time they required further evaluation due to a worsened clinical condition. Results: Of 154 patients: 78 (50.6%) were classified in group 1 and 76 (49.4%) in group 2. Basal echocardiogram and clinical parameters were similar in both groups. At 12 months, overall mortality was 21/154 (14.2%); 9/78 (11.5%) group 1 vs. 12/76 (15.7%) group 2 (p 0.486). In a univariate analysis the predictors of mortality were: plasma creatinine levels and NYHA functional class IV. After adjusting for these variables in a Cox regression model, the independent predictors of mortality were: basal NYHA functional class IV (HR 3.73, 95% CI [1.45–9.59], p = 0.006) and plasma creatinine levels (HR 1.93, 95% CI [1.00‐ 3.70], p = 0.048). Conclusions: AVJ ablation did not decrease the mortality of patients in AF treated with CRT. Basal NYHA functional class IV and poor renal function were the independent predictors of mortality in this group of patients. P084 A PROSPECTIVE AND RANDOMIZED STUDY USING A NUMERICAL MODEL ABLE TO PERSONALIZE AV AND VV DELAYS IN CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZARION THERAPY Di Molfetta A; Forleo GB; Minni V; Panattoni G; Cioè R; Papavasileiou LP; Magliano G; Santini L; Capria A; Romeo F Department of Cardiology, University of Tor Vergata‐Departement of Cardiovascular Engineer CNR, Rome AV and VV setting is a critical issue in CRT. A numerical model (NM) able to simulate patients condition and optimize AV and VV was developed. The aim of this study was to assess if the developed algorithm dedicated to CRT‐optimization could increase clinical, electrical and echocardiographic outcome. Forty patients (PT) were enrolled in a prospective study and randomized into two groups. Group A (B) contains PT programmed by NM (commercial ones). PT were studied before CRT, 3 (_3) and 6 (_6) months after CRT to evaluate: left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic volumes (Ves, Ved), QRS, 6 minute walking test (S) and total Minnesota scores (M). In group A the AV and VV were changed at each follow up according to NM indications. No significant statistical differences were observed at the baseline (Ves_A = 194 ± 102 ml, Ves_B = 157 ± 56 ml; Ved_A = 252 ± 113 ml, Ved_B = 213 ± 72 ml; QRS_A = 156 ± 44 ms, QRS_B = 150 ± 43; S = 127 ± 88 m, S_B = 132 ± 90; M_A = 29 ± 19, M_B = 33 ± 21) A significant statistical difference in left ventricular remodeling concerning the reduction of Ved (A_3 =−25%, B_3 =−10%, p = 0.001; A_6 =−30%, B_6 =−10%, p = 0.0009) and Ves (A_3 =−23%, B_3 =−12%, p = ns; A_6 =−35%, B_6 =−12%, p = 0.002) were observed. A more evident increase of S distance was observed in A (A_3 =+219 m, B_3 =+198 m; A_6 =+279 m, B_6 =+195 m). No significant statistical difference in the reduction of QRS width was reported (A_3 =−16%, B_3 =−10%; A_6 =−9%, B_6 =−18%) and in M (A_3 =−8.9, B_3 =−14.25; A_6 =−9.25, B_6 =−16). A dynamic and personalized CRT can improve ventricular remodeling, without affecting QRS decreasing. Moreover, NM can be a support to select candidates to CRT estimating in advance the benefit effect of CRT on a specific patient. P085 THE EFFECT OF CARDIAC RESYNCHR‐ ONIZATION THERAPY ON THE LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION: EVALUATION OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC AND ECHOCARD‐ IOGRAPHIC CHANGES Marinskis G; Maneikiene V; Jonaityte D; Zasytyte I; Aidietis A Clinic of Cardiac and Vascular Diseases, Vilnius University, Faculty of Medicine Aim: To evaluate the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy on the left ventricular function by analyzing changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and QRS complex width. Patients and methods: A retrospective study was held in Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu clinics. We analyzed 55 patients (18 women, 37 men, age 61.5 ± 14.5 years) who had biventricular pacing system implantation because of II‐IV NYHA heart failure. Primary implantation was performed for 45 patients, system upgrade – for 10. We analyzed the data of electrocardiograms and heart ultrasound before and after implantation (QRS width, LVEF and clinical status). Microsoft Excel and STATISTICA software was used for data processing and statistical analysis. Student t‐test was used to evaluate the difference between continuous variables in two groups. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between the changes of QRS width and LVEF. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: QRS width average before implantation was 185 ± 26 ms, after – 152 ± 19 ms (P < 0.05). QRS width decreased by mean value of 31 ± 22 ms (P < 0.05). QRS width remained the same in 4 patients. LVEF mean value before implantation was 26 ± 10%, after – 31 ± 9% (P < 0.05). On average LVEF after the implantation increased by 6 ± 10% (P < 0.05). Changes in QRS width correlated with LVEF changes (r =−0.276, p = 0.048). The broader QRS complexes were before treatment, the more significantly they shortened after implantation of resynchronization system (r =−0.52, p = 0.00078). Clinical status (followed from 3 to 76 months after treatment) of 23 (42%) patients improved, 21 (38%) remained stable, 3 (5%) worsened, 8 patients (15%) died. Conclusions: In responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy, shortening of QRS complex correlates with improvement of left ventricular function. P086 PRESERVED CONTRACTILE AND CORONARY FLOW RESERVE ARE PREREQUISITE FOR POSITIVE RESPONSE AFTER CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Djordjevic‐Dikic A; Nikcevic G; Raspopovic S; Jovanovic V; Tesic M; Djordjevic S; Milasinovic G Pacemaker Center, Institute for Cardiovascular Disease, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has become a mainstay in heart failure management, but still 30% of patients failed to respond to such therapy. In patients with non‐ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, abnormal coronary flow reserve and absence of contractile reserve are independent prognostic markers of bad prognosis. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of coronary flow reserve (CFR) and myocardial contractile reserve on left ventricular function recovery following CRT implantation. Method: Eighteen patients with heart failure (EF 26 ± 5%) and QRS duration of 159 ± 23 ms, underwent transthoracic Doppler echocardiography adenosine test to evaluate CFR and dobutamine echocardiography test to assess global contractile reserve (improvement in LVEF), before CRT implantation. Responders were defined by decrease in end‐systolic volume (ESV) ≥15%, 6 months after CRT. Results: Fourteen patients were responders, whereas 4 were nonresponders. At inclusion these groups did not differ in LVEF, ESV, EDV, QRS duration, 6 min walk test distance and coronary flow velocity at rest. Before CRT implantation, responders, compared with nonresponders, showed a greater increase in coronary flow velocity during hyperemia, and consequently higher CFR: 2,39 ± 0,74 vs. 1,68 ± 0.29, p = 0.03. During dobutamine test responders also had higher LVEF, p = 0.02, as well as after 6 months: 45 ± 12% vs. nonresponders 28 ± 8%, p = 0.013. By univariate analysis, LVEF during dobutamine infusion (p = 0.02) and coronary flow velocity during hyperemia (p = 0.04) were predictors for improvement of left ventricular function after CRT. Conclusion: Our results showed that prerequisite for positive response to CRT are preserved CFR and microcirculation and a presence of contractile reserve. P087 PREDICTORS OF THE RESPONSE TO CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH NONISCHEMIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY Vaikhanskaya TG; Kaptsiukh TM; Sidorenko IV; Kovalenko ON Republican Scientific and Practical Center of Cardiology, Minsk, Belarus Purpose: The aim of our study was to identify the significant finding of surface electrocardiogram (ECG) to predict the response to CRT in patients (pts) with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Metods: 34 pts with DCM nonischemic aethiology HF (82,4% male; 48,5 ± 10,7 years; NYHA class 3,0 ± 0,3; QRS 167 ± 21ms; LVEF 24,7 ± 2,8%) had CRT implanted. Pts were classified as symptomatic responder (CRT‐R) if they were experienced ≥5% absolute increase LVEF and improvement NYHA class ≥1 at 6 months after CRT. We (independent 3 doctors)assessed all the clinical characteristics including 12 lead ECG parameters before and after CRT and compared the findings between CRT‐R and non‐responders (CRT‐NR). Results: 15 pts (44,1%,14 male and 3 female) were CRT‐R and 19 pts (55,9%,3 female) were CRT‐NR. At baseline there were no significant differences in age, gender, NYHA, QRS width, 6‐MWT, maxV O2, LVEF, LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic volume and pharmacology therapies between two groups. When compared width QRS,QR,RS,amplitude wave in 12 lead ECG after CRT, responders had a greater RS interval shortening in V1 lead (ΔRS in V1 −16 ± 4,5 ms vs. −8,4 ± 4,9 ms; p = 0,000) and increase R wave in V1 (ΔR in V1 1,4 ± 0,8 mm vs.0,6 ± 0,7 mm; p = 0,004), and at baseline width RS in V1 were significant differences between two groups (RS in V1 55,3 ± 12,4 ms vs. 43,2 ± 13,1 ms; p = 0,01). By multivariate logistic regression analysis identified presence reduction of RS interval and increase R wave in V1 during pacing as independent predictors of response to CRT. Conclusions: The reduction of RS interval and increase R wave in V1 lead during pacing CRT and baseline greater RS in V1 was significantly correlated with improvement of both LVEF and functional capacity. Future studies on larger population are needed to confirm that RS interval in V1 lead may reliable to predict CRT‐R in pts nonischemic DCM with indication to CRT. P088 VECTOR ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC AND HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE TO ATRIOVE‐ NTRICULAR DELAY OPTIMIZATION IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS RECEIVING CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Ståhlberg M; van Geldorp I; van Deursen C; Strik M; Francois R; Francesco F; Auricchio A; Prinzen F Karolinska Institutet, Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Introcuction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the vector electrocardiographic (vECG) and hemodynamic response to atrioventricular delay (AVD) optimization in heart failure patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods: In 19 CRT recipients different AVDs were programmed in steps of 20 ms ranging from 60 ms to each patients maximal AVD before loss of capture during atrial overdrive pacing (90 bpm). ECG was recorded continuously for subsequent analysis of frontal plane vECG. At each AVD, stroke volume (SV) was measured using echocardiography (LVOT‐VTI, average of 10 beats in each setting). The AVD yielding the largest SV was considered optimal. Results: Mean maximal AVD was 270 ± 60 ms. Two different pattern of QRS response to AVD programming was observed. During CRT at short AVDs 8 patients (group 1) displayed a reduction in QRS width > 5% (mean: −23 ± 7%) while in 11 patients (group 2) no significant QRS shortening occurred (mean: +9 ± 15%). A significant, CRT induced, increase in SV over most AVDs was only observed in group 1 patients. Patients in group 2 had significantly shorter baseline QRS width (138 ± 22 vs. 170 ± 28 ms, p = 0.01) and significantly longer optimal AVDs compared to group 1 (220 ± 40 ms vs. 170 ± 50 ms, respectively, p = 0.02). Only in group 2 QRS width was shorter at optimal AVD than at short AVD (‐10 ± 10ms vs. +10 ± 10 ms in group 1, p = 0.02). In group 2 only, vector length was significantly shorter at AVDs > 230 ms compared to at AVD 60 ms which indicates fusion with intrinsic activation. Conclusions: Patients with relatively short QRS duration show little or no resynchronization (QRS reduction) with CRT at short AVD but may benefit from very long AVD, where QRS is reduced. This resynchronization is probably due to fusion with intrinsic activation, as indicated by vector length shortening on the vECG. P089 SINUS RHYTHM RECOVERY IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND DILATED CARDIOMYOPATY WHO UNDERWENT CRT IMPLANT (SIBILLA STUDY) Turco P (1); D'Onofrio A (2); Stabile G (3); Solimene F (4); La Rocca V (5); Cavallaro C (2); Iuliano A (3); Donnici G (4); Vecchione F (2); De Simone (5); Sibilla Study (1) Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy. (2) Monaldi, Napoli, Italy. (3) C. Mediterranea, Napoli, Italy Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) has been demonstrated to be beneficial also in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF); in some patients sinus rhythm occur after CRT. In this patients we evaluate the feasibility of electrical cardioversion (EC) to restore sinus rhythm and the EC efficacy in preserving SR at follow‐up. We enrolled 41 consecutive patients with symptomatic heart failure despite optimal medical treatment, left bundle branch block (QRS duration ≥120 ms), left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and chronic (more than one year) AF, who underwent CRT‐D implant. In all patients, an atrial lead was used. We scheduled one or more internal, by means of device, or external EC in all eligible patients. Results: Major population characteristics are reported in the table.

No complications occurred. EC was effective in restoring SR in 13 patients (68%); an intention to treat analysis shows a success rate of EC procedure (SR) in 31% (13/41). Eleven among thirteen patients (85%) with effective EC remained in SR at a mean follow‐up of 9,2 ± 7,6 months. Spontaneous conversion was observed in two patients. Atria; Calcuim channel; Cellar electrophysiology; Aging EC was feasible in less than 50% of patients with chronic AF post CRT; however SR was persistent at six months in greater than 30% of population, suggesting an atrial lead may be considered at implant. P090 CEPHALIC VENOUS ACCESS FOR CRT WITH SUBCLAVIAN AND CEPHALIC VEIN TORTUROSITY AND ANOMALY Xu Y; Wang J; Qiao Q; Zhang S; Hua W Hangzhou 1st People's Hospital, Fu Wai Hospital, China Introduction: Subclavian venous access can be applied for the majority of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation. However, puncture failure occurs occasionally. Case History: A 70‐years‐old man fulfilled CRT criteria. At first, several attempts were made to puncture the left subclavian vein, until arterial blood was aspirated. Puncture of subclavian vein then was abandoned out of concern for the risk of pneumothorax or hemothorax. Cephalic cutdown were performed. A 16‐gauge, 8.3‐cm angiocath was inserted into the cephalic vein, through which contrast was injected to perform venogram. Cephalic and subclavian venous anomalies were revealed. The proximal cephalic vein devided into two branches, the upper one joined the external jugular vein while the lower one, which was small and torturous, joined the axillary vein laterally at the level of superior border of the second rib, and subclavian vein was also small. A 150‐cm 0.89‐mm hydrophilic glide wire was introduced into the lower branch of the cephalic vein and advanced toward the heart under venographic guidance. A 9‐F 14‐cm sheath was then advanced over the glide wire, once the tip of the sheath unit was positioned in the superior vena cava, the dilator was removed and 2 other standard 50‐cm 0.97‐mm guidewires were introduced. The sheath was peeled away while the 3 guidewires were held in place. A left ventricular (LV) lead delivery system was advanced over the glide wire to position the LV lead. When an acceptable lead position had been attained, the delivery system was removed by tearing. A 8‐F sheath was advanced over one of the 50‐cm guidewires to position the atrial lead. This sheath was peeled away when a suitable position had been attained. Then a 8‐F sheath was placed over the final guidewire to position the right ventricular lead. All leads were fixed separately. A CRT device was implanted. Conclusion: Cephalic venous access is a feasible alternative to subclavian access for CRT. P091 TRANSAPICAL ENDOCARDIAL LV PACING FOR CRT, FIRST EXPERIENCE IN FIVE PATIENTS Karpenko Y; Volkov D Odessa State Medical University, Ukraine Background: CRT is approved method for HF treatment in selected groups of patients (pts). Transvenous method of implantation is common. Endocardial LV pacing seems promising by the fact of rapid physiologic LV depolarization pattern and absence of anatomical limits committed to the transvenous procedures. Life‐long taking of oral anticoagulants is obliged. Objective: To analyze experience of the few first LV endocardial pacing for CRT. Methods: 5 pts (4 men, age 57—74) with LBBB (QRS 170 ± 24 ms), advanced HF NYHA III (EF – 27 ± 9%) were implanted with DDD (3 pts) and DDDRV (2pts) for CRT with transapical endocardial LV lead placing as a part of the procedure. All of them had been on warfarin due to persistent‐permanent AFib. Two pts had repeated transvenous LV lead dislocations, one – no anatomical conditions for transvenous LV lead placement, one – LV lead exit block after repositioning and the last – deterioration after apical RV pacing. After thoracotomy the apex of LV was punctured and conventional screw‐in endocardial lead were inserted into LV by Seldinger method via pill‐away introduser using hemostatic purse‐string sutures. In 3 pts endocardial LV 3D activation mapping (NavX, S.J.M, USA) to find the optimal pacing site were done before final fixation. Then the electrode was tunneled to the pocket. Results: CRT was available in all pts with acute thresholds less than 1,5V,led to dramatic reduction of QRS duration (135 ± 17 ms) and good immediate and mid‐term clinical results (EF – 34 ± 12%). One patients had raise of LV capture threshold up to 3V with adequate pacing with 4,5V amplitude. LV 3D activation mapping during procedure revealed the "latest" point near LV apex in two pts with further implantations in that area which is discordant with existed theory of the best postero‐lateral regions for LV CRT delivery. Conclusion: Endocardial LV pacing for CRT is safe, useful and was at least as effective as traditional methods in our small group. P092 CARDIAC RESYNCHRONISATION THERAPY IN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION PATIENTS – ANY OUTCOME DIFFERENCES TO SINUS RHYTHM PATIENTS? Dusceac D; Iancu A; Capraru C; Bostan I; AlHassan A; Ciudin R "C.Davila" Univ of Medecine, "C C Iliescu" Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Bucharest, Romania Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is been the therapy of choice in patients (pts) with severe heart failure (HF) and left bundle brunch (LBB) QRS morphology. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35%, optimal medical therapy and NYHA class III/IV are also major indications for CRT. Atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence is high in pts with CRT indication but number of such pts enrolled in major CRT clinical trials is not so. We have study 94 pts who underwent CRT for severe HF and we have followed them for a mean of 3.2 years (from 9 years to 11 months). 60 pts had dilated non‐ischaemic etiology and 32 pts were of ischaemic etiology. 1 pt had hypertrophic non obstructive cardiomyopathy. 22 pts (23.4%) were in AF. We compare there outcome in terms of NYHA class, LVEF, mitral regurgitation degree, quality of life (QoL) and clinical and echo parameters evolution. There was no significant difference in NYHA class reduction or LVEF improvement between sinus rhythm (SR) and AF pts.Pts in SR have marginally done better in terms of mitral regurgitation reduction, 6 min walk test and QoL(Minnesota score). Non–responders percent was mainly the same: 26% in AF pts and 23% in SR pts group. If after 3 months following the initial implant the pacing percent was less than 80% despite optimal medical therapy we performed AVN ablation. We conclude that pts in AF can benefit from CRT almost as SR pts but more data and longer follow‐up period is needed. P093 THE CHOICE OF APPROACH TO LEFT VENTRICULAR LEAD IMPLANTATION FOR PERMANENT PACING Osadchy A; Marinin V; Kurnikova E; Lebedev D Almazov Federal Heart, Blood and Endocrinology Centre Objective: to improve surgical results of cardiac conduction disorder by prevention and correction of left ventricle dyssynchrony on the back of permanent pacing. Design and Methods: We observed 257 patients was exam and treated. Task 1 – to study the electrophysiological indices of LV lead, considering the delivery way (n = 80). Task 2 – to evaluate the effect of pacing on hemodynamics and CHF course, consider the lead position (n = 90). Task 3 – to study the anatomy of the venous system of the heart according to coronary angiography (CAG) (n = 107). In each task were formed comparable groups without significant clinical and demographic differences. Task 3 – by etiology patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 – with CHD, 2 – without CHD; we assess the effect of heart chambers enlargement to anatomy of cardiac veins. Venous anatomy was studied considering the zone of myocardial infarction. Results: Task 1 – in 1 group at 21% of cases problems with left ventricular lead was observed, but in 2 group these were absent. Differences in duration of operation, acute and chronic pacing thresholds were not obtained. Task 2 – ECHO: at 1 group ↑LVEDV, MR, ↓EF were significantly; at 2 and 3 group remodeling of heart chambers with normal EF were observed. At 1 group appearance of patients with IV f.cl. (NYHA), at 2 group ↓ quantity patients with III f.cl. were observed. At 3 group quantity patients with II f.cl. were decrease, patients with IV f.cl. weren't register. Task 3 – in all groups CS ostium, MCV, GCV were visualized at 100%. Conclusion: in patients before cardiac resynchronization device implantation is necessary to study the anatomy of cardiac veins and determination the optimal lead position (by tissue Doppler imaging). CAG allows to study the anatomy of cardiac veins and in combination with results of tissue Doppler imaging – permit to select the surgical approach (endovascular or thoracoscopical). P094 CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY IN POTENTIAL HEART TRANSPLANT CANDIDATES Sasov M; Liska B; Goncalvesova E; Margitfalvi P; Svetlosak M; Hatala R National Cardiovascular Institute, Bratislava, Slovakia Selected patients (pts) with end‐stage HF benefit from CRT and CRT might decrease or postpone the need for heart transplant (HTx). Aim of this study was to analyze in clinical practice the implementation of the latest ESC guidelines on CRT in HTx candidates. 311 pts with LVEF ≤ 35% referred for HTx eligibility in the years 1996 – 2009 at our institution were included in the analysis. This comprised 207 pts randomly selected from pts without realized HTx and 104 pts who finally underwent HTx (data taken from last evaluation prior HTx). Their mean age was 49.8 ± 11.4 years, 263 pts (85%) were male. The etiology was dilated CMP in 169 pts (54%), CAD in 87 pts (28%), hypertensive heart in 25 pts (8%), valvular disease in 11 pts (4%) and other in 19 pts (6%). Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) was present in 50 pts (15%) and LBBB in 93 pts (30%). Results: In the entire cohort 110 pts (35%) fulfilled the criteria for CRT. Prevalence of CRT candidates in the subgroup of patients who finally underwent HTx was 51% (53 pts). In candidates for CRT, permanent AF was present in 14 pts (13%) and LBBB in 72 pts (65%). Optimal criteria for achieving CRT response (NYHA III/IV, QRS≥150 ms, LBBB, sinus rhythm) were fulfilled in the entire cohort by 43 pts (14%). Overall, CRT devices were implanted in 22 end‐stage HF pts (7%), 17 of them fulfilled optimal criteria for achieving CRT response. In multivariate analysis the presence of LBBB (P < 0.001) but not QRS duration was independent predictor for criteria fulfillment. Conclusions: More than 1/3 of chronic HF pts eligible for HTx fulfilled criteria for CRT. This proportion was higher (51%) in the subgroup of transplanted pts. CRT was underused in this specific patient cohort with only 20% of pts fulfilling actual indication criteria receiving a CRT device. However, this proportion increased to 40% when optimal criteria for achieving CRT response are considered. P095 FEATURES OF HOLTER MONITORING OF ECG IN CRT PATIENTS Basova VA; Rogacheva NM; Krasnoperov PV; Petruneva TS; Schneider YuA Medical Academy of Postgraduate Study Purpose: to assess the significance and features of Holter Monitoring of ECG in CHF patients with CRT devices. Methods: 112 ECG Monitoring records of patients with severe heart failure were analyzed before and after biventricular pacemaker implantation. 19 patients had coronary artery disease and 32 patients – nonischemic cardiomyopathy. 9 patients was in IV heart failure NYHA class, 32 – was in III NYHA class and 10 – was in II NYHA class. 38 CRT‐P and 13 CRT‐D devices were implanted in our clinic. Results: Holter Monitoring features in CHF patients before biventricular pacemaker implantation were distal type of LBBB (QRS > 170 ms in 13 cases), changing the degree of intraventricular conduction (Δ QRS = 30 ms), high ventricular ectopy (PVC > 100/hour – 7 patients (17%), paired PVC – 2 (4,8%), polymorphic PVC – 3 cases (7,3%), nonsustained VT–– 10 (24,4%), sustained VT – 5 patients (12,2%). Reduction in heart rate variability was registered in 34 patients (SDANN). Biventricular pacing percentage, existence and number of native QRS (own AV conduction) and fusion biventricular pacing with native QRS. The most of patients had biventricular pacing >90%. All patients were separate into 2 groups: "responders" (37) and "nonresponders" (14). Patients of the 1st group ("responders") reduced ventricular ectopy, increased heart rate variability (just in patients with sinus rhythm). However patients of the 2nd group ("nonresponders") had biventricular pacing <80% (3 cases), high ventricular ectopy (2 cases), existence of the fusion biventricular pacing with native QRS complexes > 20% of 24 hours recording (3 cases). Conclusions: It's important to pay attention for biventricular pacing percentage, existence and number of native QRS and fusion biventricular pacing with native QRS complexes during the ECG records analysis. Holter Monitoring of ECG is indicated to CRT patients who didn't response to the therapy. P096 TRIPLE‐SITE VENTRICULAR PACING IN PATIENTS WITH BORDERLINE NARROW QRS AND NYHA III‐IV CARDIAC FAILURE Calovic Z; Vicedomini G; Cuko A; Saviano M; Petreta A; Vitale R; Pappone C Villa Maria Cecilia Hospital, Cotignola, Italy Two‐fifths of heart‐failure patients who receive cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are not benefitting clinically from the device therapy. Purpose: We hypothesized that among others, one of the possible reasons for this failure could be found in group patients who received CRT with a borderline QRS interval of 120 ms. (assuming they meet LVEF% requirements and other criteria). Materials and Methods: In 10 consecutive patients who fullfill "classic" criteria for CRT‐P/D, but borderline QRS duration of 120 ± 5 ms, NYHA III/IV class and echocardiography evidence of dyssynchrony, we performed CRT implantation placing additional CS lead over left ventricle and in that way obtained unify‐right with bifocal LV pacing. CS electrodes were implanted at two separate location of the LV, so the distance between the electrodes would be as far as possible. We use „Y connector" to connect two CS leads in one LV port of the pacemaker. RV electrode was implanted either in septal or apical portion of the heart. Six min hall‐walk test and echocardiography were performed 1 and 3 months after the implantation. Results: All implants were successful. No complications, either peri or post‐procedural, were observed in the patients. After 3 months follow‐up no patients died. Only one patient has no clinical improvement in hearth functional class. The rests of the 9 pts were improved at least one NYHA class, with the increase in LVEF (29,5% vs 38,9%). There was also significant increase in 6 min walking test (P < 0.05), 1 and 3 months, respectively. Conclusion: In our observational study, we found that triple‐site ventricular pacing is feasible and efficacious during 3 months pacing in patients with serious heart failure, borderline narrow QRS and significant ventricular dyssynchrony on TDI. Further bigger study and longer follow‐up is needed for pure clarification of this therapy. P097 PACING MODE SELECTION IN CRT PATIENTS: SEQUENTIAL OR SIMULTANEOUS BIVENTRICULAR PACING Krasnoperov PV; Rogacheva NM; Basova VA; Petruneva TS; Schneider YuA Medical Academy of Postgraduate Study Purpose: to study the results of sequential or simultaneous biventricular pacing in CRT patients, to assess is VV interval optimization need or not. Methods: 51 patients (M‐42, 59,7 ± 7,3 years) with cardiomyopathy (ischemic – 19, nonischemic – 32) were enrolled in the study. 38 CRT‐P and 13 CRT‐D devices were implanted. All patients had such examinations as clinical, ECG, two‐dimensional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging. Sequential or simultaneous biventricular pacing was programmed after operation before discharge. We optimized VV interval with LV outflow tract VTI. We particularly paid attention to clinical status: NYHA functional class, and echocardiographic parameters: LV volumes, LV ejection fraction (EF) at baseline, before discharge and in a 6 month after CRT implantation. Patients with improvements of ≥1 NYHA class at 6‐month follow up were classified as clinical responders. Patients with reduction of >15% in LV end‐systolic (LVESV) or/and end‐diastolic volume (LVEDV) and improvement in the LVEF of >5% were classified as echocardiographic responders. Results: 51 patients were separated depending into 2 groups depending on pacing mode. The 1st group – 29 patients with sequential biventricular pacing. VV interval was optimized after CRT implantation. The 2nd subgroup – 22 patients with simultaneous biventricular pacing. The results of 6 month follow up showed significant reduction of LV sizes and volumes in patients of the both groups. But the 1st group demonstrated biventricular pacing more systolic function improvement: EF, dP/dt, EPSS. Conclusions: Biventricular pacing is effective method of treatment patients with congestive HF. Sequential and simultaneous biventricular pacing lead to reverse LV remodeling. Systolic function increase significantly with sequential biventricular pacing. VV interval optimization is indicated to non‐responders. P098 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF INTERVENTRICU‐ LAR DELAY OPTIMIZATION IN CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY USING ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY VERSUS USING ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY An C; Yang D; Chen K; Xu J; Fang X; Sun N; Liu F; Su H; Huang X; Yan J; Department of Cardiology, Anhui Province Hospital Anhui Institute of Cardiovascular Disease Objective: To assess ECG‐optimized Interventricular Delay Interval (V‐V) in cardiac resynchronization therapy. Methods: 30 CRT patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class III ∼IV, were studied, aging from 42 to 79 (63.3 ± 10.6) years. After one month follow‐up, the patients were programmed to only LV (Left ventricle) pacing and only RV (Right ventricle) pacing, respectively. V‐V interval optimization was performed by ECG as follows: calculating the time from pacing spike to beginning of earliest deflection of QRS complex in precordial leads, first activating epicardial LV lateral wall (named as T1) and secondly during RV pacing (named as T2). Difference between T1 and T2 was regarded as a surrogate measurement of interventricular delay and defined as the best optimal V‐V interval. Echocardiography was performed to measure the optimal V‐V interval using maximal aortic VTI. Results: By echocardiography, there were 20 patients and 5 patients showed the optimal LV synchrony with LV preactivation at 30 ms, 70 ms respectively, while 3 patients gained the most benefit from simultaneous pacing at 0∼5 ms, 2 patient achieved the maximum benefit with RV preactivation at 30 ms. With ECG, 19 patients and 5 patients benefited the most with LV preactivation at 30 ms, 70 ms, respectively. 4 patients got the best benefit with simultaneous pacing at 0∼5 ms, and 2 patients benefited most with RV preactivation at 30 ms. Good concordance was found between the ECG‐optimized and echocardiography‐optimized V‐V interval (K = 0.937). Conclusions: For CRT patients, the optimal V‐V interval can be achieved by ECG which shows a good correlation with UCG. Key words: cardiac resynchronization, electrocardiography, echocardiography. P099 EFFICACY OF CRT IN CHF WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITHOUT ABLATION OF AV NODE, BUT ACHIEVED STRICT RATE CONTROL Mareev YV; Golitsin SP; Sapelnikov OV; Kiktev VG; Latypov RS; Grishin IR; Saidova MA; Shitov VN; Akchurin RS Russian Cardiology Research Complex, Moscow, Russian Federation Aim of our study was to compare effect of CRT therapy in CHF patients with low EF and wide QRS in sinus rhythm (which have been proven) and permanent atrial fibrillation without ablation of AV node. Our hypothesis was that patients with atrial fibrillation and good pharmacological rate control with indication for CRT by EF and QRS duration would have comparable effect from CRT as patients with sinus rhythm. Methods: We used The Minnesota Living_with_Heart_Failure_Questionnaire, 6 minutes walk test, measurement of EF by echocardiography (GE Vivid 7). Percent of biventricular pacing we calculated by using of 24 hours ambulatory monitor. We examined patients before implantation of CRT and after six month. Statistical significance was evaluated with Wilkokson analysis. Results: We included 24 patients: 8 patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and 16 patients with sinus rhythm. 7 of 8 patient with permanent atrial fibrillation had >85% biventricular pacing. This patient had algorithm VSR – his "fusion" complex has same Doppler VTI as biventricular complex. There ware no death in both groups of patients. Functional class by NYHA decreased from 3.1 to 2 (P < 0.05) in group of permanent AF and from 2.9 to 1.6 (P < 0.05) in group of sinus rhythm. MLHFQ decreased from 55 to 39 (P < 0.05) in patients with permanent AF and from 49 to 35 (P < 0.05) in patients with sinus rhythm. 6 minutes walk test increased from 306 to 384m (by 66 m, p< 0.05) in patients with permanent AF and from 368 to 408 (by 40 m, P < 0.05) in patients with sinus rhythm. EF increased from 26.6% to 31.6% (by 5%) in group of permanent atrial fibrillation and from 23.3% to 33.4%(by 10.1%, P < 0.05) in group of sinus rhythm. Conclusion: Patients with permanent AF without ablation of AV node have comparable effect from CRT as patients with sinus rhythm. Limitation: We exclude from study patients with mean heart rate more than 95 bpm. P100 LOSS OF CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY: INCIDENCE, CAUSES AND OUTCOMES Colchero T; Arias MA; Domínguez‐Pérez L; Jiménez‐López J; Puchol A; Pachón M; Lázaro‐Salvador M; Rodríguez‐Padial L Department of Cardiology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain Background and Objectives: The benefits OF cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are directly related to the maintenance of continuous biventricular pacing. The loss of the TRC is a common clinical problem that limits the potential benefits of this therapy in patients with heart failure. We describe the experience in our center by identifying the causes, incidence and results of loss of CRT. Method: Retrospective, observational study of all patients who were implanted with a CRT device for a period of 43.2 months. Results: We analyzed data from 97 patients. 64.4% were male and mean age was 66 years. The indication for CRT was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in 41.8% of cases. 63,2% of patients were implanted with a cardioverter defibrillator system added. During a mean follow‐up of 43,2 months, 15 patients died and a total of 37 (37.8%) patients experienced transient or permanent loss of CRT. Six patients had more than one reason for loss of CRT. The most frequent cause was the presence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (12.3%), followed by dislodgement of the LV electrode (8.2%), increased threshold of the LV electrode (7.2%), extracardiac stimulation (4.1%), increased threshold for the VD electrode (4.1%), ventricular oversensing (3.1%), atrioventricular sensing (3.1%), infection (1%) and clinical intolerance to CRT (1%). The loss of the CRT was resolved in 79.1% (n = 34) of cases and was permanent in 20.9% (n = 9). Univariate analysis was performed to identify possible predictors of loss of CRT but there was no statistically significant difference in any of the variables. Conclusions: Despite technical advances in CRT, the loss of it is a very common clinical condition and difficult to solve in an appreciable percentage of cases. A close monitoring of patients with CRT is essential to identify and solve all the problems associated with this therapy. P101 A NOVEL 3D ELECTROMAGNETIC NAVIGATION SYSTEM REDUCES FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND RADIATION EXPOSURE IN LEFT VENTRICULAR LEAD PLACEMENT Heist EK; Valderrabano M; More R; Ryu K; Greenberg S Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA Introduction: CRT implantation is often associated with extended fluoroscopy time and results in radiation exposure to physicians, patients, and staff. A novel 3D electromagnetic navigation system (MediGuide™, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) can be utilized to facilitate lead delivery with minimal fluoroscopy using specialized sensor‐enabled delivery tools. We report on our initial experience with the MediGuide™ system and tools, and its effect on reducing fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure during placement of left ventricular (LV) leads. Methods: In six canines, LV lead placement was performed by three operators in one or more coronary sinus (CS) branches using both Conventional (Conv) and MediGuide™ approaches in random order. The Conv implant used traditional tools – 0.014 CPS Courier® Guidewire, CPS Aim® inner and CPS Direct® outer catheters (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) and the MediGuide™ system implant used sensor‐enabled equivalent tools. Total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure and lead delivery time were recorded from the time of CS cannulation to the time of final LV lead placement. For statistical evaluation, two‐sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum Test was used. Results: The LV lead was successfully placed in 11 CS branches in 6 canines (1.8 ± 0.8 branches/canine) using both methods. The MediGuide™ system resulted in a 93% reduction in median values of fluoroscopy time (P = 0.001, 0.9 ± 2.0 [median = 0.1] vs 2.2 ± 2.0 [median = 1.5] min) and a 94% reduction in median values of radiation exposure (P = 0.005, 13.8 ± 32.5 [median = 1.7] vs 49.5 ± 45.3 [median = 27.2] uGym2), as measured by dose‐area product. Lead delivery times were similar (MediGuide™:237 ± 193 vs Conv: 186 ± 117 sec, P = 0.27) between the two methods. Conclusions: The MediGuide™ navigation system significantly reduced total fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure during LV lead implantation without compromising final lead location or total procedure time compared to the Conv implant strategy. P102 A NOVEL 3D ELECTROMAGNETIC NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ACCURATE AND RELIABLE FOR LEFT VENTRICULAR LEAD PLACEMENT WITHOUT FLUOROSCOPY GUIDANCE Valderrabano M; Greenberg S; More R; Ryu K; Heist EK The Methodist Hospital System, Houston, TX Introduction: Fluoroscopic exposure during left ventricular (LV) lead placement remains a major concern. A novel 3D electromagnetic navigation system (MediGuide™, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was developed to minimize fluoroscopic exposure by displaying the real‐time location of sensor embedded delivery tools superimposed on pre‐recorded coronary sinus (CS) venograms. We report on the accuracy and reliability of the MediGuide™ system in an in vivo setting with varying heart rates and C‐arm angulations. Methods: In six canines, CS venograms were obtained in three different fluoroscopic projections (RAO, LAO, AP) at three different heart rates (range: 60–140 bpm) for each projection. A MediGuide™ sensor embedded into a 0.014 guidewire was then introduced sequentially into two distinct CS branches. Location of the guidewire sensor detected by MediGuide™ was projected in real time on the pre‐recorded venograms and recorded as a movie file during pacing at the same rates that were used for venogram acquisition. The performance of the MediGuide™ system was assessed by analyzing the displacement between the projected sensor icon and the CS target branch on individual movie frames over three consecutive cardiac cycles. Results: In all six canines, the MediGuide™ sensor‐enabled guidewire could be visualized and tracked without fluoroscopy. The sensor icon was displayed within 1.7 mm of the target branch 90% of the time for all C‐arm angulations and heart rates. The MediGuide™ system accuracy was not affected by heart rate variations up to ± 30 bpm from the original rate that was used to acquire the venogram. In addition, the accuracy results were not affected by various C‐arm angulations (90% Quantiles – RAO: 1.3 mm; LAO: 1.7 mm; and AP: 2.0 mm). Conclusions: The MediGuide™ system provided accurate and reliable tracking of sensor‐enabled tools at various heart rates and C‐arm angulations for LV lead placements without fluoroscopy guidance. CHANNELOPATHIES P103 LIMITED VALUE OF INTRA‐CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY (EPY) IN SCD RISK EVALUATION IN PATIENTS WITH INHERITED ARRHYTHMIAS Zaklyazminskaya EV; Podolyak DG; Shestak AG; Nechaenko AM; Dzemeshkevich SL Perovsky Russian Research Centre of Surgery RAMS Background: Intracardiac electrophysiological (EP) study is considered as one of the methods to evaluate the risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). But the predictive value of this method is still under the question. Material and Methods: Invasive EP study with 3 consequent extra‐stimuli was performed using CardioLab 4,0 Pruca installation. Genetic screening included direct Senger sequencing of SCN5A, KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, TRPM4, MOG1 and KCNE2 genes. Results and Discussion: We did perform EP study in 4 index patients with inherited arrhythmic syndromes. One patient (21 y.o., female, SCD case in the family) had idiopathic ventricular tachycardia with moderate shortening of QT interval till 390 ms. Three patients (males 38 y.o., 40 y.o., and 44 y.o.) had genetically confirmed Brugada syndrome with spontaneous Brugada type‐1 ECG. Patients were carriers of p.Y87C, p.R893H, and p.S1787N mutations in SCN5A gene. We failed to induce ventricular tachycardia in those patients. Nevertheless, for 3 patients ICDs were implanted, and one patient with p.Y87C mutation in SCN5A refuse the ICD implantation. During 1 year of follow‐up female patient had 2 appropriate shocks, male patients with Brugada syndrome did not experienced any shocks for now. Conclusion: We suspect that patients with lack of inducible ventricular tachycardia during EP study cannot be definitely considered at low‐risk of SCD. Presence of strong familial history of sudden death or genetic confirmation of diagnosis has to be taken into account in decision‐making about ICD implantation. This study was partly supported by grant No02740110783, Russian Ministry of Education and Science. P104 FAMILIAL SUDDEN NOCTURNAL CARDIAC DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH J WAVES AND ST SEGMENT ELEVATION PREDOMINANTLY IN INFERIOR AND LATERAL LEADS: EARLY RIPOLARIZATION SYNDROME OR BRUGADA VARIANT? Menichetti F*; Ottonelli AG; Svetlich C; Lilli A; Magnacca M; Chioccioli M; Casolo G Cardiology Unit, Versilia Hospital, Italy. *Cardiology Unit, University of Pisa, Italy A 43‐year‐old man with a family history of sudden nocturnal death (his father, his brother and his cousin died respectively at the age of 35, 49 and 50 year‐old) was presented to our Hospital for cardiologic evaluation. Before any further examination, the cardiologist drew the family tree and observed some correspondences: all died patients were male and had experienced SCD during night‐time. The authors could examine the ECG for one of them, revealing an ER pattern with prominent J waves in infero‐lateral leads. This ECG alteration was also observed in other six living family members who started a medical screening for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy: no structural heart disease was found at MRI scan. All these features are very similar to those which belong to Brugada Syndrome patients (sudden death syndrome associated with right bundle branch block and ST elevation in V1 trough V3), except that J wave and ST segment elevation was not seen in the right precordial leads, but rather in the inferior and lateral leads. All patients were tested with sodium channel blockers (Ajmalina) infusion, but none ECG conversion was observed. After one year, all patients were free from syncope, chest pain and palpitations, but a very close follow up is still going on and they were referred for improved genetic analysis, looking for specific channel mutations. A growing number of case reports and case‐control studies indicate that at some instances, ER is associated with increased risk of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Our report further strengthens the hypothesis of a causal relationship between ER and family sudden nocturnal death and suggests to consider ER as a variant of Brugada syndrome. The authors hope that his case report can stimulate investigators to address the many unresolved questions in this rapidly evolving field. P105 A CASE REPORT OF BRUGADA SYNDROM PATIENT WHO TAKES QUININE AFTER BEING IMPLANTED ICD Dong J; Sun J; Zhang Z; Yuan Y; Feng L; Deng Z Department of Cardiology Zhong Shan People's Hospital, Guangdong, China Background: The Brugada syndrome (BrS) is regarded as a rare genetic disease importantly because of the mutation of SCN5A nowadays. It easily causes unexpected sudden cardiac death by malignant ventricular arrhythmia. The effective treatment is the Implantation of ICD which is an external cardiac defibrillator automatically. Quinidine is the effective durg which is an Ito retardant of sodium channel. Quinine is a levorotatory form of Quinidine. Methods: To observe occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmia in one patient with Brugada syndrome who was implanted ICD in Jun in 2006. From Jun of 2006 to July of 2009, metoprolol and Amiodarone had been regularly taken also. During that time, there were total 15 times Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation events. So metoprolol and Amiodarone were stopped by the patient himself. Then Quinine which is regarded as Quinidine by himself was took. It was regularly took from 200 mg to 600 mg each day. The patient voluntarily takes it about 2 years for no recurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmia. The Quinine is produced by Actavis in England. Results: Malignant ventricular arrhythmia never recurs from July in 2009 by now and his ECG is changed. Conclusions: Quinine is possibly as effective as Quinidine to Brugada syndrome. But it is need to make further investigation. ECG P106 ALTERATIONS IN ATRIAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AFTER HEMODIALYSIS: AN ANALYSIS OF THE P WAVE DURATION AND P WAVE DURATION AMONG CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PATIENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL (USTH) Ona RL; Ramirez MF University of Santo Tomas Hospital, Espana, Manila, Philippines Hemodialysis causes significant changes in hemodynamic status and metabolic milieu in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Electrocardiographic parameters which reflect atrial electrophysiology, exemplified by p wave duration and p wave dispersion, may indirectly reflect these hemodynamic and metabolic changes. Prolonged P‐wave duration (Pmax) has been shown in some studies to be a useful predictor of atrial fibrillation development in various clinical settings. This study aimed to determine the effect of hemodialysis on the p wave duration and p wave dispersion among patients with CKD. This is a prospective study of patients undergoing hemodialysis at the USTH. A 12 L ECG at a standard rate of 25 mm/sec was taken before and immediately after the hemodialysis. P wave duration (Pmax) was measured with electronic digital caliper in all 12 leads by one observer. P wave dispersion (Pwd) was measured. Pmax and Pwd were compared pre and post dialysis using paired student's T‐test. A total of 43 CKD patients with mean age of 55.23 ± 14.3 (age range 22–86 years old), 20 males and 23 females were included in the study. Mean pre‐dialysis Pmax was 72.44 ± 6.58. Mean Post dialysis Pmax was 75.39 ± 8.86. The mean difference between pre‐dialysis and post dialysis Pmax was −2.95 ± 5.55 (P 0.001). Mean pre‐dialysis Pwd was 15.51 ± 5.64. Mean post dialysis Pwd was 19.51 ± 7.29. The mean difference between pre‐dialysis and post‐dialysis Pwd was‐4 ± 6.2 (P0.0001). Among CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis, in our study p wave duration and p wave dispersion significantly increased after hemodialysis indicating prolongation of atrial conduction time. Longer duration of hemodialysis and increase in the amount of ultrafiltrate significantly increase the maximum p wave duration and p wave dispersion. These findings may suggest that the observed p wave prolongation is most likely due to changes in metabolic milieu rather than effect of extracellular volume changes. P107 THE 12‐LEAD ECG IN PERIPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY Tibazarwa K; Lee G; Mayosi BM; Carrington MJ; Stewart SS; Sliwa K Hatter Institute for Cardiovascular Research in Africa, University of Cape Town Background: The prognostic value of the 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in the deadly syndrome of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is unknown. Aim: To determine the prevalence of major and minor ECG abnormalities in PPCM patients on diagnosis, and to identify any ECG correlates of persistent LV dysfunction and/or clinical stability at six‐months follow‐up, where available. Methods: 12‐Lead ECGs were performed on 78 consecutive PPCM patients presenting to two tertiary centres in South Africa on diagnosis, and 44 cases at six‐month follow‐up. Blinded Minnesota coding identified major ECG abnormalities and minor ECG changes. Results: The cohort mainly comprised young Black‐African women (mean age 29 ± 7 years and median body mass index of 24.3 [IQR 22.7–27.5]kg/m2). The majority of cases (n = 70, 90%) presented in sinus rhythm (mean heart rate 100 ± 21 beats/min). At baseline, at least one ECG abnormality/variant was detected in 96% of cases. Major ECG abnormalities and minor variations were detected in 49% (95%CI 37–60%) and 62% (95%CI 51–74%) of cases, respectively; the most common being T‐wave changes (59%), p‐wave abnormality (29%) and QRS‐axis deviation (25%). Of the 44 cases (56%) reviewed at 6‐months, normalisation of the 12‐lead ECG occurred in 25%; the most labile ECG features being heart rate (mean reduction of 27 beats per min; P < 0.001) and abnormal QRS‐axis (36% vs. 14%; p = 0.014). On adjustment, major T‐wave abnormalities on the baseline 12‐lead ECG were associated with lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline (average of −9%, 95%CI −1 to −16; p = 0.03) and at six‐months (‐12%; 95%CI −4 to −24; p = 0.006). Similarly, baseline ST‐segment elevation was associated with lower LVEF at six‐months (‐25%; 95%CI −0.7 to −50; p = 0.04). Conclusions: This unique study shows almost all women with PPCM have an "abnormal□ 12‐lead ECG. Pending more definitive studies, the ECG appears useful as both a screening and prognostic tool in resource‐poor settings. P108 INFLAMMATION MODULATES VENTRICULAR REPOLARIZATION IN CHILDREN WITH KAWASAKI DISEASE Fujino M; Kuriki M; Horio K; Omeki Y; Uchida H; Eryu Y; Boda H; Miyata M; Hata T; Yamazaki T Fujita Health University Introduction: The instability of myocardial repolarization is generally mediated by myocardial failure. We assessed the hypothesis that transmural dispersion of repolarization is increased in the inflamed myocardium in patients with acute‐phase Kawasaki disease. Method: Consecutive 27 infants (M:F = 15:12) with Kawasaki disease aged 2.6 ± 2.2 years and age‐matched control infants were included. RR interval, QT interval and Tp‐e time (CM5 lead) were calculated using analysis software (Acqknowledge Ver. 3.9, Biopac Systems Inc., CA, USA). Tp‐e time was corrected by Fridericia equation (Tp‐eC). These parameters were compared in the acute phase (6.9 ± 3.0 days after onset) and recovery phase (23.0 ± 13.3 days after onset) or control. The relationship between Tp‐e/QT, Tp‐eC and C reactive protein, body temperature on admission were evaluated by regression analysis. Results: 1) The Tp‐e/QT in the acute phase were significantly higher than that in the recovery phase and control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.005, respectively).2) The Tp‐eC in the acute phase was significantly higher than that in the recovery phase and control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively).3) In acute phase, significant positive correlation was observed between Tp‐e/QT and C reactive protein or body temperature (r = 0.677 and 0.672, respectively). Further, between Tp‐eC and C reactive protein or body temperature (r = 0.482 and 0.583, respectively). Conclusions: Transmural dispersion of repolarization assessed by Tp‐e/QT and Tp‐eC was increased by inflammation in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease, which exhibits the sub‐clinical lability of ventricular repolarization. These repolarization properties of the myocardium were considered a useful indicator to assess arrhythmogenesis in patients with Kawasaki disease. P109 FRAGMENTED ECG IN CHAGAS' CARDIOMYOPATHY (FECHA STUDY) Rodriguez C; Baranchuk A; Femenia F; Lopez‐Diez JC; Muratore C; Valentino M; Retyk E; Galizio N; Di Toro D; Alonso K; on behalf of the FECHA Study Investigators IECTAS Maracaibo, Venezuela Background: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) proven to be an effective therapy to prevent sudden death in patients with CChC. Identification of predictors of appropriate therapies delivered by the ICD remains a challenge. Aims: To determine whether surface fragmented ECG helps in identifying patients with CChC and ICDs at higher risk of presenting appropriate ICD therapies. Methods: Retrospective study involving 14 centers from Latin America. All patients with CChC and ICDs were analyzed. Pacing dependent patients were excluded. Clinical demographics, surface ECG and ICD therapies were collected. Bivariate and multivariate analyses analysis were performed. Results: A total of 98 patients from 14 Latin American centers were analyzed. Four cases were excluded due to pacing dependency.63.8% were male, mean age was 55.4 ± 10.4 years old (26/75), mean LVEF was 39.6 ± 11.8%. Secondary prophylaxis was the reason for implanting in 71.3% of the cases. Fragmented surface ECG was found in 56 patients (59.6%). Location of fragmentation was inferior in 57.1%, lateral 35.7% and anterior 44.6%. Rsr pattern was the more prevalent (57.1%). Predictors of appropriate therapy in the multivariate model were: increased age (p = 0.01), secondary prevention indication (p = 0.01) and ventricular pacing >50% of the time (p = 0.004). Male gender presented a positive trend (p = 0.07). The presence of surface ECG fractionation did not identify patients at higher risk of presenting appropriate therapies delivered by the ICD (p = 0.87); regardless of QRS interval duration. Conclusions: Fragmented surface ECG is highly prevalent among patients with CChC. It has been found to be a poor predictor of appropriate therapies delivered by the ICD in this population. P110 THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MYOCARDIAL IRON LOAD AND VENTRICULAR REPOLARIZATION PARAMETERS IN ASYMPTOMATIC BETA‐THALASSEMIA PATIENTS Kayrak M; Gul EE; Acar K; Abdulhalikov T; Ozbek O; Kaya Z; Cardiology/Arrhythmia Selcuk University, Meram School of Medicine, Cardiology Department, Konya, Turkey Background: Previous studies have demonstrated impaired ventricular repolarization in patients with β‐TM. However, the effect of iron overload with cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on cardiac repolarization remains unclear yet. We aimed to examine relationship between repolarization parameters and iron loading using cardiac T2*MRI in asymptomatic β‐TM patients. Methods‐Materials: Twenty‐two β‐TM patients and 22 age and gender matched healthy controls were enrolled to the study. From the 12‐lead surface electrocardiography, regional (QT duration, corrected QT duration, QT dispersion, corrected QT dispersion) and transmyocardial (T peak to T end interval, T peak to T end dispersion, and [T peak‐T end]/QT ratio) repolarization parameters were evaluated digitally by two experienced cardiologists. All patients were also undergone MRI for cardiac T2* evaluation. Main Results: Of the QT parameters, QT duration, corrected QT interval, and QT peak duration were significantly longer in the β‐TM group compared to the healthy controls. Tp‐Te and Tp‐Te dispersion were significantly prolonged in β‐TM group compared to healthy controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Only (Tp‐Te)/QT was similar between groups (p = 0.32). There was no any correlation between cardiac T2* scores and repolarization parameters. Conclusion: Although repolarization parameters were prolonged in asymptomatic β‐TM patients, this prolongation were not correlated with cardiac iron overload. P111 ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC LATE POTENTIAL RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS FREE OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC RISK FACTORS WITH PRESERVED LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION Canataroglu A; Tekin K; Cagliyan CE; Ortoglu G; Tufan MA; Sahin DY; Koc M; Sakalli H Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital, Departement of Rheumatology Aim: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and conduction disturbances due to atherosclerosis is a common manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Objective of this study is to investigate electrocardiographic late potentials (LP) by using signal averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in patients with RA with no traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. Presence of LP's had been considered as a substrate for increased SCD in patients with cardiovascular disease. There is no previous study investigating LP's in RA patients. Methods: A total of 34 patients with RA (RA Group) and 32 healthy controls had been included in our study. All of the RA patients and controls had neither history of cardiovascular disease nor cardiac risk factors. SAECG recordings and calculations were made due to Simson method in all of them. Individuals positive for the following 2 of 3 criteria were considered to have electrocardiographic late potential (LP): 1. Filtered QRS duration (FQRS) > 110 ms 2. Root mean square voltage (RMS) in the last 40 ms < 25 mV and 3. Low amplitude duration (LAD) < 40 mv of > 38 ms. Results: SAECG calculations were made from a mean of 350 cardiac cycles and mean noise level was 0.79 ± 0.22 mV. Continous variables were compared by using t test.FQRS levels were significantly higher (82.14 ± 11.6 mV vs 77.00 ± 8.4 mV; p: 0.044) in the RA group. RMS levels were lower (63.51 ± 43.7 vs 82.87 ± 35.6 mV; p: 0.052) and LAD levels were higher (28.93 ± 12.0 vs 25.25 ± 6.5 ms; p: 0.124) in RA group, and the differences weren't statistically significant. Electrocardiographic LP's were observed in 12 patients with RA whereas none of the controls had LP'S (35.3% vs 0%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Cardiac LP's seem to be significantly increased in RA patients free of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors with preserved left ventricular function. Carefully designed prospective studies including higher numbers of this patient group are needed for more accurate results. P112 ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC P WAVE CHARACTERISTICS IN PATIENTS WITH THALASSEMIA MAJOR: P‐INDEX AND INTERATRIAL BLOCK Kayrak M; Acar K; Gul EE; Abdulhalikov T; Ozbek O; Ucar R; Alibaşiç H; Cardiology/Arrhythmia Selcuk University, Meram School of Medicine, Cardiology Department, Konya, Turkey Background: Although previous studies have documented a variety of electrocardiogram abnormalities in beta‐thalassemia major (β‐TM), little is known about P‐wave indices (P max, P min, and P dispersion), an independent risk factor for development of atrial fibrillation (AF). P index (Pi) and interatrial block (IAB) as novel parameters may more accurately predict AF and has not been previously investigated in β‐TM patients. We aimed to examine relationship between P‐wave parameters (traditional and novel) and iron loading using cardiac T2*MRI in asymptomatic β‐TM patients. Methods‐Materials: Twenty‐two β‐TM patients and 22 age and gender‐matched healthy controls were enrolled to the study. P‐wave duration was measured in all 12‐leads of the surface ECG. The difference between maximum and minimum P‐wave durations was defined as Pd. The standard deviation of the P‐wave duration across the 12 ECG leads accepted as a Pi. P wave duration above and equal 110 milliseconds was defined as interatrial block (IAB). All P‐wave parameters were evaluated digitally by two observers. All patients were also undergone MRI for cardiac T2* evaluation. Cardiac T2* score under 20 msec was considered as iron overload status. Main Results: P max, P min, and P index were significantly prolonged in the β‐TM group compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.005, p = 0.014, and p = 0.034, respectively). Only P disp was found similar between groups (p = 0.46). The prevalence of IAB was 41% and 73% in patients with β‐TM and healthy controls (p = 0.033). P‐wave parameters of patients with cardiac T2*<20 msec and T2*≥ 20 msec were comparable in patients with β‐TM. There was no correlation between P‐wave parameters and cardiac T2*MRI values. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that Pi and IAB frequency were increased in patients with β‐TM. These novel parameters may be useful measurement tools in predicting AF in the recent group. P113 ASSOCIATION OF P WAVE DURATION AND DISPERSION WITH BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE TO EXERCISE IN NON‐HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS Yao RC; Mancera JR; Asido CD; Ramirez MF University of Santo Tomas Hospital Objective: We hypothesize that hypertensive blood pressure responses to exercise stress test may be associated with prolonged P‐wave indices among non‐hypertensive patients. Methodology: Non‐hypertensive patients without known structural heart disease 18 years old and above with negative stress tests were included. Resting 12‐lead ECG at a paper speed of 25mm/s and 1mV/cm were recorded. An electronic caliper was used to measure P‐wave duration and dispersion. Patients were classified into normal systolic blood pressure (SBP), normal diastolic blood pressure (DBP), hypertensive SBP, and hypertensive DBP groups. Mean P‐wave indices were compared using independent samples T test. Results: 76 patients were eligible with mean age of 43.77 ± 12.16. 46% were male; 12.7%, smokers; 7.6%, diabetic; and 21.5%, dyslipidemic. Mean P‐wave dispersion in the hypertensive SBP group was higher than the normal SBP group (0.0512 ± 0.0234 vs 0.0386 ± 0.0200 P = 0.032). No significant difference in P‐wave dispersion between the hypertensive DBP and normal DBP groups was seen. P‐wave duration was prolonged in the hypertensive DBP group (0.113 ± 0.0147 vs 0.103 ± 0.0142 P = 0.031). Conclusion: Among non‐hypertensive patients, hypertensive systolic blood pressure response to exercise was associated with more prolonged P‐wave dispersion while hypertensive diastolic blood pressure response to exercise was associated with more prolonged P‐wave duration. P114 INFLUENCE OF THE ELECTRICAL AXIS OF THE HEART TO QRS DURATION AFTER BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION Kazakevicius T; Zabiela V; Kazakevicius L; Sileikis V; Sedlickaite D; Puodziukynas A Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania Background: Biventricular (BiV) pacing is indicated for treatment of heart failure patients with interventricular or intraventricular dyssynchrony and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Shortening of QRS duration is expected during implantation of BiV pacemaker. We observed differences in changes of QRS morphology, duration and electrical axis before and during simultaneous, left and right ventricle pacing. Aim of our study was to find correlation between these parameters. Methods: Electrical axis of the heart (QRS vector) was calculated using mathematical formula of P.N.Singh and M.Sajjad Athar Tanθ== (I+2III)/(I√3) before pacemaker implantation, during left (LV), right (RV) and simultaneous (BiV) ventricle pacing. Correlation was calculated between axis and duration of QRS complex. Results: Duration of QRS complex changed in all 27 consecutive patients with statistically significant (P < 0.001) mean difference 43.7 ± 10.6 ms. Observed correlation between QRS complex width during BiV pacing and following parameters: 1Electrical axis of preoperative (initial) QRS complex (correlation coefficient was −0.87),2Preoperative duration of QRS complex (correlation coefficient was +0.92),3Duration of QRS complex during LV pacing (correlation coefficient was +0.93). Best results (narrowness of QRS) were achieved when QRS axis before implantation was between 60° and 76°– normal or slightly to the right axis (37.5% of patients) then the QRS with LBBB and left axis morphology. Conclusions: According to our data LBBB and normal axis morphology of preoperative QRS complex predispose greater narrowing of QRS complex after implantation of biventricular pacemaker. Duration of preoperative and LV pacing QRS depends on ventricular conduction properties and has influence for postoperative QRS duration. P115 DAILY MONITORING OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAM IN DIAGNOSTICS OF PARASYSTOLES IN CHILDREN Dolgikh VV; Zurbanov AV; Denisova TV; Rychkova LV Scientific Centre of Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems of Siberian Brunsh of RAMS The Aim: To evaluate the frequency of parasystoles in the structure of the heterotropic heart rhythm disorders among children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 125 children aged 7–17 years with the idiopathic extrasystoles. All patients were examined by electrocardiography (ECG) in 12 standard leads and it was done 24‐hour monitoring ECG. The Results: According to the results of standard ECG in 81 children was found supraventricular extrasystoles, in 44 children – ventricular extrasystoles. Parasystolic signs, namely: the coupling interval variability, fusion complexes, multiplicity of interectopic intervals were found on standard ECG with 15 children (12%). Ectopic inflow in this group registered in atrioventricular node in one child (0.8%). 14 (11.2%) children has the diagnosis of ventricular parasystole. It should be noted that the multiplicity of the interectopic intervals on the standard ECG happened only among 3 people. Long‐term ECG recording complemented our group of surveyed with parasystoles, which con‐sisted of 4 children with ventricular and 1 child with atrial parasystole and parasystoles from atrio‐ventricular node. Thus, the total number of patients with parasystoles was 21 (16.8%). According to the daily monitoring, the number of registered parasystoles, with account fusion complexes was from 5 to 13 thousand per day. The coupling interval variability had increased significantly compared to the standard ECG and ranged from 100 to 230 msec, an average of 140 msec. Conclusion: therefore, the results showed a significant prevalence of parasystoles, as well as advantage of daily monitoring in the diagnosis of this dysrhythmia. P116 ACUTE EFFECTS OF ENERGY DRINK ON CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS AMONG HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS Elcano JW; Ramboyong RE; Ramirez MF The Medical City Background: Energy drinks are consumed by teens, young adults, athletes and medical students at an alarming rate despite their unproven safety. The reported association of energy drinks to arrhythmias after its consumption remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of energy drink among healthy young adults was associated with any acute cardiovascular physiologic effects as measured by blood pressure (BP), heart rate and electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters that are markers of increased arrhythmia risk. Method: A total of 103 healthy young adults were randomized to either an energy drink or placebo. Heart rate, blood pressure and ECG were taken immediately before, thirty minutes, one hour and two hours after consumption of the assigned beverage. P wave dispersion (PWD), P wave variability, QT interval, corrected QT interval (QTI rc), RR interval, QRS duration and morphology, and the presence of ST changes relative to the isoelectric line, T wave inversions, Atrial premature complexes (APCs) and Ventricular premature complexes (PVCs) were accounted for. Results: Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly increased in the treatment compared to placebo group at thirty minutes, one hour, and two hours, but there was no significant difference in the heart rate for all time frames. The PWD values were significantly longer in the treatment group at thirty minutes. There were no statistically significant differences in the QRS duration and QT interval between placebo and treatment. Two subjects developed premature ventricular complexes at one hour and two hours post energy drink ingestion. There were no ST segment shifts nor T wave inversions noted. Conclusion: These results suggest that acute ingestion of energy drink can cause systolic and diastolic BP elevation but no significant change in heart rate. No significant arrhythmia was observed in our study. P117 ST SEGMENT DEPRESION MORPHOLOGIES DURING SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYACRDIA Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Objetive: ST segment depression is a known high risk marker in coronary syndromes. It's value remains unknown in the presence of certain arrhythmias. The aim of this study is to determine the different morphologies in ST depression and its prevalence during supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Method: Patients selected for paroxysmal SVT radiofrequency ablation were included. Only nodal re‐entrant tachycardia was included without bundle Branch block or other arrhythmias. CAD history and coronary risk factors were analyzed. ST segment depression was defined as equal or greater than 0.1 mv measured 80 ms after J deflection in more than one contiguous leads. Horizontal and descendent morphologies were considered pathologic and ascendant ST depression as normal. We compared the group which developed pathologic ST segment depression and normal. Results: A total of 162 patients, (age 48 ± 17 years, 67.6% female, 41.89% showed coronary risk factors and 8.78% coronary artery disease history); 39.86% presented STD (10.13% ascendant, 6.81% descendent and 25.67% horizontal). The group that did not developed STD presented a higher mean age, coronary risk factors and coronary artery disease history. The group that developed STD were younger (45 ± 17 vs. 50 ± 16 years, p = 0.05) with less CRF (49.51% vs.25%, p = 0.04) and the arrhythmia had a shorter cycle length (258.99 mseg vs. 343.46 mseg, p = 0.05). Pathological STD was observed in 44 cases (29.72%); those presenting this condition were even younger compared to the ones with non pathological STD or without STD (43 ± 17 vs. 50 ± 16 years, p = 0.03) and had a higher prevalence of female sex (78% vs. 63%, p = 0.09). Conclusion: These results suggest that STD is a length cycle phenomenon and it is most commonly seen in healthier populations, questioning its value as a high risk marker in certain arrhythmias. This result should be analyzed in further prospective trials. P118 HAVE FRAGMENTED QRS ANY PROGNOSTIC VALUE IN CRT‐D PATIENTS? Cipolletta L; Luzi M; Brambatti M; Guerra F; Matassini MV; Capucci A Cardiologic Clinic, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy Fragmented‐QRS on electrocardiogram (ECG) is a marker of depolarization abnormality that can be correlated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study is to analyze the responsiveness to CRT‐D and cardiac event rate in patients with fragmented‐QRS. We studied 58 patients, candidated to CRT‐D(mean age 70.8 ± 6.8 years, mean EF 24 ± 9%, NYHA III) with an echocardiogram and a 12‐lead ECG before and after implant. 3 readers, blinded to clinical outcome, analyzed ECG. Fragmented‐QRS in narrow QRS were defined as: presence of a notching in R or S wave in two or more contiguous leads. Fragmented‐QRS in patients with wide QRS were defined as ≥2 notches in the R or the S wave. Non‐responders were defined as patients with no improvement of NYHA class and no increase of ejection fraction (EF) at 3 months >10% than baseline. Interventricular dyssynchrony was measured considered an aorto‐pulmonary pre‐ejection delay >40 msec. Spontaneous fragmented‐QRS prevalence was 66% in all patients; stimulated fragmented‐QRS prevalence was 52% in ischemic and 59% in non‐ischemic patients. Elderly (≥65 years) have a 2.8‐fold higher risk to have a stimulated fragmented‐QRS (p = 0.005). At 6 months follow‐up, the incidence of non‐responders to CRT is higher in patients with stimulated fragmented‐QRS (88% vs 45%; p = 0.031). Patients with spontaneous non‐fragmented‐QRS have a greater reduction of left ventricular dyssynchrony (‐34.9 ± 11.7 ms vs −11.3 ± 26.0 ms, p = 0.030); patients without stimulated fragmented‐QRS showed a greater increase of left‐ventricular EF (12.9 ± 12.3% vs 6.23 ± 9.7%, p = 0.009) at 6 months. In our study fragmented‐QRS is not predictive of arrhythmic events. Non‐fragmented QRS is associated with an improvement of echocardiographic parameters, thus it could be a good marker in identifying responders. Instead, the persistence of stimulated fragmented‐QRS is associated with lack of response to CRT making this subgroup less likely to benefit from CRT. GENETICS P119 COMMON NOS1AP GENETIC VARIANT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN DCM AND ALL‐CAUSE DEATH IN ICM Pei J; Che J; Zhan Y; Pu J State Key Lab Translational Cardiovascular Medicine, Cardiovascular Institute and Fu Wai Hospital Background: QT interval duration was an intermediate phenotype for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and a surrogate marker of SCD risk. Recent studies have shown that genetic variations in affecting QT interval and occurrence of cardiac events in healthy subjects and CAD respectively. Objective: We set to investigate whether the affecting QT interval gene variants are related to SCD in patients with CHF in a prospective study of Chinese Han populations. Methods: Using haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) to choose 6 SNPs of three candidate‐genes (KCNJ2, KCNJ11, NOS1AP) in modulating QT interval. 6 marker SNPs were genotyped to assess the effect of variant alleles on QTc and the association with SCD risk in patients with CHF. Results: The successful follow‐up rate was 86.06%(1117 cases) including 303 (85.59%) cases of DCM and 814 (86.29%) cases of ICM with the median follow‐up time of 48 months (0.58∼70 months). 298 (26.68%) cases died in total, including 133 cases of DCM and 215 cases of ICM. Of them 60 cases (45.11%)of DCM and 67 cases (40.6%)of ICM had SCD. We found that the A allele of rs12567209 in NOS1AP was significantly not associated with adjusted QT interval in additive model but involved in the prognosis of CHF. After adjusting for age, gender, and suspected risk factors, patients carrying the A allele of rs12567209 had an increased risk of SCD (HR with 4.165 for 95% CI 2.052–10.382) and cardiac death (HR with 1.893 for 95% CI 1.205–3.887) in DCM. However, in ICM patients carrying the A allele of rs12567209 was only associated with cardiac death (HR with 1.524 for 95% CI 1.278–1.78). Conclusions: The A allele of rs12567209 in NOS1AP is associated with increased risk of SCD in patients with DCM and all‐cause death in ICM. The A allele of rs12567209 in NOS1AP is an independent protective factor against SCD in patients with DCM. Key words: genetics variant; QT interval; sudden cardiac death; predictor P120 A PROTECTIVE ROLE OF KCNE1 G38S POLYMORPHISM AGAINST SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN PATIENTS WITH DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY Galati F; Galati A; Massari S Department of Biological and Environmental Science and Technologies, University of Salento, Lecce, I Introduction: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a myocardial disease with a multifactorial etiology. During recent years it has become evident that genetic factors can play a crucial role in its etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis. So we decided to investigate the effects of G38S polymorphism in the KCNE1 gene, that encodes for the β subunit of Iks potassium channel, in ischemic and idiopathic DCM (EF ≤ 35%). Methods: G38S polymorphism was genotyped by RFLP‐PCR in 132 subjects with idiopathic and ischemic DCM, treated with an ICD for primary prevention of sustained ventricular tachycardia (TV) or ventricular fibrillation (FV). Patients were followed at 6‐month intervals. Results: During a median follow‐up time of 47 ± 13 months, 60 patients (45,5%) developed almost one episode of TV/FV. We observed a prevalence of SS genotype in subjects without life‐threatening arrhythmias, although not statistically significant. Hypertension and diabetes could increase mortality and morbidity in DCM. So we divided our population into two groups, depending on the presence (I group – 78 pts) or absence (II group – 54 pts) of these diseases. Group I didn't show any difference in the distribution of alleles. In group II only 1/25 of homozygous carriers of the S38 allele developed severe ventricular arrhythmias, while 48,00% of GG38 patients (12/25) experienced at least one episode of TV/FV: this distribution was statistically significant (P < 0,05). So the incidence of TV/FV was lower in SS homozygotes (1/10; 10% vs 90%) than in G carriers (24/44; 55% vs 45%– P < 0,025). Conclusion: These results suggest that S38 allele can act as protective factor against malignant arrhythmias in patients with DCM without hypertension and/or diabetes. IMPLANTED CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS P121 SURVIVAL, INCIDENCE AND TIME‐DEPENDENCE OF APPROPRIATE THERAPY IN PATIENTS RECEIVING ICDS FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION: LONG‐TERM FOLLOW‐UP IN A TERTIARY SINGLE CENTER Kanoupakis EM; Koutalas EP; Mavrakis HE; Kallergis EM; Saloustros IG; Goudis CA; Psathakis E; Petousis S; Vardas PE Cardiology Dpt, University Hospital of Heraklion Crete Introduction: Despite the increased utilization of ICDs for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, there is a limited number of long‐term follow‐up data regarding outcomes of this population in a routine clinical practice, outside the context of controlled clinical trials. In the present, analysis we examined the survival, the incidence and time‐dependence of appropriate ICD therapy for ventricular arrhythmias in patients who underwent ICD implantation at our institution. Methods and Results: We acquired data from patients with ischaemic, non‐ischaemic dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well as patients with inherited channelopathies who received an ICD from 1996 to 2009 for primary prevention. Of 377 ICD recipients 44 deaths were observed (11.7%). Median survival was 8.9 years (95% CI: 86–95). 87 patients (23.1%) had appropriate ICD therapy. Median shock time was 6.9 years (95% CI: 41–72). Incidence of first appropriate ICD therapy was 7.7% in the first year postimplant, increased to 12.5% in year 2, while in year 5 it was 58.3%. Comparing Kaplan‐Meier curves between ischemic and nonischemic patients, nonischemic patients seem to receive shocks at a significantly higher rate than ischemic patients (p = 0.04). Conclusion: In a routine clinical practice primary prevention population, mortality rate remains low. The risk of first appropriate ICD therapy persists over long lifetime and necessitates continuing device therapy irrespective of shock‐free intervals. P122 INTRAVASCULAR DEFIBRILLATOR (INNERPULSE PICD): IMPLANTATION AND REMOVAL TECHNIQUES Merkely B; Geller L; Molnar L; Neuzil P; Reddy V; Tondo C; Natale A; Bednarek J; Bartus K; Sanders WE, Jr Heart Center Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Background: A percutaneously placed, implantable intravascular defibrillator has been developed (PICD). This is the first defibrillator for which removal techniques were developed in conjunction with a femoral vein implantation method. Objective: This study evaluated the initial implant techniques and tools as well as the acute removal procedure in a canine model. Methods: Ten hounds were anesthetized and a custom sheath was introduced into the femoral vein. Two guidewires were placed in the jugular vein and the PICD advanced via the femoral vein over a wire into the vasculature. Utilizing a delivery catheter the device was positioned such that the titanium electrodes (cathodes) were located in the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava (IVC). A self‐expanding Nitinol anchor was advanced to the jugular via the second wire and deployed to secure the PICD in the vasculature. With a lead placement catheter the RV coil electrode (anode) was positioned in the RV apex. The catheters and wires were removed with an average implant time of under 18 minutes. For removal, the IVC segment of the PICD was snared utilizing a custom catheter. The RV lead was separated from the body of the PICD by cutting the lead inside a protective sheath. A novel catheter with a surgical cutting wire was then advanced over the device. The PICD was used as a rail to advance the cutting wire to the anchoring region. The silicone segment of the PICD was detached from the Nitinol anchor by the cutting catheter and the entire device was removed via the femoral vein. The RV lead was then snared. A cutting wire was positioned at a specific detachment region at the tip and the lead was cut and removed through the femoral vein. Results: Each procedure, both implant and removal, required less than 20 minutes. All implants and removals were successful with no complications. Conclusions: The PICD can be rapidly and safely implanted and removed in canines. P123 LONG‐TERM RESULTS OF ICD IMPLANTATION Revishvili A; Lomidze N; Neminushiy N Bakoulev Scientific Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, Moscow, Russia Purpose of Study: Is to analyze the efficacy of ICD during long‐term follow‐up, estimate survival of patients with ICD, evaluate complication rate in the immediate and late postoperative periods. Material: 426 ICDs were implanted in our clinic in 1990–2010. Primary implantation was performed in 301 patients, in 125 cases the ICD were replaced because of battery depletion. Second and fourth generation of ICDs with epicardial leads were implanted in 11 patients with help of open chest surgery, for 2 patients from them (IV generation ICD) this methodic was used because of impossibility of transvenous implantation. Results: We evaluated long‐term results of 292 patients (237 male, age 12–82 years, average 50,5 ± 15,3 years, follow‐up period 1–178 months, average 39,9 ± 34,5). During this period 168 pts (57,5%) received ICD therapy, the interval between the implantation and the first therapy was 0,2 – 70 month, average follow‐up time in this group was 24,1 ± 19,3 month, in group of patients who did not get an ICD therapy – 15,5 ± 12,2 month (p = 0,04). Most of episodes of VT were terminated by electrical shocks (156) that were determined by tachycardia behavior and hemodynamic condition of patients. ATP was successful in 68 patients. Multifactorial analysis revealed that the only variable which influenced rate of ICD therapy was left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) which in group of patients who got ICD therapy was in the average 41,3 ± 16,8%, and in group of patients who did not get ICD therapy– 57,4 ± 15,7% (P < 0,03). Most important factor effecting survival was LVEF. Generally LVEF was 46,8 ± 15,7%, in deceased – 30,3 ± 16,9% (p = 0,001). Total cumulative proportional survival (Kaplan‐Meier) was 73% during 150 month. Conclusions: In our opinion LVEF is the most significant factor influencing: survival, occurrence of VT, VT number and accordingly occurrence of ICD therapy. P124 SPRINT FIDELIS DEFIBRILLATION LEAD: A NINE‐CENTRE EXPERIENCE IN SPAIN Domínguez‐Pérez L; Arias MA; Jiménez‐López J; Toquero J; Jiménez‐Candil J; Díaz‐Infante E; Tercedor L; Olagüe J; García Fernández J; Rodríguez‐Padial L Department of Cardiology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud Introduction and Objectives: Sprint Fidelis defibrillation leads are prone to early failure. Most of the series reported come from a single institution. This paper describes the clinical experience in nine Spanish hospitals. Methods: Clinical, implant, and follow‐up visits data of all patients with Sprint Fidelis lead were analyzed. All cases of lead failure were identified, medium‐term lead survival was calculated and possible predictors for lead failure were determined. Results: A total of 378 leads in 376 patients were studied. The mean age (male 85.7%) was 64.9 ± 13.6 years. The majority of patients (59.8%) had ischemic heart disease. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.334 ± 0.1445%. Left subclavian vein puncture was used in 74.8%. During a mean follow‐up of 30.9 ± 14.0 months, 16 lead failures have occurred with a lead survival of 96.1% at 36 months after implantation. Eleven of 16 lead failures were caused by failure of pace/sense conductors, 3 failures were caused by defects in the high‐voltage conductor, and 2 cases were caused by defects in both types of conductors. A less depressed LVEF was associated with an increased probability of lead failure (0.424 ± 16% vs. 0.330 ± 0.143%, p = 0.011). Three hospitals presented a rate of lead failure higher than 10%, being less than 5% in the remaining 6 hospitals. Conclusions: In this multicenter series of 378 leads, the three‐year estimated survival was higher than that reported in prior series. Clinical presentation of lead failures was similar to that reported previously. LVEF and hospital of implantation were variables associated to lead failure. P125 IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR THERAPY REDUCES ARRHYTHMIC MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION Tsiachris D; Gatzoulis KA; Dilaveris P; Arsenos P; Archontakis S; Sideris S; Kartsagoulis E; Vouliotis A; Kallikazaros I; Stefanadis C First Cardiology Clinic, University of Athens Medical School, Hippokration Hospital, Athens, Greece Background: Current guidelines for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death have used a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% as a critical point to justify implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation in post myocardial infarction patients and in those with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared mortality and ICD activation rates among different ICD group recipients using a cut‐off value for LVEF ≤ 35%. Methods: We followed up for a mean period of 41.1 months 495 ICD recipients (442 males, 65.6 years old, 68.9% post myocardial infarction patients, 422 with LVEF ≤ 35%). Prevention was considered primary in patients who fulfilled guidelines criteria or had inducible ventricular arrhythmia during programmed ventricular stimulation for patients with LVEF > 35%. Results: Over the course of the trial, 84 of 495 patients died; 69 experienced cardiac death (6 sudden) and 15 non cardiac death. ICD recipients with LVEF ≤ 35% compared to those with preserved LVEF (mean LVEF = 43%) had a greater incidence of total mortality (18% vs. 11%, log rank p = 0.028) and cardiac death (15.4% vs. 5.5%, log rank p = 0.005). There was no difference in the cumulative incidence for appropriate therapy between patients with LVEF ≤ 35% and those with LVEF > 35% (56.9% vs. 65.8%, log rank p = 0.93). Similarly, no difference was observed between the two groups in the incidence of ICD shocks or antitachycardia pacing (34.6% vs. 45.2%, log rank p = 0.35 and 50.2% vs. 57.5%, log rank p = 0.98, respectively). In the multivariate analysis the presence of advanced New York Heart Association stage predicted both total mortality (HR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.771–4.086) and cardiac death (HR = 3.437, 95% CI 2.163–5.463). Conclusions: ICD therapy may protect heart failure patients at early stages from arrhythmic morbidity and mortality, based on an electrophysiology‐guided risk stratification approach. P126 PREDICTORS OF INAPPROPRIATE THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER‐DEFIBRILLATORS AND CHAGAS' CARDIOMYOPATHY Rodriguez C; Miranda R; Femenia F; Lopez‐Diez JC; Serra JL; Muratore C; Valentino M; Retyk E; Galizio N; Baranchuk A; on behalf of the FECHA Study Investigators IECTAS Maracaibo, Venezuela Introduction: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) proven to be an effective therapy to prevent sudden death in patients with Chagas' Cardiomyopathy (CChC). Identification of predictors of inappropriate therapy delivered by the ICD would allow implementing medical or ICD programming interventions. Methods: Retrospective study involving patients with CChC and ICD from 14 centers in Latin America, follow up of 33 ± 20 months. Demographics, surface ECG and clinical and ICD follow up were collected. ICD therapies were reviewed by 2 independent investigators. Chi‐square and logistic regression were performed. Results: A total of 94 patients were analyzed. Mean age 55 ± 10 years old (26/75), 62 male (63.8%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 39.6 ± 11.8%. Secondary prophylaxis was the reason for implanting an ICD in 71.3% of the cases. During a follow up of 33 ± 20 months, 19 patients (20%), presented inappropriate therapies. Univariate analysis can be seen in Figure 1. Multivariate analysis adjusted by age and LVEF showed that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 2.4, 1.2–3.6; p = 0.01), QRS>150 ms (OR 1.6, 1.1–2.3; p = 0.04) and B‐Blocker therapy (OR 0.93, 0.84–0.97; p = 0.04) remained statistically significant. Conclusion: In patients with CChC and ICD, paroxysmal AF and QRS>150 ms increased the risk of inappropriate therapies. The use of B‐blockers therapy was protective. P127 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA WENT UNDETECTED BY ICD? A CASE REPORT Tan VH 1; Lee LL 1; Goh YS 1; Tong KL 1; Chow J 1; Tan BY 21 Changi General Hospital, Singapore; 2National Heart Centre, Singapore Introduction: ICD shock occurred in about 10–20% of patients who received ICD therapies. However, there is paucity of data on ventricular arrhythmia undetected by ICD. We attempt to describe a case of VT which was undetected by ICD and subsequent management. Case Description: 53 years old man, a sudden cardiac arrest survival (developed VT at rate of 168 bpm or 357 ms cycle length). He was later diagnosed to have arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and underwent ICD implantation (Medtronic Maximo VR 7232) in November 2010. Initial ICD setting include VT zone (430 ms, 140 bpm), FVT via VF (250 ms, 240 bpm), VF zone (320 ms, 188 bpm), wavelet threshold, onset, stability and SVT discrimination were on. He was on oral sotalol 40 mgbd. He started to feel lethargy 1 day prior to admission in June 2011. He went to seek general practitioner advice and ECG was done which showed VT and was immediately referred to hospital. On arrival at emergency department, ECG showed VT (176 bpm, 341 ms). He was given intravenous amiodarone for an hour but unsuccessfully cardioverted. He subsequently underwent synchronised cardioversion and returned to sinus rhythm. ICD interrogation revealed VT occurring at rate of 390–430 ms. It was recognized by the device as gradual onset tachycardia and therefore no shock was given. R wave sensitivity was 0.3 mv. Defibrillation threshold check was normal. Blood investigations showed no evidenced of sepsis or electrolytes abnormality. Adjustment was made in which the onset and stability was off. He did not experienced further ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalization and was subsequently discharged from hospital with sotalol 80 mgbd. He was follow up 2 weeks later at outpatient and ICD check showed 1 episode of VT with appropriate shock. Conclusion: ARVD patient who received ICD for secondary prevention and receiving high dose sotalol may required minimum detection enhancement to avoid undetected VT episode. P128 SELECTION OF ICD RECIPIENTS – GENDER DISCRIMINATION SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE OF FOUR YEARS (2007 – 2011) Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: In clinical trials of primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, mainly male patients (pts.)have been selected to be implanted with a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which can be explained only in part by a lower prevalence of coronary disease in women, in younger age groups. Objective: To evaluate the gender distribution of ICD implantation from a single center in Indian population with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Population/Methods: We studied 252 pts with moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction that were implanted ICD in our department (from 2007–2011) in New Delhi. We analyzed the distribution by gender, age and etiology. Results: Out of 252 pts (90.8% were males and 9.2% were females); the mean age of pts was 63 ± 15 yrs however there was no significant difference regarding mean age (56.5 + 9.8 years for males vs. 55.4 + 9.6 years for females). 66.4% had ischemic etiology, 29.5% had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, 3.1% had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1.0% had arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Indication for primary prevention was in 32.5%, while 67.5% of pts. had the ICDs implanted for secondary prevention as a whole group, out of which 91% of females had the ICDs implanted for secondary prevention. The mean ejection fraction (EF) was 26%± 9% as a whole group, while the mean EF for females was 24%± 5%. 15% of patients were in NYHA functional class I, 49% in class II and 36% were in class III as a group, while in the female population, 40% were in class II and 60% were in class III. Conclusion: The rate of implantation of ICDs in females in Indian population is lower than theoretically expected. Also, the female population was older with higher NYHA class. The guidelines must be implemented carefully to avoid gender selection biases. P129 CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN IMPLANTED CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR POPULATION: SINGLE CHAMBER VS DUAL CHAMBER Forleo GB; Vecchio F; Papavasileiou L; Mahfouz K; Topa A; Ticchi C; Schirripa V; Magliano G; Santini L; Romeo F Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Rome "Tor Vergata" Introduction: Implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been demonstrated to offer life‐saving therapies in patients with high risk of sudden cardiac death. The type of ICDs implanted could influence the occuence of inappropriate discharges due to supraventricular tachycardia misclassification. The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients implanted with dual‐chamber (DC) versus single chamber (SC) devices. Methods: We analyzed 285 consecutive patients underwent ICDs implantation at our Institution between September 2003 and November 2010. We subdivided patients into "single chamber device" (n = 164, 147 males, age 64.4 ± 12.2 years) and "dual chamber device" (n = 121, 102 males, age 66.8 ± 11,1 years) groups based on the type of device implanted. Results: After a mean follow‐up of 24.1 ± 18.4 months, no significant differences were found in the incidence of appropriate discharges (40 vs 25 patients, p = ns) and in the occurrence of inappropriate therapy (11 vs 7 patients, p = ns). The type of ICD does not influence the incidence of TVNS (50 vs 28 patients, p = ns). Surprising our analysis shows a significant lower mortality in single chamber device group (13 vs 26 patients, p = 0.004). Further analysis would be necessary to explain such a data which should be confirmed in a wider population study. Conclusions: In our experience type of device does not influence the occurrence of ICD therapies and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. P130 IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS AN D QUALITY OF LIFE Forleo GB; Cioè R; Magliano G; Panattoni G; Papavasileiou LP; Minni V; Topa A; Mahfouz K; Santini L; Romeo F Department of Cardiology, University of Rome "Tor Vergata," Rome, Italy Purpose: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce mortality in patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death. Quality of life (QoL) of these patients is often reduced, however, due to clinical, social problems, behavioral factors and psychological distress. The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of life of patients with ICDs. Materials and Methods: We investigated 65 consecutive patients (56 males, age 65.68 ± 6.6 years) who received ICDs between December 2005 and August 2010 at our institution. All subjects were interviewed after a mean follow up of 14.59 ± 13.93 months, using the Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36). The SF36 includes eight independent scales. For each variable item scores are coded, summed, and transformed on to a scale from 0 (worst possible health state measured by the questionnaire) to 100 (best possible health state). Results: The SF36 shown a score of 51.44 ± 28.98 for physical functioning, a score of 35.98 ± 40.46 for role limitations due to physical problems, a score of 33.33 ± 45.86 for role limitations due to emotional problems, a score of 50.00 ± 22.77 for energy/fatigue, a score of 59.70 ± 21.16 for emotional well being, a score of 67.05 ± 26.13 for social functioning, a score of 70.80 ± 26.55 for pain and a score of 49.24 ± 16.48 for general perception of health. Conclusion: The study show that from a patient's perspective, QoL of subjects with ICDs is compromised, both psychologically and physically. They have difficulty performing the work or other activities, as a result of their clinical and psychological status. Often their psychosocial involvement is caused by fear of shocks and fear of death. The results suggest the importance of dialogue between the physician and the patients, which should be reassured and helped to overcome their limitations. P131 PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN PATIENTS AFTER CARDIAC DEFIBRILLATOR IMPLANTATION Raspopovic S; Kircanski B; Nikcevic G; Jovanovic V; Pavlovic S; Zivkovic M; Milasinovic G Pacemaker Center, Clinical Center of Serbia Introduction: The aim was to establish different prognostic factors of patients after implantation of an ICD, including all cause mortality and occurrence of appropriate ICD therapy and new hospitalization rate. Method: All patients with ischemic and non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy(CMP), low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%) and only ICD implanted during 2006 and 2007 in our center, and at least one follow up (FU) examination were included in the study. Patients baseline characteristics were over‐viewed, including etiology of CMP, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, presence of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes, hyperlipidemia, previous myocardial infarction (MI), QRS duration. Follow up charts were examined, regarding the last FU date, occurrence of arrhythmia, appropriate ICD therapy, death and new hospitalization due to heart failure(HF), arrhythmia episodes or upgrade of the system. Results: A total of 77 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, 88,3% male, average age 62,4 years and 65% with ischemic CMP. Hypertension was found in 66%, AF in 36%, previous MI 58,4. There were 19,5% with diabetes and 42.9% with hyperlipidemia. NYHA class≥II had 91% and QRS≥120 ms was present in 44%. Mean FU was 34 months. Overall mortality rate was 25%(SCD 11%, nonSCD 68%, non cardiac death 21%). Arrhythmia episodes (VT/VF) showed in 52%, ICD therapy experienced 53% of patients, appropriate in 95% of cases. Hospitalization rate after ICD implantation was 21%. There were no significance between subgroups regarding mortality in patients with ischemic/non ischemic CMP (p>0,05, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. There were significance between subgroups regarding mortality in patients with hypertension and wide QRS. Conclusion: Identifying different prognostic factors is very important for outcome in a specific population like ICD patients. P132 PROBLEMS OF ICD THERAPY IN CHILDREN RELATED TO LEAD IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUE Ivanitskiy EA; Kropotkin EB; Tsaregorodtsev AP; Kasimtseva TA The Federal Centre of Cardiovascular Surgery The aim of this study was to analyze the problems of ICD therapy in children according to our own experience. Methods: Four patients were enrolled in the study, age 5 – 13 years. Two ICDs were implanted for primary prevention and two ICDs – for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. One patient had corrected triad of Fallot, one patient had long QT syndrome and sick node syndrome, one patient had Brugada syndrome and one patient had dilated cardiomyopathy before the ICD implantation. Two ICDs were implanted by using transvenous approach with endocardial leads. One ICD was implanted via sternotomy by using two epicardial pacing leads and one epicardial shock patch. One ICD was implanted via left thoracotomy by using epicardial pacing leads. The shock lead in the last patient was positioned subcutaneously in the fifth intercostal space. Results: There were problems related to sensing disorders, ineffective shocks and inappropriate shocks in one patient who had endocardial leads. In this patient all endocardial leads were then removed by using laser extractor. New endocardial leads were successfully implanted via transvenous approach in this case. Conclusion: Epicardial approach for ICD implantation in children seems to be attractive because of less problems with leads and ICD therapy. Sometimes it is very effective to use both epicardial and subcutaneous approach for ICD leads implantation. In elder age in this category of patients we still have a possibility to use transvenous approach when lead and/or device replacement is needed. P133 ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS, COMORBIDITIES AND DEVICE THERAPIES IN OCTOGENARIAN IMPLANTABLE DEFIBRILLATOR RECIPIENTS IN INDIAN POPULATION ‐FOUR YEARS EXPERIENCE (2007–2011) Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is significant cause of mortality. Large, multicenter, randomized trials have shown efficacy of implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) for primary and secondary prevention of SCD. The incidence of SCD increases with age. Many elderly patients (pts.) qualify for ICD, pts aged ≥80 years (octogenarians) are underrepresented in clinical trials of ICD as comorbidities in old age may negate the beneficial effects of ICD.Many pts who meet standard criteria for an ICD are older than those included in clinical trials of ICD, its use in these patients requires further definition. Objective: To assess baseline ECG findings, arrhythmia episodes, and severe nonarrhythmic illness or death in patients aged ≥80 years at ICD implantation, and to compare them with younger pts. Population/Methods: We studied 86 pts, ≥70 years old who underwent ICD implantation with respect to comorbidities, ECG findings and device therapies. Pts were divided in 3 groups based on age: age 70–74 (group 1; 38 pts), age 75–79 (group 2; 26 pts), and age ≥80 (group 3; 22 pts). Results: ECGs: Octogenarians were more likely to have sinus bradycardia (SB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB) compared to younger pts. There was no difference among groups in the proportion of pts with atrial fibrillation or any degree of AV block. Therapies: There was no difference in any appropriate or inappropriate therapy per patient‐year. Nonarrhythmic Death/Morbidity: There was no difference in time to death or serious illness. Conclusion: This was the study to evaluate the therapies received by octogenarians after ICD in Indian population at our centre. The higher incidence of SB and LBBB might influence the number of pacing sites in octogenarian patients. These pts have similar rates of arrhythmic episodes and development of severe comorbidities as septuagenarians, and they should not be denied ICD implantation based solely on age. P134 INTRAOPERATIVE DEFIBRILLATION THRE‐ SHOLD TESTING AND POSTOPERATIVE LONG‐TERM EFFICACY OF IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER‐DEFIBRILLATOR IMPLANTATION Tianyi G; Yu Z; Baopeng T; Jinxin L; Xianhui Z; Guojun X; Yanyi Z; Yaodong L; Jianghua Z Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China Introduction: To determine the defibrillation threshold of implantable cardioverter‐defibrilla‐ tors and outcomes of treatment. Methods: Sixty‐four patients received implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators implantation. During implantation, defibrillation threshold was determined by defibrillation safety margin. All patients were followed‐up for 12–48 months after the implantation. Results: The overall defibrillation threshold was 14.27 ± 2.56 J and defibrillation safety margin was 18.40 ± 1.89 J. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 42 patients after implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators implantation including 500 episodes of non‐sustained ventricular tachycardia and 289 episodes of persistent ventricular tachycardia. Following antitachycardia pacing treatment, 265 episodes were treated successfully by one antitachycardia pacing treatment (91.69%), 12 episodes were treated successfully by two antitachycardia pacing treatment (4.15%). 12 episodes were converted by low energy electrical cardioversion (4.15%). A total of 175 ventricular fibrillation episodes were identified. of which 18 episodes automatically terminated before treatment.146 episodes were converted by one cardioversion with defibrillation energy of 13.21 ± 2.58 J and 11 episodes were converted by two cardioversions with defibrillation energy of 16.19 ± 2.48 J. Conclusions: It is safe and feasible to determine defibrillation threshold by defibrillation safety margin measurement during implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators implantation.

We evaluated permanently paced patients from the two sites at 6 months post implantation. Methods: 30 consecutive patients with baseline normal LV function were evaluated. Detailed echocardiographic (VIVID 7, GE Medical Systems) assessment was done to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular dyssynchrony, during forced ventricular pacing. Dyssynchrony parameters assessed were interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD), septal‐posterior wall mechanical delay (SPWMD) and tissue Doppler parameters including dyssynchrony index and maximum time delay in peak tissue velocities in twelve left ventricular segments (MaxTPV). Results: 20 patients had pacemaker leads in the RVOT position. Mean age of the population was 57 ± 12 years (22 males). The mean time to echocardiographic assessment at follow‐up, from the time of pacemaker insertion was 246 ± 77 days. At follow‐up, there was no significant difference in LVEF between the two groups (61.7 ± 5.8% vs 61.8 ± 8.6%; RVOT vs RVA groups respectively, P‐0.97). The RVOT group showed a trend towards improvement in interventricular synchrony with IVMD of 28.7 ± 16.4 msec as compared to 39.1 ± 10.5 msec in the RVA group (p‐0.08). Similarly, the SPWMD showed a trend towards benefit in the RVOT group (22.9 ± 1.4msec vs 29.6 ± 4.30msec, p‐0.07). Tissue Doppler parameters of LV synchrony were also significantly better in the RVOT group (Dyssynchrony index: 3.9 ± 2.2 vs 6.2 ± 3.4, p‐0.03; Max TPV: 19.65 ± 4.9msec vs 36.5 ± 16.1msec, p‐0.0002; for RVOT vs RVA groups respectively). Conclusion: At an intermediate term follow up, patients with RVA pacing have significant ventricular dyssynchrony as compared to RVOT pacing. The left ventricular systolic function in the relatively short follow up is preserved in both sites of pacing. P136 AN ATRIOVENTRICULAR CONDUCTION TEST AT 90 BPM IDENTIFIES THE PATIENTS WITH A LOW RIGHT VENTRICULAR PACING PERCENTAGE Stazi F; Mampieri M; Verde M; Cardinale M Dipartimento Apparato Cardiocircolatorio, A. O. San Giovanni Addolorata. Roma. °CLI Foundation Introduction: High percentages of right ventricular pacing (RVP) are associated with increased mortality and heart failure. The use of the algorithms of RVP reduction such as AAISafeR® (Sorin Group) and MVP® (Medtronic) allows to obtain very low percentage of RVP in patients with preserved atrioventricular conduction. Picking out the patients that can take advantage of these algorithms it would be therefore very useful. Aim of the study was to assess if an atrioventricular conduction test at 90 beats per minute (bpm) enables to identify the patients who can have a low RVP percentage using the algorithms of RVP reduction. Methods: One hundred thirtythree patients (82 M, 51 F, age 75 ± 11 years, AAISafeR®= 121, MVP®= 12) underwent an atrioventricular (AV) conduction test at 90 bpm during atrial pacing at the time of the pacemaker (PM) (n = 113, 52 for sinus node disease, SND, and 61 for atrioventricular block of any degree, AVB) or defibrillator (ICD) (n = 20) placement, both provided of an algorithm of RVP reduction. Results: One hundred patients (65 M and 35 F, age 75 ± 12) who underwent PM (n = 80, 51 for SND and 29 for AVB) or ICD (n = 20) placement had 1:1 AV conduction (group 1) while thirtythree subjects (17 M and 16 F, age 78 ± 9) all with PM placement (32 for AVB and 1 for SND) had AV conduction defects (group 2). 73 ± 209 days after the procedure the mean RVP percentage was 6 ± 17% in group 1 and 76 ± 35% in group 2 (P < 0,0001). Conclusions: An 1:1 AV conduction during atrial pacing at 90 bpm identifies the subset of patients who will have a low RVP percentage with the RVP reduction algorithms. P137 PERFORMANCE OF ACTIVE VERSUS PASSIVE FIXATION LEADS IN PACEMAKER RECIPIENTS – ACUTE AND CHRONIC PARAMETERS; OUR CENTER EXPERIENCE OF TEN YEARS (2001–2011) Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: Innovation in pacemaker technology has lead to development of steroid eluting fixation leads‐ active(screw‐in) & passive(tined) leads leading to significant reduction in acute & chronic pacing thresholds, lead impedance & decrease in rate of lead dislodgement. For unknown reasons, screw‐in leads are used more often, despite that tined leads have lower chronic thresholds. This may have significance in pacemaker battery longevity and avoiding early replacements. We compared basic parameters of two leads at our center over ten years of follow up. Objective: To examine time course of atrial(A), ventricular(V), or A+V pacing threshold, P & R amplitude and impedance in patients (pts) who underwent single or dual chamber pacemaker implant respectively (rly) between 2001–2011. Population/Methods: We studied 3568 pts. A & V acute & chronic pacing thresholds at 0.4 ms, P & R amplitude & impedance were measured at implantation & 6 months. Results: At implantation, mean acute A & V threshold for tined & screw‐in lead‐ 0.53 ± 0.23V, 0.68 ± 0.4 V; 0.83 ± 0.25V, 0.88 ± 0.33V rly. P & R amplitude 3.8 ± 1.6mV, 11.1 ± 4.2mV; 2.9 ± 1.8mV, 10.7 ± 3.9mV rly & impedance 578 ± 93Ω, 693 ± 98Ω 602 ± 103Ω, 703 ± 98Ω rly. Mean chronic A & V threshold for tined & screw‐in lead‐ 0.33 ± 0.18V, 0.49 ± 0.1V; 0.76 ± 0.2V, 0.79 ± 0.28V rly. P & R amplitude 4.2 ± 1.6mV, 13.8 ± 4.0mV; 3.2 ± 1.5 mV, 11.9 ± 2.9mV rly & impedance 498 ± 76Ω, 608 ± 85Ω 546 ± 96Ω, 612 ± 88Ω rly. Conclusion: We concluded that acute & chronic atrial and ventricular pacing threshold with screw‐in lead was significantly higher than with tined lead. There was significant increase in chronic P and R‐wave amplitude with tined vs screw‐in lead, also decrease in chronic impedance was noticed in tined vs screw‐in lead but not statistically significant. Henceforth, one should give good thought in selection of leads as this may have great impact on pacemaker longevity and on economic aspect of health care. P138 LONG TERM OUTCOME OF VDD AND DDD PATIENTS: A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE Campana A; Manzo M; Brigante MR; Melchiorre G; Matrone A; Avallone B Heart Department A.O.U. San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D'Aragona. Salerno, Italy Background and Objective: VDD/VDDR pacing is used less frequently than recommended by guidelines. Aim of the present study was to demonstrate that VDD pacing is effective and safe, if performed in indicated patients, and to compare long‐term follow‐up results of VDD versus DDD pacemaker patients in terms of: reliability, rate of atrial fibrillation (AF) onset and device replacements during observation period. Methods and Results: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 364 patients who underwent their first implantation of DDD/DDDR or VDD/VDDR pacemaker in our center between January 1995 and December 2000. Main indication for pacemaker implantation was sinus node disease and/or advanced A‐V conduction dysfunction in 177 patients with DDD/DDDR pacemaker (Group D) and advanced atrioventricular block in 187 patients with VDD/VDDR pacemaker (Group V). The median follow‐up was 8 years (25th‐75th percentile: 4–10). Twenty‐six patients (15%) in Group D and 20 (11%) in Group V developed persistent or permanent AF. The incidence of AF was 2.2 per 100 patient‐years in Group D and 1.5 in Group V (p = 0.176). Pacemakers were replaced during follow‐up in 96 patients (54%) in Group D and in 43 patients (23%) in Group V (P < 0.001). In total, 163 patients died during follow‐up: 92 in Group D (52%) and 71 in Group V (39%). The risk of death proved to be significantly higher in Group D than in Group V (V vs D: HR = 1.48, 95%CI 1.08–2.01, p = 0.014). Conclusions: In our cohort, VDD pacing proved just as reliable as DDD pacing, more long‐lasting and no more arrhythmogenic. P139 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SUSTAINED ATRIAL OVERPACING IN SICK SINUS NODE PATIENTS WITH PAROXYMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Menezes A Jr; Rassi S; Moura MC Catholic University Of Goias Background: The atrial Dynamic overpacing for atrial tachyarrhythmias prevention is an attempt to pace the atrium with a higher rate than the coupling episodes of atrial premature beats of the patients, inhibiting their focus and avoiding the occurrence of short‐long cycle. Instead, some authors have been demonstrating that the increase in atrial and ventricular stimulation may determine the development of persistent atrial fibrillation. (GILLS, A. HRS, 2009). Objective: Observe the evolution of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with DDD device and the overpacing algorithm on, initially to persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (characterized as adverse effect of pacing mode). Methods: An observational, prospective, evaluating 35 patients with SSS and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, pacemaker DDD, followed for 48 months. Rating telemetry, 24 hours Holter and transesophageal echo every 6 months. Results: The mean age was 67 ± 8 years, 65% male, 77% patients with Chagas' heart disease. Clinical evaluation showed a significant increase in complaints of palpitations, AF burden and MS (Mode Switch) with a significant increase after 36 months with P value < 0.003. Transesophageal echocardiography with a significant increase of Left Atrim (volume, dimension) (p <0.05). Seven patients were submitted to AV node ablation (for better control of symptoms). Conclusions: Dynamic atrial overpacing when continuously accomplished, instead of prevent atrial tachyarrhythmias might develop a worsening of atrial fibrillation in SSS pacemaker patients. P140 ABNORMAL SINUS NODE RESPONSE TO ADENOSINE PREDICTS THE OCCURRENCE OF SYNCOPE OR PRESYNCOPE IN PATIENTS WITH SICK SINUS SYNDROME Fragakis N; Antoniadis A; Koskinas K; Pagourelias E; Kyriakou P; Skeberis V; Geleris P Cardiology Unit, 2nd Propedeutic Department, Hippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece Background: Intravenous adenosine administration is a noninvasive diagnostic test for sick sinus syndrome (SSS). However, whether its effect on sinus node is associated with the clinical presentation of SSS remains elusive. We hypothesized that the sinus nodal inhibition by adenosine is more pronounced in SSS patients with previous syncope or presyncope as compared to SSS patients without syncopal or presyncopal attacks. Patients and Methods: We studied 44 patients with SSS, 33 with a history of syncope or presyncope and 11 without such history. Controls were 29 subjects undergoing electrophysiological studies for supraventricular tachycardia or unexplained syncope, none of whom had sinus nodal dysfunction. We calculated the corrected sinus node recovery time after 0.15 mg/kg intravenous adenosine (ADSNRT) and after overdrive atrial pacing (CSNRT). CSNRT values >525 msec were considered abnormal. Results: SSS patients with a history of syncope or presyncope had notably prolonged ADSNRT as compared to SSS patients without such history (median: 4900, IQR: 920 – 8560 msec vs. median: 160 IQR 0–563 msec; P < 0.001). Also, SSS patients with a history of syncope or presyncope had significantly longer ADSNRT than CSNRT (median: 4900, IQR: 920–8560 msec vs. median: 680 IQR: 359–1650 msec, P < 0.01). On the other hand, SSS patients without a history of syncope or presyncope showed no difference between ADSNRT and CSNRT values (median: 160 IQR: 0 – 563 msec vs. median 380, IQR: 200–455 msec, p = 0.72). The sensitivity of CSNRT in the diagnosis of SSS was 57% and the specificity 100%. A cut‐off of 1029 msec for ADSNRT yields the same sensitivity with a specificity of 96.4%. Conclusions: Patients with SSS and a history of syncope or presyncope exhibit an exaggerated sinus nodal suppression by adenosine. Prolonged ADSNRT is suggestive of a more severe underlying sinus node dysfunction, and this may be useful in the risk‐stratification and effective management of patients. P141 CARDIAC PACING TRENDS IN SOUTH KOREA FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS: CHANGES FROM SINGLE CHAMBER PACING TO DUAL CHAMBER PACING Jang SW; Rho TH; Choi MS; Shin WS; Kim JH; Oh YS; Lee MY; Cho EJ; Kim DB; Kim JH Devision of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea A nationwide cardiac pacing survey has been undertaken annually in South Korea. We compared the 2010 survey with the 2000 one. Data were collected from the cardiac implantable electronic device manufacturers and distributors. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator was not included in this survey. In 2010, the number of total implants, new implants, and replacements were 2932, 2153, and 779, respectively. Those numbers are 162%, 133%, and 295% increases, respectively, as compared with the 2000 data. A number of new implants per million population was increased from 19 to 43. However, according to the 2009 world survey, it was still lower than other Asian Pacific countries including Japan (272), Taiwan (172), Hong Kong (124), and Singapore (94). As for the pacing mode, VVI(R) was decreased from 38% to 26%, and DDD(R) was increased from 44% to 60%. The major indications for new implants were a sinus node dysfunction (41%) and an advanced atrioventricular block (54%), and female patients constituted 59% of total implants, which were similar to the 2000 survey. Possible reasons for a small number of cardiac pacing implantation in South Korea, as compared with other Asian countries with similar economic background, could be differences in population profiles, physician's attitudes, cultural backgrounds, reimbursement problems, and a low incidence of conduction system disorders. In summary, the cardiac pacing implantation has markedly increased for the last 10 years. The dual chamber pacing has been replacing the single chamber pacing. Why the implants in South Korea are small is still questioning. P142 ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO TINED VERSUS SCREW‐IN LEADS IN PATIENTS RECEIVING DEVICE IMPLANTS – GENDER DIFFERENCES Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: Devices‐Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) & pacemakers (PMs) have reduced morbidity & mortality. However, gender differences may exist in adverse events attenuating benefits. Females unlike males are at high risk for procedural complications like high rates of bleeding, stroke & in‐hospital mortality after invasive procedures.Less is known about differences in complications in device recipients. Choice of lead (tined/screw‐in) may have major role. We addressed the issue in our patients (pts). Objective: To examine gender specific, adverse events related to type of lead in pts with device implants (2001–2011). Population/Methods: We studied 4398 pts & followed them for adverse events for three years after implantation. Results: PMs: 3568; 71.3% males, 28.7% females; mean age 62 ± 15yrs‐no significant gender difference (59.7 yrs males vs 60.1 yrs females). Females significantly got more tined vs screw‐in leads; males got nearly same. ICDs: 830; 91%males, 9%females; mean age 63 ± 14 yrs‐ significant gender difference (54.7 yrs males vs 60.1 yrs females). Females & males got more screw‐in vs tined leads. Females have more heart failure (78% vs 72%), worse NYHA class III (60% vs 51%), differences mainly found in females receiving ICDs. Females have more any adverse event (3.9% vs 3.0%) & major adverse events (1.4% vs 1.0%). The% of adverse events‐higher with screw‐in vs tined leads; females receiving tined leads in PMs or ICDs showed lesser major adverse events. Conclusion: In our center device related adverse events in females were multifactorial: Older age, higher% of comorbidities & risk factors, after adjusting these variables‐ smaller body size & anatomy such as thinner right ventricular wall, smaller blood vessel diameter; thus clear that screw‐in lead caused more adverse events in females vs males. Hence, choice of leads is a strong & independent factor associated with adverse events & one should exercise great efforts in choosing the leads especially in females. P143 ANTICOAGULATION PROTOCOLS FOR PERMANENT PACING IMPLANTATION: LESSONS TO LEARN? Sandhu K; Raju P; Ugni S; McIntosh R; Furniss S; Sulke AN; Lloyd GW; Patel NR Eastbourne District Hospital; East Sussex; England Please may we submit the following work to present as a poster at your conference?Introduction: High risk of complication in patients with anticoagulation is well recognised in patients undergoing permanent pacemaker implantation (PPM). We sought to investigate current practice in London and the South East. We focused on two different types of patient sub groups, those patient with atrial fibrillation and patient with metallic mitral valves. We looked at the number of days prior to device implantation warfarin was stopped, the INR that devices were implantations, what alternative anticoagulants were used prior to implantation after stopping warfarin and how soon after implantation warfarin was restarted. Method: A telephone survey of device implanting hospitals was undertaken in November 2009, detailing current practice with respect to anticoagulant use before and after implantation in two different sub groups. Results: 34 hospitals (London 22, South East 12), 27 NHS Trusts (London 19, South East 8) were sampled. Data was collected from registrars (19) and nurses (15) we have comprehensive images to reflect protocols in different hospitals that are within the same geographic region within the UK. Conclusion: Anticoagulant prescription protocol around PPM implantation varies widely in different NHS hospitals. The most common anticoagulant used before PPM was Enoxaparin in AF group and Unfractionated Heparin Infusion in MVR group. However no alternative anticoagulants were used in significant proportion in AF group before PPM but surprisingly an equal proportion had low molecular weight heparin in MVR group. In significant proportion of hospitals, anticoagulation was restarted after 24 hours in post PPM patients, which could increase the length of stay. It would be valuable to correlate complication rates with anticoagulation practice and produce guidance for a nationally agreed approach to anticoagulation in high risk groups. P144 SELECTIVE SITE PACING. IS IT BETTER TO STIMULATE THE LEFT THAN THE RIGHT VENTRICLE IN PATIENTS WITH CONVENTIONAL PACEMAKERS? Sapelnikov OV; Latypov RS; Grishin IR; Saidova MA; Akchurin RS Cardiology Research Center, Moscow Introduction: There are a lot of contradictory works dedicated to selective site pacing. Furthermore, BELIEVE and recent Bi‐LEFT trials showed no advantages of biventricular pacing in comparison with isolated LV‐pacing in patients with CRT‐indications. Materials: 4 groups of patients were included in this study. The 1st included 25 consecutive ventricular pacing lead implants in the interventricular septum (IVS), the 2nd – 14 patients with RVOT pacing, the 3d – 34 patients with right ventricle apex pacing and the 4th 8 patients with LV‐pacing. Patients in the last group were initially with LBBB. All the measurements were made after the procedure and in 6,12,24 months after the operation.In the period of study we observed the mean percent of ventricular pacing of 82 ± 5%. LV dyssynchrony was measured by means of Doppler investigation and tissue myocardial imaging (TMI). Results: Mean QRS duration in group 1 was 116 ± 11 ms before and 124 ± 14 ms two years after the procedure. In 2 group of patients these figures were 104 ± 10 ms and 120 ± 11 ms, and in 3 group of patients these figures were 106 ± 12 ms and 171 ± 15ms. In 4 group QRS‐duration was significantly wider (159 ± 15 ms before and 165 ± 14 ms after procedure), but the ECG pattern transformed from LBBB to RBBB. Immediately after implantation the values of electromechanical delay between IVS and left ventricle lateral wall (basal segments) were significantly higher during apical pacing (35 ± 5 ms in group 1, 30 ± 5 in group 2, 29 ± 5 group 4 and 54 ± 6 ms in group 3). In two years after implantation the difference between groups still was observed (38 ± 6 ms, 34 ± 5 ms, 27 ± 5 ms vs 68 ± 5 ms). Conclusions: The IVS and RVOT pacing allow an improvement in functional and hemodynamic parameters in acute study and shows stable effect in two years period of follow‐up. Despite of wider QRS‐duration, LV‐pacing demonstrates slightly lower parameters of interventricular dyssynchrony, especially in patients with initial LBBB. P145 POSSIBILITY TO SHORTEN PROGRAMMABLE AV DELAY BY CLOSER POSITIONING THE ATRIAL AND VENTRICULAR LEADS IN THE SEPTAL REGIONS Volkov D; Karpenko Y Institute of General and Urgent Surgery, AMS of Ukraine, Kharkov Objective: Fact of potentially negative effects of right ventricle's (RV) apical pacing on the pumping function is widely recognized in pacemakers (PM) practice. Strategies for overcoming this situation are using of alternative areas of implantation and special pacing algorithms. Nonetheless programming shortest possible AV delay (AVD) is preferring. The purpose of this study was checking the hypothesis that shortest paced and sensed AV‐conduction times recognized by PM are committed to a minimum distance between the electrodes in the right atrium (RA) and RV. Methods: The study included patients with Class I and II indications for DDD(R) pacing with intact 1:1 AV‐conduction during evaluation (n = 55, F‐21, age 65 ± 21). Patients with AV block II‐III degrees were excluded. Electrodes were implanted in four variants: RA appendage (RAA) – RV apex (RVA), n = 18; RAA – RV outflow tract (RVOT), n = 21; RA low septum (LAS) – RVA, n = 7; LAS – RVOT, n = 12. AV‐conduction defined as distance between PM channels' markers during RA sensing and pacing with programmed long AVD and three‐fold sensitivity threshold to RA and RV signals. Results: The electrodes were successfully implanted in all patients. AV conduction during RA sensing, ms: RAA – RVA 192 ± 40; RAA – RVOT 185 ± 32; LAS – RVA 156 ± 38; LAS – RVOT147 ± 35. AV conduction during RA pacing, ms: RAA – RVA 251 ± 37; RAA – RVOT 239 ± 44; LAS – RVA 215 ± 45; LAS – RVOT – 206 ± 39. Implantation of electrodes in the septal RA and RV areas led to a shortening of the AV conduction recognized by PM (LAS and RVOT positions). That was more dependent on the position of RA than RV leads. Conclusion: The position of the electrodes in the heart's chambers can influence the PM detection and thus AVD programming. Minimal distance between the electrodes at their location in the septal areas gave a combination of delayed detection in RA and stimulation the area close to the AV node and early detection in the RV. P146 IMPLANTABLE DEVICES‐RELATED INFECTI‐ ONS‐ANYTIME A POSSIBLE COMPLICATION? LONG TERM FOLLOW‐UP IN A SINGLE LARGE IMPLANTING CENTER Ciudin R; Mihaila M; Capraru C; Petre M; Bostan I; Ginghina C "C. Davila" University of Medecine, "C. C. Iliescu" Inst. of Cardiovascular Diseases Bucharest, Romania Infections involving implantable antiarrhythmic devices are often challenging to treat. Methods: From September 1997 to April 2010 we have implanted 4900 implantable devices and we identify from our records 36 patients (pts) presenting with late (>30 days following the implant) device‐related complications. Initial diagnosis of infection ranges from 30 days to 4.8 years following the primary implant, with a mean of 577 days. There were 18 male and the age group was 65,47 ± 17 years, ranging from 15 to 85 years old. Results: Device‐related late complications were diagnosed on 29 VVI, 3 DDD, 1 AAI pacemakers and 3 ICD (1 pt up‐graded to CRT‐D. In 5 pts there was a lead repositioning and in 3 pts a generator replacement. All the others were a primary implant.In 25 pts there was only a pocket related infection and in 9 pts we diagnosed as having an infective endocarditis (IE) as well. 2 pts had only IE. Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) was a probably cause for infection in 50% of the pts, in 21.3% methylino‐resistant SA was identify, Gram negative bacteria in 21.3% and Staphylococus epidermitis in 7.4%. Our treatment had included antibiotics for a mean of 10 days, device explantation for 16 pts and reimplantation on the other side in 11 pts, subpectoral in 4 pts and same site 1 pt. In 9 pts were extracted the leads as well. 4 pts with IE received a tricuspid prosthesis and the others epicardial leads. There were 2 postsurgery deaths. Late device‐related infections rate in our group was 0.73%. Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillators Devices‐related infections can complicate anytime a pacemaker/ICD implant. Incidence in our study was 0.73%. Treatment of device infections is often difficult to achieve and needs individualised hybrid antibiotics, intervention or surgical approach. P147 SUBCLAVIAN VEIN OBSTRUCTION IN PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT PACEMAKER Murat Y; Serdar B; Erdinç A; Selim E; Erdal G; Sefa S; Nursen P İzmir Atatürk Teaching Hospital Introduction: The number of patients with permanent pacemaker has increased exponentially recently. Complications associated with the implantation procedure are uncommon, but also include venous thrombosis. Device‐associated venous thrombosis generally presents as unilateral arm edema. Treatment includes extremity elevation and anticoagulation. Venous thrombosis at the access site may be silent and may be detected during re‐implantation of a new lead due to lead failure or infection. This study investigated the incidence of silent venous thrombosis in patients who underwent pacemaker re‐implantation for various reasons. We also investigated risk factors for venous thrombosis in this patient population. Method: Fifty‐three patients who underwent pacemaker pulse generator and/or lead reimplantation in our institution were enrolled between 2007–2010. Prior to exchange procedure, patients underwent subclavian venography through the ipsilateral cubital vein. Results: Complete obstruction of the ipsilateral subclavian vein was detected in 5 patients. Of these 5, only 2 patients required implantation of a new pacemaker lead. Ipsilateral venous puncture was thought impossible in these patients. In these patients, pacemaker system was removed and reimplantation was performed through the contralateral subclavian vein. Comparison of basal characteristics of patients with or without subclavian vein obstruction (SVO) revealed nonsignificant difference. There was not significant difference between patients with or without SVO according to age, gender, number of previous replacements, number of leads, systolic function, Concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications were found comparable in both groups. Significantly increased history of pacemaker pocket erosion incidence was found in patient group with SVO (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this preliminary study demonstrates that prior pacemaker pocket erosion creates a predisposition for ipsilateral SVO. P148 THE PREDICTOR FOR ATRIAL PACING DEPENDENCY AND NEED FOR RATE RESPONSE FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH HEART BLOCK Suga C; Hirahara T; Sugawara Y; Nakajima J; Wakaba H; Ako J; Momomura S Department of Cardiology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan Background: Even patients with heart block (HB) sometimes develop to atrial pacing dependency suitable for rate response function. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was any predictor for atrial pacing dependency in HB patients. Methods: This study included 145patients (64males, mean age 71.7 ± 9.1 years) undergoing a dual chamber pacemaker (PM) implantation for sinus node dysfunction (SND) or HB from 2008 to July, 2010. Atrial pacing dependency at 6 months after PM implantation was compared between SND and HB. We compared patient characteristics, atrial rate, blood pressure (BP), echocardiographic measurements before PM implantation, lead location, and lower pacing rate according to atrial pacing dependency ≥20% or <20% in HB patients. Results: Though the number of HB patients with atrial pacing dependency ≥20% (39.8%) was fewer than SND patients (87.1%, P < 0.0001), 10.8% of HB patients had ≥50%, and 3.6% had ≥80% atrial pacing dependency. There were no significant differences between HB patients with atrial pacing dependency ≥20% and <20% in patient characteristics, BP, LV dimension, LVEF, and ventricular lead location. HB patients with atrial pacing dependency ≥20% had greater LAD (46.4 ± 5.5 vs 42.0 ± 6.9[mm], p = 0.0038), faster atrial rate (82.9 ± 13.7 vs 73.9 ± 14.3[bpm], p = 0.0055), more frequent RA appendage lead placement (72.7 vs 46%, p = 0.016), and greater lower pacing rate (60.6 ± 2.4 vs 58.8 ± 3.3[bpm], p = 0.0082). Multivariate analysis showed that LAD (OR: 0.907, 95%CI: 0.827–0.995, p = 0.0391), atrial rate (OR: 1.05, 95%CI: 1.002–1.1, p = 0.0408), and atrial lead location (OR: 0.253, 95% CI: 0.074–0.861, p = 0.0278) were independent predictors for atrial pacing dependency. Conclusions: A considerable number of HB patients developed atrial pacing dependency. HB patients who had enlarged LA and relatively slower atrial rate prior to PM implantation may develop to atrial pacing dependency and may benefit from rate response function. P149 A TECHNIQUE FOR IMPLANTING A RIGHT VENTRICULAR ELECTRODE IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM LEFT SUPERIOR VENA CAVA PERSISTENCE USING A CONVENTIONAL J GUIDE Mora G Universidad Nacional de Colombia Background: Locating pacemaker electrodes can become complicated by congenital abnormalities including alterations of the systemic upper veins, such as left superior vena cava (LSVC) persistence. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out from June 2001 to June 2009 involving all patients who were admitted to the Hospital Universitario Mayor, Instituto de Corazon de Bogota and Hospital Universitario Clinica San Rafael (Bogota‐Colombia) to have a pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator implanted. LSVC was diagnosed by fluoroscopic observation (anterior‐posterior view) of the course of the guide. The following technique was used for gaining access to the right ventricle. The electrode was initially introduced with a straight guide as far as the right atrium, this was then changed for a J guide and the electrode was pushed towards the lateral or anterolateral wall of the RA. The electrode tip was thus lying against the tricuspid valve. Once in this position, the guide was withdrawn 3–5 cm and the tip passed spontaneously into the right ventricle. If it were wished to leave it in the apex, then an anticlockwise rotation would have been needed before withdrawing the guide; on the contrary, if it were wished to place it in the septum or in the outflow tract, then it would have had to be rotation clockwise. Results: A total of 1,048 patients were admitted for pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator implant during the 8‐year study period, 974 received a left subclavian venous approach. There were 508 males and 466 females. LSVC persistence was found in four patients (0.46%) Fluoroscopy time for implanting the ventricular electrode ranged from 1 to 4 minutes, 40 to 92 minutes being taken to complete the whole procedure. Conclusions: We present a simple and rapid technique for electrode placement in patients with LSVC using usual J guide and active fixation electrodes with good success. P150 PACING IN TRICUSPID PROSTHESIS PACIENTS – WHAT ARE THE IMPLANTING OPTIONS? A 9 PATIENTS SERIES EXPERIENCE FOLLOW UP Ciudin R; Bolog M; Capraru C; Mihaila M "C Davila" Univ of Medecine, "C C Iliescu" Instit of Cardiovascular Diseases, Bucharest, Romania Tricuspid prosthesis (TP) patients (pts) having bradyarrhythmias pacing indication represent a difficult option for implanting technique. We present a such 9 pts series in whom we had to choose the implanting technique according with the underlying heart disease. Methods: There were 4 male and 5 women, mean age of 43.4 yars old (range from 24 to 61 years) in whom a TP was implanted for valvulopathy (mitral and TP 3 pts; aortic, mitral and TP 1 pt; TP only in 2 pts) and 3 pts receiving TP following infective endocarditis. Results: 5 pts had metallic TP and 4 pts tricuspid bioprosthesis (TbP). In all pts with TbP we implanted a trans TbP active fixation lead into the right ventricle. 2 Pts with TP have received a coronary sinus (CS) lead for left ventricle pacing and one pt a CS lead following a surgical implanted epicardial lead high threshold. 2 pts had only a surgical epicardial right ventricle lead. During our series follow‐up 1 pt had a high threshold in an active fixation trans TbP right ventricle lead and had to be replaced and 1 pt with CS lead had an intermittent high threshold. Conclusions: Choosing the implanting technique in tricuspid prosthesis pts is not an easy option and it depends of TP type and underlying cardiac diseases. Technical pacing problems could complicate evolution of pts with TP. P151 PATIENT PROFILE AND IMPLANTATION TRENDS IN RECIPIENTS OF PACEMAKERS AND IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBR‐ ILLATORS IN INDIA AT OUR INSTITUTE: 2006–2011 Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: Early clinical success and advances in technology in implantable cardiac rhythm management devices(pacemakers [PM] and implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs])have resulted in expansion of indications with dramatic increase in access and utilization. The indications for pacemaker have also expanded beyond treatment of bradyarrhythmias to cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients (pts) with heart failure and electromechanical dyssynchrony. Objective: We evaluated trends in cardiac rhythm management device implantation. Trends in primary device implantation and burden of device replacement, defined as ratio of replacement procedures to total number of primary and replacement procedures for all pts from 2006–2011 were analysed. Methods: All pts receiving PM and ICD over a period of five years were studied. Results: Total 1900 pts and 604 pts received PMs and ICDs respectively; 1680 received primary PMs and 530 ICDs; there were 220 PMs and 54 ICDs replacement. Women comprised 29% of PM and 9% of ICD pts. The mean ICD replacement burden was 8.9% (range 4–12%)and that of PMs was 11.5%, (range 8.2–15.6%). ICD pts had more comorbidities than PM pts. Conclusions: Firstly, rate of implantation of ICDs in females in our population is lower than expected. Also, females were older with higher NYHA class. Secondly, there has been marked increase in rate of ICD implants.The ICD pts were older, with greater comorbidities, while age of PMs pts has remained stable, with slower rate of increase in comorbidities. Analysis also revealed that replacement burden for PMs has remained constant, while that for ICDs has decreased, which may be ascribed to relative stability of the patient receiving PMs and on the other hand expanding indications for ICD implantation,resulting in increased number of primary ICD implants.These data suggest that monitoring is required, given the changing populations, their disparate clinical outcomes, and implications to the health care system. P152 EPICARDIAL DUAL CHAMBER PACEMAKER (DDD) IMPLANTATION WITHOUT STERNO‐ TOMY IN INFANCY Mitropoulos F; Tsoutsinos A; Kiaffa M; Rammos S Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center Congenital complete heart block (CHB) is a rare conduction anomaly occurring in 1/11.000 to 1/20.000 live births. The most common association is with maternal systemic lupus erythematosus. Usually the surgical strategy for epicardial dual chamber pacemaker implantation include sternotomy or partial lower sternotomy. We report the implantation of epicardial pacemaker in an 18 months old female infant, with CHB, without sternotomy, or cardiopulmonary bypass. Materials and Methods: The infant was born with complete heart block, (minimum heart rate 45 beats per minute) and normal cardiac anatomy. Gradually she developed symptomatic bradycardia (heart rate 25–45) with ventricular dysfunction. Through a 5cm curvilinear skin incision the pericardium was opened and the heart was visualized. The sternum was elevated with a retractor and the diaphragmatic surface or the right ventricle was exposed. An epicardial steroid eluding unipolar ventricular electrode was sewn through diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle with 5–0 prolene. Then the right atrium was retracted in a caudal direction and a unipolar electrode was sawn to the right atrial appendage with 5–0 prolene.Through the same incision a pocket was created in the left upper quadrant below the left rectus abdominis muscle and a St. Jude generator was implanted. The infant tolerated the procedure without any hemodynamic compromise. The infant remained one day in the CTICU and she was discharged on postoperative day 5. At the first pacemaker check after implantation the parameters measurements were good. Conclusion: Non sternotomy, dual chamber epicardial pacemaker implantation can be achieved. Although technically more challenging it is feasible and safe and the aesthetic result is very gratifying. P153 PERMANENT PACING IN PATIENTS WITH PROLONGED ASYSTOLE AT THE HEAD UP TILT TEST Santini L; Capria A; Papavasileiou LP; Scarfò IS; Smurra F; Viele A; Schirripa V; Magliano G; Forleo GB; Romeo F Cardiology Department, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy Introduction: Dual chamber pacemakers with rate drop response pacing algorithm (DDDR‐RDR) may be a therapeutic option for neutrally mediated cardioinhibitory syncope assessed trough a positive Head‐up tilt test (HUTT) in patients older than 40 years with a history of syncope. Aim of our study was to evaluate the outcome of such a therapeutic strategy. Methods: We selected 22 patients who underwent HUTT, aged 42–70 years. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A: 11 pts with cardioinhibitory syncope (asystole >4 seconds or atrio‐ventricular dissociation with heart rate lower than 30 bpm) addressed to PMK implantation; Group B: 11 pts with a milder cardioinhibitory response, in this group conservative treatment was preferred. A clinical follow‐up was performed after three years. Results: 9 pts in the group A accepted PMK implantation, 2 pts preferred conservative treatment. In patients with PMK cumulative atrial pacing was found to be greater than ventricular pacing (AP 40.28 vs 3.5% VP, P < 0.05). In addition, 254 episodes of rate drop response were adequately recognized and treated. Follow‐up was concluded in 67% of PMK pts. None of them presented new episodes of syncope. Regarding patients left with conservative treatment, follow‐up was concluded in 11 pts: syncope occurred in 3 pts; 2 patients were lost in the follow‐up. Conclusions: The higher percentage of cumulative atrial pacing shows in the more severe patients group a basal vagal hypertonic pattern which modulates sinus node function but not affecting the basal AV conduction. DDDR‐RDR pacing is a valid and effective option in selected patients with history of neurally mediated syncope and a severe tilt test‐induced cardioinhibitory syncope. Patients with a milder cardioinhibitory response at the HUTT seem to have a good response to conservative treatment. P154 AN UNUSUAL CAUSE OF CHRONIC INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS FOLLOWING A PACEMEKER IMPLANT‐AN ACHILE'S TENDON PROSTHESIS ABSCESS Ciudin R; Avram AM; Arama V "C Davila" Univ of Medecine, "C C Iliescu" Instit of Cardiovascular Diseases, Bucharest, Romania Device‐Related infection are often challenging as primary cause and there treatment is not always easy. We present a 67 years old male patient with 18 months history of fever and antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis following his DDD pacemaker implant. He had undergone 4 previous pocket interventions with no obvious results. During his admission in our center the patient was stil having positive blood cultures with Gram negative germs including Pyocianic, recurrent septicemia, dermatitis and urinary infection. Pacemaker was removed and the 2 leads were extracted mechanically. We implanted a new system on the other side after antibiotic therapy but after a relatively afebrile period of 45 days he came back with recurrent fever. During his second admission we identified a local Achille's tendon abscess where the pt had a plastic orthopedic prosthesis many years before the implant. The abscess was opened, clean and debridment of inflammatory tissue was done. He had a very good recovery following his new antibiotic treatment. Conclusion: Unusual metastatic infection sites or abscesses could be the cause of recurrent infection or endocarditis resistant to antibiotic therapy in pts with device‐ related infections complications. P155 ROLE OF AF PREVENTIVE PACING ALGORITHMS IN LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF LOW AF BURDEN AS PART OF HYBRID THERAPY IN SICK SINUS SYNDROME Simeonidou E; Papandreou A; Spyroulias G; Varounis C; Dagres N; Anastasiou‐Nana M; Manolis AS 2nd University Cardiology Dept, Attikon Hospital, Athens, Greece Among the non‐pharmacologic therapeutic modalities for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial pacing for AF prevention presented an attractive strategy. Because of limited data regarding its long‐term impact, it still remains as controversial pacing indication. Aim of the study was to determine the long‐term efficacy of preventive pacing algorithms (AFPPA)on AF burden (AFB) in patients (pts) with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and drug refractory paroxysmal AF. Methods: Study population: 51 pts (10 w, 41 m), mean age 61 ± 9 yrs with SSS, who apart from conventional indications of pacing suffered frequent episodes of AF, refractory to at least 2 antiarrhythmics (AAMs) and they received a PPM with incorporated AFPPA plus AAMs, group A. Another 51 pts (41m) with SSS and frequent AF, who received a conventional DDDR plus AAMs served as controls, group B. Mean LA:43 ± 8 mm. Atrial pacing LR was programmed at 70 bpm. There was an effort to promote native AV conduction by relevant pacing settings. Different AFPPAs were activated in each pt according to the AF onset mechanism. All pts underwent fu in regular basis and interrogation of the stored diagnostic AF data every 6 mos. AFB overtime was compared annually in the same group and between the 2 groups. Two‐way ANOVA for repeated measurements was used to assess the effects of AFPPA on AFB in the 2 groups. Logarithms were used for non‐normally distributed AFB. Results:Average time of fu: 50 ± 8 mos. Five pts in A 10%) and 10 pts (22%) in B group were progressed to permanent AF. Median AFB in A and B groups at baseline, 1 yr and 4 yrs were 3.0, 1.0, 1.2 h/day and 3.8, 3.2, 6.8 h/day respectively and differed between both groups over time (F = 15.88, P < 0.001. AFB improved significantly in the 1st yr only in group A and after 4 yrs deteriorated significantly only in group B. Conclusions: Although AFPPAs efficacy is slightly reduced over time they are useful in AF management of selected SSS pts, as part of hybrid therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES P156 TRANSESOPHAGEAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY AND PACING – STILL THE OPTION FOR EMERGING COUNTRIES? Volkov D Institute of General and Urgent Surgery of Ams of Ukraine Background: Endocardial EP study and catheter ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias are the golden standards of medical care nowadays. Transesophageal electrophysiological study (TEEPS) and pacing (TEP) couldn't be an alternative, but useful supplement, especially in centers where EP service is absent or not fully available. Atrial flutter (AFl) is second common arrhythmia after atrial fibrillation (AFib), catheter ablation is the first line therapy for typical AFl, but there're a lot of local restrictions in Ukraine to apply this method widely. TEP can be used to interrupt AFl. Methods: We've been using CardioLab+ system (XAI Medica, Ukraine) for TEEPS and TEP by programmed and rapid pacing successfully in 293 tachycardia patients (pts) over last 5 years. Among them TEP for AFl were done in 95 pts (typical AFl – 76 pts). Diagnosis were established based on regular and transesophageal ECGs, AV conduction gaps, RP intervals during tachycardia and patterns of initiations and cessations by pacing and drugs. Results: AFls were converted to sinus rhythm in 86% of pts. 1) cardioversion to sinus rhythm during procedure – 61 pts; 2) induction of AFib with restoration of sinus rhythm up to 2 days – 21 pts; 3) induction and persistence of AFib – 6 pts; 4) recovery of AFl – 7 pts. Most unsuccessful results occurred in atypical AFl's pts. In remaining 198 pts different types of existed tachycardia were evaluated depending on listed above criteria of differentiation: AVRT – 91, AVNRT – 96, ectopic atrial tachycardia – 3, AFl and Afib – 8. No complications were observed. Near a half of pts had catheter ablations afterward. Conclusion: TEEPS is very cheap and useful tool for initiation and investigation of supraventricular arrhythmias in pts with non‐documented palpitations to establish indication for catheter ablation and to control its efficacy if needed. TEP is safe and effective instrument of sinus rhythm restoration in pts with AFls. P157 INTERACTION OF PORTABLE METAL DETECTOR USED IN AIRPORT CONTROLS WITH IMPLANTABLE PACEMAKERS AND CARDIO‐ VERTER DEFIBRILLATORS Tzeis S; Andrikopoulos G; Jilek C; Rassias I; Kolb C; Theodorakis G Cardiology Department, Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, Greece Aim: Proper function of pacemakers (PMs) or implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) may be impaired due to interaction with electrical devices. Portable metal detectors generate an electromagnetic field that may interfere with PMs or ICDs. In the present study we sought to investigate whether a commercially available portable metal detector routinely used in airport controls interacts with PMs and ICDs. Methods: A total of 75 patients (28 ICD and 47 PM recipients) were tested with and without telemetry communication for electromagnetic interference when exposed to the electromagnetic field generated by a portable metal detector (PD140V – magnetic field Br.m.s. 2.71 μT, electric field Er.m.s. 2.2 V/m) placed over the implanted system under continuous ECG recording. Results: No interference with proper device function (sensing and pacing) was observed in any of the 75 patients tested. Telemetry interference was observed in 83% of patients with 12% of patients presenting a "pseudo‐oversensing" type of telemetry interference (noise recording on online print‐outs without impairment of proper pacing function documented with continuous ECG recording), 59% presenting loss of detection and 12% presenting both types of telemetry interference. Conclusion: Routinely used hand‐held metal detectors may frequently cause telemetry interference with ICDs and PMs without though interfering with proper device function. These findings support the safety of using portable metal detectors for control of PM and ICD recipients. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH P158 MULTIRESOLUTION WAVELET ANALYSIS OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY RISK STRATIFIES HEART FAILURE PATIENTS FOR BOTH SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH AND TOTAL MORTALITY Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Manis G; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Kartsagoulis E; Aggelis A; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: To evaluate the performance of non‐invasive predictors in arrhythmia risk stratification of heart failure patients (pts). Methods: We prospectively screened 230 patients (age: 64.5 ± 13.4 years, male: 83%, NYHA class: 2.3 ± 0.5, LVEF:32.6 ± 10.1, CAD: 82%,DCMP: 18%) with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24‐hour HOLTER. After 17 ± 16.1 months of follow up, pts were classified into the High risk (52 pts, mean Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): 29 ± 10.2%) and the Low risk (174 pts, mean LVEF:33.7 ± 9.9%, p = 0.003) groups according to three SCD surrogates: 1. clinical VT/VF (17 pts) 2.ICD's appropriate activation (22 pts) 3.confirmed SCD (13 pts).Total mortality (TM) was also considered as an end point and 37 deaths were recorded (arrhythmic = 13, pump failure = 17, non cardiac = 7). LVEF, filtered QRS (SAECG), NSVT > 1/24 hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, Decelaration Capacity (DC) of heart rate, mean Heart Rate (HR), SDNN/HRV, QTc and the scale dependent wavelet‐ coefficient standard deviation [σwav (m)] of multiresolution wavelet analysis (MWA – Haar 8) of HRV were calculated and statistically analyzed for the two groups. Results:σwav (m) was a statistically significant predictor of SCD (Long rank test p = 0.0006). After Cox regression analysis adjusted for LVEF, gender, fQRS, NSVT episodes >1/24hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, DC, HR, and SDNN, the σwav (m) remained an important and independent SCD predictor with HR:0.991 (P < 0.001) 95% CI: 0.986–0.995. Considering TM as end point σwav (m) was again a statistically significant predictor of TM (Long rank test = 0.0001) and after a new analysis of the same multivariable Cox model for TM, σwav(m) remained an important and independent TM predictor with HR: 0.990 (p = 0.003) 95% CI:0.983–0.996. Conclusions: In this heart failure pts cohort with a short term follow up, σwav (m) was an important and independent predictor both for SCD and TM. P159 PROGRAMMED VENTRICULAR STIMULATI‐ ON AS COMPARED TO THE NON INVASIVE RISK STRATIFIERS FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH PREDICTION AMONG SEVERE HEART FAILURE PATIENTS Gatzoulis K; Arsenos P; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Kartsagoulis E; Sideris S; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Aggelis A; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: To examine the prediction ability of VT/VF inducibility on Programmed Ventricular Stimulation (PVS) for Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) among Heart failure (HF) patients (pts). Methods: We screened 114 HF pts (age: 67 ± 11 years, male: 83%, LVEF: 29 ± 9.5, NYHA: 2.4 ± 0.5, CAD: 72%, DCMP: 28%) under optimum treatment with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24 hour HOLTER. All pts underwent also a PVS. After 14.1 ± 12.6 months of follow up the sample divided to the HIGH risk (24 pts) and the LOW risk (90 pts) groups according to three SCD events/surrogates: 1. clinical VT/VF 2. ICD's appropriate activation 3. confirmed SCD. Data calculated and statistically analyzed for the two groups.

Conclusions: In this small and preliminary HF sample the non invasive risk factors from electrocardiography and echocardiography failed to predict SCD on medium term follow up. On the contrary the induction of VT/VF on PVS was the only significant SCD predictor with sensitivity 75% and specificity 48%. P160 NORMOBARIC INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA TRAINING AS A METHOD OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH PRIMARY PREVENTION IN THE PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC CARDIO‐ MYOPATHY Dubovik TA; Rachok LV; Shket AP; Khudnitskaya VS Republican Scientific and Practical Center of Cardiology The purpose of this research was to study the efficiency of using a course of normobaric intermittent hypoxia training (NIHT) before coronary bypass surgery (CABG) in the patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and chronic heart failure (CHF) and its influence on the character of reperfusion complications and life‐ threatening arrhythmias development. Materials and Methods: Cohort of 60 patients with ICMP (n = 30 in the main and control groups) were included into the research. All patients had depressed left ventricle systolic function (LVEF) less than 35%. The main group patients underwent a NIHT before CABG. The indications for CABG were the presence of myocardium more than 50% with accumulation radiopharmaceutical over 50% during SPECT with 99 mTc‐MIBI. Functional state of LV was assessed by means of echocardiography and daily monitoring of the electrocardiogram. Results: The initial CHF severity of the patients in both groups was determined by depressed LVEF against the prevalence of sympathetic activity nervous system (NS). After a course of NIHT a shift in autonomic balance towards the prevalence of parasympathetic NS was marked (RMSSD increased from 28,6 ± 4,5 ms to 58,22 ± 6,1, p <0,05) as well as a reduction in the number of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) against the microcirculatory processes improvement. The main group were characterized with a more favorable recovery during the perioperative period after CABG. We revealed less frequent of ventricular fibrillation during cardiac resuscitation after artificial circulation, reduction of VA and high grade VA in the perioperative period in the main group. Conclusion: For the patients with ICMP and CHF with adequate mass of a viable myocardium, CABG is effective in SCD primary prevention. The use of NIHT in the preoperative period can increase the volume of the viable myocardium and thus helps to protect from reperfusion injury during CABG and provides a more favorable recovery during the perioperative period. P161 RISK STRATIFICATION OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN PATIENTS WITH DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY Vaikhanskaya TG; Melnikova OP; Gul LM; Frolov AV Republican Scientific and Practical Center of Cardiology, Minsk, Belarus Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is associated with risk of sudden death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Objective: assessment of Holter monitoring predictors of life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias (LTVA}: microvolt T‐wave alternans (mTWA) and heart rhythm turbulence(HRT) in patients (pts.) with nonischemic DCM. Materials and Methods: 67 pts. with DCM were examined (10,4% females, aged 44,3 ± 11,7 years) by Holter 24‐h (Oxford) and 7‐minute ECG recording (Intecard‐7, including 3 min of exercise test (25 Wt/m). Microvolt TWA detected by the software Intecard‐7 on a method modified moving average in 3 lead of ECG‐12 at exercise test. Results: Heart rhythm ventricular dysfunctions were revealed at 29 (43,3%) pts. with DCM: nonsustained ventricular tachycardia(VT)‐28 pts., sustained VT(1 pts.). On the basis of the received data the step‐by‐step discriminant analysis by which results following independent indicators have been included in mathematical model has been carried out: mTWA ≥ 56 mcV, pathological HRTS < 2,5 ms/RR, presence syncope and extQTc. For definition of risk LTVA for patient with DCM already at the first inspection it is possible to use classification equations. Definition of high risk LTVA for the individual patient is spent by substitution of the received indicators to each of two equations. The patient gets to that group for which classification function has the greatest value. Thus, the classification equations for risk revealing of LTVA in patients DCM look like: HI = 0,9 × mTWA+7,9 × HRTS + 7,3 × Syncope + 6,3 × QTc–31. Hit of the patient in 1 group testifies to high risk LTVA and more adverse forecast. Such category of patients is potential candidates for ICD/CRT‐D. Hit of the patient in 2 group testifies to more favorable forecast and low risk LTVA: LII = 0,6 × mTWA + 3,6 × HRTS + 9,2 × Syncope + 5,6 × QTc–42. In conclusion, sudden death risk stratification is of utmost importance for DCM as it is the main cause of death related to this disease. P162 REDUCED RMSSD FROM HEART RATE VARIABILITY ANALYSIS RISK STRATIFIES HEART FAILURE PATIENTS FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Manis G; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Kartsagoulis E; Sideris S; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: To estimate the performance of non invasive arrhythmia predictors in the risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD) of heart failure (HF) patients (pts). Methods: We prospectively screened 230 pts (age: 64.5 ± 13.4 years, male: 83%, LVEF: 32.6 ± 10.1, NYHA class: 2.3 ± 0.5, CAD: 82%, DCMP: 18%) with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24 hours HOLTER. After 17 ± 16 months of follow up, pts were classified into the High risk [52pts, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 29 ± 10.2%] and the Low risk group (174 pts, mean LVEF: 33.7 ± 9.9%, p = 0.003) according to three SCD events/surrogates: 1. clinical VT/VF (17 pts) 2. ICD's appropriate activation (22 pts) 3. confirmed SCD (13 pts). LVEF, the filtered QRS (SAECG), NSVT episodes > 1 /24hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, mean heart rate (HR), RMSSD and SDNN from heart rate variability (HRV) [24 hour HOLTER], were calculated and statistically analyzed for the two groups. Results: RMSSD was a statistically significant predictor of SCD (Long rank test p = 0.01). Furthermore after Cox regression analysis adjusted for LVEF, fQRS, NSVT>1/24 hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, mean HR and SDNN, the RMSSD remained an important and independent SCD predictor with HR 0.974 (p = 0.01) 95% CI: 0.955–0.993. A cut off point of RMSSD < 46 (75th percentile) presented HR 2.491 for predicting SCD (p = 0.05) 95% CI: 0.969–6.405. Conclusions: In the present HF pts cohort with a short term follow up, RMSSD performed better (logrank p = 0.01) than the most commonly used SDNN (longrank p = 0.05) and it was an important and independent predictor of SCD. Further evaluation of the reduced RMSSD is guaranteed. P163 PREVALENCE OF RISK FACTORS OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN TRYPANOSOME CRUZI SEROPOSITIVE PATIENTS Mora G Universidad Nacional de Colombia Chagasic patients with heart disease are at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and sometimes it may be the first manifestation of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of some risk factors for MCS among carriers of antibodies to T. Cruzi with and without heart disease. Methods: 8 patients without heart disease taking (normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) were compared with 26 patients with heart disease. Echocardiogram was evaluated, number of premature ventricular contractions, heart rate variability determined by the SDNN, presence of ventricular extrasystoles and polymorphic duplet. Results: No significant differences were found in the different variables evaluated except for the number of extrasystoles in 24 hours (66 vs 369 p = 0.0084), being more common in patients with heart disease. Conclusions: factors commonly described as predictors of SCD are very common in patients with antibodies to T. Cruzi with or without heart disease. The only variable with a significant difference was the number of extrasystoles in 24 hours. P164 RISK STRATIFICATION USING MICROVOLT T‐WAVE ALTERNANS IS NOT FEASIBLE IN A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF POTENTIAL ICD RECIPIENTS Kraaier K; Wilde AAM; Scholten MF Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands Purpose: Previous studies have demonstrated that microvolt T‐wave alternans (MTWA) screening in patients with ischemic and non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy is effective in identifying patients at high or low risk for sudden cardiac death. In this study we evaluated the feasibility of MTWA testing using an exercise protocol in the risk stratification of potential ICD recipients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods: Medical charts of 180 primary prevention ICD recipients were reviewed to decide if patients were able to perform a MTWA exercise test or not. Contra‐indications for testing were: atrial fibrillation or flutter, pacemaker‐dependency, recent (cardiovascular) surgery (<1 month) and inability to exercise. Results: Fifty‐eight (35%) of the potential ICD recipients were not suitable for testing. Among which; 35 patients were excluded due to atrial fibrillation, 13 patients due to recent surgery, 6 patients due to co‐morbidity (NYHA class IV, paralysis or absence of lower extremities, balance problems, AVblock), and 3 patients due to pacemaker dependency. Conclusion: In several studies MTWA testing is a promising risk stratifier for predicting sudden cardiac death, however, 35% of the potential ICD candidates is not suitable for MTWA testing using an exercise protocol. Therefore alternative methods to estimate MTWA and their clinical value must be studied. P165 HOLTER DERIVED QTC INTERVAL RISK STRATIFIES HEART FAILURE PATIENTS FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Manis G; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Kartsagoulis E; Sideris S; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: To estimate the performance of current non invasive arrhythmia risk stratifiers in the prediction of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in heart failure (HF) patients (pts). Methods: We prospectively screened 230 pts (age: 64.5 ± 13.4 years, male: 83%, LVEF: 32.6 ± 10.1, NYHA class: 2.3 ± 0.5, CAD: 82%,DCMP: 18%) with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24‐hour HOLTER. After 17 ± 16 months of follow up, pts were classified into the High risk [52pts, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 29 ± 10.2%) and the Low risk (174 pts, mean LVEF:33.7 ± 9.9%, p = 0.003) groups according to three SCD events/surrogates: 1. clinical VT/VF (17 pts) 2. ICD's appropriate activation (22 pts) 3. Confirmed SCD (13 pts). LVEF, the filtered QRS (SAECG), the presence of NSVTepisodes> 1/24 hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, mean Heart Rate (HR), SDNN from HRV and mean 24 hour QTc interval (24 hour HOLTER), were calculated and statistically analyzed for the two groups. Results: The Holter‐QTc was a statistically significant predictor of SCD (Long rank test p = 0.01). After Cox regression analysis adjusted for gender, LVEF, fQRS, NSVTepisodes > 1/24 hour, VPBs > 240/24 hour, mean Heart Rate and SDNN, Holter‐QTc remained an important and independent SCD predictor with HR 1.009 (p = 0.02) 95% CI: 1.001–1.017. A cut off point of QTc> 470ms (75th percentile) presented HR 1.825 for predicting SCD (p = 0.05) 95% CI: 0.993–3.335. Conclusions: In the present HF pts cohort with a short term follow up, Holter‐QTc was an important and independent predictor of SCD. Further evaluation of the Holter‐QTc in the prediction of SCD is guaranteed. P166 ARRHYTHMIAS IN NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES: A Moroccan EXPERIENCE AND A LITERATURE REVIEW Bouhouch R*; Fellat I*; Zarzur J*; Oukerraj L*; Bennani R*; Birouk N**; Oudghiri FZ***; Cherti M* *Service de Cardiologie B, CHU Ibn Sina Rabat, MAROC Introduction: Neuromuscular Diseases are a heterogeneous molecular, clinical and prognosis group. Progress has been achieved in the understanding and classification of these diseases. Cardiac involvement in neuromuscular diseases, namely conduction disorders, ventricular arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy with its impact on prognosis, is often dissociated from the peripheral myopathy. Therefore, close surveillance is mandatory in the affected patients. In this context, preventive therapy (beta‐blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) has been recently recommended in the most common Neuromuscular Diseases, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy. Methods: We report a series of patients with neuromuscular diseases in whom we assessed cardiac involvement and initiated a therapy. From January 2007 to June 2011, 105 patients were referred to cardiology visit by a neurologist or pediatrician. Results: There were 49 female and 56 male with a mean age of 28 years old. Limb‐Girdle muscular dystrophies, Myotonic Dystrophy (MD), and Duchenne / Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD, BMD) are the major neuromuscular diseases in our series. Cardiac symptoms were found in 54 patients, ECG was often abnormal (96 patients): 41 patients had a conduction disorder, 42 patients had atrial or ventricular premature beats; Transthoracic Echocardiography found a left ventricular dysfunction in 10 patients. Therapy with beta‐blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was initiated in 37 patients and 5 patients required a Pace‐Maker or an Implantable Cardiovertor Defibrillator. Conclusion: A close collaboration between Cardiologists and referral physicians is mandatory for a better management of Cardiac involvement especially arrhythmias in patients with neuromuscular diseases. P167 MEAN HEART RATE FROM 24 HOUR HOLTER RECORDINGS PREDICTS TOTAL MORTALITY IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Kartsagoulis E; Sideris S; Aggelis A; Stefanadis C; Apret First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: To estimate Electrophysiological indices derived from non invasive Electrocardiographic and Echocardiographic screening as Total Mortality (TM) predictors for Heart Failure (HF) patients (pts). Methods: We screened 279 HF pts (age: 67 ± 13.0, male: 83%, NYHA: 2.4 ± 0.5, LVEF: 31.4 ± 10.1, CAD: 80%, DCMP: 20%) under optimum treatment and with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24 hour HOLTER (HM). After 14.8 ± 13.3 months of follow up 48 deaths occurred (Sudden Cardiac Deaths: 16, Pump Failure Deaths: 26, Non Cardiac Deaths: 6). Differences of non invasive markers between survivors and non‐survivors analyzed with Log rank test. The correlation of the non invasive markers with mortality was searched through survival analysis method utilizing Kaplan Meier – survival curves adjusted for possible confounders under building of appropriate Cox statistical models. Results: After Cox regression model analysis adjusted for gender, age, LVEF, VPBs/24 hour, NSVT episodes/24 hour, mean Heart Rate and QTc interval the only important and independent predictor of TM was mean Heart Rate(24 hour) presented HR: 1.044 (p = 0.007, 95% CI: 1.011–1.077). Conclusions: Mean Heart Rate predicted TM in HF patients importantly and independently of gender, age, LVEF, VPBs, NSVT and QTc. A cut off point of Heart Rate > 70.5 bpm (50th percentile) presented sensitivity 58% and specificity 51% for predicting TM. SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS P168 CASE OF A LATVIAN FAMILY'S ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY TACHYCARDIA Kupics K; Jubele K; Kalinins A; Sipacovs P Paul Stradin's Clinical University Hospital We would like to describe a case of potentially hereditary AVNRT within one family. Only a very limited number of reports are available in the literature describing inherited cases of AVNRT. In Latvia such cases have not been reported yet. In this family a mother and her two sons suffered from arrhythmia episodes. All of these diagnoses of typical AVNRT were established using intracardiac electrophysiological study. The mother's father also had had an unspecified kind of arrhythmia. In both the son's father and his family members had never occurred any episodes of arrhythmia. The mother and both her sons had had no other comorbidities diagnosed. Only the mother had been on medication – metoprolol 50mg bid, but that therapy had not reduced the number of arrhythmia episodes. The first patient to be treated at out clinic was the younger son, aged 18 (patient no 1). In his case arrhythmias had been occurring for 2 – 3 years at that time. After the younger son's successful treatment, the mother also approached us. She was 51 years old (patient no 2) and has had arrhythmias for over 20 years. The symptoms had worsened after childbirths. The last patient from this family to be treated was the older son, aged 22 (patient no 3). He has had arrhythmias for approximately 2 months. The mother and both son's were treated using radiofrequency catheter ablation of the "slow pathway" of the atrioventricular junction. After one year of regular observation no arrhythmias have reoccurred. This case hints at the possibility that in some cases the reason for changes in the atrioventricular junction that are responsible for AVNRT could be inherited, possibly in the form of an autosomal dominant type. P169 3D NONINVASIVE MAPPING AND RESULTS OF CATHETER ABLATION OF TACHYARRHY‐ THMIAS Revishvili A; Sopov O; Dzhordzhikiya T; Simonyan G; Lyadzhina O; Fetisova E; Kalinin V Bakoulev Scientific Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, Moscow, Russia Introduction: We evaluated facilities of the novel 3D surface ECG based mapping technology in patients with different atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: Before procedure noninvasive mapping using 240‐lead ECG combined with CT scan based anatomy (Amycard, RUS) was performed in 102 patients. Among them 48 patients (mean age 36,3 ± 14,6 years) were with ectopic non‐ischemic ventricular arrhythmias (VT/PVC), 35 patients (mean age 32,8 ± 10,3 years) with WPW syndrome, 19 patients (mean age 39,4 ± 16,6 years) with ectopic atrial tachycardias. The findings were compared with invasive 3D mapping and successful radiofrequency ablation. Results: In 48 patients with ventricular arrhythmias (95,9%) a location of ectopic focus was similar to the invasive data and arrhythmia was successfully eliminated by single radiofrequency (RF) application. Two focal VT (4,1%) located in interventricular septum could not be accurately identified by noninvasive mapping. Clinical target coincided in 54 (100%) patients with WPW syndrome and atrial tachycardis and successfully terminated by RF ablation. Mean distance between noninvasive target and effective point of ablation was 3,8 ± 2,5 mm. Time of fluoroscopy in group of patients that underwent noninvasive mapping was significantly lower 4,1 ± 2,5 min in comparison with average 10,3 ± 4,9 min (P < 0,05). Conclusion: Initial experience with a novel noninvasive 3D mapping system shows its clinical utility in various arrhythmias, feasibility of accurately locating the target and significant reduction of fluoroscopy and procedure time. P170 DIFFERENCES IN ANATOMICAL LOCATION AND CONDUCTION PROPERTIES OF ACCESSORY PATHWAYS IN SYMPTOMATIC WPW PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT CLINICAL DOCUMENTED TACHYCARDIAS Pastor A; Leguizamón J; Zorita B; Panizo J; Jiménez S Hospital Universitario de Getafe (Madrid), Spain Radiofrequency ablation is the preferred treatment for symptomatic WPW syndrome. Clinicians have to face symptomatic WPW patients (P) but with non‐documented ECG clinical tachycardia (CTa), in whom some therapeutic doubts arise, especially in case of presumed high risk ECG appearance (midseptal/perihisian location). Purpose: Analyse the anatomical location and conduction capabilities of accessory pathways (AccP) in P with symptomatic WPW with and without documented ECG CTa before ablation. Methods: 100 consecutive symptomatic WPW P considered for ablation. Group A consisted of 56 P with documented ECG CTa and Group B, 44 P with symptoms of palpitations, dizziness or syncope, but without documented ECG CTa. Results: Left‐sided AccP was more frequent in group A compared to group B (60% vs 34%, P < 0.01). Septal location, was found more frequently in group B compared to group A (50% vs (28%, P < 0.05), being located close to AV conduction system (midseptal o perihisian) in 6 (14%) and 6 (11%) respectively. Only anterograde conductive AccP was found more frequently in group B than in group A (36% vs 5%, P < 0.02). Orthodromic tachycardia inducibility rate was similar in group A and in group B P with bidirectional conduction of AccP(92% vs 86%). Conclusion: 1. An important subset of symptomatic WPW P (44%) considered for ablation have not documented ECG CTa before the procedure, being septal location in half of these P. 2. Exclusive anterogradely conductive AccP were found more frequent in non‐documented ECG CTa group compared to documented ECG CTa group. 3. In non‐documented ECG CTa, bidirectional conductive AccP were present in 64% and had similar rate of inducible orthodromic tachycardia compared to documented ECG CTa group, maintaining indication for ablation in the majority of these P, although careful consideration if "high risk" WPW ECG profile (septal location near AV system) or anatomical difficulties are anticipated. P171 RESULTS OF ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC TESTING IN CHILDREN WITH ASYMPTOMATIC WPW SYNDROME Ivanitskiy EA; Kropotkin EB; Tsaregorodtsev AP; Kasimtseva TA The Federal Centre of Cardiovascular Surgery The aim of this study was to find out the strategy of management of children with asymptomatic WPW syndrome. Methods: 20 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study, age 3 – 15 years. There were all typical features of preexitation on the surface ECG, and no registered paroxysms of tachycardia on surface ECG or symptoms of palpitation in past. 18 patients underwent catheter ablation of accessory pathway (AP) after previous electrophysiological study. All procedures were performed under the general anesthesia. Results: Anterograde conduction via accessory pathway more than 220 beats per minute (bpm) and effective refractory period (ERP) less than 250 ms were revealed in 15 patients. Anterograde conduction via AP less than 180 bpm and ERP more than 300 ms were seen in three patients. But retrograde conduction via AP in these three patients was more than 220 bpm, ERP was less than 250 ms. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia was induced in 14 patients. Atrial flutter was induced in one patient with 1:1 conduction via AP. All these patients underwent catheter ablation of AP. No major complications were seen after catheter ablations. Conclusion: Indications for AP ablation were revealed in 90% of patients after previous electrophysiological study. Electophysiological study is a crucial moment for taking a decision to perform ablation of AP in children with asymptomatic WPW syndrome. P172 CARDIOMYOPATHY INDUCED BY PAROXYSMAL TACHYCARDIA – AN UNDERDIAGNOSED CLINICAL ENTITY Bogossian H; Ninios I; Karosiene Z; Pechlivanidou E; Mijic D; Kloppe A; Zarse M; Lemke B Klinikum Luedenscheid, Germany Introduction: Cardiomyopathy due to a sustained tachycardia is a common clinical entity. The detrimental effects of self‐terminating tachycardias, however, have been less thoroughly investigated. We examined the effects of interventional ablative therapy on the systolic left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of otherwise healthy patients (P) with paroxysmal tachycardias. Methods: 241 consecutive P without structural heart disease(no coronary heart disease, no valve disease, no ICD or pacemaker) presenting for ablation therapy due to paroxysmal tachycardias were examined. EF was determined by echocardiography before and 1–3 months after ablation. Incidence of tachycardia was determined by repetitive Holter ECG and according to described symptoms. Results: 241 P with the following tachycardias were included: AVNRT (n = 99), atrial flutter (n = 57), paroxysmal AF (n = 51), EAT (n = 6), AVRT (n = 14), idiopathic VT (n = 14). 24% of P demonstrated with a slightly decreased EF (48 ± 6%): 22% of AVNRT‐P(EF 51 ± 5%), 28% of atrial flutter‐P (EF 47 ± 8%), 25% of paroxysmal AF‐P (EF 48 ± 9%), 17% of EAT‐P (EF 54 ± 4%), 21% of AVRT‐P (EF 46 ± 8%), 21% of VT‐P (EF 43 ± 7%). Ventricular tachycardias proved to be more detrimental to EF than supraventricular tachycardias. After successful ablation left ventricular function normalized in all patients (EF: 61 ± 5%). Conclusions: Not only sustained but also paroxysmal tachycardias may cause EF deteriorations which are fully reversible after ablation therapy. Supraventricular tachycardias worsen EF independent of its diagnosis but clearly correlated to its incidence. In P with undetermined cause of reduced EF a sinus rhythm ECG does not exclude the possibility of a tachycardiomyopathy. Therefore also paroxysmal tachycardias have to be excluded. In patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal tachycardias ablation therapy should be planned on a short term basis to prevent tachycardiomyopathy. P173 TACHYCARDIOMYOPATHY INDUCED BY FOCAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA: THE INCIDENCE, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PREDICTORS AND THE LONG TERM OUTCOME Ju W; Chen M; Yang B; Chen H; Zhang F; Yu J; Cao K Department of Cardiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 2100 Objectives: To report the incidence, clinical and electrophysiological characteristics, and the long term outcomes of the patients with focal ATs induced cardiomyopathy. Methods: Totally 186 cases of patients with focal atrial tachycardias but without pre‐exiting structural heart disease underwent catheter ablation from Jan 2005 to Apr 2011 in our institution were enrolled in the study. The data were retrospectively analyzed to characterize the clinical and electrophysiological profiles of patients with tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, which was defined as the left ventricle ejection fraction ≤50%. Results: Twelve patients (9 males, the mean age 23.4 ± 16.0 years) were identified to have tachycardiomyopathy, giving an incidence of 6.5%. The patients with tachycardiomyopathy were younger (23.4 ± 15.9 vs 45.7 ± 17.1, P < 0.05) and more frequently males (9/12 vs 64/174, P < 0.05). The tachycardias in the cardiomyopathy group were more frequently incessant (10/12 vs 32/174, P < 0.05).The prevalence of symptoms, including the palpitations, shortness, and syncope or pre‐syncope was not different between the two groups, as well as the tachycardia cycle length and heart rate. The appendage was the most preferential site for the tachycardia to develop cardiomyopathy (8/12). In a 36.3 ± 20.1 months follow up, all of the patients with cardiomyopathy had their left ventricle ejection fraction improved by either catheter ablation or rate control using drug therapy (43.9 ± 5.8 vs 61.1 ± 3.5, P < 0.05). However, one patient suffered sudden death due to unauthorized withdrawal, which leading to uncontrollable heart failure. Conclusions: About 6.5% patients with focal atrial tachycardia developed to tachycardiomyopathy. The incessant nature was associated with the development of the myopathy. The appendage was the most preferential site. Most patients had benign long term outcome using either catheter ablation or rate control by drug therapy. P174 NONINVASIVE BEAT‐TO‐BEAT CARDIAC MAPPING FOR TOPICAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATRIAL AND VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHY‐ THMIAS Shlyakhto E; Lebedev D; Treshkour T; Chmelevsky M; Zubarev S Almazov Federal Heart, Blood and Endocrinology Centre, St. Petersburg, Russia Topical diagnosis of atrial and ventricular ectopy is a relevant issue in electrocardiology. Non‐invasive beat‐to‐beat epi‐ and endocardial cardiac mapping (NCM) is a fundamentally new method of solving this problem. NCM is based of solving the so‐called inverse electrocardiographic (ECG) problem: digital reconstruction of electrograms on the epicardium and endocardium based on the multichannel ECGs recorded on the torso surface. Accurate individual heart and thorax anatomical images derived from tomography studies are used for the calculations. Objective: To determine localization of focal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTA and VTA) and to explore nature of spread of excitation, using NCM. Materials and Methods: 35 patients were examined, 5 with SVTA and 30 with VTA, average age 43 ± 12 years. Men/women – 21/14. VTA were presented by monomorphic ventricular ectopic complexes (VEC) in 19 cases and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 11 cases. Among patients with SVTA: 3 were with atrial premature beats, 2 – with atrial tachycardia. All patients were identified with indications for radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). For topical preoperative diagnosis NCM with AMYCARD 01 C SYSTEM for Noninvasive EP studies was performed. 15 patients underwent RFCA tachyarrhythmias: 12 patients with VTA and 3 patients with pulmonary veins (PV) ectopia. In 9 cases electroanatomic mapping CARTO was applied and in 3 cases – with software module CARTO Merge. Results: The areas of early activation were defined by construction of potential and isochrone maps on epi‐ and endocardium. The first results showed a complete coincidences of early activation areas obtained using intraoperative mapping and NCM. Conclusions: NCM can improve accuracy of preoperative topical VTA and SVTA diagnosis, reduce time of intraoperative mapping and duration of the cateter ablation procedures. P175 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEFT VENTRICULAR DIASTOLIC FUNCTION AND ABNORMAL REPOLARIZATION AFTER RADIOFREQUENCY CATHETER ABLATION IN PATIENTS WITH WOLFF‐PARKINSON‐WHITE SYNDROME Weng K‐P; Lin C‐C; Hsieh K‐S Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan Purpose: To assess the serial changes in LV function after RF ablation of a manifest accessory pathway and the relationship between T‐wave changes and LV diastolic function. Methods: The subjects consisted of three groups with tachyarrhythmias. Group A (n = 20): manifest WPW syndrome. Group B (n = 20): concealed WPW syndrome. Group C (n = 20): AVNRT. All patients underwent a series of EKG and echocardiographic examination before and after the catheter ablation procedure. With regard to LV diastolic function parameters, E/A ratio, DT, IVRT, Tei index and tissue Doppler parameters were assessed. Results: In group A (12 ± 3 years), 13 patients had T‐wave changes after ablation. In group B (13 ± 2 years) and C (11 ± 5 years), none had T‐wave changes after ablation. In three groups, there were no significant changes in LVDD, LVSD, and EF before and after the ablation procedure. The cE/A ratio decreased after the ablation and began to improve after 1 month. The cDT increased after the ablation and decreased after 1 month. Left ventricular cIVRT improved in the late period. No statistically significant change was observed in the E/Em ratio. The Em/Am ratio, Tei index, and tissue Doppler parameters obtained from the lateral side of the mitral annulus using tissue Doppler was statistically different before and after the ablation procedure. There was no correlation between the presence of T‐wave changes and postablation echocardiographic findings. Conclusions: T‐wave change after RF ablation of manifest accessory pathway may result from abrupt alteration of the sequence of ventricular repolarization and are not a direct result of RF ablation. This conclusion is supported by no correlation between the presence of T‐wave changes and postablation echocardiographic findings. Key words: Radiofrequency ablation, T‐wave, diastolic function P176 SLEEP APNEA DOES NOT PREDICT ATRIAL FLUTTER RECURRENCE AFTER ATRIAL FLUTTER ABLATION van Oosten EM; Furqan MA; Redfearn DP; Simpson CS; Michael KA; Fitzpatrick M; Hopman WM; Baranchuk A Kingston General Hospital, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada Background: Sleep apnea (SA) has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and has been found as a predictor of AF recurrence after successful pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). However, no investigations have been carried out to determine the prevalence of SA in patients with atrial flutter (AFL) and the impact of SA on AFL recurrence after AFL ablation. Aim: To determine if SA is a predictor of recurrence of AFL and/or atrial arrhythmias in patients who have undergone AFL ablation. Methods: Retrospective electronic chart review analysis of consecutive right sided isthmus dependent AFL referred for ablation over a two year period. Recurrent atrial arrhythmias were classified as AFL, AF, or other atrial arrhythmias. SA prevalence was determined. Results: We included 122 consecutive patients undergoing AFL ablation between Jan. 2008 – Dec. 2009. Mean follow‐up was 28.3 ± 6.4 months. 20 patients were excluded due to atypical flutter, procedure abandonment, misdiagnosis, or PVI being the primary procedure. Male 75.4%, mean age 68.3 ± 10.4 years, hypertension 65%, and structural heart disease 42%. Prevalence of SA was 27% (33 patients). Recurrence of AFL was observed in 9.8%, recurrence of AF was observed in 22%, and other arrhythmias in 5%. SA was not a predictor of AFL recurrence (6.1% vs. 11.2%, p = NS). SA was neither a predictor of AF nor of other arrhythmia recurrences. Variables associated with AFL recurrence were: no history of pre‐ablation antiarrhythmic drugs (18.8% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.04) and lower BMI (27.07 kg/m2 vs. 30.87 kg/m2, p = 0.04). Variables associated with AF recurrence included: paroxysmal atrial flutter (vs. persistent) (26.7% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.04), higher BMI (32.6 kg/m2 vs. 29.7 kg/m2, p = 0.039), and lower right atrial volume index (23.9 mL/m2 vs. 32.2 mL/m2, p = 0.002). Conclusions: In this cohort prevalence of SA in patients with AFL was increased (27%). SA was not found to be a predictor of AFL recurrence after successful AFL ablation. P177 INTRACARDIAC ULTRASOUND‐GUIDED ABLATION OF CAVOTRICUSPID ISTHMUS Bencsik G; Pap R; Makai A; Klausz G; Chadaide S; Traykov V; Sághy L 2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology Center, University of Szeged, Hungary Aims: Our aim was to compare intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) guided ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) with conventional fluoroscopy‐guided ablation (FGA) focusing on procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation exposure and delivered radiofrequency energy (RFE). Patients and Methods: In our single center, prospective, randomized study we included 72 patients (mean age 64.6 ± 11.06, 13 women) scheduled for CTI ablation with documented typical flutter. We randomized patients (1:1 fashion) in two groups: one with conventional FGA (36 patients with 3 femoral punctures for 2 multipolar and 1 ablation catheter) and a second ICE‐guided group (36 patients) with 4 femoral punctures (additional puncture for ICE catheter placed in right atrium). Procedure time was counted from starting the punctures until withdrawal of the last sheath. Fluoroscopy times and radiation data (cumulated radiation and dose‐area product (DAP)) were registered by radiology system and RFE data (sum of delivered RFE) by EP system. The endpoint for ablation was bidirectional block on the CTI after a waiting period of 30 minutes. Results: We found a significantly shorter procedure time (105.0 ± 30.3 min vs. 67.2 ± 16.0 min, p = 0.005) and a significantly lower fluoroscopy‐time (19.1 ± 10.7 min vs. 5.6 ± 4.3 min, p = 0.001) in the ICE‐guided group. DAP was found to be significantly higher in the FGA group (1493.6 ± 1263.3 cGycm2 vs. 433.3 ± 435.8 cGycm2, p = 0.001) and the sum of delivered RFE was significantly higher in the FGA group (14481.4 ± 11035.0 Ws vs.10339.5 ± 6917.7 Ws, p = 0.011). Four vascular complications (groin haematoma) and steam pops (3 in each group) were equally distributed. Conclusion: ICE‐guided ablation of CTI significantly shortens the procedure and fluoroscopy time and markedly decreases radiation exposure in comparison with FGA without a risk of increasing a complication rate. Using ICE‐guidance the sum of delivered RFE was found to be significantly lower. P178 ECHOCARDIAGRAPHIC DYNAMIC IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY TACHYCARDIA BEFORE AND AFTER RADIOFREQUENCY CATHETER ABLATION Ardashev AV; Rybachenko MS; Konev AV; Zhelyakov EG; Belenkov YuN* 83 Clinical Hospital of FMBA, * Lomonosov State University, Moscow, Russia Purpose: To assess hemodynamic parameters in pts with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) before and after slow pathway radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA). Methods and Material: Study included of 81 pts who were divided into 2 groups. Study group consistent of 61 AVNRT pts (17 female, mean age 45.3 ± 15.1 years) who underwent RFA of AV node slow pathway. Control group comprised of 20 healthy volunteers (5 female, mean age 41.9 ± 5.3 years) without structural heart pathology. Hemodynamic parameters were accessed by means of transthoracic echocardiography before and 2, 6, 12 months after intervention. We used M‐mode, 2D‐mode to determine end diastolic dimension of the left ventricle (LV), end systolic dimension of LV, end diastolic volume of LV, end systolic volume of LV, ejection fraction of LV. Results: There were no significant differences of hemodynamic parameters in studied and control groups before and 2, 6, 12 months after RFA. In AVNRT pts parameters of hemodynamics did not undergo substantial changes during 12 months of follow up after RFA comparing with initial values. Minor anomalies of development of cardiac connective tissue were diagnosed in 28 (45%) AVNRT pts (mitral valve prolapse – 21 pts, left ventricle accessory chords – 7 cases) vs 2 cases (mitral valve prolapse in both cases) of control group (10%) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Hemodynamic parameters of AVNRT pts characterized by normal values and don't differ from healthy population before and after RFA of AV node slow pathway. AVNRT might be associated with minor anomalies of development of cardiac connective tissue. P179 ELECTROANATOMICAL MAPPING OF AV NODE AND CRYOABLATION OF PARAHISIAN ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA Katsouras GE; Grimaldi M; Petruzzellis A; Sgueglia M; Langialonga T Cardiology Clinic, "F.Miulli" General Hospital, Acquaviva delle Fonti, Italy Introduction: Focal atrial tachycardia originating from the parahisian region is relatively rare. Ablation of this form of tachycardia may carry a potential risk of atrioventricular (AV) block with consequent pacemaker implantation. Methods: N/A. Results: A 37 y female, without previous diseases of note, presented with nausea, asthenia, and sense of imminent death! ECG showed frequent and repetitive atrial extrasystoles. An electrophysiologic study was performed, demonstrating numerous repetitive parahisian extrasystoles. Beta‐blockers, flecainide or sotalol were not efficient and the patient after 6 months gave informed consent to proceed with ablation of the focus. We introduced a decapolar catheter into the coronary sinus as a reference catheter and used a Navistar catheter to map the arrhythmia (CARTO system). We first constructed the right atrium and AV ring anatomy while performing a detailed mapping of the AV node, creating a cluster of points of 2 mm diameter. Each point corresponded to a His signal on the catheter. We circumscribed such points with a yellow line (Fig.) and proceeded with activation mapping of the extrasystoles. The tachycardia was arising from the midseptal region between the AV node and the AV ring. We introduced a 7 F 4 mm tip Medtronic CryoCath quadripolar catheter which was also shown on our map after regulating the CARTO system. However, we performed cryoablation excluding the CryoCath catheter from the CARTO system for incompatibility reasons. After ablation, we noted junctional beats different from the original tachycardia which had disappeared by the first month control. At one‐year follow up, the patient presented only 1 atrial extrasystole during 24 h Holter. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of AV node mapping with the technique described above, as well as the first report of combined use of cryoablation with the CARTO system. P180 THE OCCURRENCE OF AV BLOCK AFTER SLOW PATHWAY ABLATION AND 12 MONTHS FOLLOW UP: TWO‐CATHETER APPROACH Kocijancic A; Mrdja S; Mujovic N; Marinkovic M; Potpara T; Polovina M; Simic D; Ostojic MC Clinic for Cardiology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia Background: Radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway has been recommended as first‐line therapy for the treatment of AVNRT. The purpose of this study is to show that incidence of AV block follow the slow pathway ablation is not higher with two‐catheter approach than with multi‐catheter approach, as referred in the literature. Methods: A total of 92 consecutive patients (aged 19–76, mean 51.9 ± 13.3 years) underwent RFA of the slow pathway, 59 (64.1%) were female. Electrophysiologic method with only two electrode catheters, one diagnostic, (placed in the high right atrium) and one ablation cathether ("two‐catheter approach") was used. The patients were followed at the outpatient clinic for 1, 6 and 12 months during the first year after the procedure. Results: RF ablation was acutely successful in 91 patients (98.9%); slow pathway ablation was achieved in 38 patients (41.3%) and slow pathway modification in 54 (58.7%). Transient AV block occurred in 4 patients (4.3%) during the procedure. After 12 months follow‐up complete AV block occurred in 1 patient (1,1%) required pacemaker implantation. Conclusions: The use of a "two‐catheter approach" (one diagnostic and one ablation) was as effective and safe as a multi‐catheter approach. The incidence of acute and late AV block showed results similar to those of previous studies. P181 RIGHT ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA DESPITE SILENT RIGHT ATRIUM Bogossian H; Ninios I; Karosiene Z; Pechlivanidou E; Guenesdogan B; Kloppe A; Mijic D; Zarse M; Lemke B Klinikum Luedenscheid, Germany We saw a 62 year old male patient suffering from severe palpitations during his atrial driven tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm with 1:1 ventricular pacemaker (PM) stimulation (Cycle length 575 ms) for 8 weeks. A DDDR PM has been implanted due to intermittent AV‐Block III°. CHD has been ruled out via coronary angiography. Echocardiographic examination showed only slightly reduced systolic left ventricular function (EF 48%) without any major valvular dysfunction. Cardiac risk factors were hypertonus, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Additionally the patient suffered from obstructive sleep apnea. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has been described. Before EP‐study, PM modus was changed from DDDR to VVI 30/min which caused a decrease in heart rate down to 53 bpm due to 2:1 block in ventricular answer. During EP study we saw a totally silent right atrium (RA) which showed neither electrical activity nor response to stimulation even with high output. Exclusively in the coronary sinus (CS) and directly adjacent areas, a rapid centrifugal activity was demonstrated. 3‐D electroanatomical mapping was employed after pacing‐manoevers including entrainment and post‐pacing intervals were measured to closer define the area of interest. At the defined hot spot RF‐energy was applied. However, only after adding a line up to an electrically isolated anchor‐point at the tricuspid‐valve circumference tachy was terminated, followed by an atrial electrical standstill which required DDDR‐Pacing. Long AV‐interval allowed for intrinsic AV‐conduction which immediately decreased clinical symptoms. Atrial electrical standstill in one atrial chamber with the other one demonstrating rather normal electrical activity is quite unusual. In our case the underlying pathophysiological mechanism might be connected to increase right atrial pressure due to obstructive sleep apnea. This effect might be aggravated by the underlying hypertension and paroxysms of atrial fibrillation. P182 GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND ATRIOVENTRI‐ CULAR NODAL CONDUCTION PROPERTIES IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRANT TACHYCARDIA (AVNRT) Singhal R; Jaswal A; Saxena A Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India Introduction: Atrial fibrillation and WPW syndrome have higher incidence in men while Atrial tachycardia and Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) occurs frequently in women. The electrophysiological (EP) characteristics of gender differences in AVNRT is still not clear. This study investigated gender‐related EP differences in patients (pts) undergoing radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Objective: The aim of study was to investigate gender‐related EP differences in pts undergoing RF ablation of AVNRT. Methods & Results: 580 AVNRT pts (men/women 210/370; 1.8:1); mean age‐45.6 ± 18.6 years old, who underwent RF ablation were enrolled in study over three years (2007‐2010). We evaluated gender differences in EP characteristics. Women had younger age of onset, higher incidence of multiple jumps, shorter AH interval, atrial effective refractory period (ERP), anterograde (AG) fast pathway ERP, AG slow pathway ERP, retrograde (RG) slow pathway ERP, and longer ventricular ERP than men. Incidence of baseline VA dissociation was lower in women than men. No gender differences in tachycardia cycle length of AVNRT was noted. Women needed less isoproterenol/atropine to induce AVNRT. No gender differences in radiation exposure time, complication rate, acute success rate or second procedure rate were noted. Typical AVNRT was more predominant in women and atypical AVNRT was more in men. In patients with atypical AVNRT, there was no significant gender difference in incidence of baseline VA dissociation; however, the RG slow pathway ERP was significantly shortin women than in men. Women of premenopausal age ≤50 years old had higher incidence of AG multiple jumps and RG jump phenomenon, and short AG slow pathway ERP and RG slow pathway ERP than those of women ≥50 years old. Conclusion: Gender differences in AG and RG AV nodal EP were noted in pts with AVNRT, which may be related to cyclical changes in hormonal milieu in premenopausal women vs men and postmenopausal women. P183 OUTCOME ON ATRIAL FLUTTER PATIENT WITH POOR EJECTION FRACTION WHO UNDERWENT SUCCESSFUL RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION AT ONE YEAR Tan VH (1,2); Imran SS (1,3); Liew R (1); Tan BY (1); Chong D (1); Teo WS (1); Ching CK (1) 1. National Heart Centre of Singapore, 2. Changi General Hospital, 3. Khoo Teck Puat Hospital Introduction: There were limited studies on the outcome of patients with atrial flutter and poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who underwent successful radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). We report the 12 month outcome of patients with atrial flutter and depressed LVEF who underwent successful RFCA. Methods: Patients with atrial flutter and depressed LVEF ≤ 40% were included over a 15 months period. Clinical demographics, recurrence of atrial flutter at 12 months and change in NYHA status and LVEF were collected and analyzed. Results: There were 15 patients with atrial flutter and LVEF ≤ 40% during the period. Majority were male (86.7%) and mean age was 66.7 ± 8.5 years. 80% of patients had ischemic heart disease and 20% had prior stroke. Distribution of NYHA status at baseline was as follow: class I: 6.7%, class II: 53.3%, class III: 33.3% and class IV: 6.7%. All underwent successful RFCA. One patient developed pseudoaneurysm at puncture site post procedure. Mean EF before ablation was 24 ± 6.3%. Post ablation mean LVEF increased significantly to 37.6 ± 17.6% (P < 0.01). Improved ejection fraction (>40%) after ablation was noted in 46.7% of patient. Mean duration of repeat EF post ablation was 9.1 ± 7.2 months. The recurrence rate was 14% at 12 months. Comparing those who had improved LVEF (>40%) with poor LVEF (≤40%), there was no significant different in baseline characteristic and recurrence rate at one year. However, there was significant difference in NYHA class post ablation in which 4 (57%) patients were at NYHA class 1 in EF>40% group as compare to none at NYHA class 1 in EF≤40% group, p = 0.03. Conclusions: Atrial flutter ablation in patients with LVEF ≤ 40% was safe with a recurrence rate of 14% at 12 months follow‐up. LVEF was significantly improved post ablation. Of note those who attained LVEF >40% had significantly improved NYHA status. P184 ONE YEAR OUTCOME ON ISCHEMIC VERSUS NON‐ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY WITH POOR EJECTION FRACTION IN ATRIAL FLUTTER PATIENT WHO UNDERWENT SUCCESSFUL RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION Tan VH (1,2); Imran SS (1,3); Liew R (1); Tan BY (1); Chong D (1); Teo WS (1); Ching CK (1) 1. National Heart Centre of Singapore, 2. Changi General Hospital, 3. Khoo Teck Puat Hospital Introduction: Studies have shown that patients with atrial flutter and poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who underwent successful radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) have significant improvement in LVEF and NYHA class. We sought to determine if there were differences in LVEF improvement and changes in NYHA status between patients with ischemic (ICMP) and non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICMP) ≤ 40% LVEF who underwent successful RFCA for atrial flutter. Methods: Patients with atrial flutter and depressed LVEF ≤ 40% were included over a 15 months period. Clinical demographics, recurrence of atrial flutter at 12 months and change in NYHA status and LVEF were collected and analyzed. Results: 15 patients with atrial flutter and LVEF ≤ 40% during the period were recruited. 80% (12 patients) have ICMP versus 20% (3 patients) with NICMP. Clinical demographics between the two groups were similar. Distribution of NYHA status (ICMP vs. NICMP) at baseline was as follow: class 1: 0% vs. 33.3%, class 2: 66.7% vs. 0%, class 3: 25.0% vs. 66.7% and class 4: 8.3% vs. 0%. One patient in NICMP group developed pseudoaneurysm at puncture site post procedure. There was significant improved in mean LVEF post ablation within both groups (ICMP: 22.6% vs. 32.3%, p = 0.03; NICMP: 29.7% vs. 58.7%, p = 0.04). NICMP group had a significant increase in magnitude of LVEF post ablation compared to ICMP (+29.0% vs. +9.7%, p = 0.04). There was improvement in NYHA class post ablation in both groups (ICMP vs. NICMP) and as follow: class 16.7% vs. 66.7%, class 2: 58.3% vs. 33.3%, class 3: 25.0% vs. 0% and class 4: 0% vs. 0%. The recurrence rate was 25% at 12 months in the ICMP group whereas there was no recurrence in the NICMP group (p = 0.5). Conclusions: LVEF and NYHA status improved significantly in patients who underwent successful RFCA of atrial flutter. Of note, patients with NICMP seemed to have greater improvement in LVEF compared to those with ICMP. SYNCOPE P185 HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN CHILDREN IN DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF RESPONSE TO HEAD‐UP TILT‐TEST Pogodina AV; Dolgikh VV; Valyavskaya OV Scientific centre of family health and human reproduction problems of Siberian brunsh of RAMS Aim: To study the heart rate variability (HRV) during the daily life, before and following the passive 60° head‐up tilt test (HUT) in patients with different types of positive response to head‐up tilt. Methods: We evaluated 28 patients (8–17 y.o), 12 boys, with an inducible vasovagal response to the HUT. We analyzed HRV during the 5‐minute period just before tilt, during the 5‐minute period immediately after tilt in the 60° head‐up position and within 5 minutes preceding syncope while all subjects were asymptomatic. HRV also was calculated over a 24‐hour period. Results: Sixteen children had mixed response to HUT, 4 vasodepressor (VD) and 8 cardioinhibitory (CI). Over the 24‐hour period significant differences were obtained only for rMSSD, which in children with VD syncope was significantly lower than that in children with CI syncope (p = 0,03), and tended to a significant reduction compared with children with mixed syncope (p = 0,07). Values of all indices during the day had no significant differences between groups of children with different types of syncope. Values pNN50, rMSSD and SDNNi during a night's sleep had significantly lower in children with VD syncope, compared with a group of children with CI syncope (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, p = 0.03, respectively), as pNN50 in children with VD syncope was significantly lower than in children with a mixed type of syncope (p = 0.03). In the HUT all HRV parameters did not differ between groups in the supine positions. In the first 5 min of tilt there were significant differences between groups: the pNN50 in children with VD syncope became significantly lower than in children with CI (p = 0,038) and mixed (p = 0,037) types of syncope. Within 5 minutes preceding syncope significant differences between groups was again not shown for any of the indices of HRV. Conclusion: Children with VD syncope are characterized by lower vagal influences in the regulation of cardiac rhythm compared with patients having other types of syncope. P186 RISK STRATIFICATION OF SYNCOPE. MALIGNANT PRESENTATION OF SYNCOPE: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EPISODES IN THE SAME PATIENT Ruiz GA; Chirife R; Aversa E; Tentori MC; Grancelli H; Nogues M; Perfetto JC Hospital Juan A Fernandez. Instituto Fleni In the diagnosis of syncope, the anamnesis provides important information related to risk stratification. The malignity of syncope is related to two different aspects: a) malignant presentation (MP), associated to risk of injury, b) malignant etiology (ME) related to mortality risk. However, we have observed in a previous study that when two or more episodes are reported, the patient's description is frequently different. Objective: To evaluate the degree of concordance of malignant presentation of syncope between different episodes in the same patient. Methods: An extensive questionnaire describing the last (up to) 4 episodes (ep.) was performed in 147 pts (49.2 ± 21 years, 65% women) with two or more syncopal episodes during the last 2 years. Definitions: MP: absence of prodroms, presence of injury, prolonged duration (> 5 minutes), and fecal/urine incontinence. ME: syncope during exercise, syncope during sleep, absence of prodroms or cardiological prodroms and cyanosis. A value of 1 was given to the presence of each variable, with a scale from 0 to 4. Last benign syncope (LBS)was defined as MP score = 0 in the last episode, last malignant syncope (LMS) was defined as MP score>0. The prevalence of each point score and the concordance of MP, ME scores, LBS and LMS between episodes were evaluated. Results: 440 episodes were evaluated in 147 pts. Of them, 252 (57%) had a MP score≥1 and 133 (30%) had an ME Score≥1. The prevalence of MP and ME scores (2 episodes) were respectively: 0 = 42% and 69%, 1 = 34% and 29%, 2 = 19% and 3%, 3 = 5% and 0%, 4 = 0% for both. The concordance between the last 2 ep. for MP, ME, LBS and LMS was 54%, 73%, 55% and 65%, respectively. Conclusion: The malignant quality of syncope is quite variable between episodes in the same patient. Almost half of patients whose last episode was benign had at least one criteria of malignity in previous episodes. These finding are important when considering the description of the episode for risk stratification. P187 ASYSTOLE DURING TILT TABLE TEST: WHO IS AT RISK? Zimerman A; Magalhães APA; Pimentel M; Zimerman LI Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Introduction: The tilt table test is a useful diagnostic method in the evaluation of syncope. Asystole is an important response which may occur during the test. Objectives: To evaluate the characteristics of patients with asystole during the tilt table test. Methods: A total of 640 tilt table tests were analyzed and patients who had a positive response were compared with the ones among them who had asystolic response. The protocol had a passive phase (20 minutes; 70 degrees inclination) and an active phase (1.25mg sublingual nitrate and inclination during 10 minutes). Asystole was defined as the presence of pause ≥3 seconds. Results: Patients were mostly females (63.8%) and mean age was 49.1 ± 22.2 years old. The tilt table test was considered positive in 334 patients (51.9%), from which 40 (12%) presented asystole, with an average duration of 9.1 ± 6.8 seconds. The patients with asystole had a lower age, 37.3 ± 18 vs. 48.7 ± 22 (p = 0.01). Asystole occurred in 9.3% of men and 9.9% of women (p = 0.86). It was present in 10.7% of the positive tests in the passive phase and in 12.8% after sensibilization (p = 0.7). The asystole duration during passive phase was 5.9 ± 3.6 vs. 10.6 ± 7.4 seconds after sensibilization (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Asystole during the tilt table test occurs more frequently in younger patients. The asystole duration was longer when the event took place after the pharmacological sensibilization with nitrate. P188 GENDER DIFFERENCES IN HEAD‐UP TILT TESTING (HUTT): 8 YEAR EXPERIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL Yao RC; Reyes DRC; Ramirez MFL University of Santo Tomas Hospital Objectives: To determine if there is difference in response patterns to HUTT between males and females. Methods: Records of patients who underwent HUTT for the evaluation of syncope were reviewed. Results: 328 out of 332 records were included in the study. 58.5% were females with mean age of 43 years for females and 48 for males. 48.2% of the female population tested positive compared to 30.4% among the male population. 23 patients developed a positive response without nitroglycerin (NTG) provocation. 78% were females. 111 patients developed a positive response with NTG provocation. 70% were females. Female patients who tested positive were significantly younger than males (38 vs 52 P = 0.0001). Mean baseline SBP and DBP were significantly lower in females who had positive result. Responses to HUTT among males in decreasing frequency are Type 1, followed by Type 3, POTS, Type 2a, Type 2b, and dysautonomic responses while in females, Type 1, followed by POTS, Type 3, 2b, 2a and dysautonomic response. Mixed type of response is more common in females than in males (74% VS 26%). POTS, Type 2b and dysautonomic responses were also more common in females. Frequency of type 2a and Type 3 responses were not significantly different between genders. When divided into 0–30, 31–60, and >60 years age group, significantly more females had a positive response in the 0–30 (59% vs 18% P = 0.0001) and 30–60 age group (49.5% vs 28.1% P = 0.006). In the >60 years age group, more males had positive response to HUTT, however this was not statistically significant. (44.7% vs 27.5% P = 0.09). Conclusion: In our institution, more females than males had positive response to HUTT both with and without provocation. Female patients with a positive response were significantly younger, had lower baseline SBP and DBP. Type 1 response is the most common type of response in both genders. In the >60 years age group, more males tested positive but this was not statistically significant. TELEMONITORING FOR CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT DEVICES P189 PERSONALIZED REMOTE MONITORING OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN PATIENTS WITH ELECTRONIC IMPLANT DEVICES Trucco E; Arbelo E; Laleci GB; Yang M; Kabak Y; Chronaki C; Hinterbuchner L; Guillén A; Dogac A; Brugada J; iCARDEA Hospital Clinic, Thorax Institute, Cardiology Department, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Care management systems are used to support and manage the care of patients (pt) with chronic diseases. Although adopting evidence‐based clinical guidelines provide numerous benefits, till now they are underutilized in clinical practice due to interoperability problems of different healthcare data sources. The iCARDEA architecture is an intelligent platform for personalized remote monitoring of pts with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED). The aim is to introduce the iCARDEA care management system for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in CIED pts, with emphasis on prevention of cardioembolic events and rate and rhythm management. Methods: The care plan engine executes the clinical guideline for management of patients with AF by accessing the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, the patient maintained personal health records (PHR) and the CIED data through standard interfaces. Results: The AF care plan is initiated whenever an AF event is detected and the physician is notified automatically by the iCARDEA system. Information about care plan execution steps are provided, and a link is given to a graphical monitoring tool which shows the care plan workflow graphically, allowing seeing the results of each decision step, such as the retrieved EHRs. For every decision, the care plan engine accesses the EHR and PHR. After a recommendation is presented to the physician, different options are provided, such as guidance on possible doses and major side effects, updating the hospital information system for storing this prescription, or continuing with the rest of the care plan. Conclusion: Through iCARDEA, early detection of AF events will be facilitated. This will facilitate the timely introduction of protective interventions against thromboembolic events, and will enable the anticipation of adverse hemodynamic effects. After completing all the system components including the security and privacy measures, a clinical trial is planned. P190 DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POPULATION ENROLLED IN "CLINICAL EVALUATION OF REMOTE MONITORING WITH DIRECT ALERTS TO REDUCE TIME FROM EVENT TO CLINICAL DECISION (REACT)" STUDY McComb J; Fernandez‐Lozano I; Kacet S; Jung W; Landolina M; Mortensen P; Raatikainen P; Mullens W; Speca GC; Gazzola C; REACT Freeman Hospital, Newcastle (UK) The number of patients with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT‐D) is increasing significantly. They need regular follow up (FU); guidelines require FU 2–4 times per year and additional FUs if necessary. The latest generation of devices allows remote interrogation, monitoring and automatic detection and alerting of potentially silent but dangerous events. The REACT study was designed to investigate if the detection of clinically relevant events with daily alerts notification by St Jude Medical (SJM) Merlin.net remote care leads to faster clinical decision and action. Methods: The REACT study is a prospective, randomized parallel open trial. 220 patients (219 analyzable) were enrolled between March 2010 and February 2011 by 28 centres in 11 European countries. Eligible patients must meet guidelines for ICD or CRT‐D implant and have a SJM device compatible with the Merlin.net Remote Care system. Results: The characteristics of Control Group (C) (n = 107, alerts off) and Treatment Group (T) (n = 112, alerts on) are as below: ControlTreatmentTotalGender (Male):86%86%86%Age (years):  62 ± 11  64 ± 12  63 ± 12Height (cm):173 ± 7173 ± 7173 ± 7Ischemic heart disease:62%62%62% Ejection Fraction was significantly lower in the control group: 30 ± 13 vs 32 ± 12, p = 0.04 (overall 31 ± 13). Hypertension (n = 104, 47%), Hypercholesterolemia (n = 87, 39%) and Diabetes (n = 54, 34%) are the commonest co‐morbidities. The indication for device implantation is primary prevention in 140 (64%) and secondary in 79 p (36%), 134 (61%) patients received an ICD (single or dual chamber) and 85 (38%) a CRT‐D device. Conclusion: The population enrolled in the REACT study is similar to the real‐world ICD and CRT‐D population. P191 REMOTE MONITORING SERVICE FOR CARDIAC DEVICE (ICD'S) PATIENTS. INITIAL EXPERIENCE FROM A GREEK HOSPITAL Rassias I; Tzeis S; Andrikopoulos G; Theodorakis G Henry Dunant Hospital Introduction: The application of remote monitoring (ICD's patients), consists of regular follow up of various parameters, concerning the normal operation of an ICD device, the recording of arrhythmic events and the number of delivered therapies. (appropriate or not). In this particular study we are describing the initial experience of our center, using the remote monitoring system Care Link by Medtronic. Method: 19 ICD patients were included in this study (7 with ischemic‐12 with non ischemic cardiomyopathy), consisting of remote monitoring follow up. 10 patients have BV ICD, 8 patients have DDD ICD and 1 patient has VVI ICD. On a regular weekly basis, we are checking the usual parameters, concerning the normal function of an ICD such as impedance, sense and threshold, as well as the arrhythmic events (ventricular tachycardia‐fibrillation episodes, atrial fibrillation episodes), the parameters concerning heart failure deterioration (optivol), the percentage of pacing (atrial, ventricular, biventricular) and the delivered therapies (appropriate, inappropriate therapies). Results: The mean follow up time, of our study is two months. We have recorded two episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, terminated appropriately with antitachycardia pacing and delivered shock correspondingly. In one patient we recorded an unusual increase of the impedance of the ventricular electrode. (> 3000 Ω). We also have recorded 7 episodes of atrial fibrillation and 11 episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Conclusion: The remote monitoring system of ICD patients offers many advantages concerning the safety and the quality of life, especially of those who live in rural areas. P192 INTEGRATION OF LATITUDE REMOTELY TRANSMITTED DATA INTO AN EMR SYSTEM USING FILEMAKER PRO SOFTWARE: PROCEDURE AND ALGORHYTMS Pupita G; Molini S; Matassini MV; Mazzanti I; Brambatti M; Capucci A Clinica di Cardiologia, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona The LATITUDE® Patient Management system allows to remotely follow Boston Scientific ICD and CRT‐D devices, accessing a website where the device info (transmitted using Bluetooth technology) is displayed. Boston Scientific has developed a software to download available transmissions into a local directory: it creates HL7 files structured according to the HL7 2.3.1 Observation Result Unsolicited message type, sending the information in the form of a lab report document. Each file contains a Message Header, a Patient Identification segment, and four Observation Reports sections (last interrogation, implant, lead test, lead information), each one having several Observation Results segments containing the parameters, that include lead status, device set up, arrhythmic events and stimulation statistics details. We developed a procedure to retrieve data from the HL7 files to put them into an EMR system; both are built in FileMaker Pro. The integration procedure is fully automated: it imports each files' segments in an ad hoc table, reconstructs the original message and grabs each parameter by parsing the reconstructed text, using specifically built custom functions developed in Filemaker Pro; finally the parameters are stored into the EMR system. We've tested the above mentioned procedure with our Center's data, processing a total of 163 transmissions belonging to 52 patients. We've encountered some minor issues: data import must be set to Unicode, date fields calculations need to be adjusted for the presence of the datum, the threshold measure units are always passed even if no measurement has been recorded; several numeric parameters can contain text instead of numbers; decimal separator must be adjusted to local standards. LATITUDE® remotely transmitted data can be integrated into an EMR system effortlessly, thus allowing full availability of patients' data and providing a way to closely monitor several clinically relevant parameters. P193 ICARDEA: PERSONALIZED REMOTE MONITORING OF PATIENTS WITH ELECTRONIC IMPLANTED DEVICES Arbelo E; Trucco E; Dogac A; Luepkes C; Chronaki C; Hinterbuchner L; Ploessnig M; Yang M; Guillen A; Brugada J; iCARDEA European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) – Grant Agreement n.o.: ICT‐248240 Introduction: Cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs) have become part of the standard therapy in patients (p) who are at risk of life‐threatening arrhythmias. CIEDs require regular scheduled hospital visits to monitor the device parametres and any adverse event. Additionally, many p require extra visits due to arrhythmic events or system‐related complications. This calls for new methods of long‐term surveillance to optimize patient safety, alleviating the burden of caregivers, and lowering costs through IT support. The iCARDEA project aims at developing an intelligent platform to semi‐automate the follow‐up of CIED p using adaptable computer interpretable clinical guideline models. Methods: Data from hospitals' electronic health records (EHR), from p‐maintained personal health records (PHR) and the CIED device readouts, provided by the remote monitoring services, are collected and correlated. This abstract describes the system architecture of iCARDEA. Results: In order to provide the Adaptive Care Planner, the CIED data is converted into a vendor independent standard format, and EHR and PHR data are converted to HL7 Clinical Document Architecture format, in order to be connected to the iCARDEA system. The data presented is enriched by automatically generated specific warnings and suggestions based on statistically valid patterns extracted using data analysis techniques applied to reference case knowledge bases. An adaptive care planner employing clinical guidelines automates risk assessment generating alarms as appropriate. Patients are empowered with integrated PHRs that enable informed and responsible participation in their health care and education. Conclusion: Leveraging the remote management capabilities of CIEDs heightens awareness of device status and disease progression, allowing more timely and effective treatment, while reducing the burden of in‐office visits. iCARDEA monitoring will reduce the time from an event to a clinical decision. VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIAS P194 VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS: LOOKING FOR THE REASON Tatarski RB; Lebedev DS; Gureev SV; Michailov GV Federal centre of heart, blood and endocrinology Everybody knows for today about a large number of patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VA). But high technology methods as a 3D electroanatomical mapping usage cannot show the myocardial and endocardial structural changes, and, as a result, modification of it's electrophysiology, that is a cause of VA presence. Goals: To identify the presence of heart structural changes using endocardial biopsy (EB) in patients with idiopathic VAs. Materials and Methods: 77 patients (27 male, age 42 ± 18 years) with idiopathic VAs were treated by radiofrequency ablation and they passed EB during operation. It' proved, that EB doesn't increase risk of intervention, it's duration and radiation obligation for patient and personnel. Different types of biopsy instruments were used during EB. 4 –7 bits extraction from each patient was considered as sufficient. Results: EB showed chronic myocarditis in 16 (22%), cardiosclerosis –10 (13%), acute myocarditis –9 (12), arrhythmogenic right ventricle dysplasia –18 (23%), lypoma –5 (6%), toxic myocardiopathy –3 (4%), amyloidosis –5 (6%), hypertrophy and protein dystrophy –11 (14%) patients respectively. In no case any of such disease was suspected. Total effectiveness of RF ablation in these patients during 10‐year observation period assembled 85%. No fatal event, associated with EB, was presented. Conclusion: The endocardial biopsy usage opens new horizons in diagnostics, pathogenetic foundations of VA and prognosis evaluation in patients with VA; it makes RF ablation more predictable. But it needs in large number of investigations for full data evaluation and determination of treatment strategy in these patients. P195 ABLATION OF VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS ORIGINATING FROM VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW TRACT USING REMOTE MAGNETIC FIELD NAVIGATION: FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY STUDY Pajitnev D; Zaltsberg S; Greiss H; Lehinant S; Neumann T; Kuniss M Kerckhoff Heart Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany Background: Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is an effective and generally accepted treatment of symptomatic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) originating from ventricular outflow tract (VOT). Catheter navigation using an external magnetic field may allow accurate mapping and ablation with reduced fluoroscopy time. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of VOT PVCs ablation using remote magnetic navigation. Methods: 12 consecutive patients (pts) with symptomatic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias and no underlying structural heart disease were included (2 female, age 59 ± 8 years). For mapping and ablation a 3.5 mm cooled tip magnetic catheter (Celsius RMT Thermocool® Biosense Webster) were used. Remote magnetic navigation was performed with Niobe System (Stereotaxis Inc.). After positioning of the catheter in the VOT activation‐ and pace‐mapping was performed by using the automated bull's eye mapping function of the Niobe system. Ablation was performed at the site of earliest activation (at least −30 ms) and/or best pace‐mapping. Cessation of spontaneous PVC activity was considered as ablation endpoint. Results: Successful ablation site was localized in the septal RVOT in 4 pts (33%), in the posterior RVOT in 6 pts (50%) and in 2 pts in the left and non‐coronary aortic cusp respectively. Mean procedural time was 74 ± 27 minutes with fluoroscopy time of 2.8 ± 1.5 minutes. Successful ablation was achieved in all patients utilizing 8.5 ± 7 RF‐applications at 40 Watts. No complications were observed. Conclusion: Arrhythmias originating from the right and left ventricular outflow tracts can be treated safely and successfully using remote magnetic navigation. The use of automated navigation function of the system allows precise mapping with reduced fluoroscopy times for both, the patient and the investigator. P196 IS CATHETER ABLATION OF VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA WORTHWHILE IN PATIENTS WITH ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY? Segetova M; Peichl P; Cihak R; Lefflerova K; Bytesník J; Kautzner J Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic Objectives: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is often considered of limited value in management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The aim of this study was to review long term results of substrate‐based RFA in ARVC. Methods: The study population comprised 14 patients (age 49.3 ± 18.4 years, 5 female) who underwent 1 or more RFA procedures for VT. Ten of them had implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Eleven primary procedures were followed by recurrence of VT during follow up that necessitated re‐do procedure or heart transplant in one patient with recurrent electrical storm. Only 3 patients had no recurrence after the first RFA. A total of 35 RFA procedures were performed using 3‐dimensional substrate mapping (n = 34) or conventional entrainment (n = 1) mapping (2,5 ± 1.5 procedures per patient). Epicardial approach was needed 4 times in 3 subjects (all younger than 30 years). During 31 ± 18.1 months after the last ablation procedure, patients had no recurrences of VT. Conclusions: Despite a high rate of earlier recurrences after first RFA, repeated procedures can abolish VTs in ARVC in long‐term horizon. Epicardial ablation seems to be necessary in all younger subjects (below 30 years of age). P197 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC MARKERS AND INDUCIBILITY OF VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS IN ISCHAE‐ MIC CARDIOMYOPATHY PATIENTS Kanoupakis EM; Koutalas EP; Kallergis EM; Mavrakis HE; Saloustros IG; Solidakis G; Psathakis E; Goudis CA; Vardas PE Cardiology Dpt, University Hospital of Heraklion Crete Introduction: Research on prognostic factors of ventricular arrhythmias inducibility in patients with severe reduced LV systolic function being ICD candidates for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death has given limited results so far. Aim of our study was to examine the relationship of specific echocardiographic markers, beyond LV ejection fraction, particularly left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter, with ventricular arrhythmias inducibility during electrophysiological study in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results: Data were acquired from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe reduced LV systolic function who underwent electrophysiological in the context of primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Electrophysiological study protocol included programmed electrical stimulation from right ventricular apex. Of 119 patients included, ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 76 (63.9%). Prior echocardiographic study revealed 26 (21%) patients with ventricular hypertrophy (defined as interventricular septum and posterior wall diastolic thickness >11 mm) and 90 patients (76.3%) with dilated left ventricle (defined as LV end‐diastolic diameter >55 mm). 80% of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy had ventricular arrhythmias induced compared to 59% of patients without ventricular hypertrophy (P < 0.05). However, as regards LV end‐diastolic diameter, difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.92). Conclusion: In populations at high risk for sudden cardiac death, such as ischemic cardiomyopathy patients, ventricular hypertrophy is correlated to ventricular arrhythmias inducibility and possibly is a risk factor for spontaneous malignant arrhythmias. P198 SPATIAL QRS‐T ANGLE IS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN ASYMPTOMATIC SARCOID PATIENTS WITH VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS Giallafos I; Kouranos V; Stampola S; Kalianos A; Peros I; Rapti A; Tryposkiadis F; Giallafos J Department of Cardiology of University of Athens & University of Larissa Although arrhythmia is a common in patients with sarcoidosis (Sar), it is often underdiagnosed. Electrocardiographic (ECG) derived spatial QRS‐T angle (QRS‐T‐a) is a novel marker of ventricular repolarization which have predictive value for sudden cardiac death in general and in diseased populations. The present study was carried out to evaluate the QRS‐T‐a in asymptomatic patients with Sar and to investigate the relationship between QRS‐T‐a and the occurrence of potentially serious ventricular arrhythmias. ECG derived QRS‐T angle of 112 Sar patients was calculated from the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) while MRI and 24 hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) was performed. Risk for arrhythmias was estimated for each patient by using Lown classification criteria for ventricular arrhythmias based on Holter results. Four subgroups were formed according to the combination of the arrhythmic risk (Lown >3 was high and Lown ≤3 was low) and the possible cardiac involvement (yes–no). The angle of the patients was compared with that of 65 healthy subjects. Results: 36 patients (32%) fulfilled the criteria of cardiac involvement while 12 patients were classified as Lown 4A (Couplets of Premature Ventricular Beats) with 3 as 4B (Non sustained Ventricular Tachycardia). The spatial QRS‐T angle of the Sar patient's were increased compared to the control's one, while the subgroup analysis showed that the cardiac positive & Lown >3 group had significantly elevated angle compared to the other disease groups. Bivariate correlation showed that spatial QRS‐T angle is positively associated with the age (p = 0.031, r = 0.204) and the Lown classification (p = 0.011, r = 0.240). Spatial QRS‐T angle seems to be increased in Sar patients compared to healthy subjects especially those with increased arrhythmic risk and with cardiac involvement. Determination of this angle can be useful in the risk assessment of however needs further studies for evaluation of this finding. OTHER P199 EVALUATION OF P WAVE DISPERSION AND QRS DURATION BEFORE AND AFTER THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY Rafla S; Elbadawy T; Helmy T; Ahmad E Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Egypt The effect of thrombolytic therapy on P wave dispersion (PWD) and QRS duration were studied in 30 patients (pts) with acute STEMI. PWD is defined as the difference between the longest and shortest P wave duration recorded from surface ECG. Pts received thrombolytic therapy (Streptokinase) in addition to standard medical therapy. Pts were divided into 2 groups; group A: Pts with successful thrombolytic therapy (23) and group B: Pts with failed thrombolytic therapy (7). P wave duration and dispersion were measured. The normal PWD is 28 ms ± 10. QRS duration was measured and pts were divided into 3 groups; Duration <90 ms, duration 90–110, and duration >110 ms. The incidence of arrhythmia was recorded. Results: PWD was higher in pts with STEMI than normal range. PWD on admission was positively related to age, ST deviation score, CK‐MB, Troponin, left atrial size, ejection fraction, and inversely related to beta blocker use before admission and not related to heart rate. After thrombolytic therapy; PWD and P max were higher in group B than group A: (Gr A 34 ± 6 vs Gr B 47 ± 10 ms, P < 0.006). Arrhythmias during the duration of stay in the ICU were atrial fibrillation in one, ventricular fibrillation in one and V tachycardia in three. Three pts died. As regards QRS duration; there was a significant change in QRS duration (shortening) in pts with successful thrombolysis. There was a significant negative correlation between the QRS duration and EF, and there was a significant positive correlation between QRS duration and the end diastolic and end systolic diameters. The incidence of complications (arrhythmias, heart failure, shock, pulmonary edema, mortality) increased with the increase in QRS duration. Conclusions: PWD is correlated with success of thrombolytic therapy and with other parameters as LA size and EF, In pts with STEMI the QRS duration is a useful indicator of LV systolic function, dimensions and is a predictor of outcome. P200 SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES Kallergis E; Chrysostomakis S; Goudis C; Bouloukaki I; Mermigkis C; Schiza S; Simantirakis E; Siafakas N; Vardas P Department of Cardiology, University Hospital, Heraklion, Crete, Greece Aims: Although the prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is high in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), there is little knowledge about the persistence of OSAHS in ACS patients after the acute event. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and time course of OSAHS in patients with ACS, during and after the stabilization of the acute cardiac event. Methods and Results: Fifty two patients with first ever ACS and with preserved left ventricular function, who were not on sedation or inotropes, underwent attended overnight polysomnography (PSG) in our sleep center, away from the CCU environment, on the third day after the acute event. In patients with an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) >10/h, we performed a follow up PSG one and six months later. Twenty eight patients (54%) had an AHI >10/h. There was a significant decrease in AHI 1 month after the acute event (13.9 ± 5.9 vs. 19.7 ± 6.7, p = 0.001), confirming the diagnosis of OSAHS in 22 of 28 patients (79%). At 6‐month follow up the AHI had decreased further (7.5 ± 4.6 vs. 19.7 ± 6.7, P < 0.05), and at that time only 6 of the 28 patients (21%) were diagnosed as having OSAHS. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a high prevalence of sleep apnea in the acute myocardial ischemia setting, which did not persist 6 months later, indicating that, to some degree, SDB abnormalities may be transient and related with the acute phase of the underlying disease. P201 COMPARISON OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION AND NORMAL DIASTOLIC FUNCTION IN TERMS OF HEART RATE RECOVERY AS A PREDICTOR OF MORTALITY Aksoy MN; Kilic H; Sari M; Ertem AG; Yeter E; Balci MM S.B. Health Ministry, Ankara Diskapi YB Training and Research Hospital Dept. Of Cardiology Heart rate recovery which is measured in recovery period of the exercise ECG test is a function of vagal tonus. It can be used as a predictor of mortality independent from other cardiovascular risk factors. In this study we compared asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction patients with healthy controls in terms of HRR which was already documented to be abnormal in patients with diastolic heart failure. We enrolled 71 patients in total which was divided into 3 groups consisted of Grade 1 DDF, Grade 2 DDF and Normal DF groups. Diastolic function assessments were made by TTE and all the patients achieved age predicted submaximal heart rate during exercise stress test. Heart rate recovery measured at 1st (HRR1) and 2nd (HRR2) minutes after cessation of exercise without a cool down period. HRR1 values in the Grade 1 DDF group were significantly lower than control group. Although mean HRR1 of Grade 2 DDF showed a trend towards lower than controls, it did not reach any statistical significance comparing with Grade 1 DDF and control group. (Normal, Grade 1 and Grade 2 HRR1 values were 36,6 ± 9,7 25,1 ± 11,1 and 29,0 ± 10,2 p:0,003). There were no significant difference in HRR2 between groups. In regression analysis, the difference of HRR1 values between Grade 1 DDF and Normal DF seemed to be independent from other variables (age, sex, DM, HT, smoking). These findings suggest that autonomic functions begins to deteriorate much before the onset of symptoms in diastolic dysfunction patients and this deterioration could be a sign of an increase in overall mortality risk in this subgroup of patients. Keywords: Heart rate recovery, Diastolic dysfunction, Echocardiography P202 RESULTS OF HOLTER MONITORING AND DAILY MONITORING OF BLOOD PRESSURE AT YOUNG ATHLETES Skuratova NA; Belyaeva LM; Gomel Regional Children hospital, Gomel, Belarus Belarusian Medical Academy of Post‐Graduate Education, Minsk, Belarus There are literary data about revealing of an arterial hypotension at young athletes which is frequently treated as physiological and testifies to the raised tone of parasympathetic nervous system. Aim: To estimate results of the Holter monitoring and daily monitoring of blood pressure (DMBP) at young athletes. Materials and methods: At 80 young sportsmen of 8–18 years (middle age 13, 0 ± 2, 2 years) it has been spent Holter monitoring and DMBP. Results: The group of young athletes with arterial hypotension (5 to 50 percentile) has been presented by 38 children (47, 5%). Normal values DMBP (from 50 to 90 percentile) had 22 (27, 5%) young athletes, normal values DMBP (from 50 to 90 percentile) had 22 (27, 5%) young athletes, "high normal" blood pressure or arterial hypertension had 16 (20%) children. Among surveyed children 4 (5%) the person had an arterial hypotension less than 5 percentile. At the analysis of occurrence various arrhythmias at athletes it is revealed, that at young sportsmen with an arterial hypotension less than 50 percentiles during DMBP considerable ECG‐changes (Sa‐block, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia and others) were registered authentically often (p = 0,01, × 2). Conclusions: 1The majority of young sportsmen have an arterial hypotension less than 50 percentile during DMBP that can be a sign of physiological sports heart, however demands additional inspection.2Young athletes with an arterial hypotension less than 50 percentile during DMBP have considerable ECG‐changes at Holter monitoring more often, that dictates necessity of differential diagnostics between physiological and pathological athletes heart. P203 A1 EXPONENT FROM DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS (DFA) OF HEARTBEAT TIME SERIES PREDICTS TOTAL MORTALITY IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Manis G; Dilaveris P; Tsiachris D; Archontakis S; Aggelis A; Pietri G; Kartsagoulis E; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: To estimate the DFA method analysis of heartbeat time series as compared to other conventional non invasive electrophysiological indices for their ability to predict total mortality (TM) in Heart Failure (HF) patients (pts). Methods: We screened 191 HF pts (age: 64.7 ± 13.5 years, male: 84%, NYHA class: 2.3 ± 0.5, LVEF: 32.5 ± 10.4, CAD: 80%, DCMP: 20%) under optimum treatment with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24 hours HOLTER. After 18 ± 16.8 months of follow up 34 deaths occurred (Sudden Cardiac: 13, Pump Failure: 17, Non Cardiac: 4). Differences between survivors and non‐survivors for electrophysiological TM predictors were analyzed with Log rank test. The correlation of the electrophysiological predictors with TM was evaluated through survival analysis method utilizing Kaplan Meier curves adjusted for possible confounders under building of appropriate Cox statistical models. Results: In univariate analysis, DFA a1 was a statistically significant predictor of TM. (Logrank p = 0.002). This finding was verified after Cox regression analysis adjusted for gender, left ventricular ejection fraction (ECHO), fQRS (SAECG), Ventricular Premature Beats >10/hour, Non Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia≥1 episode, mean Heart Rate, SDNN/HRV and 24 hour mean QTc (HOLTER). The most important and independent predictor of TM was DFA a1 with hazard ratio (HR): 0.144, (p = 0.008, 95%CI:0.346–0.606). A cut off point of a1< 0.697 (25th percentile) presented HR 3.299 (p = 0.006) 95% C.I. 1.401–7.767. Conclusions: DFA a1 exponent was an important and independent predictor of TM in HF patients. P204 STRUCTURE AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT METHODS OF TACHYARRHYTHMIAS STARTING IN ANTENATAL PERIOD Svintsova L; Kovalev I; Child's Heart Center Institute of Cardiology Materials: We observed 17 children whose tachycardia was firstly disclosed in the perinatal period and was confirmed by fetal echocardiography (Echo). All patients were performed reschedule abdominal delivery at 33–38 weeks of gestation. They were admitted to our clinic with arrhythmogenic cardiopathy and HF by 1 month of life. Tachyarrhythmias were idiopathic in all children with anatomically normal heart. Results: Permanent form of atrial flutter (AF) was in 8 patients with fetal tachycardia in anamnesis, in 5 children – persistent paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, in 4 child – also persistent paroxysmal tachycardia involving accessory pathways. Patients with permanent form of AF (n = 8) were successfully performed electric cardioversion. Here tachycardia relapses were not arisen. Most of patients with persistent paroxysmal tachycardia were refractive to AAT. Seven of them were performed radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of tachycardia. RFA of tachycardia was performed to two children weighing 3800 g and 4200 g during their first two months of life. RFA ablation was performed to them in the second half‐year period of their life. The postoperative period was without complications in all patients. Follow‐up was from one month to five years. Tachycardia relapses were not observed. AAT appeared effective in two children having concealed WPW syndrome. In both cases tachycardia was stopped by amiodarone. Treatment course in both cases was 4 months. Recurrent tachycardia was not revealed after drug withdrawal. Follow‐up was 3 and 6 months respectively. Conclusion: Cardioversion is effective for treatment of permanent atrial flatter in infants and newborns. Persistent paroxysmal tachycardias have progressive course, are accompanied by HF rising and are refractory to AAT. RFA is the most effective method of treatment in such patients. P205 WHAT IS BEHIND "IDIOPATHIC ARRHYTHMIA": ENDOMYOCARDIAL BIOPSY AS A CLUE TO THE PRECISE DIAGNOSIS Blagova OV; Nedostup AV; Kogan EA; Sulimov VA; Abugov SA; Kupryanova AG; Zaidenov VA; Donnikov AE I.M.Sechenov I Moscow State Medical University Objective: To estimate the role of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) of right ventricle in precise nosology diagnosis ascertainment and therapy specification in patients with «idiopathic» arrhythmias. Methods: We observed seventeen patients (8 females, 42.6 11.9 y.o.) with «idiopathic» arrhythmias resistant to therapy (atrial fibrillation (AF) in 88%). Investigation concluded EMB with following histological examination; PCR detection of virus infections; detection of anti‐heart antibodies (AB). Results: Perfusion defects were found in 56% of patients, moderate enlargement of the left atrium in 41%; AB against endothelium in 65%, conduction system in 76%, cardiomyocytes in 53%, and specific antinuclear AB in 65%. Virus genomes in EMB samples were detected by PCR in 4 patients: parvovirus B19 – in 2 EMB samples, herpes virus 6 type – in 1 EMB sample and in blood only – EBV in 1 patient; 11 patients had myocarditis, one of parvovirus B19 carriers had endomyocarditis; productive vasculitis was in 2 patients prevailed. Four 3 virus‐negative samples had signs of immune cytolysi, and one with mytosis. Primary cardiomyopathy, ARVD, and Fabry disease were also found. The follow up is 32.7 7.3 months. Therapy of antiarrhythmic drugs, corticosteroids (n = 12, 28.8 ± 10.9 mg/day), azatioprine 150 mg/day (n = 2), hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day (n = 10), meloxicam 15 mg/day (n = 7), gancyclovir/acyclovir (n = 4), iv immunoglobulin (n = 2) was prescribed for 14 patients. Reduction of AF episode frequency (from several times per week up to several times per month) was noted in 69,2% of patients. None of those receiving immunosuppressive therapy had a transformation AF to the chronic form. Aggravations of arrhythmia due to an infection or a cancelling of therapy are noted at 47%; two patients required RFA. Conclusions: By means of EMB at 88,2% of patients it is revealed the immune‐inflammatory nature of «idiopathic» arrhythmias (AF), the effect from specific therapy is received. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remain some of the most important public health concerns worldwide. For the past 50 years, the recommendation in the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines has been that defibrillation is the only option for shockable cardiac arrest. There is growing evidence to demonstrate that mitochondria play a vital role in the outcome of postresuscitation cardiac function. Although targeting mitochondria to improve resuscitation outcome following cardiac arrest has been proposed for many years, understanding concerning the changes in mitochondria during cardiac arrest, especially in the case of VF, is still limited. In addition, despite new research initiatives and improved medical technology, the overall survival rates of patients with SCA still remain the same. Understanding cardiac mitochondrial alterations during fatal arrhythmias may help to enable the formulation of strategies to improve the outcomes of resuscitation. The attenuation of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction during VF through pharmacological intervention as well as ischaemic postconditioning could also be a promising target for intervention and inform a new paradigm of treatments. In this review, the existing evidence available from in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies regarding the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction during VF is comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition, the effects of interventions targeting cardiac mitochondria during fatal ventricular arrhythmias are presented. Since there are no clinical reports from studies targeting mitochondria to improve resuscitation outcome available, this review will provide important information to encourage further investigations in a clinical setting.

AB  - • Missed injuries (MIs) are identified during hospitalization after initial and secondary surveys. • As previously reported, MIs affect patient outcomes, including mortality, morbidity, quality of life and length of hospital stay. • Factors associated with MIs were evaluated in patients admitted to a Level I trauma centre between 2019 and 2023. • Multiple trauma and night-time arrival (8 PM to 8 AM) at the trauma resuscitation unit were identified as independent risk factors for MI. • Optimized resource allocation during night-time shifts is critical for reducing MI rates. In trauma care, missed injuries (MIs), defined as injuries identified during clinical reassessment involving physical examination and additional diagnostic tests, such as radiological imaging, initial and secondary surveys (these surveys are conducted according to the Advanced Trauma Life Support [ATLS] guidelines), significantly impact patient outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. This study aimed to identify factors contributing to MIs to establish strategies for improving MI detection and care outcomes in patients from a trauma centre. This retrospective year-matched case-control study included 288 patients with trauma (144 with MIs, 144 without) admitted to a Level I trauma centre in Seoul, Korea, from 2019 to 2023. Randomly selected controls were selected using the year-match technique for temporal balance. To adjust for potential confounding, propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbour, calliper = 0.1) was performed separately to evaluate the independent effects of night-time presentation and polytrauma. The conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Patients in the MI group had significantly longer intensive care unit and hospital stays. No significant differences were found in age, sex, GCS, or ISS between groups. Falls were the most common injury mechanism in both groups. Propensity score–matched logistic regression revealed that both night-time presentation (adjusted OR: 1.916; 95 % CI: 1.157–3.174; p = 0.012) and polytrauma (adjusted OR: 2.210; 95 % CI: 1.023–4.774; p = 0.044) were independently associated with missed injuries. Injuries were more likely to be missed in patients presenting at night or with polytrauma, with extremity injuries being the most common. These findings highlight the need to reinforce trauma team staffing, particularly during the night-time for timely evaluation and reduced MI risk. System-level strategies that improve personnel availability and promote comprehensive evaluation may enhance trauma care delivery and outcomes. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - A 65‐year‐old gentleman underwent dual chamber pacemaker implantation (DDDR, St Jude Medical) 7 years back for infra‐hisian complete heart block. He was completely asymptomatic and came for his annual routine check‐up. After undergoing ECG with and without magnet, he was prepared for device evaluation. After placing the programmer wand over the chest as soon as the ";interrogate" button on the programmer screen was pressed, the patient immediately experienced pre‐syncope but recovered instantly as the wand was promptly withdrawn. After taking him to the casualty room with all resuscitation measures in hand, a repeat attempt of interrogation was made after connecting ECG, which revealed reproducible loss of capture (LOC), exclusively during wand placement. A differential diagnosis of lead failure, battery depletion, or wand related issues were considered. However, serial ECGs recorded without wand raised the possibility of AutoCapture malfunction. With all precautions, the device was programmed to fixed ventricular output mode after which interrogation could be performed safely. There was a remaining battery longevity of 2 years with acceptable lead parameters and stable threshold. He continues to be asymptomatic at 10 months of follow up. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - ANTIARRHYTHMICS O001 EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF NEW CLASS III ANTIARRHYTHMIC AGENT NIFERIDILE IN PHARMACOLOGICAL CONVERSION OF PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND FLUTTER Yuricheva Y; Maykov E; Sokolov S; Golitsyn S; Mironov N; Beloshapko G; Yushmanova A; Rosenshtraukh L; Chazov E Russian Research Cardiology Centre The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of i.v. administered new class III antiarrhythmic agent niferidile in doses up to 30 mkg/kg in conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter (AFL) to sinus rhythm. 50 patients (33 male) without structural heart diseases, age 55 ± 12 years, with arrhythmia lasting 4,4 ± 4,2 months (2 weeks‐ 24 months) were included. Niferidile was administered as 3 bolus injections (10 mkg/kg each) performed with the 15‐min interval. Conversion to sinus rhythm within 24 hours was achieved in 44 of the 50 patients: success rate of niferidile in dose of 10 mkg/kg was 54%, in dose of 20 mkg/ kg – 70%, and in dose of 30 mkg/ kg reached 88%. Niferidile was effective in all 11 patients with AFL and in 33 of 39 patients (85%) with AF. None of patients developed proarrhythmic effects such as «torsade de pointes». Conclusion: i.v. niferidile in doses up to 30 mkg/kg seems to be very effective (up to 88%) and safe for sinus rhythm restoration in patients with persistent AF and AFL. O002 ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC AND ANTIARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS OF NEW CLASS III AGENT NIFERIDILE IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS Mironov NYu; Golitsyn SP; Sokolov SF; Yuricheva YuA; Maikov EB; Shlevkov NB; Rosetstraukh LV; Chazov EI Russian cardiology research complex Background: According to preclinical studies Niferidile (Nf) is a novel potassium channel blocker that inhibits transient outward and delayed rectifier currents and increases effective refractory periods (ERP) more in atria, less in ventricles. High affinity of Nf to atrial myocardium predispose to high efficacy in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias and to low risk of ventricular arrhythmogenic action. Objectives: To evaluate electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects of Nf in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Materials and Methods: Effects of Nf (20micrograms/kg intravenously) were studied in 22 patients (14 males) with PSVT (11 orthodromic tachycardia in WPW syndrome, 8 atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, 3 orthodromic tachycardia due to concealed bypass tract) during endocardial electrophysiological study (EPS). Termination of PSVT by Nf could be investigated in 16 patients and prevention of reinduction of PSVT by this drug – in 19 patients. Results: Nf terminated PSVT in 81.25% and prevented reinduction of PSVT in 75.95% of patients. Nf increased the ERP of right atrium (by 22.61%, p < 0.001), left atrium (by 21.55%, p < 0.001), right ventricle (by 14.02%, p < 0.05) and accessory pathways (anterogradely by 30.16%, p < 0.001; retrogradely by 33.6%, p < 0.001). Nf did not alter sinus node recovery time and atrioventricular conduction. Nf prolonged QT (by 21.3%, p < 0.01) and QTc (by 16.01%, p < 0.05) intervals without the evidence of proarrhythmic effect. Conclusions: Prolongation of ERP in cardiac tissues (mostly in atrials) is the main electrophysiologic effect of Nf. New drug demonstrated high antiarrhythmic efficacy and good safety profile in patients with PSVT. O003 PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH INAPPROPRIATE SINUS NODE TACHYCARDIA: BETA‐BLOCKER OR IF‐CHANNEL INHIBITOR? Borbola J; Abraham P; Foldesi Cs; Kardos A Hungarian Institute of Cardiology Inappropriate sinus‐node tachycardia (IST) is a rare disease defined as increased heart rate at rest, and/or inadequate response to physical or emotional stress. In the last years 25 patients (23 women, 2 men, age: 18–57 (33) years) were treated with IST due to palpitations. Patients had no structural heart disease (LVEF: 65 ± 2%), TSH values were within normal limits, but resting heart rate were repeatedly high: 106 ± 3/min. The results of Holter recording (expressed as minimal‐maximal and average heart rate/min) without medication showed high heart rate values: 58 ± 2 – 163 ± 3 – (96 ± 2)/min. The bicycle ergometry showed an average loading capacity of 120 ± 5 W (heart rate: control (C): 104 ± 4/min, top (T): 170 ± 6/min. The aim of the study was to compare the beta‐blocker and ivabradine treatment in IST patients. The beta‐blocker treatment (bisoprolol 5 mg/day) improved the high sinus node frequency spectrum both during Holter monitoring (54 ± 2 – 135 ± 4 – 81 ± 2/min, p < 0.0001) and during ergometry (120 ± 8 W; C: 86 ± 3; T: 145 ± 4/min; p < 0.05). The ivabradine therapy decreased the heart rate significantly and dose‐dependently compared to the control values: ivabradine 5 mg b.i.d: 50 ± 2 – 131 ± 5 – 76 ± 2/min (p < 0.0001), ivabradine: (7.5 mg b.i.d.): 48 ± 1 – 130 ± 6 – 72 ± 2/min; p < 0.0001), and decreased the heart rate frequency during ergometry: ivabradine (2×5 mg/day: C: 83 ± 3; T: 137 ± 4/min (p < 0.05)), (2×7.5 mg/day: C: 77 ± 4; T: 137 ± 8/min (p < 0.05)). There was no change in the loading capacity. The ivabradine treatment was well tolerated, there was no sinus bradycardiac episode leading to treatment discontinuation. On the other hand, several side effects were noticed during beta‐blocker therapy. Based on our clinical experiences, IST can be treated with the sinoatrial node modulator drug ivabradine successfully and safely. The ivabradine treatment might be considered as an alternative to the ablation of the sinoatrial node with the inherent risk of pacemaker implantation. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION O004 ABLATION OF PAROXYSMAL AND PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: 1‐YEAR FOLLOW‐UP THROUGH IMPLANTABLE ECG RECORDER Romanov A; Pokushalov E; Corbucci G; Shabanov V; Elesin D; Stenin I; Losik D State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology Introduction: The aim of this prospective observational study was to identify Responders to ablation through continuous subcutaneous monitoring for 1 year after ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) or persistent AF (PersAF). Method: Patients with symptomatic drug refractory AF were enrolled. Real‐time three‐dimensional (3D) left atrium maps were reconstructed by using a nonfluoroscopic navigation system (CARTO, Biosense‐Webster, USA). The ipsilateral left and right pulmonary veins (PVs) were encircled in 1 lesion line by circumferential PV isolation. All patients were implanted with Reveal XT (Medtronic Inc.) for continuous AF monitoring and data collected every month during the 12‐month follow‐up. Results: We enrolled 129 patients (56 ± 9 years, 102 males), all of whom were followed‐up for 12 months after the last ablation procedure: 58 (45%) had a history of PersAF. After only 1 ablation procedure, 76 (59%) of the 129 patients were AF‐free at 12‐month: 48 out of 71 (68%) in the PAF group and 28 out of 58 (48%) in the PersAF group. After 1 or more ablation procedures, 94 (73%) of the 129 patients were AF‐free 12 months after the last procedure: 57 out of 71 (80%) in the PAF group and 37 out of 58 (64%) in the PersAF group. Conclusion: Ablation is highly effective in treating AF, as assessed through detailed 1‐year continuous monitoring: success rate is higher in PAF than in PersAF patients. The use of subcutaneous monitors is a valuable means of identifying responders and nonresponders, and can potentially guide antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic therapies. O005 FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN ADVANCED HEART FAILURE AFTER MITRAL SURGERY IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IS RELATED TO LONG TERM MANTAINANCE OF SINUS RHYTHM Rostagno C; Blanzola C; Sclafani G; Montesi GF; Braconi L; Stefano PL; Cardiologia Generale1, §Cardiochirurgia – AOU Careggi – Firenze Objective: Atrial fibrillation is associated with a higher mortality in patients with advanced heart failure, Persistence of AF after mitral valve (MV) surgery is associated with poorer hemodynamic improvement in comparison to resumption of sinus rhythm (SR). RF‐maze associated with MV surgery is associated with a 60–70% long term persistence of SR. The aim of this prospective investigation was to evaluate the relation between persistence of SR and change of functional status in patients in patients with advanced NYHA class. Methods: 301 consecutive patients were treated by RF‐maze with Medtronic CardioBlate® system associated with MV surgery between November 2001 and December 2007 and were followed up for an average period of 1450 days. 234 /301 were in advanced NYHA functional class (III‐IV). Clinical examination, ECG and echocardiogram were evaluated at baseline and during follow‐up (3 to 96 months). Results: At an average follow‐up of 1450 days, 180/234 (77%) patients in preoperative NHYA class III‐IV were alive. One hundred and twenty were in SR, while 60 remained in stable AF. In the two groups age was similar (mean 64.7 years in SR, 66.7 in AF) as mean AF duration (36 vs 39 months). Baseline LA diameter, left and right atrium area were greater in patients in whom AF persisted in comparison to those in SR. These last patients showed a more relevant remodelling of atrial chambers after surgery. Baseline mean NYHA class was 2.96 in SR and 3.13 in AF patients. At follow‐up a significant functional improvement was found in SR patients (average NYHA class 1.31 vs 2.33, p < 0.003), associated with a significant decrease of calculated systolic pulmonary pressure. Conclusions: persistence of SR after AF ablation is associated with a significant functional improvement in comparison to patients who remain in AF. Persistent pulmonary hypertension after surgery may limit clinical improvement and contribute to maintenance of AF. O006 TRANSSEPTAL ACCESS AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION GUIDED BY INTRACARDIAC ECHO IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL SEPTAL CLOSURE DEVICES Santangeli P; Di Biase L; Burkhardt JD; Horton R; Sanchez J; Lakkireddy D; Bai R; Beheiry S; Hongo R; Natale A Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute – St. David's Medical Center, Austin, TX Background: Percutaneous positioning of closure devices is a well‐established treatment of atrial septal defects (ASD). These patients are at increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF), and treatment by catheter ablation is underutilized due to the perceived difficulty of obtaining transseptal access in the presence of the closure device. We report the acute and long‐term results of radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF in patients with ASD closure devices. Methods: Thirty‐nine patients (age 54 ± 6 years, 72% males) with drug‐refractory AF (33% paroxysmal, 51% persistent, 16% long‐standing persistent) and ASD closure devices (82% Amplatzer®, 18% Cardioseal®) underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation. A double transseptal access guided by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was obtained in all patients. Results: In 35/39 (90%) patients the transseptal access was obtained in a portion of the native septum, while in 4/39 (10%) a direct access through the device was required. The latter group had a significantly longer time for achieving the double transseptal access (73.6 ± 1.1 min vs. 4.3 ± 0.4 min, p < 0.001), longer fluoroscopy time (122 ± 5 min vs. 80 ± 8 min, p < 0.001), and total procedure time (4.1 ± 0.2 hours vs. 3.1 ± 0.3 hours, p < 0.001). At a follow‐up of 14 ± 4 months the overall success rate was 77% (85% in paroxysmal AF, 73% in non‐paroxysmal AF). Transthoracic contrast‐enhanced echocardiography with the Valsalva maneuver, performed between 3 and 6 months after the procedure, failed to detect shunt in all patients. Conclusions: Radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF is feasible, safe and effective in patients with ASD closure devices. Transseptal access can be obtained in portions of the native septum in the majority of the cases. Direct transseptal puncture of the device is feasible and safe, but it requires longer time for each transseptal access. O007 IMPACT OF RADIO‐FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS ON ACUTE PULMONARY VEIN RECONNECTION AND CLINICAL OUTCOME AFTER PVAC ABLATION De Greef Y; Tavernier R; Schwagten B; De Keulenaer G; Stockman D; Duytschaever M Department of Cardiology, Antwerp Cardiovascular Institute Middelheim, Belgium Aim: To study the impact of radio‐frequency (RF) characteristics on acute pulmonary vein reconnection (PVR) and outcome after PVAC ablation. A strategy of PV isolation with additional ablation of PVR (PVI + PVR) was compared to PVI‐only. Methods: Eighty patients underwent PVAC‐ablation: in 40 patients, PVI‐only was performed; in another 40 patients adenosine and 1‐hour waiting time were used to unmask and ablate PVR (PVI+PVR) after baseline PVI. Freedom of AF was compared at 12months. RF‐characteristics of PVAC applications needed for baseline PVI were assessed. Results: There was no difference in clinical characteristics or baseline RF‐profile between the 2 groups. In the PVI+PVR group, PVR was observed and ablated in 38 out of 160 veins (24%). Freedom of AF after PVI+PVR was higher compared to PVI‐only (85% vs 65%, p < 0,05). Within the PVI group, when comparing patients with and without AF recurrence, percentage of PVAC applications with high T° but low power (>48°, <3W) was higher (28 ± 18% vs 11 ± 11%, p < 0,0001). When comparing PVs with and without PVR, the percentage of PVAC applications with high T° but low power was also higher (27 ± 13% vs 13 ± 15%, p < 0,0001). Conclusions: After PVAC‐guided PVI, 24% of PVs exhibit acute PVR. Additional ablation of PVR is associated with improved clinical outcome. Acute PVR and recurrence of AF are characterised by a prior PVAC ablation with a considerable number of applications with high temperature but low power. If PVI is obtained with low power PVAC applications, a consistent use of adenosine and waiting time is required. O008 THE ROOF LINE DOES NOT INFLUENCE THE 12‐MONTH SUCCESS OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL ABLATION OF THE PULMONARY VEINS: RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY. Arbelo E; Guiú E; Andreu D; Borras R; Berruezo A; Tolosana JM; Brugada J; Mont L Hospital Universitari Clínic, Thorax Institute, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: The isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is often associated to linear radiofrequency lesions within the left atrium (LA) in an effort to improve results. The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of the roof line in the mid‐term success of AF ablation. Methods: We prospectively included patients (p) undergoing catheter ablation for AF. The PV isolation was performed by continuous circular lesions around ipsilateral PV, checking for conduction block with a circular multipolar catheter within the veins. Subsequently, p were randomized to no further ablation (CPVA‐NoRL) versus an additional linear ablation at the roof of the LA (CPVA‐RL) between the superior aspect of the circular lesions at the left and right PV). Follow‐up was performed at 1, 3, 6 months after the procedure and every 6 months thereafter. After a 3 month blanking period, recurrence was defined as the occurrence of any arrhythmia of ≥30 seconds. Results: 140 patients (55 ± 11 years, 69% male, 35% hypertension, LA diametre 42 ± 6 mm, LVEF 62 ± 8%, 20% structural cardiomyopathy) undergoing AF ablation, were randomized. No significant differences were observed between the CPVA‐NoRL vs. CPVA‐RL groups in terms of LA diametre, presence of hypertension, structural cardiomyopathy nor any other arrhythmia predictor. After a first procedure of AF ablation, there was no significant difference in the arrhythmia‐free survival curve between the two groups (72% in CPVA‐RL vs. 78% in CPVA‐NoRL at 12‐months, log‐rank p = 0,29). The incidence of LA macroreentrant tachycardias after a first procedure was 4,8% in the CPVA‐RL group versus a 5,5% in the CPVA‐NoRL one. Conclusion: The left atrial roof line does not improve mid‐term results of the isolation of the pulmonary veins for the ablation of atrial fibrillation. O009 COMPLEXITY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IN CHINESE IN ROUTINE DAILY PRACTICE: INSIGHTS FROM THE REALISEAF‐TAIWAN REGISTRY Chiang CE; Wang KL; Naditch‐Brule L; O'Neill J; Steg PG; RealiseAF registry General Clinical Research Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan Purpose: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have multiple co‐morbidities and high cardiovascular risk. Most studies were carried out in Western countries, and there is a paucity of data from Chinese patients. The aim of this analysis was to describe clinical characteristics, risk factors, co‐morbidities, and management strategies in Taiwanese patients in the RealiseAF registry. Methods: RealiseAF was a cross‐sectional survey of 10,523 patients from 831 sites in 26 countries on 4 continents, with at least one AF episode documented by standard electrocardiogram or by Holter monitoring in the last 12 months. Participating physicians were randomly selected in 2009 from lists of office‐/hospital‐based cardiologists and internists. Results: Among 742 patients in Taiwan who were eligible for analysis, the mean (SD) age was 70.2 (11.8) years. More men (59.8%) than women were enrolled. Permanent AF was most common (51.7%), followed by paroxysmal (33.3%) and persistent (11.1%) AF. Cardiovascular risk factors and co‐morbidities were very common: 72.9% had hypertension, 27.0% had diabetes, 40.7% had heart failure, 34.5% had coronary artery disease, 21.9% had cerebrovascular disease, and 38.8% had valvular heart disease. A rate‐control strategy (67.8%) was more frequently undertaken than rhythm‐control (24.5%). The majority of patients (85.2%) received at least one anti‐arrhythmic drug, but 81.5% of patients had an EHRA AF classification ≥2. The mean (SD) CHADS2 score was 2.2 (1.4), and 65.1% had a CHADS2 score ≥2. However, only 31.8% of patients were receiving an oral anti‐coagulant. Conclusions: AF patients in daily practice in Taiwan had multiple risk factors and co‐morbidities, similar to those in Western countries. Patients were highly symptomatic despite the widespread use of anti‐arrhythmic drugs. The risk of stroke was generally high, but the use of anti‐coagulants was extremely inadequate. There is an apparent unmet need in AF treatment in Chinese patients. O010 IMPACT OF RADIOFREQUENCY CATHETER PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION (PVI) ON TOTAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF) BURDEN IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Urban L; Hlivak P; De Melis M; Garutti C; Corbucci G; Hatala R National Cardiovascular Institute, Slovak Medical University, Bratislava, Slovakia Background: Evaluation of success of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in AF patients (pts) is largely based on symptoms reduction / abolition and on intermittent ECG recordings. Evaluation of the occurrence of AF by means of continuous ECG monitoring was rarely used until now. Aim: To quantify the total AF burden (AF%) in pts undergoing catheter PVI in the pre‐ and post‐ablation period. AF% was defined as the percentage of the total monitoring time during which the patient was in AF. To this aim, continuous ECG monitoring was performed by means of implantable loop recorder (ILR, Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc., USA) in pts undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF. Patients and Methods: 52 pts (56 ± 9 years, 79% males) were prospectively enrolled in this study. All patients had the ILR implanted in stable sinus rhythm before RFCA (3 ± 2 months) and were followed‐up for 9 months after RFCA. The initial 3 months were blanked and were not comprised in the analysis. All pts had paroxysmal AF for a mean of 6.4 ± 4.8 years, 47% of them had a history of >1 episode of persistent AF prior to ILR implantation, mean left atrial diameter was 44 ± 4 mm, LVEF% was 59 ± 6%. Their mean CHADS2 score was 1 ± 0.7. RFCA comprised point‐by‐point electroanatomically guided PVI only in 31 pts (60%), linear lesions were added in 21 (41%). Results: 1The median pre‐ versus post‐RFCA AF% was 19.5% and 0.4%, respectively (p < 0.00001)2The maximum daily AF burden decreased from 21 ± 6 h to 7 ± 8 h (p < 0.0001)3Post RFCA, 90% of pts did not have episodes lasting >24h. Conclusions: This pilot study on the role of continuous ecg monitoring by ILR in assessing RFCA outcome demonstrates a dramatic reduction in paroxysmal AF burden and episode duration after PVI based RFCA. Pre and post‐RFCA ecg data derived from ILR allow for comprehensive AF characterization which is important for quantifying RFCA success and for further clinical arrhythmia management. O011 INDUCIBILITY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION DOES NOT INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME AFTER PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION Arbelo E; Guiú E; Andreu D; Borras R; Berruezo A; Tolosana JM; Brugada J; Mont L Hospital Universitari Clínic, Thorax Institute, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Some conflicting results of the efficacy of the inducibility test used in the catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of inducibility in the outcome of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods: In this prospective study, 114 consecutive patients (p) undergoing ablation of atrial fibrillation were included. The ablation set included antral encircling of the pulmonary veins (PV) in all p (checking for conduction block with a multipolar circular catheter placed within the veins), with additional lines at the LA roof in 55 p and the mitral isthmus line in 8 p. At the end of the procedure, inducibility was evaluated with trains of 10 impulses with an initial cycle length of 350 ms, reduced by 10 ms until 250 ms or until 1:1 atrial capture was lost. AF was considered inducible when sustained for at least 30 seconds. Patients were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months after the procedure and every 6 months thereafter. Results: 130 patients (55 ± 11 years, 74% male, 40% hypertension, LA diametre 42 ± 5 mm, LVEF 60 ± 10%, 16% structural cardiomyopathy) undergoing AF ablation (99 p Paroxysmal AF, 31 p Persistent AF in sinus rhythm during the procedure) were evaluated. AF was inducible in 25 p (22%) after antral PV isolation. No significant differences were observed between the inducible vs. non‐inducible groups in terms of LA diametre, presence of hypertension, structural cardiomyopathy nor any other arrhythmia predictor. After a first procedure of AF ablation, there was no significant difference in the arrhythmia‐free survival curve between the two groups (68% vs 86% at 12‐months, p = 0,584) (figure). Conclusion: The absence of inducibility of arrhythmias after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation does not predict a better mid‐term result after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. O012 THE ABLATION OF COMPLEX FRAGMENTED ATRIAL ELECTROGRAMS DOES NOT INFLUENCE 12‐MONTH SUCCESS OF PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION FOR THE ABLATION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY Arbelo E; Guiú E; Andreu D; Borras R; Berruezo A; Tolosana JM; Brugada J; Mont L Hospital Universitari Clínic, Thorax Institute, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: The ablation of continuous and fragmented potentials has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy to the isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV) in an effort to improve results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the ablation of fragmented potentials in the ablation of persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: We prospectively included patients (p) undergoing catheter ablation for persistent / permanent AF. The PV isolation was performed by continuous circular lesions around ipsilateral PV, checking for conduction block with a circular multipolar catheter within the veins. Subsequently, p were randomized to no further ablation (CPVA‐NoF) versus additional ablation of fragmented potentials (CPVA‐F). These fragmented potentials were defined as any continuous and fractionated activity of low voltage, sustained over >10 seconds over time. Follow‐up was performed at 1, 3, 6 months after the procedure and every 6 months thereafter. After a 3 month blanking period, recurrence was defined as the occurrence of any arrhythmia of ≥30 seconds. Results: 110 patients (53 ± 10 years, 81% male, 36% hypertension, LA diametre 45 ± 6 mm, LVEF 54 ± 12%, 26% structural cardiomyopathy) undergoing AF ablation, were randomized (82% persistent AF, 18% permanent AF). No significant differences were observed between the CPVA‐NoF vs. CPVA‐F groups in terms of LA diametre, presence of hypertension, structural cardiomyopathy nor any other arrhythmia predictor. After a first procedure of AF ablation, there was no significant difference in the arrhythmia‐free survival curve between the two groups (58% en CPVA‐F vs. 65% en CPVA‐NoF at 12‐months, log‐rank p = 0,434). Conclusion: The ablation of complex fragmented atrial electrograms in addition to PV isolation does not improve the mid‐term results of pulmonary vein isolation for the ablation of persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation. O013 SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE OF CATHETER ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION USING MULTI‐ELECTRODE MAPPING AND ABLATION CATHETERS Zeb M; Scott A Paul; Yue A; Roberts P; Morgan J Southampton University Hospital Purpose: Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) is an established therapy for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Many techniques have been reported to achieve RFA. We report a single center experience of RFA using three multielectrode catheters. Method: We collected data of the patients who had radiofrequency ablation for AF using custom designed multielectrode mapping and ablation catheters between May 2007 and November 2009 at this center. Results: 105 pts aged 56 ± 9.6 yrs underwent radiofrequency ablation using three multielectrode catheters. Eighty seven patients were new and 18 patients had redo AF ablation using the multielectrode mapping and ablation catheters. In the new patients the mean duration of procedure was 141 + 38 minutes and fluoroscopy time was 38 + 14 minutes. The mean duration of follow up was 15.8 + 6.4 months. Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 75 (86%) patients, 48 (55%) patients remained in sinus rhythm (SR) after first procedure while 7 (8%) had multiple procedures and remained in SR without Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). Fourteen (16%) patients required AADs following single procedure and one (1.1%) patient after multiple procedures to remain in sinus rhythm. Seven (8%) patients had reduced burden of AF. No improvement occurred in 12 (13.7%) patients. In the 18 redo patients, 15 (83.3%) patients had symptoms improvement. Four (22.2%) patients remained in SR after single procedure and 4 (22.2%) patients required multiple procedures to remain in sinus rhythm without AADs. one (5.5%) patient remained in sinus rhythm on AADs following single procedure one (5.5%) patient remained in sinus rhythm on AADs following multiple procedures. Five (27%) patients had reduced burden of AF and 3 (16.6%) patients had no improvement. Conclusion: PVI using multielectrode mapping and ablation catheters is an effective treatment of paroxysmal and persistent AF with a complication rate equivalent to published data. O014 CHARACTERIZATION OF FRACTIONATED ATRIAL ELECTROGRAMS CRITICAL FOR MAINTENANCE OF AF: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ABLATION STRATEGIES (THE CFAE AF TRIAL) Hunter RJ; Diab I; Tayebjee M; Richmond L; Sporton S; Earley M; Schilling RJ Cardiology Research Department, St Bartholomew's Hospital Introduction: Whether ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) modifies AF by eliminating drivers or atrial de‐bulking remains unknown. This randomised study aimed to determine the effect of ablating different CFAE morphologies compared to normal electrograms (i.e. de‐bulking normal tissue) on the cycle length of persistent AF (AFCL). Methods: After pulmonary vein isolation CFAE were targeted until termination of AF or abolition of CFAE prior to DC cardioversion. 10s electrograms were classified according to a validated scale, with Grade 1 being most fractionated and grade 5 normal. Patients were randomised to have CFAE grades eliminated sequentially, from grade 1 to 5 (group 1) or grade 5 to 1 (group 2). Because grade 5 electrograms were considered normal, only 5 were ablated. An increase in AFCL (mean of left and right atrial appendage) ≥ 5 ms was regarded as significant. Results: 968 CFAE were targeted in 20 patients. CFAE grade determined by rapid visual inspection agreed with that at off‐line manual measurement in 93% (k= 0.91). AFCL increased after targeting 51 ± 35% of grade 1 CFAE, 30 ± 15% grade 2, 12 ± 5% grade 3, 33 ± 12% grade 4, and 8 ± 15% grade 5 CFAE (p < 0.01 for grades 1, 2, and 4 versus 5, 3 versus 5 not significant). Binary logistic regression confirmed the impact of CFAE grade, but showed no effect of electrogram amplitude, location in the left or right atrium, or the order in which CFAE were targeted on the proportion of lesions causing AFCL prolongation. Elimination of the most fractionated electrograms first reduced the number of grade 3 and 4 CFAE encountered (group 1 versus group 2 both p < 0.01), translating to fewer CFAE targeted per patient in group 1 compared to group 2 (37 ± 14 and 58 ± 18 respectively; p = 0.015). Conclusion: Targeting CFAE is not simply atrial de‐bulking. Ablating certain grades of CFAE increases AFCL, suggesting they are more important in maintaining AF. O015 COMPARISON OF LEFT MITRAL AND INFERIO‐SEPTAL ISTHMUS ABLATION FOR CURE POSTABLATIVE PERIMITRAL FLUTTER Ardashev AV; Zhelyakov EG; Konev AV; Rybachenko AV; Belenkov YuN* 83 Clinical Hospital of FMBA, * Lomonosov State University, Moscow, Russia Aim: to compare mitral isthmus vs. inferio‐septal isthmus ablation to cure perimitral atypical atrial flutter (PAAF) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Methods: Study consisted of 22 pts (8 women, 54.3 ± 13.6 years of age) with PAAF who underwent RFA because of paroxysmal (4 pts), persistent (11 pts) and permanent (7 pts) AFib. All studied pts underwent redo because of drug‐refractory PAAF in the period of 6 ± 3 months after primary RFA. Activation mapping and entrainment technique demonstrated PAAF in all studied pts. Mitral isthmus RF‐lesions in the left atrium were a first step (endocardial approach to mitral isthmus). Then distal CS‐roof RFA was performed (epicardial approach to mitral isthmus). As a third step linear RFA of the inferio‐septal isthmus (from right inferior pulmonary vein ostium to mitral annulus) was performed (endocardial approach to inferioseptal isthmus). Additional RF‐applications delivered inside the proximal CS roof (epicardial approach to inferioseptal isthmus). Results: Left mitral isthmus endocardial RF‐pulses terminated AAF in 4 cases, increased CL of PAAF without changes of atrial hierarchy activation in 2 cases (from 200 to 310 ms), and transformed PAAF to AFib in 2 cases. Distal CS‐roof RF‐isolation terminated PAAF in 2 pts. Endocardial inferio‐septal isthmus ablation was associated with SR restoration in 2 cases and increasing of PAAF CL in 5 cases. RFA applied into the proximal CS terminated PAAF in 10 pts. Follow up was 26.7 ± 12.4 mos. Endocardial and epicardial mitral isthmus approach terminated perimitral PAAF in 6 pts (36%). RF‐ablation of endocardial and epicardial aspects of the inferioseptal isthmus restored SR in 12 pts (64%) (p < 0.05). There were neither AFib nor PAAF during follow up period. Conclusion: Endocardial and epicardial aspects of the inferio‐septal isthmus seem to be more critical comparing to mitral isthmus to cure PAAF after RFA of AFib. O016 TWO DIFFERENT ABLATION STRATEGIES IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED COMPARISON Romanov A; Pokushalov E; Shabanov V; Elesin D; Artemenko S; Stenin I; Yakubov A; Losik D State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare PVI isolation plus LL with PVI plus ablation of ganglionated plexi (GP) in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods: One hundred forty six consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF were randomly assigned to 2 different ablation schemes: PVI plus LL (n = 72) and PVI plus GP (n = 74). Primary end point was to assess the maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) after procedures. Anti‐arrhythmic drugs were discontinued within 2–4 weeks after ablation in both groups. PVI was successful in all targeted veins in both groups. Results: PVI plus GP – after single procedure at the 12‐month follow‐up, 51 of 74 patients (68.9%) were in SR without AAD. AF recurrence was the reason of a redo procedure in 11 patients, atypical atrial flutter in 2 patients, and typical atrial flutter in 3 patients. In the 2 patients with atypical atrial flutter, a reentry circuit involving the right PVs was the mechanism. Among the remaining 11 patients with AF recurrence a recovery of veno‐atrial conduction in at least 1 or more PVs was found in all the patients. With the addition of a second procedure, the overall success rate without AAD was 79.7% (59 of 74 patients). PVI plus LL – 38 of 72 patients (52.7%) were in SR without AAD (p = 0.006). Repeat ablation was performed for recurrent AF in 21 patients, and for atypical atrial flutter in 9 patients. The mechanism of the atypical atrial flutter was a conduction gap in the lesion line of the left isthmus in 7 cases and a conduction gap in the roof line in 2 patient. Among the 21 patients with AF recurrence, a recovery of veno‐atrial conduction in at least one or more PVs was found in all the patients. After second procedure, the overall success rate without AAD was 73.6% (53 of 72 patients; p = 0.03). Conclusions: PVI isolation plus GP is superior to the PVI plus LL strategy in maintaining SR without antiarrhythmic drugs after first and second procedures in paroxysmal AF. O017 PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION: A COMPARISON OF THE ABLATION PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES BETWEEN POINT BY POINT AND MULTIPOLAR CIRCULAR ABLATION CATHETER (PVAC) IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Lim SH; Lewis A; Affolter J; Broadhurst P Aberdeen Royal Infirmary Background: Catheter ablation is widely used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study is to compare the procedural outcomes between point by point ablation and multipolar circular ablation catheter (PVAC) for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with atrial fibrillation. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of adults undergoing PVI in a tertiary care center. Procedural outcomes were compared between PVAC and point to point ablation group using student's t‐test and the chi‐square as appropriate. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Outcomes: Among 85 patients (mean age 56years, 54men) undergoing PVI ablation, 57 patients had point to point ablation and 28 had PVAC ablation. NAVX geometry mapping of the left atrium was used in both ablations. Screening time (46 vs 66mins; p = 0.000), radiation dose from fluoroscopy (5553 vs 8282cGy.cm2; p = 0.010) and duration of procedure (3 vs 4 hours; p = 0.000) were significantly shorter in the PVAC group. There was also higher success of complete electrical isolation of targeted pulmonary veins using PVAC (93 vs 76%; p = 0.064). In addition, there was less additional ablations (roof lines and cavo tricuspid isthmus ablation) and pre procedural cardiac CT/MRI performed in patients undergoing PVAC ablation and this were statistically significant. Ablation duration, day 1 post ablation rhythm, procedure complications and days of admission were comparable between both groups. Conclusion: Patients undergoing PVI ablation using PVAC had higher success in electrically isolating the targeted pulmonary veins and lower screening time, procedure duration and radiation dose. The results suggest PVAC may prove to be a practical option to point by point ablation. O018 EFFECTS OF PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION ON THE CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Kriatselis C; Brala D; Nedios S; Gerds‐Li JH; Fleck E Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin Introduction: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is an effective procedure for symptomatic atrial fibrillation refractory to treatment. Following successful PVI, most patients experience an improvement in subjective symptoms. However, the effect on objective cardiopulmonary exertion parameters is not yet known. We studied the influence of PVI on these parameters, as tested by cardiopulmonary exercise testing with maximal exertion. Methods: Twenty‐eight patients (8 women, age 58 ± 11 years) with paroxysmal (n = 15) or persistent (n = 13) atrial fibrillation and indication for PVI were studied. Spiroergometric testing was performed before and 3 and 6 months after PVI (ergometer bicycling in semi‐supine position, stress increase of 10 Watts/min until symptom‐limited maximal exertion reached). Antiarrhythmic medication was terminated after 4 weeks in patients with paroxysmal and after 3 months in those with persistent atrial fibrillation. Cardiopulmonary parameters measured or calculated were: maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max, ml/min), functional capacity (FC,% VO2max/VO2 pred.) und anaerobic threshold (AT, calculated by the V‐slope method). Results: FC before PVI was 92 ± 16% (range 65–125%). Six months after PVI 24 patients had sinus rhythm. VO2max and FC were significantly increased in comparison with the baseline values (2114 ± 750 vs 1954 ± 635 ml/min, p: 0.021 and 101 ± 24 vs 93 ± 17%, p: 0.04). The AT was also significantly improved (1224 ± 330 vs 1080 ± 338%, p: 0.003). Summary: Following primarily successful isolation of the pulmonary veins the maximal oxygen uptake, functional capacity and anaerobic threshold of patients show a significant increase through a follow‐up period of six months. O019 EFFICACY, SAFETY, AND OUTCOME OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION IN THE ELDERLY Arbelo E; Guiú E; Andreu D; Borras R; Berruezo A; Tolosana JM; Brugada J; Mont L Hospital Universitari Clínic, Thorax Institute, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) has become a treatment option for patients with drug refractory AF. With improved safety, the therapy has been offered to older populations. However, the outcome of AF ablation in the elderly is not clear. The aim was to compare success rate, outcome, and complication rate of AF ablation in the elderly (>70 years old) versus the younger population. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 785 consecutive patients that had undergone a catheter ablation for drug‐refractory symptomatic AF from 2003 to 2011. Patients were divided into two groups: (Gr1) ≥70 years (n = 41) and (Gr2) <70 years (n = 744). AF ablation consisted of pulmonary vein antral isolation with or without additional linear lesions of complex fractionated electrogram ablation. Follow‐up was performed at 1, 3, 6 months after the procedure and every 6 months thereafter. After a 3 month blanking period, recurrence was defined as any arrhythmia of ≥30 seconds. Results: Baseline characteristics among the two groups only differed in gender (78% Gr1 vS 42% Gr2), presence of hypertension (40% Gr1 and 59% Gr2) and the duration of AF (57,5 ± 58,1 Gr1 and 59,1 ± 59,2 Gr2). No differences were observed in terms of LA diametre, structural cardiomyopathy, nor other arrhythmia predictor. After a follow‐up 14,5 ± 14,9 months, there was no difference in the arrhythmia‐free survival curve after a 1st procedure (60% G1 vs. 56% Gr 2 at 12‐months, log‐rank p = 0,66). The complication rate was similar (8,1% in group 1 versus 7,3% in Gr2). However, there were 2 strokes and 2 other cardioembolic events in the group ≥70 yo, and this was significantly different (1,5% group 1 versus 9,8% group 2,). There were no deaths. Conclusion: AF ablation is a safe and effective treatment for AF in the older patients. However, special care must be taken with the anticoagulation management, for there seems to be a higher risk of periprocedural thromboembolic events. O020 CATHETER ABLATION WITHOUT FLUOROSCOPY: A SINGLE INSTITUTION EXPERIENCE Clark JM; Smith GL; Lane J Akron Children's Hospital, Akron OH Introduction: Catheter ablation without the use of fluoroscopy is becoming more widely used. We review our experience over the last three years utilizing the Ensite system. Methods: Chart review was performed for all ablations either completed or attempted without fluoroscopy between January 2008 and May 2011. Information gathered included patient age, height, weight, tachycardia mechanism, ablation energy used, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, success or failure of procedure, and complications. For patients undergoing transseptal puncture, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used instead of fluoroscopy. Results: There were 224 procedures performed or attempted without fluoroscopy. In 221 procedures fluoroscopy was not used. Mean patient age was 14 years (range 6 months to 65 years). Mean weight was 57.2 kg (range 7.2 – 142kg). Mean procedure time was 142 minutes (range 42 – 402 minutes, median 127). The mechanisms of tachycardia were as follows: AVNRT in 80 patients; WPW in 80 patients; concealed accessory pathway in 46 patients; AET in 5 patients; VT in 4 patients; flutter in 2 patients; and 7 patients had more than one tachycardia mechanism. Radiofrequency energy was used in 123 procedures, cryoenergy in 99, and both in 2. Acute success was achieved in 219/224 (98%). There were no complications. Fluoroscopy was needed in three procedures. One patient with a left‐sided pathway was ablated under conscious sedation, and therefore could not undergo TEE. One patient required fluoroscopy due to technical problems with TEE. And one patient with flutter had a transvenous atrial pacing lead. Fluoroscopy was used to localize the tip of the pacing lead. Conclusion: Catheter ablation can be routinely performed without the use of fluoroscopy. Utilizing newer three‐dimensional mapping systems, fluoroscopy is rarely necessary. This has long‐term benefits to both patients and staff. O021 TRANSCRANIAL MEASUREMENT OF CEREBRAL MICROEMBOLIC SIGNALS DURING PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION: A COMPARISON OF TWO DIFFERENT ABLATION TECHNIQUES Nagy‐Baló E; Tint D; Beke I; Clemens M; Kovács R*; Csiba L*; Édes I; Csanádi Z Institution of Cardiology and Department of Neurology*, University of Debrecen, Hungary Backround: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) have been increasingly used to cure atrial fibrillation. Recently, concerns have been raised that subclinical brain damage may occur due to microembolisation during these procedures. We compared the occurrence of bubble formation seen on intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and microembolic signals (MES) detected by transcranial Doppler using different ablation techniques and anticoagulation strategies. Methods and Results: 26 procedures in 25 consecutive patients (age: 51 ± 13 years; female:male 5:20) were included in this prospective study. PVI was performed using cryoballoon and conventional anticoagulation protocol (ACT>250 sec) during 7 procedures (Group1), multipolar duty‐cycled radiofrequency catheter (PVAC) and conventional anticoagulation protocol in 12 procedures (Group 2) and PVAC with an aggressive anticoagulation regime (ACT>350 sec) during 7 procedures (Group 3). The total number of MES detected during the procedures were 1494 ± 1136 in group 1, 5631 ± 3317 in group 2 and 5419 ± 2064 in group 3 (p = 0,01). A significant difference was also demonstrated in the number of solid microemboli in the 3 groups (220 ± 97, 915 ± 240 and 963 ± 385, respectively, p = 0,01). MES were detected mostly during energy delivery in all 3 groups (425 ± 405, 30903 ± 3076 and 3619 ± 1636, respectively, p = 0,01). Strong correlation (r = 0.89) was found between the degree of bubble formation on ICE and the number of MES in all groups. Conclusion: Duty‐cycled RF ablation is associated with significantly more MES even when a more aggressive anticoagulation is applied. Most of MES are gaseous in nature and occur during energy delivery. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT O022 PREDICTORS OF CLINICAL EFFICACY OF "ABLATE AND PACE" THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Brignole M; Botto GL; Mont L; Oddone D; Iacopino S; De Marchi G; Campoli M; Sebastiani V; Vincenti A; Garcia Medina D; APAF Ospedali del Tigullio Aim: To evaluate the 2‐year clinical improvement after "Ablate and pace" therapy and to identify the variables able to influence its efficacy in patients with severely symptomatic permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and results: In the Ablate and Pace in Atrial Fibrillation (APAF) trial, 171 patients, in whom AV junction ablation had been successfully performed, were randomly assigned to right ventricle (RV) pacing or echo‐guided cardiac resynchronization (CRT) pacing and had valuable follow‐up data. During a median follow‐up of 20 months (interquartile range 11 – 24), 125 (73%) patients had clinical improvement after "Ablate and pace" therapy (Responders group); responders were 63% of RV paced patients and 83% of CRT paced patients (p = 0.003). Other 46 (27%) patients did not have clinical improvement (7%) or worsened (20%) (Non‐responders group). At univariate analysis, non‐responders were more likely to be males, to have lower systolic blood pressure, larger LV end‐systolic diameter and to have RV pacing. At multivariable Cox regression analysis, CRT mode and echo‐optimized CRT remained the only independent protective factors against non‐responsive conditions (HR = 0.24 [95% CI 0.10–0.58, p = 0.001 and 0.22 [95% CI 0.07–0.77, p = 0.018 respectively). When comparing freedom from non‐responsive conditions, there was a trend in favor of echo‐optimized CRT versus simultaneous biventricular pacing (p = 0.077). Conclusion: In patients affected by severely symptomatic permanent AF, clinical benefit from Ablate and Pace therapy was observed in 63% of RV pacing group and 83% of CRT pacing group. CRT pacing and echo‐optimized CRT were the only independent predictor of clinical benefit. O023 DOES THE LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE MORPHOLOGY CORRELATES WITH THE RISK OF STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION? RESULT FROM A MULTICENTER STUDY Di Biase L; Gaita F; Anselmino M; Horton R; Santangeli P; Salvetti I; Gilli S; Sanchez J; Burkhardt JD; Natale A Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David's Medical Center, Austin, Texas, USA Introduction: The left atrial appendage (LAA) represents one of the major cause of TIA/stroke in pts with atrial fibrillation (AF). We quantitatively studied various morphology of the LAA by computed tomography (CT) and by magnetic resonance (MRI) and correlated the LAA morphology with the history of stroke/TIA. Methods: 932 pts with drug refractory AF planning to undergo AF ablation. All pts underwent cardiac CT or MRI and care was taken to obtain LAA frames. All pts were screened for history of TIA/stroke. LAAs were categorized into different morphologies which included Chicken Wing, Windsock, Cauliflower and Cactus. Results: CT images of 499 patients and MRI images of 433 pts were analyzed (59 ± 10 yrs, 79% male, BMI 27 ± 4, EF 60 ± 7, 14% CHADS2 ≥2). The LAA was categorized into four morphologies: 278(30%) pts were classified as Cactus, 451(48%) as Chicken Wing, 179(19%) as Windsock and 24(3%) as Cauliflower. Out of the 932 pts, 73(8%) pts had prior history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The prevalence of pre‐procedure stroke/TIA in Cactus, Chicken Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower morphologies were 12%, 4%, 10%, and 18% respectively (p = 0.003). After controlling for CHADS2 score, gender, and AF types in a multivariable logistic model, Chicken Wing morphology was found to be more likely to remain stroke‐free (odds ratio 19, p = 0.043). In separate multivariate model we entered chicken wing as reference group and assessed the likelihood of stroke in other groups in relation to reference. Compared to chicken wing, Cactus had 4.08 times (p = 0.046), Windsock‐ 4.5 times (p = 0.038), and Cauliflower 8.0 times (p = 0.056) more likely to have an ischemic event. Conclusion: This study suggests that pts with chicken wing morphology are less likely to have an embolic event even after controlling for comorbidities. If confirmed, these results could have a relevant impact on the anticoagulation management of pts with an intermediate risk for stroke. O024 A GLOBAL COMPARISON OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS AT TIME OF ACUTE CARDIOVERSION: PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE RHYTHM‐AF STUDY Lip GYH; Crijns HJGM; Bash LD; for the RHYTHM‐AF Study Scientific Committee University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England Purpose: Explore type of antithrombotic therapy (ATT) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients (pts), and appropriateness at cardioversion (CV), in terms of stroke risk and AF duration. Methods: RHYTHM‐AF is a prospective observational study in 10 countries (8 in EU, Brazil, Australia). Pts considered for CV were enrolled from acute care settings between May 2010 and July 2011. Data collected at time of AF; descriptive statistics compared type of ATT administered at time of CV and discharge, related to both stroke risk ('high risk' defined by CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥ 2) and duration of AF (< or ≥ 48 hrs) of each patient. Pts with unknown AF duration were included in the group with AF ≥ 48 hrs. Results: Of 2381 pts who were cardioverted (35% via pharmacologic (PCV), 65% via direct current (DCV) cardioversion), 63% were at high risk of stroke and 24% presented with AF ≥ 48 hrs. Among all pts undergoing PCV and DCV, 64% (n = 540) and 74% (n = 1141), respectively, had either a high stroke risk or AF>48hrs. Among these high risk pts, 35% (n = 191), and 85% (n = 971) were on vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or heparin at time of PCV and DCV, respectively. At discharge, these rates had risen to 60% and 93%, respectively. Among all low stroke risk pts with a short AF duration undergoing PCV (n = 300) and DCV (n = 400), 14% and 71% were overtreated with VKA or heparin at the time of CV, respectively. At discharge, these rates even rose further to 27% and 79%, respectively. Conclusions: In the majority of high risk AF pts PCV is performed without appropriate ATT. PCV does not seem to trigger correct ATT although between conversion and discharge the numbers of appropriately treated PCV pts increased significantly. In contrast, DCV is most frequently performed under appropriate ATT. Overtreatment with ATT occurs mainly in pts undergoing DCV. To enhance pericardioversion stroke prevention, CV algorithms should focus less on type of conversion and more on stroke risk factors and AF duration. O025 AF AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TUBERCULOUS PERICARDITIS: SOUTH AFRICAN EXPERIENCE Syed FF; Ntsekhe M; Wiysonge C; Badri M; Oh JK; Mayosi B; IMPI Africa Cardiac Clinic, Univ. of Cape Town, S.Africa and Div. of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA Background: There is no study regarding the prevalence, correlates, and natural history of atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with tuberculous (TB) pericarditis to guide the management of affected patients. Methods: Consecutive patients presenting with TB pericardial effusion of at least 1 cm width anteriorly recruited between January 2006 and September 2008 for a study of HIV‐associated cardiomyopathy were reviewed. AF was diagnosed on 12‐lead electrocardiography taken at presentation and repeated at follow‐up intervals of 2 weeks, 2 months and 6 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with AF at presentation. No anti‐arrhythmic interventions were administered to patients with AF. Results: Eighty patients with TB pericardial effusion were enrolled. The median [IQR] age was 33 [28–43] years, 53 (66%) were male and 71% were HIV‐infected. The prevalence of AF at presentation was 25% (20/80). All underwent pericardiocentesis, with no change in numbers with AF. Anti‐tuberculosis chemotherapy was associated with a rapid resolution of AF, with 80% recovery of sinus rhythm at 2 weeks, 90% at 2 months, and 100% at 6 months. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (odds ratio [OR]= 10.395, 95% CI 2.504–43.157, p = 0.001) and raised N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) (OR per ng/L increase = 1.001, 95% CI 1.000–1.002, p = 0.003) were independently associated with AF. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of AF in survivors compared to those who died at 6 months of follow‐up, and no case of stroke was observed among the survivors. Conclusions: AF is common in patients with TB pericardial effusion, but resolves completely over six months of anti‐tuberculosis treatment without anti‐arrhythmic interventions. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction and raised NT‐proBNP are independently associated with AF in TB pericarditis. O026 AV NODE ELECTRIC BYPASS IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY SYMPTOMATIC PERMANENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: SINGLE CENTRE PROSPECTIVE STUDY De Filippo P; Ferrero P; Ferrari P; Brambilla R; Cantù F Electrophysiology and Cardiac Pacing Unit, Cardiovascular Department, OORR Bergamo, Italy Background: Ablate and pace provide optimal rate control in patient with refractory symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Main drawback of this strategy is life‐long nonphysiologic ventricular activation. An appealing solution is to set up a AV node electric bypass (AVNEB) combining pure His bundle stimulation with compact node ablation. We sought to investigate the feasibility and the long term clinical and technical outcome of this strategy. Methods: This intention‐to‐treat study enrolled patients with long lasting symptomatic atrial fibrillation refractory or not further amenable of rhythm control with heart rate not controlled. Preliminary workup included: echo, six minute walking test, quality of life assessment (SF 36). All patients underwent an attempt of AVNEB; if it failed, a conventional ablate and pace procedure was delivered. In patients undergoing AVNEB a second back up lead was implanted. Pre procedural assessment and device control were repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: 12 patients (67 ± 6 years) were enrolled: in 10/12 AVNEB was achieved, in 2/12 a conventional ablate and pace procedure was performed. Out of the 10 patients with AVNEB, we observed a transient loss of capture during RF application in 5/10 not impairing procedural success, a late loss of His capture in 2/10 and a recovery of AV conduction in 2 patients that required a redo AV node ablation. His capture threshold progressively increased over time (2,5 times at 1 year vs baseline). In all 12 patients, we observed a significant improvement of quality of life and 6 minute walking distance, while the trend in EF increase was not significant. Conclusions: Although AVNEB is an attractive therapeutic strategy, we observed important technical drawbacks that may limit its clinical routine applicability. The main challenge appears to be the capability of delivering a stable pure His pacing together with an efficacious ablation of the AV node. O027 DIASTOLIC FUNCTION IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR BOTH SUCCESSFUL AND FASTER PHARMACOLOGIC CONVERSION TO SINUS RATE IN PATIENTS WITH FIRST EPISODE OF NON‐VALVULAR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Nikas D; Theodorou S; Karanasios A; Antonopoulos E; Papazoglou G; Kyriazos I; Latsoudas S; Kefalas K; Antonoulas A Cardiology Department, Lamia General Hospital, Lamia, Greece Introduction: To evaluate patterns of diastolic dysfunction associated with successful pharmacological cardioversion (PCV) in patients with atrial fibrillation of recent onset (Afib). Methods: Prospective study included 164 patients [82 males (50.0%), mean age 67.6 ± 14.6] with first episode of Afib for PCV. NT‐proBNP at admission (aNT‐proBNP) and discharge (dNT‐proBNP), absolute and relative (%) NT‐proBNP difference (dfNT‐proBNP,%dfNT‐proBNP) and E/e' ratio were used as patterns of diastolic dysfunction. Patients were categorized in group A for successful PCV and Group B for unsuccessful PCV, within 72 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using t‐test for comparisons and linear regression analysis for correlations. Results: Patient in Group A had significantly lower values of E/e' ratio (mean 7.0 ± 3.4 for Group A and mean 8.6 ± 3.7, p = 0.04). There was no difference in aNT‐proBNP, dNT‐proBNP or dfNT‐proBNP between the two groups. Lower levels of aNT‐proBNP and the lower values for E/e' were significantly correlated with shorter days for PCV (r = 0.41, p < 0.03 and r = 0.44, p = 0.05, respectively) (Figures 1 and 2). Conclusions: Lower values of E/e' ratio in admission are associated with better rates and shorter time for PCV. Lower levels for aNT‐proBNP is associated with shorter time for PCV but no better rates of PCV. O028 SIX MONTH OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS ENROLLED IN A CONTEMPORARY MIDDLE EASTERN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION REGISTRY (GULF SAFE) Zubaid M; Rashed W; Alsheikh‐Ali AA; AlMahmeed W; Shehab A; Sulaiman K; Al‐Zakwani I; Al Qudaimi A; Asaad N; Amin H; Gulf SAFE Registry Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Kuwait Purpose: To study the clinical characteristics and six month outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in the Middle East. Methods: We used data from the Gulf Survey of Atrial Fibrillation Events (Gulf SAFE), a prospective multinational registry of consecutive AF patients presenting to emergency rooms (ER) of 23 hospitals in the Gulf region of the Middle East between October 2009 and June 2010. Results: We enrolled 2043 patients (age 57 ± 16, age ≥75 (14%), 48% female, 30% with diabetes, 53% with hypertension, 28% with history of heart failure, 13% with prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), 24% with history of significant valvular disease). Types of AF were: first attack 37%, paroxysmal 17%, persistent 10%, permanent 33% and not known 3%. Of patients with non‐valvular disease, 25% had CHADS2 score of 0, 27% had CHADS2 score of 1 and 48% had a CHADS2 score of 2 or more. AF was the primary reason for ER visit in 45% of patients, of whom 75% presented within 48 hours of symptom onset. Six month follow up was completed for 1772. Six month mortality was (7%). [3.2% for patients with primary reason for ER visit AF, 17% for patients with primary reason for ER visit other cardiac, 24.2% for patients with primary reason for ER visit other non‐cardiac]. At six month follow up the following outcomes were recorded: TIA in 21 patients (1.2%), stroke in 26 (1.5%), peripheral embolization in 2 (0.1%), any bleeding in 114 (6.4%), major bleeding in 21 (1.2%), admission for heart failure in 142 (8%) and admission for atrial fibrillation in 109 patients (6.2%). Conclusions: Middle Eastern patients with AF are relatively young with high risk profile. They have relatively low incidence of adverse outcomes at six months. O029 PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION RECURRENCE AFTER CARDIOVERSION Masar G; Ejup P; Blerim B; Dardan K; Xhevdet K UCC of Kosova Introduction: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm should be considered for all patients in atrial fibrillation (AF). Our aim was to determine the immediate and long‐term outcome of cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation, and to determine factors predicting AF recurrence after cardioversion. Materials and Methods: A prospective twenty‐years follow‐up study of 1220 patients with atrial fibrillation (coronary artery disease, 24.5%; arterial hypertension 65%; lone AF 10.5%) undergoing cardioversion between 1990 and 2010 was done. Transthoracic (98%) and transoesophageal (12%) echocardiograph examination were performed before rhythm–control cardioversion treatment algorithm strategy was involved. Results: Electrical cardioversion was successful in 94% of the patients. Female gender was associated with successful cardioversion (p = 0.02). Only 46% remained in sinus rhythm after the one‐year follow‐up. Patients with a structural myocardial disease were at a higher risk of recurrence of AF (54% of patients had one and 22%, more than one AF episode during one year follow‐up). Maintenance of sinus rhythm was associated with anti‐arrhythmic drug treatment (p = 0.033). Relapse of atrial fibrillation was associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.003). Complications occurred in 1.2% of the electrical cardioversions; of these, 0.4% were thromboembolic events. Discussion: Less than one half of the patients remained in sinus rhythm after the one year follow‐up despite the use of anti‐arrhythmic drugs and upstream therapies on AF. Electrical cardioversion is not without risk. Patients with a history of AF of >12 months, mitral valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, enlarged left atrium and a history of recurrence of AF were at a higher risk of recurrence of AF. Conclusion: Cardioversion should be considered primarily when symptoms of AF are unacceptable despite optimal frequency regulation or in patients with AF detected for the first time. O030 THE FIRST EPISODE OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF): PAROXYSMAL, PERSISTENT OR UNCERTAIN? Panizo JG; Perea J; Galán L; Jiménez S; Romero R; Ruiz M; Villanueva A; Hinojar R; Ruiz JG; Cosío FG Cardiology Service. Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Madrid. Spain. Background: The classification of AF in paroxysmal or persistent has advanced our understanding of the clinical course and improved treatment indications. However, at the time of the first episode AF can not be classified and the clinical course is uncertain. Objectives: To study clinical presentation and course of a first documented episode of AF in a public hospital serving a Spanish industrial town of 250,000 people. Methods: From January 2008 to December 2010 we registered all patients with a first episode of AF admitted to the emergency room (ER). We excluded patients with poor clinical tolerance or structural heart disease, as cardioversion (CV) is generally applied in these, altering the natural course. Patients were followed up 15 ± 4 days after discharge. Findings: 168 patients admitted for AF were discharged (50.6% men, age 63.9 ± 13.9 y). The symptoms were palpitations in 35.5%, dyspnea in 13%, chest pain in 7.1%, syncope/presyncope in 14.3%, other in 7.1%, and 23.1% were asymptomatic. In 27 CV was attempted with antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) followed in 1 by electrical CV and 25 of these were discharged in sinus rhythm (SR). The remaining 141 patients were managed with rate control drugs (digoxin, beta‐blocker, calcium antagonists) or no drugs, and after an observation time ≤ 48 h, 58 (41%) were discharged in SR and 83 (59%) in AF. Two patients each in the SR and AF groups received AAD on discharge. At follow‐up 15 patients discharged in AF had recovered SR. Conclusions: In patients without severe structural heart disease or arrhythmia intolerance, in the absence of AAD 41% recover SR in ≤48 h and another 11% at 15 day follow‐up. This high trend to persistence of AF after the first episode underlines the importance of early consideration of CV, either in the ER or soon after short‐term follow‐up, in order to prevent structural remodeling. Only long‐term follow‐up will allow the diagnosis of paroxysmal AF in cases with recurrent self‐limited episodes. BASIC SCIENCE: FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE O031 AUTOANTIBODY AGAINST THE BETA1‐ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR PREDICT INCREASED MORTALITY FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE Pei J‐H; Chen J‐Z; Zhang Y‐H; Cao K‐J; Zhang P; Pu J‐L Fu Wai Cardiovascular Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Background: Clinical studies and in vitro animal experiments suggested that β1‐ adrenergic receptor autoantibody (β1‐AAB) played an important rule in the pathophysiological process of chronic heart failure (CHF). Removal of β1‐AAB with immunoabsorption reduced mortality in those patients. Therefore, we set to evaluate whether β1‐AAB may predict the prognosis and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with CHF. Methods: In total of 2062 patients of CHF including 824 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy(DCM) and 1238 cases of ischemic cardiomyopathy(ICM) and control group(824 cases) were collected and followed‐up in this study. β1‐AAB was detected by ELISA method and compared the results in different groups. The correlation between β1‐AAB and the prognosis of CHF was analyzed. Results: The successful follow up rate was 85.26%(1758 cases) including 704(85.44%) cases of DCM and 1054(85.14%) cases of ICM with the median of 36 months(0.40□65 months), 379 (21.56%) cases composed of 164 cases of DCM and 215 cases of ICM died in total, 153(40.37%) cases including 69 cases of DCM and 84 cases of ICM had SCD. The positive rate β1‐AAB between CHF group and control group were 8.19% and 2.2% (p < 0.01). Cox regression analysis revealed that the positive β1‐AAB was associated with all‐cause mortality and SCD but not with Non‐SCD(NSCD) both in DCM(HR were 2.420 [95% CI:1.605–3.649] for all‐cause mortality, 4.514 [95% CI:2.405–8.471] for SCD and 1.691 [95% CI:0.969–2.951] for NSCD) and in ICM (HR were 2.339 [95% CI:1.673–3.271] for all‐cause mortality,3.749 [95% CI:2.389–5.884] for SCD and 1.475 [95% CI:0.877–2.480] for NSCD). Conclusions: The positive rate of β1‐AAB was higher in patient group than in the control group. It indicated 4 to 5‐fold of risk for SCD. It may serve as an independent predictor for the prognosis of the patients with CHF.

There is no proven, reliable and sensitive, hemodynamic sensor which can work in a closed loop with these devices. We are exploring the feasibility of using a tissue perfusion sensor based on laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) technique to monitor the hemodynamic status of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods: Fifteen patients with an indication for an electrophysiological study were enrolled. Tissue perfusion was measured using a commercial laser Doppler perfusion monitor (LDPM). Fiber optic perfusion probes were placed epicutaneous on the left arm or high chest skin where a stable perfusion signal was observed. Arterial blood pressure was used as hemodynamic reference. High rate atrial and ventricular pacing at 120, 140, 160 and 180 beats per minute simulated supra ventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Results: Patients were mostly male (10 male, 5 female), the mean age was 47 ± 20 years, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 52 ± 9.1%. Patients were evaluated for ventricular arrhythmia (7), AVNRT (4), WPW (1) and SVT (4). A significant linear relationship was observed (p < 0.01, r = 0.7) between change in mean arterial pressure and perfusion at 5 seconds after the simulated cardiac arrhythmias. High rate ventricular pacing (180BPM) resulted in 43.25 ± 13% drop in perfusion from baseline at 5 seconds reflecting the drop in pressure (35.5 ± 10%). Whereas the change in perfusion and pressure during high rate atrial pacing (180BPM) was relatively low (0.03 ± 19% vs 0.77 ± 15%) showing that LDPM has the potential for discriminating hemodynamically stable and unstable arrhythmias. Conclusion: Laser Doppler perfusion sensor is a potential tool for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring and therapy optimization. We are currently exploring the feasibility of miniaturizing the technique to realize a closed loop system. O033 CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY AND BONE MARROW CELL TRANSPLANTATION IN PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC HEART FAILURE AND ELECTRO‐MECHANICAL DYSSYNCHRONY. A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY Romanov A; Pokushalov E; Corbucci G; Prokhorova D; Shabanov V; Artemenko S; Stenin I; Elesin D; Losik D; Yakubov A State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of combining BMMC transplantation with CRT in patients with severe ischemic HF, left bundle branch block (LBBB) and mechanical dyssynchrony. Methods: Patients with ischemic HF, LVEF < 35%, LBBB and mechanical dyssynchrony underwent intramyocardial transplantation of BMMC and CRTD system implantation. This randomized, single‐blind, cross‐over study compared clinical and echocardiographic parameters during two follow‐up periods: 6 months of active CRT (BMMC+CRTact) and 6 months of inactive CRT (BMMC+CRTinact). Physical performance was assessed by means of a 6‐minute walking test. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by SPECT. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed through the Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire (MLwHFQ). Results: Twenty‐six patients (64 ± 7 years) were enrolled in the study. The distance covered by the patients during the 6‐minute walking test significantly increased in the BMMC+CRTinact phase (BMMC therapy only) in comparison with the baseline (269 ± 68 vs 206 ± 51; p = 0.007) and in the BMMC+CRTact phase (BMMC therapy + CRT) in comparison with the BMMC+CRTinact (378 ± 59 vs 269 ± 68; p < 0.001). The summed rest and stress score (SPECT) decreased significantly in the BMMC+CRTact and BMMC+CRTinact phases in comparison with the baseline (P ≤ 0.03). Both phases showed equivalent myocardial perfusion in the segments into which BMMC had been injected. QoL score was significantly lower in the BMMC+CRTinact phase than at the baseline (44.1 ± 14 vs 64.8 ± 19; p < 0.001), and in the BMMC+CRTact phase than in the BMMC+CRTinact phase (26.4 ± 12 vs 44.1 ± 14; p = 0.004). Conclusion: BMMC and CRT seem to act independently on myocardial perfusion and electro‐mechanical dyssynchrony, respectively. Combining these two complementary therapies can significantly improve LV performance in patients with severe HF and electro‐mechanical dyssynchrony. O034 EFFECTS OF WENXIN GRANULE ON L‐TYPE CALCIUM AND TRANSIENT OUTWARD POTASSIUM CURRENT IN ADULT RAT MYOCARDIUM Wang X; Wang X; Wang T; Gu Y‐W; Tang Y‐H; Huang C‐X Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University Arrhythmia is the leading cause of death of heart disease. The class I anti‐arrhythmic drugs showed that these drugs increased sudden death and total mortality compared with the placebo group. Wenxin Granule is developed by The China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). From clinical application, it can effectively control the arrhythmia, and is safe and reliable. We used ventricular myocytes isolated from the heart of male rat. The whole patch‐clamp technique was performed to record current in ventricular myocardial cells of adult rats. Upon the application of Wenxin Granules, the amplitude of calcium current was decrease, The peak amplitude of ICa‐L was decreased 29.3%± 4.8%, 45.8%± 5.3%, 72.6%± 4.1% (n = 6, P < 0.05) by WenXin Granules derivatives at 1g/L, 5g/L, 10g/L, respectively. Wenxin Granules made current‐voltage (IV) curves upwards, shifted the curve to the right, and prolonged the recovery time of Ca2+ channel from inactivation. WenXin particle inhibited the current density of Ito and the decreased rates of the peak Ito were (15.31 ± 7.21)%, (32.86 ± 5.08)%, (53.25 ± 4.74)%, (73.23%± 4.11)%. at 1g/L, 5g/L, 10g/L, 20g/L group, respectively. The current‐voltage curve was shifted downward, and steady‐state inactivation curve shift to right. The results of the present work suggested that Wenxin Granule modulate L‐type calcium channels and transient outward potassium channel in rat cardiac myocytes. Our study suggested that Wenxin Granule might play a cardioprotective role, and suppress arrhythmias by altering Electrophysiological properties of ilon channel. O035 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MYOCARDIAL HYPOXIA AND ATRIAL STRUCTURAL REMODELING IN THE RAPID ATRIAL PACING CANINE MODE Tianyi G; GuoJun X; Xianhui Z; Baopeng T; Xia G; Yaodong L Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, Chi Introduction: Atrial structural remodeling is important for the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation(AF). The high rate of atrial excitation would lead to tissue hypoxia during AF. However, the relation of myocardial hypoxia and atrial structural remodeling has not been clarified. Methods:"J"‐type electrodes were placed in the right atrial appendage under the guidance of X‐ray in 16 dogs, Animals in model group (n = 8) received fast pacing (400 beats/min) for 10 weeks while animals in control group (n = 8) maintained at sinus rhythm. Burst stimulation was applied to induce atrial fibrillation in all animals after 10 weeks, animals were sacrificed thereafter and the left atrial tissues were taken for myocardial collagen measurement (Masson staining) and myocardial ultrastructure examination. Western blot and real‐time polymerase chain reaction analyses of the expression of Matrix metalloproteinase 9(MMP‐9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors, and hypoxia‐induced transcription factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) were performed. Results: Atrial myocardial collagen volume fraction was significantly increased in model group compared with the control group. Ultrastructure examination in atrial tissue evidenced disorder, fracture, collagen fiber proliferation, mitochondrial swelling, blurred cristae, and intercalated disc distortion, expansion. Compared with the control group, the MMP9, the VEGF, HIF‐1α of mRNA and protein levels increased significantly in the AF group. VEGF receptor‐1 mRNA, a high affinity receptor for VEGF, but not VEGF receptor‐2, was upregulated in the atria of the AF group. Conclusions: Upregulation of HIF‐1/VEGF is involved in the enhancement of MMP‐9 expression under hypoxic conditions.This may lead to atrial structural remodeling.

Methods: Langendorff perfused SD rat hearts were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups: time control group (TC group), ischemic‐reperfusion group (I/R group, 25 mins of ischemia followed by 30 mins of reperfusion), and sevoflurane preconditioning group (SpreC group, preconditioned with 3% sevoflurane for 15 mins). The hemodynamics, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels and arrhythmia data were measured. At the end of reperfusion, single left ventricle myocytes of epicardium were dissociated enzymatically, then the APD and ICa, L characteristics were determined by a whole‐cell patch clamp technique. Statistical significance was assigned as P < 0.05. Results: Sevoflurane preconditioning improved LVDP, ± dp/dt, and HR recovery, decreased cTnI release, and decreased the incidence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion (SpreC vs I/R, P < 0.05). Compared with the TC group, ischemia‐reperfusion injury could shorten the APD90 (from 37.65 ± 3.05 s to 31.44 ± 2.93 s), reduce the peak ICa, L densities (from 9.68 ± 0.47 to 4.79 ± 0.25 pA/pF) and elevate the current‐voltage curves (P < 0.05). Compared with the I/R group, sevoflurane preconditioning could prolong the APD90, increase the peak ICa, L densities, and lower the current‐voltage curves (P < 0.05). The ICa, L steady‐state activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation curves were not significantly different between the I/R and SpreC groups. Conclusions: Sevoflurane preconditioning could protect isolated rat hearts against ischemia/reperfusion insults and improve reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias, which may be related to the attenuation of ICa, L current suppression induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Key words: reperfusion arrhythmia, sevoflurane, ischemia/reperfusion injury, preconditioning, L‐type Ca2+ current O037 DIFFERENTIAL DENSITIES OF CHOLINERGIC NERVES IN CANINE SUPRAVENTRICULAR REGIONS OF HEARTS Li Z; Zhao QY; Huang H; Yang B; Huang CX Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China Introduction: Cholinergic nerve plays an important role in the induction and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). Cholinergic innervation at supraventricular tissues is considered to be the histological basis and ablation associated target site for the arrhythmia, however, the distribution of cholinergic nerve in supraventricular tissues is not studied. Methods: We performed histological and immunohistochemistrical staining on canine tissues of left atrial appendage (LAA), right atrial appendage (RAA), left atrium (LA), right atrium (RA), atrial septum (AS), crista terminalis (CT), pulmonary vein (PV) and superior vena cava (SVC) using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Results: Normal canine cardiovascular histological structures were shown from H&E staining. Cholinergic nerve densities at LAA and RAA were significantly higher than LA, which was higher than RA, but no significant difference was observed between LAA and RAA. Furthermore, RA was significantly higher than AS, CT, PV and SVC while there were no significant differences among the latter four. Conclusions: The different densities of cholinergic nerve at canine supraventricular regions indicate that the heterogeneity property establishes the histological basis of cholinergic nerve mediated pathological conditions. Structures with higher cholinergic innervation at supraventricular tissues are considered to be ablation associated target site for AF. O038 DIFFERENT ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY EFFECTS BETWEEN SEVOFLURANE AND SEVOFLURANE POSTCONDITIONING ON CARDIOMYOCYTES DISPERSED FROM RAT HEARTS Gong J; Yao Y; Fang N; Li L Department of Anesthesiology, Fuwai Hospital, and Peking Union Medical College Objectives: To observe the effects of sevoflurane or sevoflurane postconditioning on action potential (AP) and L‐type calcium currents (ICa,L) of cardiomyocytes dispersed from Langendorff perfused rat hearts. Methods: Part I: The effects of 3% sevoflurane on AP and ICa,L of single left ventricle myocytes were tested. Part II: Langendorff perfused isolated SD rat hearts were randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups: ischemic/reperfusion group (I/R group), and sevoflurane postconditioning group (SpostC group, postconditioned with 3% sevoflurane at the first 15 minutes of reperfusion), then the AP and ICa,L characteristics of single left ventricle myocytes were determined by a whole‐cell patch clamp technique. Statistical significance was assigned as P < 0.05. Results: Part I: The amplitude of membrane potential (AMP) and resting membrane potential (RMP) were not changed by 3% sevoflurane (P < 0.05), but the APD90 was significantly prolonged from 37.56 ± 3.09 ms to 48.39 ± 3.13 ms (P < 0.05). Peak ICa,L densities were reduced at about 37% of the control group by 3% sevoflurane (P < 0.05). The data between the control group and the recovery group were not significantly changed. Part II: Compared with the I/R group, sevoflurane postconditioning increase peak ICa, L densities (from 4.79 ± 0.25 pA/pF to 6.94 ± 0.20 pA/pF, P < 0.05), but the time to peak was not changed (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the ICa,L steady‐state activation, inactivation, and reactivation curves between the I/R and SpostC groups. Conclusions: 3% Sevoflurane directly suppresses ICa,L peak densities and prolongs APD90 of cardiomyocytes, while 3% sevoflurane postconditioning attenuates the suppression of ICa,L peak densities induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury, which may extenuate calcium overload and may improve reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias. Key Words: ischemia/reperfusion injury, sevoflurane, L‐type Ca2+ current, action potential duration, postconditioning CARDIAC IMAGING O039 ESOPHAGYC MULTI SLICE 64 COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (MSTC‐64) 3D RECONSTRUCTION AND PASSIVE FUSION WITH ESOPHAGUS SHELL. A NOVEL APPROACH DURING PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION. Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A; Kamlofsky M; Banega R Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Purpose: Catheter ablation(CA) has proven as standard procedure for drug‐refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrio esophagic fistula has been described as an infrequent but lethal complication of this procedure. Differents techniques were described to avoid this tremendous complication. Objective: Describe a new technique to determinate the accuracy of tridimensional esophagic reconstruction from MSTC‐64 to. Determine its feasibility and reproducibility as a methodological approach to avoid atrio esophagic fistula complication in a huge cohort of patients. Methods: Single‐center prospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent ablation of atrial fibrillation and received a MSCT‐64 prior to ablation in the Center between May 2009 and May 2011. A MSTC‐64 computed tomography was optimized for imaging of pulmonary veins. We performed the tridimensional reconstruction of the esophagus as described previously to determinate the relation with the PVO. We designed simultaneously with the left atrium shell another one for the esophagus positioning a quadripolar catheter inside the esophagus. We performed the fusion of the left atrium with the MSTC using Verismo® tool. Results: 153 patients were included with a mean age 61 ± 9.7 yrs, 90% male and a mean BMI of 26.5 ± 6.4 kg/m2. 78 (93.97%) patients were in sinus rhythm at time of MSCT‐64. We determine the esophagus tract in 146 patients (95.18%). The accuracy obtained was of 62.02% when MSTC was performed more than 48hs prior PVI. When we discriminate studies performed less than 48 h we have obtained 83.82% of accuracy (p < 0.05). The range of mismatch between each structure after fusion was 6 mm ± 10 mm. Conclusions: Passive Fusion of the esophagus has a high accuracy to determinate the esophagus position if the MSCT is performed during the last 48h before the procedure. This allows avoid this critical structure during AF ablation and lets us modify the strategy during ablation procedure. O040 PREDICTIVE VALUE OF LEFT ATRIAL VOLUME AS DETERMINED BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FOR PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION AS SINGLE ABLATION APPROACH FOR PERSISTENT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Kriatselis C; Nedios S; Gebker R; Jahnke C; Paesch I; Gerds‐Li JH; Fleck E Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is an effective interventional treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The role of PVI as single interventional treatment of persistent AF remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to test the predictive value of left atrial volume (LAV) as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation undergoing PVI without any additional left or right atrial ablation lesions. Methods and Results: Sixty‐three consecutive patients (44 men, mean age: 63 ± 10 years) with drug‐refractory persistent AF were included. A CMR examination was performed one day before the scheduled PVI and the different LAVs were determined: maximal LAV (LAVmax), minimal LAV (LAVmin), LAVmax and LAVmin per m2 of body surface area, LA ejection fraction. The ablation procedure included isolation of all pulmonary veins without additional ablation lesions. If a second procedure was needed this included only reisolation of the reconnected PVs. During a mean follow‐up of 25 ± 7 months AF recurred in 25 out of 63 (40%) patients. A cut‐off value of 110 ml for LAVmin was the strongest predictor of outcome. 32 out of 34 patients (94%) of patients with an LAVmin ≤110 ml remained in sinus rhythm during follow‐up while this was the case in only 6 out of 29 patients (21%) with an LAVmin >110. The number of second ablation procedure was lower in patients with LAVmin ≤110 compared to those with LAVmin >110 (1.3 vs 1.7, p:0.01). Conclusions: LA volume as measured by preinterventional CMR is a significant predictor of long‐term outcome after pulmonary vein isolation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. As a minimal LAV of 110 ml or less predicts long‐term freedom from AF after pulmonary vein isolation, a strategy of extensive left atrial ablation in these patients does not seem to be justified. CARDIAC RESYNCHRONISATION THERAPY O041 CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE: RESULTS FROM A EUROPEAN SURVEY Nagamori J; Braunschweig F; Ståhlberg M Karolinska Institutet, Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Background: Current guidelines give detailed advice with regard to the selection of appropriate patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, strategies for patient follow‐up and device optimization have not been subject to systematic research and may differ largely between institutions. This survey aimed to describe current follow‐up and device optimization strategies in European centers. Methods: A survey containing 35 questions regarding methods for post implantation follow‐up routines and optimization methods was sent out by email to centers implanting CRT‐devices in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Spain, France and Germany. Results: A total of 52 centers, following‐up approximately 10.050 patients, responded to the survey (participation rate 15%). For CRT‐P patients the median time‐interval between follow‐up visits was 6 months (IQR: 3–6) while it was 1 month shorter for patients with CRT‐D. In 69% of the responding centers CRT‐optimization was routinely performed in all patients while 29% optimized selected patients only (non‐responders, NYHA IV, lowest EF). When device optimization was considered, the atrioventricular‐ and interventricular delay was individualized in 98% and 82% respectively. In a subset of centers, pacing mode (55%) and basic heart rate (32%) was also modified to maximize treatment efficacy. Echocardiography was the most commonly used method to optimize devices (92% of the centers) while only 6% routinely used invasive methods. Conclusions: The clinical routine concerning follow‐up of CRT‐patients varies between European centers but generally includes device optimization, at least for selected patients. Echocardiography is the most widely used method for device tuning. The differences in follow‐up strategies probably reflect the lack of evidence for optimal CRT‐patient follow‐up and device programming. O042 HIGH‐SPEED ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY FOLLOWED BY 3‐D RECONSTRUCTION OF CORONARY SINUS IN CRT DEVICE IMPLANTATION Zubarev E; Lebedev D Almazov Federal Heart, Blood and Endocrinology Centre, Saint‐Petersbug, Russian Federation Aim: To assess the capability of rotational angiography in CRT device implantation. Methods: We implanted CRT devices in 109 patients from 2009 till 2011 years. After coronary sinus (CS) cannulation standard occlusive retrograde angiography was performed in all patients. Besides, 17 patients underwent high‐speed rotational angiography followed by 3‐D reconstruction of coronary venous tree. Rotational isocentric scan was obtained by rapid rotation of C‐arm, left anterior oblique (LAO) 45° to right anterior oblique (RAO) 45° with speed of 60° per second (Allura Exper FD 10, Philips). Received images were analyzed using special software with assessment of full range of angles, diameters of target veins and 3‐D model of coronary venous tree was created, providing an operator with significantly more information about CS anatomy. According by received data we chose angulation and instrument for each patient. Results: Performing single rotational scanning was enough to evaluate venous anatomy in 82%, while additional standard angiography was required in 18% of cases. Optimal angulation for left ventricle lead implantation was found to vary significantly both for each vein and patient. The mean volume of contrast dye was 11.2 ± 3.3 ml for rotational angiography compared to 48.6 ± 29.9 ml for standard angiography (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Rotational angiography followed by 3‐D reconstruction of CS anatomy allows minimizing the dose of contrast dye. Using this method enables an operator to evaluate parameters of target vein and choose LV lead and its delivery system more accurately. O043 CORONARY SINUS LEAD EXTRACTION: SAFETY, TECHNIQUES, AND COMPLICATIONS Taborsky M; Fedorco M; Heinc P Ist Internal Clinic, Universtity Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic Introduction: The implantation of coronary sinus (CS) pacemaker leads has dramatically increased over the past few year. Extraction of CS leads remains limited. Methods: We analysed all percutaneous extractions of transvenous CS leads performed at our institution. Extractions occurring within 1 month of implantation were excluded. Results: Between 2000 and 2010, 117 CS leads were percutaneously extracted from 99 patients(8 infections and 91 lead dysfunction). In 1 patient the endovasal CS lead extraction was unsuccessful. The average duration in situ for the CS Leads was 2.41 ± 1.77 years. The majority of the leads were removed by simple traction (n = 97, 82.8%). The rest of the LV electrodes were removed by advanced extraction techniques including locking stylet with sheath support (n = 14,11.9%), locking stylet and laser (n = 6, 5.1%). The majority of CS leads implanted longer than four years required advanced extraction techniques (20/37, 54.3%). There were complications with extraction of 11 leads (9.4%). It was difficult to determine whether complications were attributable to CS lead extraction, another lead extraction, or reimplantation. Complications included CS or vein thrombosis (n = 4/99 pts, 4.4%), CS dissection (n = 2/99 pts, 2.2%), bleeding (n = 3/99, 3.3%), and pneumothorax (n = 2/99, 2.2%). Endovascular reimplantation of a new CS lead was successful in 87 of 99 attempts (87%). A longer duration after the implant was associated with increased use of an advanced extraction technique (p <.001). Duration of implantation and method of extraction were not associated with complications, fluoroscopy time, or re – implantation success. Conclusions: CS leads in situ greater than four years often require advanced techniques. Advanced extraction techniques can be implemented when simple traction is unsuccessful without an appreciable increase in complications. O044 THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF THE RIGHT HEART DURING CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Bucyte S; Sedlickaite D; Silkute A; Brukstute S; Puodziukynas A; Jurkevicius R; Kazakevicius T; Zabiela V; Sileikis V Department of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Medical Academy Purpose: To estimate the structural changes of the right heart during cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods: 37 patients meeting ESC recommended CRT implantation indications were included into this study. The size of the right ventricle (RV), the volume of the right atrium (RA), right ventricle myocardial performance index (RV MPI), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and the highest tricuspid annular systolic velocity (TASV) were evaluated before starting CRT and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0. Results: Mean initial RV size was 34.95 ± 8.6 mm., after 3 months of CRT in responders' and non – responders' group it was 34.02 ± 8.45 mm and 35.67 ± 8.88 mm, respectively, after 6 months – 34.82 ± 7.9 mm and 34.45 ± 10.23 mm, respectively. Mean initial RA volume was 82.31 ± 39.3 ml., after 3 months of CRT in responders' and non – responders' group it was 48.9 ± 10.46 ml and 89.75 ± 35.12 ml, respectively, after 6 months – 65.62 ± 25.23 ml and 70.0 ± 24.2 ml, respectively. Mean initial RA and mean RA after 3 months appeared to differ significantly (p < 0.05) between the responders' and non – responders' groups. Mean initial RA correlated with mean initial RV and highest TASV. We found a high positive correlation (r > 0.5) between the reduction of mean RA and the increase of LV EF and TASV in responders' group after 3 months. Conclusions: 1During CRT the structure of the right heart does change.2The difference of the mean initial RA volume and mean RA volume after 3 months of CRT between responders' and non – responders' was statistically significant.3Severe dilation of the RA might be the prognostic sign of the absence of the response to CRT. O045 THE FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE RIGHT HEART DURING CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Bucyte S; Sedlickaite D; Silkute A; Brukstute S; Puodziukynas A; Jurkevicius R; Kazakevicius T; Zabiela V; Sileikis V Department of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Medical Academy Purpose: To estimate the functional changes of the right heart during cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods: 37 patients meeting ESC recommended CRT implantation indications were included into this study. The size of the right ventricle (RV), the volume of the right atrium (RA), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and the highest tricuspid annular systolic velocity (TASV) were evaluated before CRT and after 3 and 6 months. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0. Results: Mean initial RV size was 34.95 ± 8.6 mm., after 3 months of CRT in responders' and non – responders' group it was 34.02 ± 8.45 mm and 35.67 ± 8.88 mm, respectively, after 6 months – 34.82 ± 7.9 mm and 34.45 ± 10.23 mm, respectively. Mean initial RA volume was 82.31 ± 39.3 ml., after 3 months of CRT in responders' and non – responders' group it was 48.9 ± 10.46 ml and 89.75 ± 35.12 ml, respectively, after 6 months – 65.62 ± 25.23 ml and 70.0 ± 24.2 ml, respectively. Mean initial TAPSE was 12.92 ± 5.62 mm., after 3 months of CRT in responders' and non – responders' group it was 14.5 ± 3.1 mm and 11.9 ± 5.7 mm, respectively, after 6 months – 14.52 ± 3.9 mm and 14.5 ± 3.15 mm, respectively. Mean highest initial TASV was 11.03 ± 3.37 cm/s., after 3 months of CRT in responders' and non – responders' group it was 13.0 ± 4.0 cm/s and 10.56 ± 3.94 cm/s, respectively, after 6 months – 13.15 ± 3.77 cm/s and 12.0 ± 3.0 cm/s, respectively. Mean initial RA correlated with mean initial RV and highest TASV. We found a high positive correlation (r > 0.5) between the reduction of mean RA and the increase of LV EF and TASV in responders' group after 3 months. Conclusions: 1During CRT the structure and function of the right heart does change.2Even in non – responders' group the function of RV does improve.3Severe dilation of the RA might be the prognostic sign of the absence of the response to CRT. O046 WHY WE STILL CALL THEM NON‐RESPONDERS? Papavasileiou L; Forleo GB; Vecchio F; Cioè R; Minni V; Della Rocca DG; Topa A; Magliano G; Santini L; Romeo F Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Rome "Tor Vergata" Introduction: The objective of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is the improvement of objective parameters and the amelioration of the quality of life of patients with heart failure. We have different measures to evaluate the percent of patients who could be considered CRT responders. The aim of our study was to evaluate if there is a concordance between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) changes and changes in subjective (patients view) parameters. Methods: We analyzed 61 consecutive patients underwent CRT implantation at our institution between May 2009 and December 2010. Patients were divided in two groups based on the presence (responders) or absence (non responders) of an improvement (≥15%) of LVEF. Patients view was assessed by: the six minute walk test (6MWT) and the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Results: The two groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex, EF prior implantation and underlining heart disease. After a mean follow up of 8.4 ± 4.8 months, 34 patients were responders (Δ EF = 19 ± 13) while 27 patients (non responders) did not fulfill LVEF criteria (ΔEF =−3 ± 13). Regarding patients view, no significant differences were found between two groups about Δ 6MWT distance (209 ± 119 in non responders group vs 221 ± 105 in responders group, p = ns), Δ MLHFQ (−13 ± 16 vs −7 ± 22, p = ns). Of note, acute decompensation with necessity of hospitalization was observed in similar mode in both groups (4 events in non responders group vs 3 in responders group). Conclusions: Objective parameters routinely used in order to evaluate the response of patients in CRT are valid, nevertheless a vast majority of patients report improvement of clinical status in absence of the classic measurable parameters. New tools are necessary in order to assess benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy. O047 DIRECT ENDOCARDIAL LEFT VENTRICLE: A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL RESYNCHRONIZATION VIA CORONARY SINUS Roa‐Garrido J; Moriña‐Vazquez P; Barba‐Pichardo R; Fernandez‐Gomez Juan M; Venegas‐Gamero J; Arrhythmias Department "Juan Ramón Jiménez" Hospital, Huelva, Spain. Introduction: Biventricular pacing through the Coronary Sinus (CS) is effective for the treatment of patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block. However, this approach is sometimes not feasible (lack of response, anatomical considerations of CS, etc). Although surgical epicardial lead implantation is the alternative, this technique may be deleterious in patients with low ejection fraction (EF) and high anaesthetic risk. Thus, direct endocardial Left Ventricle (LV) stimulation performed under local anaesthesia may be an alternative. We describe the results of direct endocardial LV pacing. Method: Prospective study (n = 12) with failed resynchronization via CS (April 2006‐January 2011) all except one with width QRS. Technique: Femoral approach, transeptal puncture and LV mapping; active fixation of the lead at the point where the longer electrical delayed was observed, peeled away from the introducer and connection to generator. Parameters: previous device implanted through the upper veins, inferior generator was programmed VVT (n = 8); n = 3 with an exclusive femoral approach was accomplished and connected to a tricameral generator. Follow‐up: 6 to 48 months. An echocardiogram was performed before implantation and 6 months later. Results: The LV lead was implanted successfully in all the cases (thresholds under 1.5 V). 4 Pocket haemathoma were observed, 3 cured spontaneously, the other suffered from infection so the system was explanted. A patient with narrow QRS died due to cardiogenic shock, another died due to a hemorrhagic stroke after implantation. The rest of the patients had improved at least a step in the NYHA status at 3 months. All of them improved EF. A patient with recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation and shocks is now asymptomatic. Conclusion: Direct endocardial LV pacing through the transeptal approach is safe and may be a less risky and more efficient alternative than surgical epicardial lead implantation to resynchronization via CS. O048 INCREASE IN TPEAK‐END INTERVAL INDUCED BY BIVENTRICULAR PACING PREDICTS VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIA FOLLOWING CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY Miyoshi F; Onuma Y; Watanabe N; Kikuchi M; Ito H; Adachi T; Kawamura M; Asano T; Tanno K; Kobayashi Y Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Showa University School of Medicine Background: The relationship between induction of arrhythmias and dispersion of repolarization after CRT is controversial. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) alters QT interval, QT dispersion, and Tpeak–Tend interval (Tpeak–end) and whether such changes relate to the risk of developing major arrhythmic events (MAE). Methods: Data from 67 patients (49 male, age 71 ± 10 years) who underwent CRT device placement were analyzed retrospectively. Patients had NYHA class III (n = 62) or IV (n = 5) heart failure, as a result of ischemic heart disease (n = 28), cardiomyopathy (n = 35) or valvular heart disease (n = 4). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 ± 9%. The electrocardiogram was recorded at baseline and during follow‐up after implantation (3 days, 7 days, 1 month, and 2 months). For each electrocardiogram, the following parameters were measured: QRS duration, QT interval, QTc, QT dispersion, and Tpeak–end. Results: After 29‐month follow‐up, 11 patients experienced MAE. QT interval, QTc, QT dispersion, and Tpeak–end did not change significantly immediately after CRT. However, 3 days after CRT, Tpeak–end in patients with MAE was significantly increased when compared with patients without MAE (p < 0.05). We divided patients into two groups according to change in Tpeak–end after 3 days of follow‐up (increased Tpeak–end group; n = 27, decreased Tpeak–end group; n = 40). The increased Tpeak–end group demonstrated a significant increase in MAE (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Increased Tpeak–end at 3 days after CRT was associated with a significant increase in MAE, and this could be a useful predictor of ventricular proarrhythmias. O049 EVALUATION OF LEFT INTRAVENTRICULAR SYNCHRONY IN ASYMPTOMATIC LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK PATIENTS BY NON‐INVASIVE PARAMETERS OBTAINED FROM RADIONUCLIDE VENTRICULOGRAPHY Pastor A; Perea J; Leguizamón J; Villanueva A; Jiménez S Hospital Universitario de Getafe (Madrid), Spain Introduction: Radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) has been used to assess ventricular synchrony by means of phase and amplitude parametric images and their quantitative‐derived parameters: the mean (M) phase angle (PA) represents mean time of ventricular contraction onset and the standard deviation (SD) of the PA relates to the synchrony of ventricular contraction. Methods: We evaluated parameters obtained from RNV of left intraventricular synchrony in 16 normal ECG controls and compared them with a group of 36 asymptomatic patients (P) with a left bundle branch block (LBBB, no previous cardiac history, referred for routinely evaluation at the cardiology outpatient room. MPA and the SD of the PA was derived and measured from the phase histogram obtained in the best left anterior oblique view. Both the MPA and the SD of PA were expressed in grades (°) or msec (MPA° or SD° x RR interval/360°). Results: Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 39 ± 9% in 15 LBBB P, while in 21 LBBB and controls P, LVEF was 60 ± 5% and 62 ± 6% respectively. MPA measures in (°) or ms were non statistically significant between groups. However, SDPA measures in (°) or msec were significant less in control and LBBB/EF ≥50% P compared with LBBB/EF ≤ 50% P (24 ± 14°/36 ± 22° vs 58 ± 14°, p < 0.001 and 55 ± 31ms/86 ± 53ms vs 130 ± 34ms, p < 0.001). No differences in SDPA values were observed between control/LBBB/EF≥ 50% P. In LBBB P an inverse correlation between SD and LVEF was found (r =– 0.73, p < 0.001), so the greater SD of PA, the less LVEF. Conclusion: Abnormal LV systolic function is present in 42% of asymptomatic LBBB P, referred for routinely evaluation. An important subset of LBBB P who show left intraventricular electrical dyssynchrony may have not mechanical dyssynchrony data estimated by RNV parameters being similar to normal P. We can speculate if depressed LVEF found in 42% of the LBBB group is due to the LBBB‐dependent electrical asynchrony itself or vice versa O050 SENSOR EQUIPPED IMPLANTATION TOOLS FOR LV LEAD PLACEMENT USING A NOVEL NON‐FLUOROSCOPIC INTRA‐CARDIAC DEVICE TRACKING SYSTEM: IN ANIMAL EVALUATION Piorkowski C; Sommer P; Rolf S; Doring M; Eitel C; John S; Wetzel U; Arya A; Gaspar T; Hindricks G University of Leipzig, Heart Center, Department of Electrophysiology, Germany Background: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy has evolved as standard treatment for patients with advanced heart failure and asynchronous ventricular contraction. Difficulties implanting the LV lead may result in long procedure and fluoroscopy times. Hereby we report on an animal evaluation of specialized sensor‐equipped implantation tools for LV lead placement using a novel non‐fluoroscopic intra‐cardiac device tracking system. Methods: The novel non‐fluoroscopic tracking system consists of an electromagnetic field controller mounted on a conventional X‐ray system. Interventional intracardiac devices equipped with a miniaturized single coil sensor can either be projected over fluoroscopy or tracked non‐fluoroscopically at the precise position of the sensor within the electromagnetic field. Sensor equipped EP catheters, CS sheaths, target vein sub‐selectors, and angiography guidewires were tested for LV lead positioning in a porcine animal model. Results: In one porcine subject, the CS was non‐fluoroscopically engaged after jugular venous access using a sensor‐equipped steerable EP catheter and a sensor‐equipped CS sheath. Acquisition of occlusive CS venograms was performed and utilized to reconstruct a 3D model of the CS venous anatomy and to serve as the underlying image for non‐fluoroscopic target vein access achieved by sensor‐equipped sub‐selectors and guidewires.Utilization of live fluoroscopy during CS navigation procedures, which should be reduced by the unique "road mapping" algorithm with cardiac and respiratory motion compensation, was monitored and reported. Conclusions: A novel non‐fluoroscopic device tracking system together with sensor equipped implantation tools were able to support a new workflow of LV lead implantation in a porcine animal model. Future studies should examine applicability of this technology in the clinical setting and demonstrate the actual effect on any reduction of fluoroscopic time and exposure to both patients and operators. CHANNELOPATHIES O051 CRITICAL VENTRICULAR REPOLARIZATION PROLONGATION PRECEDING TORSADE DE POINTES IN ACQUIRED LONG QT SYNDROME Chiladakis I; Zagkli F; Kalogeropoulos A; Koutsogiannis N; Alexopoulos D University Hospital of Patras, Greece Objective: There is a strong but not causal association between ventricular repolarization prolongation and torsade de pointes (Tdp) in acquired long QT syndrome (aLQT). We determined the preferred method of ventricular repolarization assessment which best identifies the critical degree of ventricular repolarization prolongation exacerbating Tdp. Methods: We evaluated the electrocardiograms immediately before the occurrence of Tdp in 29 patients (age 63 ± 16 years) with aLQT. Drug‐induced ventricular repolarization prolongation had 17 patients. The QT (QTc) and the JT (JTc) intervals were measured by the use of six different QT/JT heart‐rate correction methods. We compared the distribution of QT(QTc) intervals for patients with normal QRS duration against the proposed cutoff levels of concern at 450ms, 480ms and 500ms, and the distribution of JT (JTc) intervals for patients with wide QRS complex at the cutoff levels of 310ms, 330ms and 360ms, respectively. Results: The study included 25 patients with normal QRS duration of QRS 106 ± 9 ms and QT interval of 543 ± 60 ms, and 4 patients with wide QRS complex of 162 ± 9 ms and JT interval 434 ± 58 ms. In the whole patient group as well as in patients with normal QRS duration the correction formulae of Hodges and Fridericia yielded highest detection probability for Tdp at all three cutoff levels (i.g. at the 480ms cutoff level, t = 7.34, p < 0.001, and t = 6.70, p < 0.0001, respectively, and at the 500 ms cutoff level, t = 5.28, p < 0.001, and t = 4.77, p < 0.005, respectively). For patients with wide QRS complex, greatest detection performance for Tdp showed the uncorrected JT interval (t = 3.55, p < 0.05) followed by the Hodges formula (p = NS) at the level of 330ms. Conclusions: Assessment of ventricular repolarization based on the use of the Hodges or alternatively Fridericia formula best identifies the likelihood of Tdp development. The uncorrected JT interval may be of comparable usefulness in patients with wide QRS complex. O052 RIGHT VENTRICLE MAPPING IN PATIENS WITH BRUGADA SYNDROME Ficili S; Galeazzi M; Lavalle C; Russo M; Chiarelli G; Santini L; Amati F; Mele F; Pandozi C; Santini M dipartimento Cardiovascolare, Ospedale San Filippo Neri – Roma‐Italy Background: The role of structural heart disease and sodium channel dysfunction in the induction of electrical instability in Brugada syndrome is still known. However recent paper had showed that endomyocardial biopsy detected structural alterations in subjets with Brugada syndrome and arrhythmias. Objective: To investigate the role of structural alterations in subjects with Brugada syndrome and inducible at electrophysiological study (EPS). Methods: We studied 28 consecutive probands (24 males, 4 females) with clinical and istrumental diagnosis of Brugada syndrome. All probands were Caucasian. According to the most recently proposed diagnostic criteria, the clinical presence of BS was based on demonstration on the ECG of a type 1 or a type 2 that was converted to type 1 after flecainide test (2 mg/kg). All patients were inducible at EPS. A bipolar voltage mapping was also performed by CARTO system. In a subset of patients (8), the electroanatomical right ventricular map was integrated with MR/CT image to assure the contact between the tip of catheter and endocardial tissue. In 2 patients intracardiac echo (ICE) was used to investigate the structural alterations. Genetic study for SCN5A mutational screening was also performed onto DNA obtained from peripheral blood sample of all 148 patients. Results: Programmed electrical stimulation induced VF in all the patients. The electroanatomical mapping showed normal potentials of the right ventricle in all the patients. The mean number of acquired points was (325 ± 25 points) with an average mapping period of 24 ± 4 minutes. Structural alterations were non detected by ICE. Genetic study revelead 3 mutation (mutation rate 21,4%) IVS‐24/CT in two patients (B6 and B 11) and R 1512 W in one patient (B15). Conclusion: Substrate right ventricular mapping of Brugada patients does not highlight any alterations. O053 MUTATION SPECTRUM IN KCNQ1 AND KCNH2 GENES IN IRANIAN LONG QT SYNDROME PATIENTS Banihashemi K; Saber S; Houshmand M; Moradmand Z; Aryan H; Fazelifar AF; Haghjoo M; Emkanjoo Z; Eftekharzadeh M; Zaklyazminskaya EV Medical Science Department, IECF, Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, Tehran, Iran Background: Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a heterogeneous group of inherited arrhythmic disorders characterized by QT interval prolongation, and associated with high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). At present more than 10 genes were detected as causative. But mutations in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 genes encode the cardiac potassium channels account about 60% of all LQTS patients. Material and Methods: We had 40 Iranian LQTS index patients under our observation. Clinical examination was performed in Rajaei Hospital, and Tehran Arrhythmia Clinic. Genetic screening was performed by direct sequencing of all coding area of KCNQ1 and KCNH2 genes in Special Medical Center. Results: We did find 3 mutations in KCNQ1 gene, in 3 out of 40 (about 8%) index patients. About 46% of patients are carrying common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Screening of KCNH2 coding and adjacent intronic area did not reveal any of disease‐causing mutation, but 40% of patients were carrying intervening SNPs in KCNH2 gene. Conclusion: We found surprisingly low prevalence (8%) of mutations in KCNQ1 gene. Lack of mutation in KCNH2 gene in Iranian LQTS patients is also rather confusing. This is not in concordance with findings in other populations. This discrepancy may reveal different molecular mechanisms in Iranian LQTS patients due to different pathogenic candidate genes, or phenomena such as allelic drop‐out. Further molecular investigations in other known genes involved in LQTS pathogenicity may elucidate its genotype‐phenotype correlation in Iran. E‐HEALTH AND ARRHYTHMIAS O054 ARRHYTHMIA TELEMONITORING IN SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS IN GEORGIA (REPUBLIC OF) Gegenava T; Gegenava M; Kirtava Z; Patients with arrhythmia, syncope, epilepsy Tbilisi State Medical University Introduction: Mobile telemedicine (m‐Health) represents an important recent sub‐segment of e‐Health and a rapidly growing branch of telemedicine. A classical example demonstrating the impact of telemedicine on diagnosis is the event recording of arrhythmias. Method: We investigated 47 outpatients with different types of arrhythmia (n = 27 male and n = 20 female, age – 12–80 year. Among them were n = 7 patients with unexplained syncope, n = 10 patients with epilepsy, n = 2 patients after radiofrequency catheter ablation, n = 5 patient after aorto‐coronary bypass graft surgery. Control group was performed with n = 10 sportsmen. Investigations were made by 3‐lead electrocardiograph‐ECG Loop Recorder in automatic recording/transmitting mode. Results: Arrhythmias were registered during 7–68 hours of observation. n = 22 (48%) patients had arrhythmia symptoms. n = 25 (52%) patients were asymptomatic. Cases of sinus brady‐ and tachyarrhythmia, sick‐sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) supraventricular premature complexes (SVPCs) and ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) have been correctly recognized by automatic recognition software and recorded. We also studied n = 2 patients after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA). Arrhythmia relapse was shown in both of them (SVT, SVPCs), but mostly they were asymptomatic. We studied also n = 10 patients with epilepsy and discovered n = 3 patients with SVT and n = 2 patients with sinus tachycardia. Among n = 7 patients with unexplained syncopes, we revealed n = 2 patients with sinus tachycardia, n = 2 patients with SVT. Asymptomatic episodes revealed mostly in study group p = 0.001, there were no different between gender p = 0.05. Conclusions: Mobile telecardiology represents feasible methodology to monitor arrhythmia outpatients in Georgia, promoting earlier discharge of non‐life‐threatening cases, improving patients' comfort of life and increasing their mobility with enhanced safety. O055 A NEW WEB‐BASED NATIONAL DATABASE: THE HELLENIC CARDIOLOGY SOCIETY ABLATION REGISTRY. RESULTS OF THE 2008–2010 YEAR PERIOD Vassilikos V; Efraimidis M; Billis A First Cardiology Dept, AHEPA University Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece In 2008 the radiofrequency ablation procedures (RFA) registry of the Hellenic Cardiology Society (HCS) was created. This is a dynamic, web‐based application, which acts as the interface for storing and retrieving patients' demographic data and ablation procedures. Access to the site is permitted only to registered users. The purpose of this study is the report of the results of RFA procedures performed in Greece over the 2008–2010‐year period. There are 24 licensed centers to perform RFA in Greece. During the 2008–2010 year period 3413 RFA procedures were performed in 3222 patients in 19 centers. 5 centers did not contribute data for various reasons. It is interesting that >50% of the total number of procedures were performed at 4 high volume centers (>100 cases/year). Male:Female ratio was 54% vs 46% and the mean age was 51.2 years. The most common procedure was slow pathway ablation for atrio‐ventricular reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), the second was accessory pathway related tachycardias (AVRT), and the third was atrial fibrillation ablation. Success rates were high (92%), complication rate was 2.6% (serious complications <1%) and total relapse rate was 9% at six months follow‐up. The electronic RFA registry in Greece confirmed that all RFA procedures are performed in Greece with high success and low complication rates, comparable to the European and US standards. The experience and results from the first three‐ year period use of the application are very interesting and encouraging, thus indicating the need for development of similar national databases at the National level. GENETICS O056 NEW SCN5A GENETIC VARIANT IN IRANIAN PATIENT WITH BRUGADA SYNDROME Saber S; Banihashemi K; Houshmand M; Fazelifar AF; Haghjoo M; Emkanjoo Z; Alizadeh A; Zaklyazminskaya EV Petrovsky Russian Research Center of surgery, RAMS, Moscow, Russia Background: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an autosomal dominant cardiac arrhythmia characterized by ST elevation in V1‐V3, pseudo‐Right bundle branch block (RBBB), high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and apparently normal heart. Mutations in SCN5a gene cause 15–20% of BrS cases. Clinical examination: Physical examination, standard 12‐leads ECG, echocardiography and 24‐Holter monitoring were performed for index patient. Genetic screening: included PCR‐based Senger sequencing of all coding exons and adjacent introns area of SCN5a gene. Results: We observed male BrS patient, 46 y.o, at first hospitalization. He had atypical chest pain, syncope and positive family history of Sudden Death (his brother at 5 y.o). Brugada‐pattern, type 1 was registered on resting ECG (HR = 70, QTc = 465 ms, PR = 200 ms, without other arrhythmia). Myocardial structural was normal by Echo‐CG examination. Genetic screening revealed a new rare variant c.C5787T (p.R1929C) in SCN5A gene. This change has not been observed in other ethnic groups. Single‐chamber ICD was implanted with a regular checking every 3 months. During first month after implantation, patient got two appropriate shocks, and the one inappropriate. Quinidine administration (200 mg/twice daily) was prescribed. Three years later, patient interrupted quinidine therapy and had one appropriate shock. After this episode quinidine therapy was resumed and no appropriate shock or any other major cardiac events were registered during next three years. Conclusion: We have recently identified new possibly disease‐causing c.C5787T variant in SCN5A gene in patient with Brugada syndrome. This variant was not found in other ethnic groups. Population analysis in ethnically‐matched control group is in progress now. Long‐term quinidine therapy seems to be efficient in events‐free surviving in BrS patient. This drug can be promising in control of ventricular tachycardia in BrS but cohort study has to be performed to verify their efficiency. O057 AMINO ACID SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE PORE OF THE CAV1.2 CALCIUM CHANNEL AFFECT ANOMALOUS MOLE FRACTION EFFECT OF THE CHANNEL Li Z; Huang H; Yang B; Gao GF; Peterson BZ; Huang CX Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China Introduction: The nature of ion permeation through ion channel is the electrophysiological basis of arrhythmias and has long been the subject of investigation. The anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) is an important probe of ion‐ion interactions in the pore of voltage‐gated Ca2+ channel and depends on holding voltage, total ion concentration and the intrinsic binding properties of the channel. The amino acid residues at position 1144 differed from several classes of voltage‐gated Ca2+ channels are important to the pore's permeation of multiple Ba2+ and Ca2+ ions. Methods: We substituted Phe‐1144 (F, CaV1) with glycine (G, CaV2) and lysine (K, CaV3) and observe the effects of mutation on voltage and concentration dependences of AMFE. Whole‐cell currents were recorded in the external solutions mixing of Ca2+ and Ba2+ such that the Ba2+/(Ba2++ Ca2+) was 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 and with total divalent cation concentration held at 2, 10 or 20 mM at holding potential from −80 to −20 mV. Results: IBa/ICa determined under 2 mM differs from IBa/ICa determined under higher concentrations (10 and 20 mM) and also differed while tail currents were evoked at potentials from −80 to −20 mV. The AMFE was greatest when tail currents were evoked at relatively positive potentials (−20 mV) and when the total divalent cation concentrations were kept low (2 mM). AMFE is attenuated for F1144G while accentuated for F1144K compare with wild‐type respectively. Conclusions: These results indicate that glycine and lysine substitutions of Phe‐1144 affect on AMFE via different mechanisms. Phe‐1144 substitutions confer to structure‐based models for Ca2+ channel permeation. The residues at position 1144 determine the permeation of several classes of voltage‐gated Ca2+ channels. O058 ALTERATIONS IN THE EXPRESSION OF GENES RELATED TO CONTRACTILE FUNCTION AND HYPERTROPHY OF THE LEFT VENTRICLE IN CHRONICALLY PACED PATIENTS FROM THE RIGHT VENTRICULAR APEX (PRELIMINARY RESULTS) Simantirakis EN; Kontaraki I; Arkolaki EG; Chrysostomakis SI; Nyktari EG; Patrianakos AP; Vardas PE Cardiology Department, University Hospital of Heraklion Background: Long term asynchronous ventricular activation from right ventricular apex results in reduced systolic and diastolic function. The purpose of this study is to assess in the peripheral blood alterations of the expression of genes related to contractile function and hypertrophy of the left ventricle, after right ventricular apical pacing in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Methods: Patients were divided into two categories, based on the cumulative percentage of ventricular pacing post‐implant. Group A consisted of those paced due to atrioventricular conduction disturbances (ventricular pacing> 90%), while group B of those with preserved intrinsic atrioventricular conduction. At the time of implantation and 3 months later, we evaluated in the peripheral blood concentrations of mRNA of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) and β‐myosin heavy chain (β‐MHC). We also estimated echocardiographically left ventricular end‐diastolic and end‐systolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction. Results: We have collected data for 30 patients during a period of 3‐months follow up. In group A at 3‐months follow‐up, mRNA levels of SERCA were decreased (9,3 ± 1,49 vs 4,04 ± 1,33 p = 0,021) and β‐MHC mRNA levels were increased though not significantly (62,12 ± 46,97 vs 424 ± 245 p = 0,127). Left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter, left ventricular end‐systolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction remained unaltered (46.5 ± 2.2 vs 47.85 ± 2.18 p = 0.7, 27.8 ± 2 vs 32.4 ± 2.2, p = 0.4 and 61 ± 2.8 vs 59 ± 2.1, p = 0.7 respectively). In controls all measured parameters showed no significant changes. Conclusions: Permanent right ventricular apical pacing is associated with alterations, in the peripheral blood, in the expression of genes regulating left ventricular contractile function and hypertrophy. These findings are traceable, while at the same time left ventricular function has not been deteriorated. O059 GENETIC VARIATION OF SCN5A IN KOREAN PATIENTS WITH SICK SINUS SYNDROME Kim YN; Lee YS; Park HS; Jung BC; Shin DG; Cho YK; Lee SH; Han SM; Lee MH; Daegu Arrhythmia Gene Study Group Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center Purpose: Recent western studies have been shown that the genetic variation of SCN5A is related with sick sinus syndrome (SSS). To determine the SSS‐associated genetic variation in Korean patients, we investigated the genetic variation of the SCN5A in Korean patients with SSS. Methods: We enrolled 30 patients with SSS, who diagnosed by sinus pause more than 3.0 sec in Holter monitoring, and 30 control. All exons including the putative splicing sites of the SCN5A gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced directly or after subcloning using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. The structure model of the human SCN5A domain was obtained from the Automated SWISS‐MODEL. Results: A total of 9 genetic variations in 30 patients were identified. Among these, 7 variations (G87A‐A29A, IVS9–3C>A, A1673G‐H558R, G3823A‐D1275N, T5457C‐D1819D, T5963G‐L1988R, C5129T‐S1710L) have been reported in previous studies and 2 variants (A3075T‐E1025D, T4847A‐F1616Y) were firstly found. In three‐dimensional modeling of SCN5A domain, only 1 variation site (F1616Y) was able to be analyzed. Conclusion: There were 2 novel genetic variations (E1025D, F1616Y) in the SCN5A gene in Korean patients with SSS. However, further functional study might be needed. IMAGING MODALITIES O060 PULMONARY VEINS VARIATIONS PATTERNS DETERMINED BY MULTI SLICE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AN ATRAIL NON FLUOROSCOPIC GEOMETRY Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Objective: To determine pulmonary veins drainage patterns determined by multi slice 64 computed tomography (MSCT‐64). Method: A total of 153 MSCT of patients with atrial fibrillation eligible for pulmonary veins isolation (PVI) were analyzed. The images were fused with the left atrium En Site (Nav X) Verissmo System electro‐anatomic map obtained during PVI. The primary end point was to determine the number of pulmonary ostiums located at each side of the LA, therefore the most common anatomic drainage pattern variations. We defined single Ostia as the ones which did not showed vein bifurcations in the endoscopic view; Common Ostia as the ones that showed vein bifurcation and primary trunk to those presenting vein bifurcation >5 mm away from the ostium. Results: The mean age was 57.88 years (± 9.68 DS); 80.73% male and 19,27% female. 69.87% presented 2 left ostiums; 93.97% showed 2 right ostium, corresponding to the superior and inferior PVs. A single left ostia was seen in 18.07% of the cases; 8.43% showed a left single trunk; 6.02% presented right single ostia and 4.08% a third right ostium. The correlation between the atrial geometry and MCCT‐64 was 100%. Conclusion: The presence of 4 pulmonary vein ostium corresponds to the known left atrium anatomy. This study suggests the most frequent anatomic drainage pattern variations in the following order: a unique left ostia, a single left trunk containing both superior and inferior left PVs, a single right ostia and less frequent a third right ostium corresponding to the middle vein. Knowing the LA anatomy may help to select the most suitable strategy during PVI. O061 OPTIMAL FLUOROSCOPIC PROJECTIONS FOR ANGIOGRAPHIC IMAGING OF THE LEFT ATRIUM APPENDAGE: LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE INTRAPROCEDURAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT ATRIUM AND PULMONARY VEINS Kriatselis C; Nedios S; Tang M; Gerds‐Li JH; Fleck E Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin Introduction: Percutaneous left atrium appendage (LAA) obliteration is a new strategy for prevention of embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Selective angiography of the LAA in standard fluoroscopic projections is used to identify the LAA ostium. Anatomical variability is an important limitation of this imaging approach. Methods: Hundred patients (67% men, age: 60 ± 12 years) undergoing a PV isolation procedure received intraprocedural rotational angiography and three‐dimensional reconstruction of the left atrium (LA), the pulmonary veins (PVs) and the LAA. For each patient, 33 angiographic projections, from RAO 80° to LAO 80°, in steps of 5°, were evaluated. Optimal projections of the LAA ostium were defined at sagittal plane: (i) clear identification of both superior and inferior segments of the LA–LAA junction and (ii) no overlapping between LA and LAA ostium. At frontal plane: (i) clear identification of all four quadrants of the LAA ostium and (ii) visualisation of the maximal horizontal ostial diameter. Results: A reconstruction of the LA, the PVs and the LAA was obtained for 97 patients. The optimal fluoroscopic projection for the LAA ostium in a sagittal plane was RAO 30 in 82 out of 100 patients (82%). Projections in RAO 25 and 35 were optimal in 71% of the patients. RAO 45 resulted in optimal sagittal LAA visualisation in 45%. The optimal ostial projection in a frontal plane for the LAA ostium was LAO 40 in 60 out of 100 patients (60%). Optimal LAA visualisation was feasible in 50% in LAO 45 projections and in 38% in LAO 35 projections. Conclusion: If selective angiography of the LAA is performed to facilitate implantation of an occlusion device, fluoroscopic projections should be carefully selected to avoid suboptimal visualisation. The preselected projections proposed in our study: RAO 30 and LAO 40 result in optimal sagittal and frontal angiographic projections of the LAA ostium respectively in the majority of patients. IMPLANTED CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS O062 ICD THERAPY IN THE ELDERLY: LONG‐TERM PREDICTORS OF BENEFIT AND MORTALITY Wolber T; Haegeli L; Steffel J; Schmid C; Duru F University Hospital Zurich Background: Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduces arrhythmic and all‐cause mortality in patients at high risk of sudden death. However, its clinical benefit in elderly patients is uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the long‐term efficacy of ICD treatment in elderly patients and to identify markers of successful ICD therapy and risk factors of mortality. Methods: We performed multivariate analysis of a prospective long‐term database from two tertiary care centres including 1118 consecutive patients implanted with an ICD. Predictors of ICD therapy and risk factors for mortality were assessed in patients aged 75 years or older at ICD implantation compared with younger patients. Results: The mean follow‐up time was 45 ± 40 months. The rates of ICD therapy were similar among both age groups. No significant predictors of ICD therapy could be identified among older patients. Median estimated survival was 165 months among patients younger than 75 years, and 81 months among those aged 75 and older (P = 0.004). Age (HR 1.23 per year; P = 0.05), reduced ejection fraction (HR 1.82 per 10% decline; P = 0.02) and impaired renal function (HR 1.40 per 10 ml/kg/m2 eGFR decline; P = 0.05) are risk factors of mortality in patients aged 75 years and older. However, mortality of older patients is similar to that of the age‐matched general population irrespective of the delivery of ICD therapy. Conclusion: ICD therapy is effective for treatment of life‐threatening arrhythmias in all age groups. However, prevention of sudden cardiac death may have limited impact on overall mortality in older patients. Despite a similar rate of appropriate ICD therapies, the risk of death is increased twofold in ICD recipients aged 75 years or older compared with younger patients. Patients with reduced ejection fraction and impaired renal function are at highest risk. O063 SERUM MARKERS OF COLLAGEN TURNOVER PREDICT FUTURE SHOCKS IN ICD RECIPIENTS WITH DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY ON OPTIMAL TREATMENT Kanoupakis EM; Kallergis EM; Mavrakis HE; Goudis CA; Saloustros IG; Koutalas EP; Chlouverakis GI; Vardas PE Cardiology Dpt, University Hospital of Heraklion Objectives: We investigated prospectively whether serum markers of collagen turnover could be used as predictors for the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with non‐ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDC) implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention. Methods: Serum C‐terminal propeptide of collagen type‐I (CICP), C‐terminal telopeptide of collagen type‐I (CITP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐1, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)‐1 were measured as markers of collagen synthesis and degradation in 70 patients with mildly to moderate symptomatic heart failure due to NIDC with LVEF <35%, who received an ICD for primary prevention of SCD. Patients were evaluated for any appropriate ICD delivered therapy, whether shock or antitachycardia pacing, during a 1‐year follow‐up period. Results: Appropriate device therapies were delivered in 14 of the 70 patients during the follow‐up period, with antitachycardia pacing in 2, antitachycardia pacing with shocks in 4, and shocks in 8. Preimplantation MMP‐1 levels were significantly higher in patients who had appropriate ICD‐delivered therapy than in those who did not have any therapy (27.7 ± 1.6 ng/ml vs. 24.1 ± 2.5 ng/ml, respectively, p < 0.001). The same was true for baseline serum concentrations of TIMP‐1 and CITP (89 ± 14 ng/ml vs. 58 ± 18 ng/ml, p = 0.008 and 0.46 ± 0.19 ng/ml vs. 0.19 ± 0.07 ng/ml, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Undoubtedly, ECM alterations play a crucial role in the constitution of an arrhythmogenic substrate in NIDC and, given the availability of therapies to prevent fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the quest for factors that have a very good correlation with appropriate ICD discharges in these patients is logical. Our results confirm the role of serum markers of collagen turnover as predictors of arrhythmic events in ICD recipients and could provide an auxiliary tool in this context. O064 EARLY DETECTION OF CHRONIC MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA IN A PATIENT IMPLANTED WITH AN ICD CAPABLE OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAM MONITORING Papavasileiou LP; Forleo GB; Santini L; Romeo F University of Rome "Tor Vergata". Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology. Rome, Ita We report the detection of intracardiac ST‐segment variation in a 75 year‐old man affected by ischemic heart disease; previous coronary artery by‐pass surgery (1983, 1995) previous percutaneous coronary treatment (2002, 2006) and ICD implantation (AnalyST Accel TM DR, St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, USA). During routine in‐clinic visits pacing thresholds were stable and no arrhythmic or ischemic events were documented. Remote monitoring with the Merlin system was provided, but unfortunately the patient was not able to use. In September 2010 he reported stress angina so antiischemic treatment was potentiated. The first week of January 2011 he was admitted to the emergency department for unstable angina. He reported that episodes of angina became more frequent and more graving since September. During ICD interrogation; 140 ST episodes were documented. During inspection of the intracardiac electrograms (IEGM) a clear ST segment depression >2 mm was documented initially for higher cardiac rate. A coronary angiogram (CA) was performed and two saphenous grafts (SVG), for obtuse marginal (OM) and right coronary artery (RCA), resulted occluded. The two grafts were patent in previous CA, performed in 2006. PCA and bare metal stent implantation was performed in native right coronary artery and SVG for OM. In March 2011, an in‐clinic ICD follow‐up was performed and no new ST events were documented and patient reported to be asymptomatic. Comment: We report the correct documentation of ST‐segment modification by the AnalyST Accel ICD in patient with stress angina. Of note, clinical manifestation of stress angina and myocardial ischemia, as reported by patient during last in clinic FU, preceded ST segment modification detected by the algorithm only by few days. In fact, patient reported reduction of angina threshold during time and the algorithm initially recognized ST modifications in high frequencies and over time reported episodes of ST depression for lower heart rates. O065 ROLE OF IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER‐DEFIBRILLATORS IN PATIENTS WITH LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES Gkouziouta A; Adamopoulos S; Leontiades E; Kostopoulou A; Elivanis ; Maounis T; Pavlides G; Voudris V; Bairaktaris A Onassis Cardiac Surgery Centre Purpose: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been used effectively as a "bridge" to cardiac transplantation and as destination therapy in patients with advanced heart failure(H.F.). Patients with H.F. are prone to ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation ‐VT/VF) and implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) reduce the morbidity and mortality. No indication guidelines for ICD implantation in patients with LVADs exist. We retrospectively reviewed the role of ICDs in patients with LVADs in our centre. Methods: 65 patients were supported with VADs since 2003 in the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Centre as a bridge to transplantation. 26 patients(40%)were supported with LVADs. Devices used were:HeartMate XVE, Novacor LVAS, LVAD Berlin Heart, INCOR LVAD and Heartware. All VT/VF and the type of therapy delivered by the ICDs were analyzed from time of LVAD implantation. Concurrent anti‐arrhythmic medications were documented. Results: Indications for LVADs were non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in 65% and ischemic cardiomyopathy in 35%.19(73%)patients had ICDs implanted prior to VAD implantation. VT/VF occurred in 10 patients (52.5%)(8 non‐ischemic and 2 ischemic) post‐LVAD. 7 patients were defibrillated while antitachycardia pacing was utilized in 8 of them. All of them were in heart failure treatment(including amiodarone)and 3 of them were on anti‐arrhythmic medications (mexilitine, or procainamide). 4 patients had a single VT/VF event which was terminated by the ICDs and did not require any management changes. A pt died of intractable VT/VF in another hospital due to complications of an unsuccessful ablation. Conclusions: Patients on LVAD support have VT/VF events. Anti‐arrhythmic drugs were not always successful in terminating VT/VF. ICDs terminated these events and may contribute to decreased morbidity and mortality in patients with LVADs. Prospective studies analysing their role would provide guidelines for ICD implantation in patients on LVADs. O066 THE EFFECT OF REMOTE MONITORING ON JAPANESE CRT‐D PATIENTS Nakajima J; Suga C; Wakaba H; Hirahara T; Sugawara Y; Ako J; Momomura S Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Japan Abstract: Recently, device remote monitoring (RM) has been applied in clinical settings especially in heart failure. However, the effect of RM for heart failure practice is controversial. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of RM for heart failure on cardiac resynchronization therapy‐defibrillator (CRT‐D) patients in our institution. Methods and Results: We retrospectively analyzed hospital files of fifty‐seven CRT‐D consecutive patients who were followed up in our out‐patient clinic every three‐four months; thirty patients were out‐patient clinic only (non‐RM group), and twenty‐seven patients were in addition controlled with RM (RM group). There were no differences between two groups regarding clinical background, i.e., NYHA functional class, serum BNP, and QRS duration. Kaplan‐Meier curves of clinical adverse event free rates were obtained. During a median follow‐up of 865.4 ± 445.6 days, clinical adverse events were death in nine patients (two in RM group, and seven in non‐RM group), and heart failure hospitalization in nineteen patients (nine and ten respectively). Three device‐related adverse events also occurred, one in RM group and two in non‐RM group. As comparing the RM group with non‐RM group, Kaplan‐Meier curves of clinical adverse events did not show statistically significant difference. Conclusion: RM failed to show clinical benefit in terms of reducing the clinical adverse events in CRT‐D patients. We need to consider how to utilize the information from RM to improve clinical outcome of heart failure patients. O067 PATTERNS OF ICD USE IN PATIENTS ENLISTED FOR HEART TRANSPLANTATION: A SINGLE CENTRE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS 2006–2010 Sedlacek K; Jurkuvenas P; Hoskova L; Malek I; Kautzner J IKEM, Clinic of Cardiology, Videnska 1958/9, 140 21 Prague, Czech Republic Purpose and methods: We retrospectively analyzed indications for ICD (and CRT‐D) use and occurrence of appropriate ICD therapies in patients enlisted for heart transplantation between 2006–2010. Potentially life‐saving therapy was defined as ventricular tachycardia (≥ 150 bpm) or fibrillation, adequately terminated by antitachycardia pacing or shock. Results: During the study period, 223 patients were enlisted for heart transplantation. Among 89 non‐urgent candidates receiving an ICD, 36 patients were implanted at the time of the waiting list enrollment ("bridging" indication; mean time on the waiting list 301 days; mean time from implant to transplantation 367 days) and 53 received an ICD earlier (conventional primary or secondary indication; mean time on the waiting list 180 days; mean time from implant to transplantation 729 days). In the bridging strategy group, potentially life‐saving therapies were recorded in 8 patients (22%; 3 with ischemic and 5 with non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy). In the conventional indication group, appropriate ICD therapy was registered in 19 patients (36%; 9 with ischemic and 10 with nonischemic cardiomyopathy). The incidence of potentially life‐saving therapies was thus 19% per year in both groups with minimal difference between ischemic and non‐ischemic disease etiology. Among 16 patients who died during the study period, no sudden death was identified. Nine of the deceased patients had an ICD and 3 of them received potentially life‐saving therapies unrelated to their cause of death. Conclusions: ICD was effective in preventing of sudden cardiac death in patients enlisted for heart transplantation. The rate of adequate therapies justifies consideration of ICD bridging indication in ambulatory patients waiting for heart transplantation. Cost‐effectiveness is probably limited by the short time between implantation and heart transplantation comprising approximately year in this study. O068 LONG‐TERM FOLLOW‐UP OF PATIENTS RECEIVING ICDS FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION IN THE ISLAND OF CRETE Kanoupakis EM; Koutalas EP; Mavrakis HE; Kallergis EM; Saloustros IG; Stokkos K; Psathakis E; Solidakis G; Vardas PE Cardiology Dpt, University Hospital of Heraklion Crete Introduction: Implantation of ICDs has proven its efficacy in various subgroups of patients having experienced spontaneous malignant arrhythmic episodes. However, relative scarcity of data exists regarding long‐term follow‐up outcomes of this population in the context of tertiary hospitals‐ICD implantation centres beyond randomized clinical trials borders. In the following analysis the survival and the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy for ventricular arrhythmias in patients who underwent ICD implantation at our institution, the only in the island of Crete, was examined. Methods and Results: We acquired data from patients with ischemic (ICM), non‐ischemic dilated (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies as well as in patients with inherited channelopathies who received an ICD from 1997 to 2009 for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Of 188 ICD recipients 53 deaths were observed (28.2%). Median survival was 118 months (95% CI: 100–135). Eighty six patients (45.7%) had ICD therapy. Of the delivered therapies, 16,3% were inappropriate. Median shock‐free survival was 64 months (95% CI: 53.8–74.2). Median survival between the largest subgroups, ICM and DCM patients, differs in favor of DCM ones in a statistically marginal non‐significant way (89 months vs 131 months, p = 0.053. Conclusion: In a close geographical region, where the general level of health care is good and well appreciated by the population, the survival and the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy for ventricular arrhythmias is in accordance with that of the international large trials. O069 THE ACCURACY OF THORACIC IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT BY CARDIOVASCULAR IMPLANTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS Kimura R; Inoue K; Toyoshima Y; Doi A; Masuda M; Sotomi Y; Iwakura K; Fujii K Sakurabashi Watanabe Hospital The measurement of thoracic impedance by implantable device (Medtronic Optivol) is expected to be useful for early detection of heart failure, but the accuracy of thoracic impedance measurement in human body is not yet fully investigated. Here we report two cases of heart failure and chronic dialysis. Case 1 with ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class III, QRS width 210 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) 35% with dyssynchrony, underwent CRTD (Medtronic Concerto) implantation. After 4 months the patient was admitted because of heart failure. The trend chart of the thoracic impedance showed the distinctive pattern of oscillation. The thoracic impedance increased from the baseline value during the therapy for heart failure. Case 2 with dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class III, QRS width 160 ms, EF 21% with dyssynchrony, underwent CRTD (Medtronic Concerto) implantation. After 4 months the patient was admitted because of pneumonia and heart failure. The trend chart of the thoracic impedance also showed the distinctive pattern of oscillation. The thoracic impedance slightly decreased during the therapy for heart failure. In both cases, it is important to note that the increase and the decrease of the thoracic impedance perfectly coincided with the schedule of dialysis on a daily basis. Thus, the trend chart of the thoracic impedance showed the distinctive pattern of periodical oscillation. Those patients had dialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The thoracic impedance sharply increased on these days, and rapidly decreased on other days without exception. This fact clearly indicates that the measurement of thoracic impedance has enough accuracy and temporal resolution to detect the daily change of the fluid status in human body before and after dialysis. Though the algorithm to calculate thoracic impedance index (Optivol index) seems to have room for refinement, the thoracic impedance monitoring for the detection of heart failure is feasible. O070 OCCURRENCE OF ICD INTERVENTIONS INFLUENCES THE OUTCOME OF PATIENTS IMPLANTED FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Svetlosak M; Sasov M; Leclercq C; Martins R; Daubert JC; Mabo P; Hatala R National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia Background: Occurrence of appropriate (AI) or inappropriate (InI) ICD interventions relates to a worse prognosis of patients implanted for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) post myocardial infarction (MI). However, less is known about their prognostic value in patients implanted for secondary preventative reasons in the era of modern reperfusion therapy of MI. Aim: To analyze the impact of ICD interventions (AI or InI) on mortality in a secondary preventative cohort of post‐MI patients. Methods: This retrospective analysis included all consecutive post‐MI patients implanted with an ICD for secondary SCD prevention in a single centre between 2000 and 2007 (n = 148; mean age 65 ± 10 years; mean left ventricular ejection fraction 33 ± 8%). We analyzed the total mortality of patients with AI comparing to the other patients. The impact of InI or ICD shocks for any reason was studied thereafter in the same way. Results: After a mean follow‐up of 51 ± 27 months we found at least one AI in 96 (65%) and at least one InI in 37 (25%) patients, 27 (18%) patients had both AI and InI, 37 (25%) patients died. Patients experiencing an AI had a significantly higher mortality comparing to the others (OR 2,92; 95% CI 1,18–7,23; P = 0,02). There was a non‐significant trend for a higher mortality in the group with InI (32% vs. 23%; P = 0,23). However, when only ICD shocks irrespective of their appropriateness were considered, they were associated with a higher mortality (OR 2,32; 95% CI 1,05–5,15; P = 0,04). Conclusion: In our cohort of consecutive patients with ICD implanted in the setting of secondary prevention of SCD after MI, AI and ICD shocks (delivered as AI or InI) were related to a higher mortality. These findings correspond to the data from primary preventative post‐MI ICD populations and highlight the need for a careful follow‐up and management of the underlying disease in patients experiencing an AI, as well as the use of algorithms minimizing ICD shocks. O071 IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER‐DEFIBRILLATORS IN ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA: A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE Hatzinikolaou‐Kotsakou E; Kotsakou M; Latsios P; Reppas E; Moschos G; Beleveslis T; Tsakiridis K Electrophysiology Department Saint Luke's Hospital‐Thessaloniki‐Greece Introduction: Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD) is associated with potential life‐threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden death. Our purpose was to study the outcome of ARVD patients treated with an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD). Methods and Results: We included 28 ARVD patients(pts) with ICD (60% male, ages 15–58, median 36). Twenty four pts for secondary prevention and for primary prevention 4 pts. Primary prevention based: 1) on the clinical criteria 2) EP study findings and 3) familiar history. The mean follow‐up was 35 ± 18 months. Complications associated with ICD implantation included need for lead repositioning (n = 4). During follow‐up, one patient underwent heart transplantation. During this period 19/28 (70%) pts received a mean of 4.7 (range 2–68) appropriate ICD therapies. Two (50%) of the pts who underwent ICD implantation for primary prevention had appropriate ICD discharges. The median period between ICD implantation and the first shock was 6‐months. ICD electrical storms were observed in 3 pts. Inappropriate shocks were seen in 9 pts. Predictors of appropriate therapy were fulfillment of the ARVD criteria (82% vs 25% respectively, p < 0.001), the frequency of the daily PVCs > 3.500 (72% vs 29% respectively, p < 0.001) induction of VT during EPS (70% vs 35% respectively, p < 0.001), syncope (82% vs 31% respectively, p < 0.001) and severe RV dysfunction in echocardiography (69% vs 14% respectively, p < 0.02). The inappropriate shocks were seen in patients with very frequent atrial tachyarrhythmias. Conclusions: Patients with ARVD have a high arrhythmia rate requiring appropriate ICD therapies. ICD treatment appears to be well tolerated and effective in the management of patients with ARVD. O072 WORK BURDEN OF CLINICIAN IN REMOTE MONITORING OF IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER‐DEFIBRILLATORS Papavasileiou LP; Panattoni G; Santini L; Mahfouz K; Schirripa V; Magliano G; Vecchio F; Minni V; Forleo GB; Romeo F University of Rome "Tor Vergata," Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Rome, Italy Background: The efficacy, accuracy and safety of remote monitoring (RM) as well as patient's satisfaction is well demonstrated. Work burden of remote monitoring has not be estimated. In addition in most European countries reimbursement schemes of RM clinics are currently unavailable. Our study aimed to establish the work burden related to RM. Methods: Consecutive patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) were enrolled to RM. Parameters analyzed: total work hours (WH) of follow‐up with RM, WH/patient, total WH/patient in RM vs total WH/patient without RM. Results: 119 patients with mean follow‐up of 13,5 ± 12,4 months. 19 patients were unable to perform transmissions and so exclude from the study. The network received 843 transmissions. Mean number of transmissions per patient was 8,5. There were 514 event‐free transmissions while 329 transmissions regarded one or more events. Total WH used in RM were 308,55 (80 hours for training visits and first in clinic visit, reviewing event‐free transmissions 26 h, 27 hours for reviewing transmissions with events, 12,25 hours for transtelephonic contact of patients and 163,3 hours for in clinic visits of patients after transmissions or transtelephonic contact). WH/pt with RM was 3,08 while WH/pt without RM was 1,6. Statistical analysis' resulted to be significant regarding total WH but not regarding WH/pt with RM (p < 0,0001 and p = ns, respectively). Conclusions: Work burden of clinician is superior in patients with remote monitoring. In order to expand remote monitoring in all patients reimbursement formulas should be made. O073 EARLY DETECTION OF A SPRINT FIDELIS LEAD FRACTURE WITH THE CARE LINK MONITORING SYSTEM. Papavasileiou LP; Schirripa V; Minni V; Panattoni G; Sergi D; Mahfouz K; Santini L; Forleo GB; Magliano G; Romeo F Department of Cardiology, University of Rome "Tor Vergata," Rome, Italy In October 2007, Medtronic's vigilance process announced that the Sprint Fidelis high‐voltage implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) lead (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is prone to fracture and voluntarily removed it from the market. The advisory recommended the use of lead impedance monitoring alerts to identify impending lead fractures in order to reduce the adverse events, including inappropriate shocks. We report the case of a 75 years old patient with an In Sync ICD implanted in October 2007 in primary prevention. Routine in clinic follow‐up revealed stable impedance thresholds (448 Ohm). At September 2010 patient was provided with Carelink remote monitoring system and he performed first manual transmission on January 2011. During inspection of transmission lead impedance was out of range (1088 Ohm) and short VV intervals were 7. Patient was immediately asked to reach the emergency room of our hospital. During ICD interrogation data confirmed imminent fracture of lead. Patient did not recognize the audible alerts. When asked he confirmed hearing alerts, but he failed to recognize them. The patient was hospitalized and the next day a new ICD lead was implanted through the subclavian vein. This is the first report of successful prevention of lead failure of Sprint Fidelis lead with the Care Link remote monitoring system. It is reported that With RV Pacing Impedance Alert set to 1,000 ohms, 47% of patients would have four or more days notice, an additional 2% would have two days notice, and an additional 2% would have one day notice. The ICD lead fracture might induce inappropriate intervention and in extreme cases might be fatal. The remote monitoring systems automatically perform transmissions in case of lead integrity alerts and/or clinical‐arrhythmic events. Extended use of RM systems can help fast and correct detection of technical or clinical problems regarding patients with implantable devices. PACING O074 IMPACT OF MULTIPLE PACING SITES ON LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY Kaladaridou A; Bramos D; Skaltsiotes I; Kottis G; Papadopoulou E; Daskalakis C; Agrios I; Matthaios I; Antoniou A; Toumanidis ST Dpt. Of Clinical Therapeutics, Medical School, University of Athens, Purpose: Left ventricular (LV) torsion and apical rotation(rotap),are very important contributors to LV performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of simultaneous multiple pacing (P)sites on LV function including rotational and torsional parameters in intact myocardium. Methods: In 9 healthy pigs atrio‐ventricular epicardial P in multiple P sites was performed simultaneously. Classic right ventricular apical(RVap)P was combined with: 1) LVapex lateral 2) LV basal posterior 3) RV basal anterior 4) RV basal anterior+LV basal posterior. Moreover, 5) LV basal posterior+ LVapex lateral, 6) LV basal posterior+RV basal anterior and 7) RV basal anterior+LV apex lateral P in a random order were performed. LV torsion was calculated by measuring LV basal and apical rotation from basal and apical short‐axis epicardial planes with speckle‐tracking technique using EchoPac software. LV torsion, ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output(CO), rotap, untwisting rate in sinus rhythm were compared to every P combination. Results: CO reduced significantly in:RVap+LVbasal posterior, RVap+RV basal anterior, RVap+RV basal anterior+LV basal posterior, LV basal posterior+LVapex lateral and LVbasal posterior+RVbasal anterior P in comparison to CO in sinus rhythm. EF and LV torsion in sinus rhythm revealed superior in comparison to EF and LV torsion in every P combination. Rotap reduced significantly in: RVap+LVapex lateral, RVap+LV basal posterior, RVap+RVbasal anterior, RVap+RVbasal anterior+LVbasal posterior and RVbasal anterior+ LVapex lateral P. Finally, untwisting rate reduced significantly in: RVap+LVapex lateral, RVap+LV basal posterior, RVap+RVbasal anterior+LV basal posterior, LV basal posterior+LVapex lateral P in comparison to untwisting rate in sinus rhythm. Conclusions: Different combinations of multiple pacing sites did not increase haemodynamic and rotational deformation parameters of intact LV myocardium. O075 INITIAL EXPERIENCE WITH A NEW MAGNETIC RESONANCE CONDITIONAL PACEMAKER SYSTEM UNDERGOING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE PROMRI SINGLE CENTER PILOT STUDY Wollmann C; Vock P; Steiner E; Mayr H Hospital of St. Pölten‐Lilienfeld, Dep. of Cardiology Introduction: The purpose of our study is to evaluate safety of a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conditional pacemaker (PM) system (Evia SR‐T and DR‐T with Safio S53/S60 active screw‐in leads, Biotronik SE & Co KG, Berlin, Germany) under MRI conditions. We report preliminary results of the ProMRI single center pilot study. Methods: Patients implanted with Evia SR‐T or DR‐T PM and Safio leads at our institution are eligible for enrollment in this single center prospective non‐randomized pilot study. Patients undergo a non‐diagnostic MRI of the brain and the lumbar spine at 1.5 Tesla. PM are interrogated before and after MRI to assess potential changes of lead parameters (right atrial (RA)/right ventricular (RV) sensing [mV], pacing threshold [PT, V/0.4 ms], pacing impedance [Ohm]). Patients are followed for 3 months with in‐hospital visits at 4 weeks and 3 months after MRI. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD. Results: By now, 27 patients (female 11, age 74 ± 10 years, higher degree AV block 10, sick sinus syndrome 5, atrial fibrillation with significant bradycardia 12, dual chamber PM 13) were enrolled in the study. Twenty‐three patients completed the 4 weeks FU by now and 11 patients the 3 month FU, respectively. Except for RV pacing impedance paired Student's t‐test revealed no significant changes of lead dependent parameters when comparing measurements immediately before and after MRI. When comparing lead measurements assessed immediately before MRI with measurements assessed at the 1 month and 3 month FU, no statistically significant differences were found. One‐way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences for all parameters when comparing all available FU. No MRI related adverse events occurred. Conclusion: The new MRI conditional Evia pacemaker system demonstrated unobtrusive function under MRI conditions. Observed differences in lead measurements between the different follow‐ups were in clinically accepted ranges. O076 THE EFFECT OF AAI AND DDD PACING MODE ON LEFT VENTRICULAR STRAIN, TWIST AND CORONARY FLOW PARAMETERS Papadopoulou E; Kalantaridou A; Hatzidou S; Pamboucas C; Toumanidis S; Antoniou A Dpt. of Clinical Therapeutics, Athens Medical School, Alexandra hospital, Athens, Greece Background: RV apical pacing may induce detrimental effects on left ventricular (LV) function and coronary flow. In this study we evaluated the effect of DDD and AAI pacing mode on cardiac mechanics and potential changes on coronary blood flow. Methods: This preliminary study included 14 patients who have received DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome or carotid sinus syndrome and presented with sinus rhythm at their regularly scheduled visit at the pacemaker clinic. All patients had their ventricular lead placed in the RV apex. Patients underwent a complete transthoracic echocardiographic examination while in sinus rhythm and subsequently underwent non‐invasive Doppler assessment of coronary flow in the LAD and speckle tracking echo of basal and apical short‐axis planes during AAI and DDD pacing mode for 5 min with a 5 min interval in sinus rhythm. Results: Rotation of the base was significantly decreased in DDD pacing compared to AAI pacing (−7.44 ± 2.55o vs. −5.26 ± 2.85o, p = 0.012) as well as LV twist (17,65 ± 4.12o vs. 13.99 ± 5.5o, p = 0.05). Time to peak basal rotation during DDD pacing (expressed as percentage of systole) was significantly shortened (98.8%± 2.06% vs. 86.21%± 10.48%, p = 0.002). Circumferential strain of the base and time to peak significantly deteriorated in DDD compared to AAI pacing (−16.41 ± 3.00% vs. −13.65 ± 4.60%, p = 0.04 and 97.25%± 7.00% vs. 103.64%± 8.72%, p = 0.04 respectively). Apical rotation and circumferential strain did not change significantly. Flow in the LAD, expressed as velocity–time integral, decreased significantly in DDD pacing (10.42 ± 2.49 cm vs. 9.12 ± 1.94 cm, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Acute DDD pacing mode showed a detrimental effect on LV twist, rotation of the base and in LAD flow in comparison to AAI pacing mode. Further study is needed to support the above preliminary data. O077 INACCURACY OF THE 12‐LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM IN PREDICTING LEAD POSITION IN RIGHT VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW TRACT PACING Salahuddin S; Sharma G; Jagia P; Sharma S; Bahl VK All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India Introduction: The 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and fluoroscopic landmarks are usually the only guides available to achieve a true septal location in right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) pacing. These have, however, not been properly anatomically validated. We sought to validate these using cardiac computed tomographic (CT) angiography to confirm lead position within the RVOT. Methods: 34 patients with pacemaker leads in the RVOT position were subjected to a cardiac CT angiogram (64‐slice Dual Source Siemens Definition) for lead localization within the RVOT as anterior, free wall or septal location. 12‐lead ECGs were analysed during forced pacing. Fluoroscopic images of the pacemaker leads were also obtained in 4 standard views‐AP, LAO, RAO and lateral views. Results: Cardiac CT angiography was performed in 34 patients with a mean age of 59 ± 13 years (25 males). 17 patients (50%) were found to have an anterior lead location within the RVOT, while 17 (50%) had a septal position. Mean QRS axis and QRS duration did not differ significantly among the two groups (QRS axis: 71 ± 5.4° vs 74 ± 4.3° (P‐0.20) and QRS duration: 153 ± 21.1 vs 148 ± 19.3 msec (P‐0.55) for anterior versus septal respectively). A negative QRS in lead I could not distinguish an anterior from a septal lead location (10/17 vs 13/17, P‐0.46, anterior vs septal). Similarly, notching in none of the limb leads, including inferior leads, was helpful in differentiating the two groups. In the fluoroscopic LAO view, the lead was directed rightward in all 17 patients with septal location, but also in 14/17 patients in the anterior location (P‐0.22).The lateral view revealed posterior direction of lead in 12/17 patients with septal location, and in only 3/17 patients with anterior lead location (P‐0.003). Conclusions: Conventional ECG criteria are inaccurate in differentiating septal from anterior RVOT pacing. Also, the fluoroscopic LAO view is insufficient in predicting septal lead placement. O078 SHORT TERM EFFECT OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW TRACT COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL APICAL PACING ON LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION AND SYNCHRONY IN PATIENTS WITH NORMAL BASELINE CARDIAC FUNCTION Sharma G; Singh H; Patel C; Ray A; Sharma P; Bahl VK All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India Objectives: Chronic ventricular pacing is known to adversely affect left ventricular (LV) function. We sought to have an objective assessment of LV function and dyssynchrony in patients with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and RV apical (RVA) pacing using equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA). Methods: Thirty three patients who underwent dual‐chamber, rate‐modulated (DDDR) pacemaker implantation were prospectively included. All patients had no history of cardiac disease and baseline normal left ventricular function. Out of 33 patients, 19 had pacemaker lead positioned at RVOT site and 14 at the RVA site. All patients underwent ERNA within 2 week post pacemaker implantation and at 6 month follow‐up. All studies were acquired under forced pacing at heart rate of 100/min. Standard deviation of LV mean phase angle (SD LV mPA) expressed in degrees, which was derived by Fourier first harmonic analysis of phase images was used to quantify left intra‐ventricular synchrony and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were evaluated at baseline and at follow up. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the RVA and RVOT groups at baseline with respect to LVEF (52.9 ± 6.38% vs. 50.8 ± 6.70%; p 0.271) and SD LV mPA (13.3°± 7.36° vs. 14.4°± 6.17°; p 0.412). Similarly, no significant difference was observed between the groups at 6 month follow up (LVEF 51.3 ± 9.07% vs. 51.5 ± 9.48%; p 0.855, SD LV mPA 15.3°± 9.23° vs. 15.1°± 5.24°; p 0.560). Conclusions: No significant difference in LVEF & LV synchrony was observed between RVOT and RVA pacing in patients with normal baseline LV function at 6 month follow‐up. A longer follow up with ERNA annually is underway to see the effect of chronic pacing from the two locations. O079 CLOSED LOOP STIMULATION IMPROVE HAEMODINAMIC RESPONSE DURING MENTAL STRESS TEST Proietti R; Manzoni GM; Castenuovo G; Lombardi L; Vegliante N; Pietrabissa G; Quaglia C; Spoto A; Sagone A Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory Luigi Sacco Hospital. Milan. Italy Cloose Loop Stimulation (CLS) algorithm is a form of rate adaptive pacing, able to provide an effective pacing rate profile not only during physical exercise but although during mental stress. To test this hypothesis CLS or accelerometers sensor (AS) rate response was compared intraindividually during a mental stress test. Methods: 36 patients (mean age 76 ± 9)implanted with a VVI‐CLS Cylos Biotronik underwent mental stress test in different pacing configuration: non‐rate adaptive mode (VVI), accelerometer sensor (AS) mode (VVIR), and CLS respectively. A modified Stroop test was used in order to induce mental stress. Heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pacing percentage burden were collected for 5 minutes before, during and 5 minutes after the test. Results: Our study show that the average peak HR during mental stress test was significantly higher in CLS configuration than in AS and non adaptive mode. Further the average HR increase (calculated as the difference in minimum HR and the HR peak) during mental stress test was wider in CLS configuration than in VVIR and VVI. Finally, the percentage of pacing beats during mental stress test was higher in CLS configuration than with the other algorithms.

O080 AAIsafer PACING REDUCES THE PERCENTAGE OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR PACING IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING PULSE GENERATOR REPLACEMENT. Stazi F; Mampieri M; Verde M; Cardinale M Dipartimento Apparato Cardiocircolatorio, A O. San Giovanni Addolorata, Roma. CLI Foundation Introduction: Several trials have shown that high percentages of right ventricular pacing (RVP) induce an increased risk of mortality and heart failure, particularly when the RVP percentage is > 40%. Accordingly, the AAISafeR® (Sorin Group) algorithm was specifically developed to decrease the RVP. The aim of this study was to assess if this pacing mode actually decreased the unnecessary RVP in patients undergoing pulse generator replacement. Methods: Thirty‐six patients (M = 20, F = 16, mean age 80 ± 7 years) with standard DDD pulse generators (22 for sinus node disease and 14 for atrioventricular block) underwent generator replacement with a device programmed with the AAIsafeR algorithm. Results: Pre‐replacement analysis of the 36 patients showed a mean RVP percentage of 82 ± 28% and 31/36 (86%) had a RVP percentage > 40%. Twenty‐three days after the pulse generator replacement the mean RVP percentage was 21 ± 36% (p < 0,0001 compared to the pre‐replacement analysis) and only 9 patients (25%) had a RVP percentage > 40%. Conclusions: In our study, that uses the same patients as the control of themselves, the AAIsafeR algorithm significantly decreases the RVP percentage compared to the standard DDD stimulation. O081 AV NODAL ABLATION AND PACING FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF) AND HEART FAILURE (HF) – LONG TERM EXPERIENCE Obel IWP; Daniels J; Marcer G Milpark Hospital, Johannesburg, ZA Atrial fibrillation commonly accompanies heart failure. When heart failure is severe (NYHA grade III‐IV) the prognosis is extremely poor. AV node ablation provides excellent rate control but adds ventricular dyssynchrony unless bi‐ventricular pacing is instituted. Method: 407 Patients (26% female) have been followed for up to 19 years (m = 4.68 yrs). Age m = females 67.5 years, males 64 years. All patients had chronic AF with poor rate control. NYHA III‐IV = 220 patients (54%) all receiving optimal medical therapy and monitoring. Bi‐ventricular pacing (BiV) was instituted initially for broad QRS or previously paced patients or as clinically indicated following AV nodal ablation and RV pacing. 189 patients received BiV pacing. Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) – 73 (59%), non‐ischaemic cardiomyopathy – 89 (28%). Follow up by referring doctors and others at pacemaker clinic. Underlying heart disease included ischaemic heart disease (25% female, 71% male), cardiomyopathy (41% female, 59% male), valve disease (56% female, 44% male) and miscellaneous (58% female, 42% male). Results: There were 142 deaths. 38% non cardiovascular and 21% unknown. Heart failure deaths (14.8%) were more frequent in ischaemic patients. The effect of or delay to bi‐ventricular pacing did not appear to support the concept of routine bi‐ventricular pacing in this group of patients. Disease aetiology appeared to have a greater influence on mortality than mode of pacing. This may represent the effects of case selection for BiV pacing. The shortcomings of Warfarin as an anticoagulant in the real world situation are profound. Conclusion: AV node pace and ablate is an attractive and simple approach to uncontrollable AF and HF. Better anticoagulation is essential. O082 THE EFFECT OF THE RIGHT VENTRICULAR MID‐SEPTAL PACING FOR LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION AND HEMODYNAMICS STATUS IN PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION Baimbetov AK; Iskakova BK; Moldabekov TK; Oshakbayev KP Republican Scientific Center of Emergency Medical Care, National Medical Holding, Kazakhstan Purpose: To compare the effect between the right ventricular apex (RVA) pacing and the right ventricular mid‐septal (RVMS) pacing for left ventricular function and hemodynamics status in patients with bradyarrhythmias. Methods: We observed 58 patients (age 59 ± 19 years, 19 men), who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation suffering from AV block III. We evaluated 28 patients with RVMS‐pacing and 30 patients with RVA‐pacing. Left atrial volume index, Pulsed‐wave Doppler‐derived mitral inflow indices, colour M‐mode flow propagation velocities (Vp), Tissue Doppler measurements of systolic and diastolic (e') velocities at four mitral annular sites and mitral E/e' ratio, were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography, before and 6 month after implantation. Results: Permanent RVA‐pacing contributes to increase inter‐ & intra‐ventricular dyssynchrony and to increase pressure into the left atrium that lead to diastolic dysfunction of LV, as a result mechanical dyssynchrony caused by dyssynergia of systolic activation of walls LV. However, RVMS‐pacing procedure did not lead to increase intraventricular dyssynchrony and to impairment of hemodynamics status of LV. Conclusion: This study reveals that permanent RVMS‐pacing procedure contributes to less left ventricular dysfunction and mechanical dyssynchrony of walls LV compared with a conventional RVA‐pacing procedure in patients with permanent pacemaker implantation. O083 IS LEFT SIDED SINGLE LEAD VDD OR DDD PACING FEASIBLE? Obel IWP; Daniels J; Camps T; Smeets P; Obel OA; Lindemans F Milpark Hospital, Johannesburg, ZA Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) can provide great relief for heart failure patients. However, ± 30% of heart failure patients (pts) do not respond. Most attention has been centered on the site of the LV lead, provision of optimal LV filling and an excess of intravascular/cardiac leads. Intra‐atrial delay (sensed or paced) may contribute to poor left sided A‐V timing. We explored the possibility of a single lead, capable of sensing and pacing both left atrium and left ventricle, optimally placed in the coronary sinus (CS) to address these problems. Methods: Five prototypes were implanted in pts with standard CRT indications including 13 pts with chronic atrial fibrillation. In total, 36 pts received 1 of 5 prototypes. Underlying heart disease; ischaemic cardiomyopathy (18), non‐ischaemic cardiomyopathy (16), sinus node disease where right atrial pacing was impossible (1) and congenital heart block/single venous access (1). In 5 pts intra atrial conduction (pace or sense RA) was tested. Results: The site of the atrial bipole was the proximal CS, regardless of the final site of LV lead (9F lead placed without sheath or guide wire). Pacing and sensing results are given in the table below: LA Sense mVLA PaceLV Sense mVLV PaceV@0.5msV@0.5msAcute3.581.813.221.28(1.5–7.1)(1–3)(5.6–34)(0.4–3.0)Chronic (m = 21.4 months)10 ± 4.8mV1.8 ± 2.5V* Not possible in 2 pts Pacing and LV pacing was satisfactory up to 4 yrs with one LV lead displacement. Intra atrial conduction time increased from 97 ms to 147 ms with RA pacing. Time from LA sense to RV (at permanent RV site) was 83 ms longer from RA than LV. In the last 7 pts R‐wave size was measured via the atrial (CS) electrode and varied from 1.0–8.0 mV. Conclusion: Our experience showed the potential value and feasibility of long term single lead, left sided atrioventricular pacing. O084 LONG‐TERM RESULT OF THE CLINICAL TREATMENT FOR PACEMAKER INFECTION WITH VACUUM‐ASSISTED WOUND CLOSURE (VAC) Satsu T; Saga T; Onoe M; Miyashita N Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kinki University, School of Medicine Background: Although pacemaker infection is a rare, but life‐threatening complication, the optimal treatment of such infections is poorly defined in the literature. Methods: We describe 9 cases (8 patients), treated for an infected pacemaker at our and colleague institutes between 2008 and 2011. The pacemaker generator was partially exposed in four patients. The pacemaker pockets were fenestrated and treated with vacuum‐assisted wound closure (VAC). Results: Purulent fluid cultures were positive for methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus (four cases), methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus (four cases), and Bacillus cereus (one case). Infection was eradicated in eight patients without the need for aggressive surgery or removal of the intra‐vascular lead. Fenestrated wounds in two cases were re‐sutured without replacement of the entire pacemaker system. The others were implanted with new pacemakers in the contra‐lateral side after removing the infected generator. However, in only a case (73‐year‐old man, who had been operated for pacemaker implantation before 42 days) VAC did not lead to eradicate the infection, and intra‐vascular lead was removed using traction. A pacemaker became infected again in one patient without removing the entire pacemaker system nine months later. The VAC therapy was repeated and the infection was eradicated by removing the pacemaker generator but not the intra‐vascular lead. The mean durations of VAC and hospitalization were 30.3 and 47.4 days, respectively. The patients remained completely asymptomatic after VAC, with no evidence of recurrent infection for 1–41 months (mean: 24.6 months) after discharge. Conclusions: Although complete removal of an infected pacemaker system is essential, less invasive VAC might serve as the first option for treating pacemaker infection when the risk of total system explantation is high, such as among the very elderly. O085 SAME DAY CONTRALATERAL DEVICE IMPLANTATION IN PATIENTS WITH POCKET INFECTION UNDERGOING DEVICE EXTRACTION Mountantonakis SE; Tschabrunn CM; Cooper J Electrophysiology Section, Division of Cardiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA Introduction: Minimal data exist regarding the timing of device reimplantation following an extraction for infection. Pacemaker‐dependent patients pose a management challenge, given the ongoing need for pacing support after infected device extraction, but with the risk of infection of newly implanted hardware. Methods: Clinical and procedure‐related data were retrospectively collected on pacemaker‐dependent patients who underwent device and lead extraction for local pocket infection only, and who had a new contralateral device implanted on the same day, to investigate outcomes. Results: 15 patients (11 male, mean age 77, range 58–93) with pacemaker‐dependence underwent device (8 pacemaker, 4 ICD, 3 bi‐v ICD) and complete lead extraction (mean 2.5 leads per patient, range 1–5; mean implant duration 6.2 years, range 6 weeks‐16 years) for simple pocket erosion or purulent pocket infection, but negative blood cultures and no evidence of systemic infection. Femoral vein temporary pacing support was used during the extraction and a new contralateral permanent device was implanted on the same day, following a new complete sterile prep (9 pacemaker, 5 ICD, 1 bi‐v ICD). The infected pocket was managed with debridement with full capsule resection (sent for culture), and primary wound closure except for leaving the wound end open with a Penrose drain in place. Intravenous antibiotics were used prior to the procedure and continued for a mean of 2 days post‐procedure, with oral antibiotics used thereafter for a mean course of 2 weeks. All infected pockets healed, with daily dressing changes and gradual withdrawal of the drain. No infections of the new device system occurred, with a mean follow‐up of 32 months (range 4–66 months). Conclusions: In the setting of simple device erosion and pocket infection a new contralateral device can be implanted on the same day as the extraction. This strategy can be particularly useful in patients with pacemaker‐dependence. O086 SAFETY AND ELECTRICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE NEW CAPSUREFIX MRI LEAD IN PATIENTS WITH STANDARD PACING INDICATION Pignalberi C; Lacopino S; Santini L; Piraino L; Calò L; Bongiorni MG; Aquilani S; Magris B; Forleo G; Santini M San Filippo Neri Hospital – Department of Cardiology, Roma Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used non‐invasive imaging modalities because of its unique ability to discriminate soft tissues. We aimed to evaluate long‐term clinical outcomes and electrical performances of first MRI safe cardiac pacing system in patients treated for bradycardia in the clinical practice of 16 Italian centers. Methods: 318 patients (64% male; mean age 71 ± 13y) with Class I or II indication for dual chamber pacemaker implantation according ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines received a Medtronic EnRhythm MRI SureScanTM with CapSureFix MRI leads. Data were collected at implant and every 6 months after implant, to characterize the atrial and ventricular lead pacing capture threshold, impedance and sensing amplitude changes through a long term follow‐up period and procedure or device‐related complications. Results: Preliminary analyses were performed on 292 patients who had at least 1 follow‐up visit. Median follow‐up time was 16 months (25th – 75th percentile 9 – 22 months). At implant and at follow‐ups pacing thresholds, sensing and impedances were stable and comparable with literature data. In particular at 6 months follow‐up, atrial and ventricular sensing were 3 ± 1 mV and 9 ± 4 mV respectively, thresholds were 0.7 ± 0.4 V and 0.7 ± 0.6 V at 0.5 ms, and impedances were 524 ± 106 Ω and 535 ± 79 Ω. When considering atrial and ventricular leads together, we observed 11 lead dislodgements out of 584 leads (1.9%). This dislodgement raw rate decreased from 2.7% (8/292), in the first 146 patients, to 1.0% (3/292) in the second 146 patients. Conclusions: Adoption of the new EnRhythm MRI SureScanTM and CapSureFix MRI lead in the Italian clinical practice has confirmed that the pacing system is safe and that lead measurements are stable in the long run. The temporal trend of lead dislodgements suggests that a learning curve is associated with the use of this new MRI lead. O087 LONG TERM EFFICACY OF AAISAFER AND MVP STIMULATION TO MINIMIZE THE PERCENTAGE OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR PACING IN AN UNSELECTED POPULATION OF PATIENTS Stazi F; Mampieri M; Verde M; Cardinale M Dipartimento Apparato Cardiocircolatorio. A. O. San Giovanni Addolorata. Roma. CLI Foundation Introduction: High values of right ventricular pacing (RVP) can be deleterious increasing the probability of mortality and heart failure, particularly when the RVP percentage is >40%. The AAISafeR® (Sorin Group) and MVP® (Medtronic) have shown to minimize the RVP percentage. Aim of the study was to assess the long term efficacy of these pacing modes in an unselected population of patients undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator placement. Methods: Fiftyfour patients (M = 33, F = 21, mean age 76 ± 10 years) who underwent placement of a pacemaker (N = 41, sinus node disease = 27, atrioventricular block = 14) or defibrillator (N = 13) both with pacing minimizing algorithms (AAISafeR®= 40, MVP®= 14) were studied. Results: After a mean follow‐up of 18 ± 21 months the mean RVP percentage was 18 ± 30% and 43 patients (80%) had a mean RVP percentage <40%. The median percentage of RVP was 0,9%. Conclusions: In our study after 18 months of follow up AAIsafeR and MVP allow a low RVP percentage in an unselected population of patients. Moreover, the majority of the patients presents a RVP percentage <40%. O088 CLS ALGORITHM IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN A SMALL SAMPLE OF ELDERLY PATIENTS Manzoni GM; Proietti R; Castelnuovo G; Spoto A; Lombardi L; Sagone A Istituto Auxologico Italiano Introduction: CLS (Closed Loop Stimulation) algorithm showed to provide a rate‐adaptive stimulation in response to haemodynamic demand due to emotional upheaval in chronotropically incompetent patients. We hypothesized that the hemodynamic benefits supplied by CLS algorithm may extend to neuro‐cognitive functioning through enhanced cerebral blood perfusion. Methods: In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a small‐scale three‐arm randomized controlled clinical trial involving 45 implanted patients randomly assigned to three pacing configurations: CLS (n = 15), Accelerometer Sensor (AS) mode (n = 15) and non rate‐adaptive mode (n = 15). A pool of ten neuro‐psychological tests tapping main neuro‐cognitive domains (memory, attention, language, visuo‐spatial skills and executive function) was administered to each participant before randomization and one year after. Mean change scores in cognitive measures were compared among the three pacing configurations at 1‐year follow‐up. Results: Statistically significant differences in change scores were found on attention and executive functioning measures. On average, patients in CLS configuration showed significant improvements on such measures, while patients in AS and non rate‐adaptive modes showed non‐significant deterioration trends. No statistically significant difference was found in change scores for the other neuro‐cognitive parameters. Conclusion: CLS algorithm showed to be effective in improving attention and executive functioning in a small sample of chronotropically incompetent patients one year after pacing configuration. Large‐scale trials are needed to corroborate such preliminary and novel results. O089 PATTERNS OF PACEMAKER AND ICD IMPLANTATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA Okreglicki A; Scott Millar R; for the Cardiac Arrhythmia Society of South Africa University of Cape Town Introduction: World surveys of cardiac pacing show implant rates <5/million in most of Africa. In South Africa it is >12fold higher and increasing. Despite this, provision of pacing is not homogenous within South Africa; great variations in implantation rates, indications and implant practice exist. Methods: Implantation data from South Africa submitted to the World Society of Arrhythmias Surveys in 2001, 2005 and 2009, device company sales data, questionnaires to implanters and South African data from the international Panorama registry were analysed. Results: Pacemaker implantation rate in South Africa increased from 39 to 47 and 60/million in 2001, 2005 and 2009 respectively; corresponding ICD implantation rates: <1, 2 and 6/million. South Africa accounted for 99% of pacemakers implanted in southern Africa. No ICDs were implanted in other countries. Company sales data show that of all pacing leads sold, 33% were atrial, 57% ventricular and 10% coronary sinus. Biventricular pacing/ICD devices (CRT‐D) increased from 37% of the total ICDs in 2005 to 51% in 2009. The Panorama registry revealed differences in primary indication by hospital type (1 public and 12 private): AV block: 69.1% vs 19.3%; Sinus node disease: 19.8% vs 66.9% (p < 0.001) and in devices implanted: in patients with AV block, 2 or 3 chamber pacemakers were implanted in 12.5% in public and 76.1% in private. Conclusions: Despite limitations in methods of data collection, implantation of arrhythmia devices in southern Africa has increased 7% annually. Significant differences in implant rates exist between countries and also in indications and especially implantation practice within South Africa; these need to be recognized in analysis of any pacemaker related data included in surveys from this region. Although financial, equipment and personnel constraints account for most differences between the countries, these do not apply for many of the differences observed in South Africa. O090 VENTRICULAR PACING IN ICD PATIENTS AND CLINICAL OUTCOME Vecchio F; Santini L; Papavasileiou L; Schirripa V; Sergi D; Tota C; Cioè R; Magliano G; Forleo GB; Romeo F Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Rome "Tor Vergata" Purpose: Few data are available about the influence on outcomes of right ventricular pacing in patients implanted with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). Methods: We analyzed 285 consecutive patients who underwent ICD implantation at our institution between September 2003 and November 2010. Patients were divided in two groups "Vp > 50%" (n = 39, 33 males, age 64,8 ± 11,6 years) and "Vp < 50%" (n = 246, 233 males, age 65,7 ± 12 years) based on the percent of right ventricular pacing during follow‐up. Results: Mean follow–up was 24.12 ± 18.4 months. The two groups were homogenous regarding age, sex, ejection fraction, type of device (single or dual chamber) and pharmacologic treatment. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding episodes of AF and appropriate discharge of the device. Nevertheless, the Vp > 50% group experienced appropriate discharge earlier (time to 15,75 months vs 39,5 months, p < 0.05) The group with Vp < 50% presented more episodes of non sustained ventricular arrhythmias (NSVT 66/264 vs 19/39, p = 0,05). Conclusion: Despite what communally thought right ventricular pacing seems to be protective in ICD recipients. O091 CONTINUOUS RIGHT VENTRICULAR APICAL PACING CAUSE ASYMPTOMATICALLY REDUCED CARDIAC FUNCTION WITHIN TWO YEARS Yamada T; Arita T; Ohshima M; Okamoto K; Murata T; Iseikai Hospital Cardiovascular Center Puropose: To elucidate long‐term outcome after continuous right ventricular pacing for cardiac function. Methods: Forty patients with advanced or complete atrio‐ventricular block who needed permanent pacemaker and their ejection fraction were preserved or mild reduced (more than 45%) were analayzed. Their cardiac function was evaluated by cardiac echocardiography at pre‐implanatation, one week after implanatation, 12 months and 24 months after pacemaker implantation. Ventricular permanent pacemaker leads were all placed at right ventricular apex. And optimal atrio‐ventricular delay was adjusted by echocardiography within 1 week after implanatation. Results: Mean age was 71.7 and percent male was 46.2%. QRS widths were changed as following, 161.4 msec (1 W), 165.3 msec (12 M) and 165.9 msec (24 M). Percent ventricular pacing were more than 98% all the period. Systolic function (= ejection fraction) significantly decreased gradually after pacemaker implantation, 1W‐12 M (0.605–0.592, P = 0.0065), 1 W‐24 M (0.605–0.576, P = 0.0017), respectively. Tei index was also significantly reduced, 1 W‐12 M (0.652–0.612, P = 0.0832), 1 W‐24 M (0.652–0.576, P = 0.0071), but NYHA classes were not significantly changed (1.67 – 1.75: P = 0–4352) at 2 years after implantation. Conclusion: Continuous long term right ventricular apical pacing might reduce cardiac function. O092 ELETRICAL AND MECHANICAL ATRIAL REMODELING PREVENTION USING MINIMAL VENTRICULAR PACING AND RIGHT OUTFLOW TRACT VENTRICULAR LEAD IN SINUS NODE DISEASE Menezes A Jr; Carneiro ARC; Oliveira BL; Souza LA; Neto WJS Catholic University of Goias Introduction: Will the minimum ventricular stimulation of the pacemaker when associated with alternate ventricular stimulation site reduce the incidence of Permanent or Intermittent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in long‐term?Objectives: Compare the synergetic effects of the minimum ventricular stimulation management (IRS PLUS) and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stimulation in sick node syndrome (SND) patients in electrical and mechanical atrial remodeling to RVOT stimulation alone. Methods: 50 SND patients were submitted to a dual chamber pacemaker implantation. The atrial leads were positioned in the right atrium septum and the ventricular lead in the right outflow tract. Patients were randomized in two groups, GROUP I (IRS plus ON in the first 6 months, then the next 6 months the IRS PLUS was turned OFF, then again turned ON for the next 12 months) e Group II (exact the opposite sequence of group I). After 6, 12, 18 and 30 months all patients were submitted to: 1) Follow‐up, 2) Pacemaker telemetry of the AF burden and Mode Switches 3) Transesophageal Echo and 4) Completion of SF‐36 form. Results: All data were calculated using the Mann‐Whitney Test 1) AT‐ AF burden in IRS Plus OFF was higher in all evaluations (6, 12, 18 and 30 months)‐ p < 0,00012) Left Atrial Volume in IRS ON was smaller than in IRS plus OFF in all evaluations either.3) Quality of Life (SF‐ 36 had not changed during the follow‐up (p>0,05)4) Note that during the 30 month follow‐up 7 patients presented permanent AF, for this reason they were excluded. GROUP I = 1 patient and GROUP II = 4 patients. Conclusion: Minimum ventricular stimulation associated with right ventricular outflow tract stimulation reduced the AF burden and left atrium remodeling due to a lower incidence of Atrial Fibrillation in 30 months follow‐up. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH O093 ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA: CLINICAL POLYMORPHISM AND THE ROLE OF ACCOMPANYING MYOCARDITIS Blagova OV; Nedostup AV; Morozova NS; Kogan EA; Gagarina NV; Sedov VP; Shestak AG; Zaklyazminskaya EV; Frolova YuV; Dzemeshkevich SL I.M.Sechenov I Moscow State Medical University, B.V.Petrovsky Russian Scientific Center of Surgery Objective: To study clinical polymorphism of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), prevalence and a role of accompanying myocarditis. Methods: We did observe group of 15 patients (9 females; 6 males, 45,5 ± 15,9 y.o.) with clear (n = 9) and suspected (n = 6) diagnosis of ARVD. Investigations included heart CT/MRI; PCR detection of virus genomes, anti‐heart antibodies (AB); one right ventricle (RV) biopsy; and 2 autopsy. Genetic analysis is in progress now for all patients. Results: Three variants of ARVD phenotypes were sorted out. Group 1, "Typical" (or "latent arrhythmic", n = 8; 44.5 ± 12.9 y.o.), with frequent persistent «idiopathic» premature ventricular beats from RV, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); lack of major ECG criteria in the presence of intra‐myocardial fat. The prevalence of myocarditis was 50%, and Epstein‐Barr virus was detected in 1 case. Patients from group 2 (n = 2, 71 y.o.), "Arrhythmic" developed stable VT alongside with major ECG criterias; RV dilatation of various degree; myocarditis is not revealed. Group 3 is ARVD with biventricular heart insufficiency (n = 5, 39.7 ± 13.5 y.o.); prevalence of myocarditis is 60%. Two patients within this group died; and Herpes virus types 1, 6 in myocardium were detected in both. Three patients have got ICD, for 4 patients ICDs were recommended, for 2 patients RFA were performed. Conclusions: The ARVD can be found in patients of any age and gender. The fat inclusion is revealed by MRI in 82% (from 11 patients), and detected by CT in 83% (from 6), but criteria's of the diagnosis do not fulfill. Inexplicable RV dilatation always requires exclusion of ARVD. Dysfunction of the left ventricle (due to fibro‐fatty replacement or myocarditis) make correct diagnosis ARVD more complicated. For isolated ARVD is not peculiar increase of a anti‐heart AB. Biopsy with viral genome detection seems to be very helpful in diagnostics of ARVD, myocarditis by itself or in combination. O094 RESULTS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REGISTRY FOR ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY (ARVC): SOME NOVEL GENETIC AND OTHER FINDINGS Okreglicki A; for the Cardiac Arrhythmia Society of South Africa University of Cape Town Introduction: ARVC is a heart muscle disorder characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden death often occurring in the young and in athletes, familial in >50% and with mutations in genes encoding essential desmosomal proteins. First described in South Africa in 1997 and reported in 2000, it has been found in all segments of African society. The ARVC Registry of Southern Africa has enrolled probands and affected first degree relatives since 2004. Methods: Results of the SA ARVC registry which provides diagnostic validation, assessment of clinical risk and therapy, and genetic screening were analyzed. Results: Of 259 individuals with suspected ARVC enrolled in the registry, 67 have definite diagnosis according to the ARVC Task Force Criteria: 68% male; median age 27yrs; most frequent presenting symptom: palpitations; most frequent ECG abnormality: abnormal T‐wave inversion; ventricular tachycardia documented in >80%; >60% involved in sports; annual mortality ± 3% with history of syncope and VT strongest independent predictors of death. Genetic screening in 36 of the first 50 unrelated index cases revealed: in 25% disease‐causing mutations in the PKP2‐gene encoding plakophilin 2 of the desmosome; 5 being novel mutations; and in 2 individuals compound heterozygosity giving an allelle 'double dose' effect and severe phenotype. Screening in 62 definite ARVC cases of the DSP‐gene encoding desmoplakin found mutations in 2; the same mutation occurred in 6 of 150 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Conclusions: ARVC in South Africa is not uncommon and similar in many respects to other international reports. However, the registry is unique in showing: younger age of death (<40yrs), strongly predicted by syncope and VT; high rate of sport participation; compound and novel mutations in the commonly affected PKP2‐gene; and the demonstration of DSP‐gene mutations in both ARVC and DCM patients suggesting a common spectrum of heart disease. O095 CLINICAL AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF JAPANESE PATIENTS WITH ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY Ohno S; Nishio Y; Nagaoka I; Miyamoto A; Kimura H; Itoh H; Makiyama T; Horie M Cardiovasacular Department, Shiga University of Medical Science Background: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease characterized by fibrofatty replacement of right ventricle (RV). ARVC often presents ventricular tachycardia (VT) of RV origin, heart failure and sudden death. Recently numerous mutations in desmosomal genes—plakophilin‐2 (PKP2), desmoplakin (DSP), desmoglein‐2 (DSG2), desmocollin‐2 (DSC2)—have been shown to cause ARVC. The incidence rate of these gene mutations was reportedly 30∼40% in Europe, but in Asia, it remains unstudied. Methods and Results: This study aimed to elucidate the clinical characteristics in Japanese ARVC patients. The diagnosis of ARVC was established in accordance with new criteria (Circulation, 2010). We examined consecutive 33 Japanese ARVC probands (definite, borderline and possible) from 33 unrelated families. Twenty‐eight probands (84%) were diagnosed as definite, 4 (12%) as borderline and 1 (3%) as possible. The cohort consisted of 25 males (75.8%) and 8 females. The frequency of male patients was higher as reported. We screened four genes: PKP2, DSP, DSG2 and DSC2 using direct sequencing methods. We identified gene mutations in 15 patients (45%): 9 patients with PKP2, 5 DSP, 4 DSG2 and 1 DSC2 mutations. Four of them were compound mutations: 2 PKP2 + DSG2, 1 PKP2 + DSP, and 1 DSP + DSG2. We also identified homozygous mutation carriers in 1 patient with PKP2, 2 DSP and 1 DSG2. The frequency of PKP2 mutation carriers was as high as reported previously. Conclusions: We identified mutations of ARVC‐related genes in 15 of 33 patients (45%). The prevalence of the mutation carriers in four desmosomal genes appeared to be higher in Japan than Europe. As the cardiac arrest can be an initial manifestation of ARVC, the identification of genetically affected family members (even though asymptomatic) would also offer a strong clinical modality to prevent sudden death. O096 A FIVE‐YEAR FOLLOW‐UP OF PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE: CLINICAL PREDICTORS OF ARRHYTHMIC VS ALL‐CAUSE MORTALITY Stergiou P; Flevari P; Lagou S; Ntai K; Kolokathis F; Filippatos G; Anastasiou‐Nana M 2nd Department of Cardiology, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece Background: Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in heart failure remains suboptimal. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) is currently used for guiding cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation, but is also associated with pump failure. Aim of this study was to identify readily available clinical markers that increase the risk of arrhythmic vs clinical parameters associated more with all‐cause mortality. Methods: A cohort of 386 patients was assessed, with heart failure of dilated (n = 252) or ischemic (n = 134) etiology. LVEF, 6‐min walking test, atrial fibrillation (AF), QRS duration, QT duration, hyponatremia, serum urea, and LV hypertrophy were estimated in order to identify i) prognostic factors of SCD or rapid sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ii) factors associated with all‐cause mortality. VTs faster than 180 bpm were taken into account (verified by either surface ECG or intracardiac defibrillator recordings) and were used as SCD surrogate end‐points. Cox stepwise regression was used for analysis. Results: During a 5‐year period, all‐cause mortality was 27.7%, while SCD or sustained VT 7.7%. Regarding all‐cause mortality, AF (p < 0.001), LVEF (p = 0.001), serum urea (p = 0.047), and 6‐min walking test (p < 0.001) were independent predictors. On the other hand, AF (p = 0.005), LVEF (p = 0.015), as well as hypertrophy (p = 0.01) were independent predictors of arrhythmic death. Interestingly, the presence of AF was associated with a 4‐fold increased risk in all‐cause mortality and an 11‐fold risk in SCD or sustained VT. It is also remarkable that hypertrophy was related with an almost 13‐fold risk of SCD or sustained VT. Conclusion: In patients with heart failure, a reduced LVEF is equally predictive of long‐term all‐cause and arrhythmic mortality, while the presence of AF or LV hypertrophy increases significantly the risk of life‐threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. More studies are needed to test the clinical utility of these findings. O097 NO INFLUENCE OF SCAR TISSUE ON MICROVOLT T‐WAVE ALTERNANS Kraaier K; Olimulder MAGM; Galjee MA; van Dessel PFHM; van der Palen J; Wilde AAM; Scholten MF; Twente ICD Cohort Study (TICS) Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands Background: Microvolt T‐wave Alternans (TWA) is an electrocardiographic marker for predicting sudden cardiac death. In this study, we aimed to study the relation between TWA and scar assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in patients with ischemic (ICM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods: Sixty‐three patients with positive or negative TWA and complete CMR examination were included. Using CMR and the delayed enhancement technique, ejection fraction (LVEF), end‐diastolic volume (LVEDV) and scar characteristics were assessed. Results: Overall, positive TWA (n = 29) was related to male gender (p = 0.01), lower LVEF (p = 0.05) and increased LVEDV (p < 0.01). After multivariate analysis, male gender (p = 0.01) and lower LVEF remained significant (p = 0.04). Scar characteristics (presence, transmurality, and scar score) were not related to TWA (all p > 0.5). In the patients with ICM (n = 35) scar was detected in 32. Positive TWA (n = 14) was related to older infarct age (median 17 years, range 2–32 versus median 5 years, range 0–21, p = 0.05). Trends were found for male gender (p = 0.07) and higher LVEDV (p = 0.09). In patients with DCM (n = 28), scar was detected in 11. Trends were found between positive TWA (n = 15) and male gender (p = 0.10), lower LVEF (p = 0.10), and higher LVEDV (p = 0.09). In both subgroups, the presence, transmurality or extent of scar was not related to TWA (all p > 0.45). Conclusion: Neither in patients with ICM or DCM a relation was found between the occurrence of TWA and the presence, transmurality or extent of myocardial scar. Overall there was a significant relation between heart failure remodeling parameters and positive TWA. O098 QT COMBINED WITH TIME DOMAIN‐TWA AND T‐WAVE MORPHOLOGY COULD PREDICT COMPLETE HEART BLOCK RELATED TORSADE DE POINTES Simeonidou E; Kastellanos S; Varounis C; Michalakeas C; Koniari C; Nikolopoulou A; Anastasiou‐Nana M 2nd Cardiology Dept, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece Purpose: It is known that complete heart block (CHB) predisposes infrequently to torsade de pointes (TdP), mainly through QT prolongation with consequences even after permanent pacemaker implantation (PPM. T‐wave alternans (TWA) is linked to vulnerability to life‐threatening arrhythmias and an increase in TWA precedes the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Purpose of the study was to examine the contribution of the time domain TWA (TD‐TWA) combined with ECG T‐W morphology in prediction of TdP during CHB. Methods: 60 consecutive patients (pts), (35w, 25m), mean age 77 ± 7 years, referred for PPM implantation because of CHB underwent 12 leads ECG assessment and 24h Holter monitoring, if their escape rhythm was satisfactory with temporary pacing back‐up. TD‐TWA was assessed by the MMA method on a MARS Holter analyser. The maximum TD‐TWA in either modified lead V1, V2, V3 was derived and its value defined as positive when the voltage was ≥75 uV. T‐wave morphology was defined as broad, notched, small and late, deep inverted. The longest QT in any of the 12 ECG leads was measured. Results: There were not reversible causes of CHB. Nineteen out of 60 pts (33%) developed mainly short runs of TdP and bradycardia was the only cause. Neither the escape rhythm HR nor the QRS width predicted the risk of TdP. TWA (OR 1.171 with 95% CI: 1.057–1.310, p = 0.003), QT (OR 1.034 with 95% CI:1.012–1.056, p = 0.002), and notched TW morphology (OR = 8.00 with 95% CI:1.36–46.81, p = 0.021) were correlated with greater risk of TdP. All pts needed PPM implantation. In the TdP group LPR was programmed to 80 bpm. Pts were followed up for 1 year and interrogation of each pts data was negative for TdP. Conclusions: In CHB pts positive TD‐TWA, prolonged QT and notched T‐waves are associated with increased risk for TdP. Prediction of this risk is helpful in precautionary PPM programming to avoid recurrence of TdP after PPM implantation until the QT shortens to normal. O099 J WAVE AND FRAGMENT QRS ON ECG ASSOCIATED WITH ALL‐CAUSE MORTALITY AND SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN PATIENTS WITH CHF Pei J; Li N; Chen J; Gao Y; Zhang Y; Zhang P; Cao K‐J; Pu J Fuwai Cardiovascular Hospital, Peking Union Medical College,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Objective: Although sudden cardiac death (SCD) secondary to J wave and fragment QRS (fQRS) is not a rare phenomenon in patients without structure heart diseases, whether they are risk factors for SCD in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and predictive values of J wave and fQRS for SCD in patients with CHF. Methods: The electrocardiograms of 1570 hospitalized CHF patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, 572 cases) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, 998 cases) aged from 18 to 79 years were analyzed regarding the relationship between ECG characteristics and all‐cause mortality, SCD and Non‐SCD (NSCD). Results: During a median follow‐up period of 36 months, 21.49% patients died, of whom 35.84% died of SCD. The prevalence of J wave and fQRS in the inferior leads of patient group were significantly higher than that of control group (p < 0.01). After adjustment for age, gender, heart failure classification, QRS width, QTc interval, 24‐hour average heart rate, left or right bundle branch block, and medications, Cox regression analysis revealed that J wave in the inferior leads was associated with all‐cause mortality (HR, 2.655; 95% CI, 1.774–3.973), NSCD (HR, 2.122; 95% CI, 1.265–3.560) and SCD (HR, 4.095; 95% CI, 2.132–7.863), in DCM respectively, However, in ICM, only fQRS in the inferior leads was associated with all‐cause mortality (HR, 1.889; 95% CI, 1.444–2.471), NSCD (HR, 1.441; 95% CI, 1.001 –2.079) and SCD, (HR, 2.714; 95% CI, 1.809–4.072] respectively. Detailed analysis showed that the HR in men was higher than that in women for the NSCD and SCD groups. Conclusions: The presence of J wave and/or fQRS in the inferior leads of CHF patients indicated 2 to 4‐fold higher risk of all‐cause mortality, NSCD and SCD. They may serve as the independent predictors for the prognosis in this population. Key Word: J wave, fQRS, sudden cardiac death, chronic heart failure O100 ARRHYTHMIA RISK STRATIFICATION WITH NON‐INVASIVE DEPOLARIZATION AND REPOLARIZATION ARRHYTHMIC RISK MARKERS IN ASYMPTOMATIC YOUNG INDIVIDUALS WITH INCIDENTALLY FOUND PROMINENT J‐WAVE Simeonidou E; Michalakeas C; Kastellanos S; Varounis C; Koniari C; Dai C; Psarogiannakopoulos P; Stassinos V; Anastasiou‐Nana M 2nd Cardiology Dept, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece Purpose: The J‐point elevation is a common electrocardiographic variant considered for years as benign ECG manifestation. Recently a high prevalence of this pattern was found in patients (pts) with idiopathic VF. Although the J wave is synonymous to early repolarization, recently there was some evidence that maybe is a delayed depolarization abnormality. Aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of late potentials (LPs) testing (depolarization marker) and time domain T‐wave alternans (TD‐TWA) (repolarization marker) in healthy young individuals with prominent J‐wave. Methods: The study population was consisted of 77 consecutive healthy young individuals (13 w, 62 m), mean age 30 ± 13 years, with incidental discovery of J‐point elevation on the 12 lead ECG. Eighty consecutive healthy young individuals with normal ECG served as control population. All pts consented to LP testing by SAECG and time domain T‐wave alternans (TD‐TWA) by 24 hours Holter monitoring. LPs were considered positive when at least 2 criteria were met. The greater TD‐TWA was chosen for assessment and it was defined as positive when the max voltage was >75 uV. Results: On 360 ± 85 days follow‐up (fu)nobody developed significant arrhythmias. The ECG localization of J‐wave was 17 inferior, 43 anterior and 15 diffuse. LPs were positive in 22 pts (28%) and TD‐TWA in 11 pts (15%). Prevalence in healthy subjects with normal ECG 4% and 3.2% respectively. Neither max TWA (p = 0.751) nor LPs (p = 0.493) were correlated to J‐ point ECG localization. Conclusions: In our population of healthy young individuals with prominent J‐point, the prevalence especially of the depolarization marker LPs is significantly higher than in healthy subjects without prominent J‐wave, without any arrhythmic consequences in one year's fu. Validation in larger population and longer fu is needed. O101 ARRHYTHMOGENESIS FACTORS IN NEWBORNS Kovalev I; Svintsova L; Child's Heart Center Institute of Cardiology Objective: To determine risk criteria of formation and advance of heart rhythm disturbances in newborns. Results: 102 patients (14 healthy incl.) were examined. Extrasystoles – 32,4%, bradyarrhythmias – 25,7%, tachyarrhythmias – 22,9%, WPW syndrome – 18,9%. Rhythm disturbances preserve only in 5,4% by the sixth month of life. Longer persistence is typical for extrasystole and WPW syndrome. Heart rhythm disturbances are marked much more often in newborns whose mothers had acute respiratory disease during pregnancy (p = 0,049), and who were born from the primipregnancy (p = 0,041). Bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias have similar factors which can potentially favor arrhythmia manifestation: intracranial hypertension according to neurosonography and changes of hormonal profile of thyroid body towards hypofunction. Established fact that higher value of systolic pressure in the right ventricle (p = 0,047) is the peculiarity of intracardiac hemodynamics in the group of newborns with heart rhythm disturbances. Presence of extrasystole in newborns is related with increase of troponin level I (p = 0,015) and activation of parasympathetic link of vegetative nervous system (increase of pNN50 (p = 0,009) and SDNNi (p = 0,037). Association of bradyarrhythmias with level of myocardial antinuclear antibodies in blood (x2 = 4,89; p = 0,027) are marked for fact in newborns. Conclusion: Thus, autoimmune component is important link of bradyarrhythmias pathogenesis, which, probably, is formed into antenatal period with the help of maternal antibodies. Destructive processes in myocardium, accompanying by increase of troponine I level in blood serum, and also activation of parasympathetic link of vegetative nervous system during extrasystole depend, on the contrary, on factors connecting with intra‐ and postnatal periods. Infection during pregnancy can influence, indirectly, on the process abnormality of obliteration of additional conduction tracts at WPW syndrome. O102 REDUCED DECELERATION CAPACITY OF HEART RATE RISK STRATIFIES PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH PRESERVED LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF>35%) FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Manis G; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Aggelis A; Kartsagoulis E; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: Previous studies reported that the cut off point of ≤2.5 ms from the Deceleration Capacity (DC) of heart rate is a powerful predictor of mortality in post myocardial infarction patients (pts). We used the same cut off point to examine whether it is an adequate sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk predictor in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function (LVEF > 35%). Methods: We prospectively screened 104 pts (age: 64 ± 14.0 years, male: 84%, NYHA class: 2.1 ± 0.4, LVEF: 41.7 ± 6.5, CAD: 84%, DCMP: 16%) with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24‐hour HOLTER. After 15.5 ± 13.7 months of follow up, patients were classified into the High risk (12 pts, mean LVEF: 39 ± 5.5%) and the Low risk (92 pts, mean LVEF: 42 ± 6.5%, p = 0.1) groups according to three SCD events/surrogates: 1. clinical VT/VF (5 pts) 2. ICD's appropriate activation (2 pts) 3.confirmed SCD (5 pts). LVEF, filtered QRS (SAECG), DC ≤ 2.5 ms, NSVT > 1/24 hour, VPBs > 240/24 hour, mean Heart Rate (HR) and SDNN /HRV (24‐hour HOLTER), were calculated and statistically analyzed for the two groups. Results: DC ≤ 2.5 ms was a statistically significant predictor of SCD (Long rank test p = 0.02). After Cox regression analysis adjusted for LVEF, fQRS, NSVT > 1/24 hour, VPBs > 240/24 hour, HR and SDNN /HRV (24 hour HOLTER), the cutoff point of DC ≤ 2.5 ms remained an important and independent SCD predictor with HR 6.007 (p = 0.01) 95% CI: 1.513–23.854. Conclusions: In the present pts cohort, the cut off point of DC ≤ 2.5 ms was an important and independent predictor of SCD. Further evaluation of the reduced DC of heart rate in a larger population with longer follow up is justified. O103 CLINICAL PROFILE OF PATIENTS WITH ELECTRICAL VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA/FIBRILLATION STORM: A TWO‐YEAR REVIEW OF CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS, RISK FACTORS AND OUTCOMES Ona RL; Ramirez MF University of Santo Tomas Hospital (USTH), Espana, Manila, Philippines Electrical storm refers to multiple occurrences of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation occurring three or more times in a 24 hour period. We reviewed the clinical profile and outcome of patients admitted for electrical storm at the USTH from June 2008 to February 2011. Ten patients, 6 males and 4 females aged 30 to 72 years old were included in the study. There were 3 cases of acquired long QT syndrome, 2 cases of congenital long QT syndrome, 1 case of ischemic and 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p ICD implantation and 2 cases of NSTEMI (anterior wall). Seven of the nine patients presented with mild to severe hypokalemia. Four had mild hypocalcemia. Most of the patients were managed medically with antiarrhythmics, a combination of intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine. Four patients underwent temporary pacemaker insertion for overdrive pacing. One patient with NSTEMI developed the electrical storm after emergency coronary bypass surgery. Among the 2 patients with congenital long QT syndrome, one underwent implantation of an internal cardioverter‐defibrillator(ICD) while the other one, while awaiting funds for device therapy, is being managed medically. Two patients with cardiomyopathy and CHF underwent ICD implantation while the other patient with already a previous implant developed storm with multiple ICD shocks. Eight patients were discharged from the hospital improved, all of whom are still following up and stable. Two patients with electrical storm had multiple organ failure and died. These were the cases of NSTEMI who developed electrical storm after coronary bypass surgery and a case of electrical storm secondary to acquired long QT syndrome due to severe hypokalemia and drugs. In our 2 year review of electrical storm patients, the major etiologies include long QT syndrome, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with heart failure. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia were the common electrolyte abnormalities associated with the occurrence of electrical storm. SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS O104 THE ROLE OF NON‐CORONARY CUSP ABLATION APPROACH IN THE TREATMENT OF PERINODAL ATRIAL TACHCARDIAS: PREFERENTIAL OR ADJUNCTIVE? Ju W; Chen M; Yang B; Chen H; Zhang F; Yu J; Cao K Department of Cardiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 2100 Backgroud: Ablation in the noncoronary aortic cusp (NCC) potentially has a role in the treatment of perinodal atrial tachycardias (ATs). Objectives: To characterize the role of NCC ablation in the treatment of perinodal ATs among a cohort of patients with perinodal ATs. Methods: One hundred and seven patients with focal ATs who underwent electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency catheter ablation were enrolled in the study. The electrophysiological characteristics and the target electrograms of those who need NCC ablation and other patients of perinodal ATs were compared. Results: Totally 18 cases were revealed to have the focal ATs located in the perinodal area. Among them, only 4 cases (22%) warrant ablation in the NCC, whereas the remainder could be successfully eliminated by ablation from the endocardial right atrium at the perinodal region. There were no clinical and electrophysiological clues observed to have the potential to predict the true original site, including the onset behavior, the earliest activation site in the right atrium, the configuration of the unipolar recording, as well as the time to termination during the ablation in the perinodal area. Conclusions: Approximately one fifth of the perinodal ATs warrant ablation in the NCC. However, no clinical and electrophysiological clues could predict the potential site of the perinodal ATs. The NCC ablation may serve as a adjunctive role in the treatment of the perinodal ATs. O105 DIRECT MID‐ISTHMUS APPROACH FOR RADIO‐FREQUENCY ABLATION OF CAVOTRICUSPID ISTHMUS‐DEPENDENT ATRIAL FLUTTER Cheng T; Liu Y; Kongstad O; Hertervig E; Yuan S Department of Arrhythmias, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden Aims: To test the feasibility and efficacy of the direct mid‐isthmus (DMI) approach for ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus‐ (CTI‐) dependent atrial flutter (AFL). Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either conventional linear radio‐frequency (RF) ablation between the tricuspid annulus and inferior vena cava (the linear approach) or RF ablation at sites with the highest electrical signals, usually in the middle of the CTI (the DMI approach). Sustained, bi‐directional CTI block was the endpoint. Procedure parameters and follow‐up data were obtained. Results: In total, 80 patients were included, 40 each for the linear approach and the DMI approach. To achieve sustained bi‐directional CTI block, the linear approach needed 841 ± 594 S or 14.0 ± 9.9 RF applications, with total fluoroscopy time of 18.6 ± 9.4 min and total procedure time of 152 ± 58 min, as compared to the DMI approach which needed 350 ± 319 s (p < 0.0001) or 5.8 ± 5.3 RF applications (p < 0.0001), with total fluoroscopy time of 14.8 ± 6.0 min (p < 0.05) and total procedure time of 111 ± 36 min (p < 0.0005). The CTI block was obtained with 3 or less RF applications in 18 patients in the DMI group (45%), but only in 2 patients in the linear ablation group (5%). During follow‐up of 28 ± 14 months, recurrence cases were 2 in the linear and 1 in the DMI group (NS). Conclusions: During RF ablation of typical AFL, directly targeting the muscular bundles in the middle of the CTI can significantly reduce the amount of RF energy needed for bi‐directional CTI block, with shorter fluoroscopy and procedure times. This direct mid‐isthmus approach may be recommended for clinical use to replace the conventional linear approach. O106 DEPRESSION OF ST SEGMENT AS PROGNOSTIC VALUE IN SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS Scazzuso FA; Rivera S; Gomez L; Albina G; Laino R; Sammartino V; Giniger A Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires (ICBA) Background: ST depression is a known high risk marker in acute coronary syndromes, accounting for higher mortality and infarction rates in this subgroup. However, it is unknown weather this phenomenon has similar implications during supraventricular tachycardia. Objective: To determine accuracy of ST depression to predict further coronary events, myocardial revascularization need, cardiac heart failure, and all cause mortality in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Methods: Patients eligible for radiofrequency ablation of SVT were included. Only the ones presenting nodal re‐entrant tachycardia were considered. Pre‐existing bundle branch blocks and AV re‐entrant tachycardia were excluded. ST morphologies and cycle length variations during tachycardia were analyzed. Follow up (6 months to 5 years) determined: Mortality rates (total and cardiovascular), MI and unstable angina incidence, CABG or PTCA need. Two groups were compared: the ones which developed pathologic ST depression (descendent or horizontal ST morphology) and the ones that did not develop ST depression or developed a non pathological ST depression (ascendant). Results: Total of 68 patients, age (49,57 ± 13 years); 66,3% males. Incidence of UA was 8.82%; 7,35% required percutaneous angioplasty; 2,94% total mortality (non cardiac); 1,47% developed cardiac insufficiency. The group that developed non pathologic ST or non ST depression were older (55.47 ± 11,1 years); males (82,76%) and showed a higher incidence of UA (15,38%); CABG or PTCA requirement (12.82%); CI (2,56%) and all cause mortality (5,12%). Conclusions: ST segment depression failed to predict higher mortality rates and CAD in this subgroup. This study suggests that ST depression is not a high risk marker in SVT and has no prognostic value in this subgroup. O107 RISK OF MALIGNANT ARRHYTHMIAS IN INITIALLY SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WITH WPW SYNDROME: RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW‐UP STUDY Pappone C; Vicedomini G; Petretta A; Vitale R; Saviano M; Pappone A; Baldi M; Cuko A; Giannelli L; Santinelli V Maria Cecilia Hospital Objectives: This study was designed to assess characteristics and predictors of malignant arrhythmias (MA) in initially symptomatic patients with WPW syndrome. Background: The available amount of detailed long‐term data in patients with WPW syndrome is limited and no prospective electrophysiological studies looking at predictors of MA are available. Methods: Among 8575 symptomatic WPW patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) referred for EPT, 369 (mean age, 23 ± 12.5 years) declined catheter ablation and were followed. Primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate over a 5‐year follow‐up predictors and characteristics of patients developing MA. Results: After a mean follow‐up of 42.1 ± 10 months, MA developed in 29 patients (mean age, 13.9 ± 5.6 years, 26 M) resulting in presyncope/syncope (25 patients) or resuscitated cardiac arrest (4 patients). Of the remaining 340 patients, 168 (mean age, 34.2 ± 9.0 years) remained asymptomatic up to 5 years and 172 (mean age, 13.6 ± 5.1) had benign recurrence including sustained AVRT (132 patients) or AF (40 patients). As compared with no‐MA group, MA group showed shorter AP‐AERP (p < 0.001), more often exhibited multiple AP (p < 0.001) and AVRT triggering sustained preexcited AF (AVRT‐AF) was more frequently inducible (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that short AP‐AERP (p < 0.001) and AVRT‐AF (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of MA. Conclusions: Most initially symptomatic WPW patients remain asymptomatic or may have benign recurrences, but a minority of them may experience MA. Short AP‐AERP and AVRT triggering AF are independent predictors, which emphasizes the need of contextual catheter ablation in patients at highest risk. O108 RFA OF DRUG‐REFRACTORY TACHYARRHYTHMIAS IN SMALL CHILDREN Svintsova L; Kovalev I; Murzina O; Popov S; Child's Heart Center Institute of Cardiology Materials: Twelve RFA of tachyarrhythmias were performed to children of 1–12 months in our clinic during for the last five years. The minimum age of effective RFA is 48 days, the minimum weight is 3800 gr. Tachycardia was first disclosed in three children antenataly. In 8 cases tachycardia had the persistent paroxysmal course; in 4 cases it was paroxysmal. The presence of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, accompanied by blood insufficiency, and also ineffectiveness of antiarrhythmics combinations including amiodarone were the indications of RFA performance in all cases. Results: WPW syndrome was diagnosed in five children: concealed WPW was in four of them, and manifest WPW was in one. Localization of accessory pathway: left posterior (n = 2), left anterolateral (n = 2) and right posteroseptal (n = 1). In all cases of left sided localization of accessory pathway an approach into the left atrium was carried out through the patent foramen oval. Intra‐atrial tachycardia was diagnosed in seven children. Localization of atrial ectopic focuses was determined in the area of right atrial auricle basis (n = 2), in the area of right atrial anterior wall (n = 3), in the area of His band (n = 1). The atrial reentry tachycardia happened in the area of the patent foramen oval in one case. The intra‐ and postoperative period in all patients was without complications. According to the Echo data reduction of atrium sizes, increase of left ventricle contractile function was marked in 5 – 10 days (p < 0,05). Follow‐up was from one month to five years. Tachycardia relapses were not disclosed. As a result of Echo investigations, pathology was not uncovered. Conclusion: RFA is an effective and safe method of tachyarrhythmia treatment including infants. All children of early age with hemodynamic and clinically significant tachycardias, refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy should be turned to specialized centers, having RFA experience at the given age. SYNCOPE O109 ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF VERY PROLONGED OBSERVATION BY IMPLANTABLE LOOP RECORDER IN PATIENTS WITH UNEXPLAINED SYNCOPE Furukawa T; Maggi R; Bertolone C; Fontana D; Brignole M; Department of Cardiology Ospedali del Tigullio, Lavagna, Italy Introduction: In the literature, the average diagnostic yield of the implantable loop recorder (ILR) is reported to be 35% over an observation period generally less than 18 months. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of ILR during very prolonged observation. Methods and Results: Consecutive patients who had received one or more (in the case of battery exhaustion before diagnosis) ILR (Reveal/plus/DX, Medtronic. inc) from 2001 to 2010 were included. The diagnostic ECG was classified according to the ISSUE classification. We analyzed 157 patients (87 males, 69 ± 14 years): 70 of these were followed up for ≥18 months. The estimated cumulative diagnostic rates were 30%, 43%, 52% and 80% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively; 26% of diagnoses were made after 18 months. The diagnostic yield was independent of structural heart disease, bundle branch block, number of syncopes, age and gender; the median time to diagnosis of ISSUE type 1 patients was shorter than that of the others (4 [2;10] v.s. 16 [6;23] months; p = 0.003). During the observation period, 3 patients (1.9%) died and none suffered arrhythmic death. Conclusions: Prolonging observation up to 4 years increased the diagnostic value of ILR in syncopal patients and was safe. A quarter of patients diagnosed needed more than 18 months of follow‐up. As consequence, when a strategy of prolonging monitoring is chosen, monitoring should be maintained even for several years until diagnosis is established. O110 SYNCOPE DUE TO IDIOPATHIC PAROXYSMAL AV BLOCK: LONG‐TERM FOLLOW‐UP OF A DISTINCT FORM OF AV BLOCK Brignole N; Deharo JC; De Roy L; Menozzi C; Blommaert D; Dabiri L; Ruf J; Guieu R; Department of cardiology Ospedali del Tigullio, Lavagna, Italy Objectives: We present data on patients with syncope due to paroxysmal atrioventricular (AV) block unexplainable in terms of currently known mechanisms. Background: Paroxysmal AV block is known to be due to intrinsic AV conduction disease or to heightened vagal tone. Methods: We evaluated 18 patients presenting with unexplained syncope who had: 1) normal baseline standard ECG; 2) absence of structural heart disease; and 3) documentation, by means of prolonged ECG monitoring at the time of syncopal relapse, of paroxysmal third‐degree AV block with abrupt onset and absence of other rhythm disturbances before or during the block. Results: The study group consisted of 9 males and 9 females, aged 55 ± 19 years, who had suffered from recurrent unexplained syncope for 8 ± 7 years and were subsequently followed up for up to 14 years (4 ± 4 years on average). The patients had no structural heart disease, standard ECG was normal and electrophysiological study was negative. In all patients, prolonged ECG monitoring documented paroxysmal complete AV block with one or multiple consecutive pauses (mean longest pause: 9 ± 7 sec) at the time of syncope; AV block occurred without P‐P cycle lengthening or PR interval prolongation. During the observation time no patient developed permanent AV block; on permanent cardiac pacing, no patient had further syncopal recurrences. Conclusions: Common clinical and electrophysiological features define a distinct form of syncope due to idiopathic paroxysmal AV block characterized by a long history of recurrent syncopes, absence of progression to persistent forms of AV block and efficacy of cardiac pacing therapy. O111 SUPINE VASOCONSTRICTION AND VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE Flevari P; Stergiou P; Leftheriotis D; Dagres N; Lekakis J; Anastasiou‐Nana M 2nd Department of Cardiology, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece Background: Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is characterized by a reduced vasoconstrictor reserve during sustained orthostatic stress. It has also been suggested that VVS is associated with forearm vasoconstriction during supine rest. The study addressed whether supine forearm vascular resistances (FVR) are related to the vasoconstrictor reserve during head‐up tilt test and its result. Methods: We studied 37 pts with recurrent VVS (at least 2 syncopal episodes during the last 6 months), mean aged (±SE) 46.5 ± 3.6 years who underwent 2 head‐up tilt tests (HUTs): an initial, positive examination, and a second one, 3 months later (with or without drugs. Group A patients comprised 28 patients with a subsequently negative HUT, while Group B consisted of the remaining 9 patients with a second, positive HUT. Strain‐gauge venous occlusion plethysmography was used to assess right forearm blood flow (FBF) and FVR i) at rest, in the supine position, just prior to HUT, ii) during the first 10 mins of HUT, every 30 sec. FBF was expressed as ml per min per 100 ml of forearm tissue volume and FVR was calculated as the mean blood pressure divided by FBF. Vasoconstrictor reserve was assessed as the mean% reduction in supine FVR. Results: In patients whose HUT remained positive, no changes were observed in supine FVR or vasoconstrictor reserve between the 2 examinations. On the contrary, in patients with a subsequently negative HUT, a decrease was observed in supine FVR (18.7 ± 1.7 vs 27.8 ± 1.8 at baseline, p < 0.05). An increase was observed in their vasoconstrictor reserve during the second HUT (122 ± 3.6 vs 109 ± 3.1 at baseline, p < 0.05). The % reduction in FVR between tests was associated with the% increase in vasoconstrictor reserve. Conclusion: VVS is characterized by vasoconstriction in the supine position. This increase in forearm FVR is pathophysiologically significant and seems to be the reason for the impaired vasoconstrictor reserve observed in this syndrome. O112 COMPARISON OF THE TILT TABLE TEST RESULTS IN ELDERLY AND IN NON‐ELDERLY PATIENTS Zimerman A; Pimentel M; Magalhães APA; Zimerman LI Hospital de Clínicas – Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul Introduction: The tilt table test is a useful diagnostic method in the evaluation of syncope. The comparison of the results between elderly and non‐elderly patients has not been elucidated. Objectives: To compare the results of the tilt table test in elderly and non‐elderly patients. Methods: A total of 640 tilt table tests were analyzed and patients were separated in two groups: elderly (≥65 years old) and non‐elderly (<64 years old). Tilt table test response was compared between groups. The protocol had a passive phase (20 minutes; 70 degrees inclination) and an active phase (1.25 mg sublingual nitrate and inclination during 10 minutes). Chi‐square test was used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Methods: The tilt table test results of 640 patients were analyzed. The protocol used in the test was 20 minutes with an inclination of 70 degrees. In case there was no alteration, pharmacologic sensibilization was made with sublingual nitrate during ten more minutes. Patients whose age was ≥65 were considered to be elderly. Results: Patients were mostly females (63.8%) and mean age was 49.1 ± 22.2 years old. The tilt table test was considered positive in 334 patients (51.9%), from which 63.6% after nitrate use. The most frequent positive response was the mixed type (72.3%). The comparison of the results between elderly and non‐elderly patients is shown below. Test resultElderlyNon‐elderlyPositive 93 (45.8%)241 (54.9%)Negative110 (54.2%)196 (45.1%)Total203437p = 0.03. A greater proportion of negative results among elderly was observed both in men and in women, but was only significant in the second group. Conclusions: Elderly patients had significantly less positive results in the tilt table test. The greater presence of other causes of syncope in this age group may have contributed for this finding. TELEMONITORING FOR CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT DEVICES O113 INTEGRATING OUT‐PATIENT AND REMOTE FOLLOW‐UP OF CARDIOVASCULAR IMPLANTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE PATIENTS Chronaki C (1); Sfakianakis S (1); Petrakis Y (1); Yang M (2); Radulescu M (3); Eichelberg M (2); Laleci G (4); Hinterbuchner L (5); Arbelo E (6); Dogac A (5); iCARDEA project (1) FORTH, Gr (2) OFFIS, De (3) SFRG, A (4) SRDC, Tr (5) SALK, A (6) HCPB, ES Introduction: Annual costs of CVD in the European Union estimated at 192B€, comprise direct healthcare costs (57%), productivity losses (21%), informal care (22%). Health providers and CIED patients can benefit from integrated care engaging health teams in tele‐monitoring and e‐visits in responding to patient‐reported or device‐recorded events or replacing hospital followup. Guideline‐driven services based on consistently implemented standards have the potential to enable integrated care leading to productivity gains and potentially cost savings. The iCARDEA care planner employs AF and VT practice guidelines linked to hospital records, personal health records, and telemonitoring reports to reduce information overload and improve decision support. Thus, interoperability testing is critical for iCARDEA. Methods: IHE integration profiles specs constrain standards and terminologies to achieve interoperability. The care planner uses CM to subscribe and receive patient data, IDCO to process CIED reports, XPHR to exchange personal health data, XDS to share standardized clinical content, PIX/PDQ to cross‐reference patient IDs, and ATNA for security and auditing. Of‐the‐shelf testing tools for IHE profiles were collected and evaluated. Custom tools and anonymised data filled gaps. Results: Comprehensive survey and analysis noted limited test tools, benchmarks, and data sets for complex workflows. The IHE MESA and NIST tools cover most profiles. TestBATN can support testing complex business processes for multiple profiles. Off‐the‐shelf and custom tools with sample datasets were successfully used in testing iCARDEA. Conclusions: A guideline‐driven care planner and supporting components for AF and VT can support integrated healthcare processes for remotely managing CIED patients. Adhoc interoperability testing may works, but to ripe the benefits of integrated care, certified data sets, interoperability testing and benchmarking tools for eHealth must be adopted. VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIAS O114 VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS ARISING FROM THE EPICARDIAL VENOUS ANATOMY: PREVALENCE, MAPPING AND ABLATION Mountantonakis S; Jauregui M; Dixit S; Hutchinson M; Riley M; Lin D; Garcia F; Gerstenfeld E; Callans D; Marchlinski F Electrophysiology Section, Division of Cardiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA Introduction: The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence, mapping, and limitations in ablation of ventricular tachycardias or ventricular premature complexes (VT) arising from the coronary venous anatomy. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients (pts) referred for ablation of VT who underwent detailed activation and pace mapping of ventricular outflow tracts, coronary venous system (CVS) and coronary cusps. Results: Among 294 pts with VT referred from catheter ablation, 37 (16 males, age 52 ± 16 years) had earliest activation in the CVS (41 ± 20 ms pre QRS). Of those, 16 (43%) had earliest in the distal great cardiac (GCV), 19 (51%) in the anterior interventricular vein (AIV) and 2 (5%) in the middle cardiac veins. In all cases, pacemaps generated from the vein system were better match then those from the cusps or endocardium. Successful RF ablation within vein was achieved in 23/37 patients (62%). Proximity to coronary vessel precluded adequate energy delivery in 14 pts (38%) and in 2 pts (5%) the ablation catheter could not be passed to the site of earliest activation identified by a 6 F catheter. Successful ablation was achieved at adjacent epicardial sites in 2 pts, from the adjacent left coronary cusp (LCC) in 6 pts and from the opposite endo in 2 pts to avoid coronary damage for overall success of 84%. Typically, longer ablation times with increased power were used/required at adjacent sites to achieve success. Conclusions: VTs commonly (13%) arise from the CVS and can be effectively eliminated with RF delivery within the veins in the majority of pts (62%). Limitations include presence of coronary arteries, adequate power delivery and decreased ability to position the ablation catheter at an earlier distant venous site. Ablation from the LCC and less frequently on the endocardial site opposite earliest recorded venous site can be alternatives sites of effective and safe ablation to improve overall outcome to >80%. O115 "CHANNELS" IDENTIFIED DURING SUBSTRATE MAPPING OF VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (VT): ISTHMUS OR BYSTANDER? Mountantonakis SE; Park RE; Hutchinson M; Dixit S; Cooper J; Marchlinski F; Gerstenfeld E Electrophysiology Section, Division of Cardiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA Introduction: Substrate mapping in patients (pts) with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and VT may involve lowering the voltage cutoff that identifies scar (<1.5 mV) to identify "channels" within scar that contain the VT circuit. However, the number of "channels" present and their relationship to the VT isthmus is unknown. We assessed the relationship of "channels" to the VT isthmus in pts with mappable VT. Methods: Detailed bipolar endocardialvoltage maps (396 ± 140 points) from 20 males (age 69 ± 9 yrs) with ICM(EF 32 ± 9%) and tolerated VT were reviewed. Endocardial scar was defined by voltage < 1.5 mV. The voltage cutoff was reduced in steps of 0.1 mV until the maximum number of channels were seen. The VT isthmus was identified by entrainment criteria and tagged on the map. The first channel to appear and proximity to the VT isthmus was measured. Results: Inferior/anterior scar was present in 16/4 pts, respectively (scar area = 38 ± 20 cm 2). With lowering of the voltage cutoff, 25 "channels" through scar were identified in 15 pts (75%) at high/low voltage cutoffs = 0.97 ± 047 mV/0.50 ± 0.40 mV). The clinical isthmus was included in a channel in 11/20 pts (55%) or 11/25 (44%) channels. In 7/11 pts, the isthmus was included in the first channel to appear. Conclusions: Channels can be identified in 75% of patients by adjusting the voltage limits of bipolar maps, however only 44% harbor a clinical VT isthmus. O116 REVERSAL OF OUTFLOW TRACT VENTRICULAR PREMATURE DEPOLARIZATION INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY WITH ABLATION: EFFECT OF RESIDUAL ARRHYTHMIA BURDEN AND PRIOR CARDIOMYOPATHY ON OUTCOME Mountantonakis SE; Frankel DS; Garcia F; Lin D; Gerstenfeld E; Riley M; Hutchinson M; Dixit S; Callans D; Marchlinski F Electrophysiology Section, Division of Cardiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA Introduction: Outflow tract premature ventricular complexes (OTVPDs) can be associated with reversible left ventricular cardiomyopathy (LVCM). Limited data exists regarding outcome with ablation of OTVPDs and LVCM in patients with residual VPDs after ablation and preexisting LVCM. Methods: 69 patients (43 men; mean age 51 ± 16 years) with non‐ischemic LVCM (LVEF 35 ± 9%, diastolic diameter 5.8 ± 0.7 cm) were referred for ablation of frequent OTVPDs (29 ± 13% per 24 hours). Nineteen (28%) patients had more than one VPD morphology whereas the presence of LVCM was diagnosed prior to the occurrence of VPDs in 20 (29%) patients. Results: VPDs originated in the right or left ventricular outflow tract in 27 (39%) and 42 (61%) pts respectively. Ablation was not successful in 5 pts (7%) primarily due to proximity to coronary vessel. After a follow up of 11 ± 6 months, 44 (66%) patients had no VPDs (<1%), 15 (22%) had decreased (>80%) VPD burden and 8 (12%) had no clinical improvement with persistent (5 patients) or recurrent (3 patients) VPDs. Only patients with either complete resolution or decreased VPD burden had a significant improvement in their LV function and size (ΔEF 13 ± 9%, p < 0.001; ΔLVDD 0.4 ± 0.8 cm, p < 0.04). Although, the degree of LVEF improvement correlated negatively with the burden of residual VPDs (r‐0.574, p < 0.001) no significant difference was found between patients with complete elimination vs significant suppression of VPD burden. Patients with preexisting LVCM, had a more modest but significant improvement in LV function (ΔLVEF 8%, p < 0.001; ΔLVDD 0.3 mm, p 0.013). Conclusions: 1) Significant reduction and not complete elimination of VPD burden seems to be important in improvement of LVEF in patients with VPD‐related LVCM. This implies that in patients with pleomorphic VPDs, targeting the dominant focus (foci) may suffice as an endpoint. 2) Elimination of VPDs is beneficial even in pts with preexisting LVCM. O117 CHARACTERISTICS OF UNSUCCESSFUL CATHETER ABLATION OF VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA Ban J‐E; Park Y‐M; Choi J‐I; Lim H‐E; Park S‐W; Kim Y‐H Arrhythmia Center, Korea University, Seoul, Korea Background: This study was to identify the electrophysiologic characteristics of unsuccessful catheter ablation (CA) of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods: Out of 302 patients undergoing CA of VAs, 43 consecutive patients (14.2%, 43 ± 14 years) who attempted but failed to eliminate VAs with the first CA (US group). US group was compared with successful CA group (S group) to assess predictors to affect unsuccessful ablation. Results: US group included 8 patients underwent unsuccessful CA and 35 patients underwent repeated CA due to arrhythmia recurrence. Presenting VA was ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 24 patients (55.8%) but premature ventricular complex in only 13 patients (30.2%). VT was more common in US group (55.8%) than that of S group (39.0%, P = 0.03). The ejection fraction of the left ventricle (LV) was lower in US group (38.0 ± 7.2%) than in S group (43.7 ± 6.9%, P = 0.02). The earliest activation time (EAT) prior to QRS onset in US group (29.8 ± 7.8 ms) was later than S group (37.4 ± 8.4 ms, P = 0.04). There was a significant difference in VAs origin from‐right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) (41.8% in US group vs. 60.2% in S group, P = 0.02). There were no significant differences in QRS width during VAs between two groups. Conclusions: A VT as presenting VAs, the severity of LV dysfunction, later EAT and non‐RVOT origin were associated with unsuccessful CA, in whom repeated CA was often required. OTHER O118 USE OF THE LATITUDE PATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR HEART FAILURE PATIENTS: A SINGLE‐CENTER PROSPECTIVE STUDY Guarracini F; Zuccaro LM; Rebecchi M; de Ruvo E; Sciarra L; Fagagnini A; De Luca L; Martino A; Sforza M; Calò L Division of Cardiology, Policlinico Casilino, Rome, Italy Background: The risk stratification for hospitalization in heart failure (HF) patients is traditionally assessed during clinical visits. Latitude patient management System (LS) is the first HF management tool using wireless telemetry present in implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and biventricular defibrillators (CRT‐D) that is linked to remotely collected blood pressure (BP) and body weight measurements. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of LS to improve the clinical management of HF episodes in patients with implanted ICDs and CRT‐D devices. Methods and Results: This single‐center prospective study enrolled a population of 40 HF patients (mean age 66.6 ± 13.4, years, 31 males) who underwent CRT‐D or ICD implantation between September 2009 and June 2010 in our Hospital. All patients received a communicator and home‐monitoring equipment (including a weight scale and BP monitor) and underwent training. Significant clinical events were reported in 18 (45%) patients at a mean follow‐up of 12 ± 3 months. Pharmacological therapy optimization via telephone contact was sufficient to resolve clinical problems in 11 (61.2%) patients. An in clinical office evaluation was necessary to optimize the management or device‐programming in 2 (11.1%) patients. Five patients (27.7%) were hospitalized because they needed intravenous pharmacological therapy or interventional therapy for atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. No hospitalization for acute HF was present. High satisfaction was expressed by physicians who participated in the study. Conclusions: Our results suggest that LS may improve the clinical management of HF patients with an implanted ICD or CRT‐D. Further studies are needed to compare the clinical impact of LS with standard care methods. O119 REDUCED DECELERATION CAPACITY OF HEART RATE PREDICTS TOTAL MORTALITY IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS Arsenos P; Gatzoulis K; Dilaveris P; Gialernios T; Archontakis S; Tsiachris D; Aggelis A; Pietri G; Kartsagoulis E; Stefanadis C; APRET First Department of Cardiology, Medical School, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece Purpose: Previous studies reported that the Deceleration Capacity (DC) analysis of heart rate is a powerful predictor of mortality (TM) in post myocardial infarction patients. We examined whether DC is an adequate TM predictor in heart failure patients [mean Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) = 32.6 ± 10.1%], as well. Methods: We prospectively screened 230 patients (age: 64 ± 13.4 years, male: 83%, NYHA class: 2.3 ± 0.5, CAD:82%, DCMP: 18%) under optimum treatment with ECG, SAECG, ECHO and 24 hours HOLTER. After 17 ± 16.1 months of follow up, 37 deaths occurred (arrhythmic = 13, pump failure = 17, non cardiac = 7). Echocardiographically determined LVEF, filtered QRS (SAECG), NSVT episodes > 1/24 hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, DC, mean Heart Rate, SDNN/HRV, mean QTc (24 hour HOLTER), were calculated and statistically analyzed for the two groups. Results: In univariate analysis, DC was a statistically significant predictor of TM (Log rank test p = 0.007). Furthermore after Cox regression analysis adjusted for LVEF, fQRS, NSVT episodes >1/24 hours, VPBs > 240/24 hours, mean Heart Rate, SDNN, and QTc (24 hour HOLTER), DC remained an important and independent TM predictor with Hazard Ratio: 0.862 (p = 0.01) 95% CI: 0.764–0.973. A cut off point of DC < 2.5 presented Hazard Ratio: 2.925 (p = 0.01) 95% C.I.: 1.287–6.647. Conclusions: In our patients cohort with impaired systolic function and short term follow up, DC was an important and independent predictor of TM. Further evaluation of the reduced DC of heart rate in a larger population with longer follow up is needed. O120 ATRIAL SENSING PERFORMANCE OF ICD LEADS WITH FLOATING ATRIAL DIPOLE Schirdewan A 1 ; Safak E 1 ; Schmitz D 2 ; Konorza T 3 ; Wende C 4 , on behalf of the Linoxsmart S DX Master Study Investigators 1 Charité Berlin , 2 Elisabeth Hospital Essen , 3 University Hospital Essen , 4 Marien Hospital Papenburg (Germany) Purpose: In this clinical investigation the atrial sensing quality of the single‐coil ICD lead Linoxsmart S DX has been investigated. This ICD lead has an additional floating atrial dipole which enables the detection of right atrial signals. Therefore IEGM‐recording and statistics of the atrium in a single chamber ICD system can be provided. Methods: The Linoxsmart S DX ICD lead has been implanted with a Lumax VR‐T 540 DX ICD of BIOTRONIK in 116 patients in 7 European countries. Atrial sensing was investigated at pre‐hospital discharge, 1, 3 and 6 month follow‐up. The patients were asked to take three body positions: lying dorsal and normal breathing, sitting and palms pressing together, and sitting with Jendrassik manoeuvre. The atrial sensing performance was observed in all three positions. The atrial senses were analyzed using the respective IEGMs. Results: In 1074 out of 1163 atrial sensing tests, appropriate atrial sensing performance was determined by the investigator. This results in a rate of appropriate atrial sensing of 92.3%.

The prospective randomized single‐center study "Mesh Ablator versus Cryoballoon Pulmonary Vein Ablation of Symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation" (MACPAF) compared the efficacy and safety of two balloon‐based pulmonary vein ablation systems. Methods: Patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF were randomized 1:1 for a first procedure of PV ablation using the Arctic Front® (Medtronic, Inc.) or the HD Mesh Ablator® catheter (C.R. Bard, Inc.). The primary endpoint was complete PV isolation (PVI). Results: Overall, 32 (mean age 62.3 ± 8.4 years, 40.6% female; median CHA2DS2‐VASc score 2.0 (1–3) underwent PV ablation according to study criteria. Complete PVI was achieved in 13 (76.5%) of 17 Arctic Front® patients but in none of the 15 HD Mesh Ablator® patients (p<0.0001). There were one major and two minor complications in each study arm but no clinically evident stroke. Postprocedural AF recurrence was detected within hospital stay in 2 (11.8%) Arctic Front® patients and in 7 (46.7%) HD Mesh Ablator® patients (p = 0.049). Conclusions: The MACPAF study revealed a superiority of the Arctic Front® catheter concerning complete PVI. Because of the insufficient efficacy of the HD Mesh Ablator® catheter, the safety board decided to stop the MACPAF study prematurely. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) on cardiopulmonary function, quality of life, depression, and hemodynamic parameters in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and to compare the efficacy of hospitaland home-based exercise programs. Patients and methods: Between December 2014 to May 2016, a total of 30 patients with PAH were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to either a hospital-based (n=15) or home-based exercise program (n=15). The hospital group was assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation (three days/week, 1 hour/week 50 to 70% maximal oxygen uptake [PvO2]) program for eight weeks. The home-based exercise group received home exercises alone. Before and after eight weeks of rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated for their functional status (PvO2), pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1), mL, forced vital capacity (FVC), mL and FEV1/FVC%, quality of life using Short Form-36 (SF-36), depression severity using Beck Depression Inventory, and hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. Results: Of the patients, 12 completed the study in each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional status, quality of life, depression severity, and hemodynamic parameters after the rehabilitation compared baseline between the groups. Conclusion: Based on our study results, short-term CPR seems not to be beneficial in patients with PAH. We recommend long-term rehabilitation programs to achieve more benefits from aerobic exercise training in this patient population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (iVF) is diagnosed in cardiac arrest survivors without an identifiable cause. Data regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in iVF patients are lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the HRQoL of iVF patients and to compare it to patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) diagnosed with an underlying disease and healthy subjects. Methods In 61 iVF patients with an ICD (iVF-ICD) and 59 ICD patients with a diagnosis (diagnosis-ICD), HRQoL was assessed using the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the ICD Patient Concerns (ICDC) Questionnaire. In addition, 860 healthy subjects completed the SF-12. Results IVF-ICD showed similar SF-12 physical summary scores compared with diagnosis-ICD patients (50.8 [interquartile range (IQR) = 42.1-53.9] vs 54.1 [IQR = 46.5-58.3]; P = 0.080) and healthy subjects (51.8 [IQR = 45.9-54.1]; P = 0.691). The mental summary score was impaired in iVF-ICD patients compared with diagnosis-ICD patients (45.9 [IQR = 40.7-49.4] vs 54.6 [IQR = 46.0-57.9]; P < 0.001) and healthy subjects (47.7 [IQR = 43.0-50.4]; P = 0.027). Scores on all five EQ-5D domains were similar between iVF-ICD patients and diagnosis-ICD patients, as well as symptoms of severe depression (19% vs 12%; P = 0.101). ICD concerns were similar between iVF-ICD and diagnosis-ICD patients (ICDC-scores 2 vs 2; P = 0.494). Conclusions Data suggest that there is a reduced mental HRQoL in patients with iVF compared to other cardiac arrest survivors. Screening and treatment of psychological distress should therefore be considered in iVF patients. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - To characterize the mechanisms, distribution, and outcomes of traumatic limb amputations among military casualties during the Israel-Hamas War, and to evaluate the association between life-saving interventions and survival. This retrospective observational study analyzed data from the Israel Defense Forces Trauma Registry. The cohort included 3253 urgent battlefield casualties who sustained limb injuries and were treated by IDF medical forces between October 27th, 2023 and October 31st, 2024. The primary outcomes were anatomical distribution of amputations, mechanism of injury, application of life-saving interventions (tourniquet, whole blood, freeze-dried plasma), and survival on the way to hospital admission and during hospitalization. Of 3253 casualties, 135 (4.2 %) were initially recorded as having amputations. After review, 112 cases were confirmed to involve at least one amputated limb. Explosive devices were the leading cause of injury among amputees (88.9 %). Among the 112 confirmed cases, 50 (44.6 %) survived until hospital admission, and 62 (55.4 %) were pronounced dead prior to hospital arrival; 4 of the survivors died during hospitalization. Tourniquets were applied in 90 % of survivors compared to 24.2 % of deceased (p < 0.001). Whole blood and FDP were administered more frequently in survivors (60 % and 40 %, respectively) than in deceased casualties (9.7 % and 4.8 %, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Above-knee amputations were the most common anatomical level in both groups. Combat-related limb amputations during the Israel-Hamas War were primarily caused by explosions and were associated with high mortality. Prompt application of life-saving interventions, particularly tourniquets and early blood resuscitation, was strongly associated with survival. These findings emphasize the critical need for rapid hemorrhage control and trauma care readiness in modern military conflict settings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background: Early recognition of cardiac arrest and prompt start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) boost survival rates and reduce postarrest consequences. Little information is available about the fundamental CPR knowledge of healthcare workers who work with children in Ethiopia. Methods: All physicians, regardless of seniority, participated in this cross-sectional survey from June to August 2022. They received a structured survey that was modified from the American Heart Association (AHA) Basic Life Support (BLS) test which was made up of 10 questions about participants' job experience and 25 multiple-choice CPR knowledge questions. Data analysis was done using a multinomial logistic regression test with a p value of 0.05. Result: One hundred sixty-eight doctors with various levels of seniority participated in this study. The participants included a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1, a median age of 28 years, 92 (57.9%) male participants, and 124 (78%) participants with less than 5 years of clinical experience. Ninety-seven participants, or 61%, had scored less than 75% whereas 13 (8.2%), participants, had good knowledge that is scoring above 75%. Participants who had training in CPR within the previous year showed significantly higher levels of knowledge than those who hadn't. Even though 90% of the participants claimed to have CPR knowledge, the majority of participants were found not to have below 75%. Conclusion: The study concludes that while many doctors believe they have adequate CPR knowledge, actual knowledge levels are insufficient. Staff should undergo regular certification and assessments to ensure they retain their resuscitation knowledge. This ongoing evaluation is crucial for maintaining high standards of care and preparedness in emergencies.

AB  - We now know that the elements required to achieve the highest survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest include: witnessed arrest, rapid telephone notification of the emergency medical service, early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, rapid arrival within minutes of emergency personnel equipped with a defibrillator, and early advanced airway management and intravenous pharmacology. In the United States, and in several other countries innovative approaches have been tried to bring all these elements together in one system. These approaches include community-wide CPR training programs, telephone-assisted CPR instruction delivered at the time of a cardiac arrest, early defibrillation performed by family members of high risk patients, early defibrillation performed by minimally trained community responders, and early defibrillation performed by minimally trained ambulance personnel. Controlled, prospective studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and practicality of all of these approaches. New studies are in progress with the prehospital use of early transcutaneous cardiac pacing and these show promise. This article reviews the evidence that supports these multi-layered and innovative approaches to the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between high and low temperature and outof- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with cardiac etiology. Methods: The study was conducted under a case-crossover design. Subjects were 97,500 patients aged 40 years or older with OHCA having a cardiac etiology in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka Prefecture from 2005 to 2012. We used national data with an Utstein-style resuscitation registration. Temperature was categorized into five categories with cut points of 5, 10, 24, and 30 °C. The reference category was 10–23.9 °C. Conditional logistic regression was used with adjustment for daily means of relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and daily amount of precipitation and hours of daylight. Results: Exposure to high temperature (≥30 °C) increased the risk of OHCA (OR = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.18). Further, low temperature (<5 °C) and relatively low temperature (5–9.9 °C) were also associated with OHCA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.16–1.25; OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.07–1.13, respectively). The temperature-OHCA association curves were U-shaped or J-shaped, and the association was more prominent among those aged 80 years or older. Conclusion: This study shows that the occurrence of OHCA with cardiac etiology is associated with low temperature. In addition, the occurrence is also associated with high temperature in those aged 80 years or older. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - To study the long-term evolution of patients with lower-limb Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), focusing on functional and proprioceptive aspects and quality of life. In 20 patients suffering from chronic distal lower-limb CRPS diagnosed using Budapest criteria, we assessed joint position sense and strength of the knee muscles at the CRPS and unaffected leg, functional exercise capacity, pain, CRPS severity score, quality of life and kinesiophobia. Similar assessments were performed in 20 age-matched controls. The joint position performance (at 45°) was significantly lower for the CRPS leg as compared to controls. The knee extensor strength of the CRPS leg was significantly reduced as compared to the unaffected leg (−27%) and controls (−42%). CRPS patients showed significantly reduced performance at the 6 min-walk test as compared to their age group predicted value and controls. Patients suffering from CRPS for 3.8 years in average still exhibit high pain, severity and kinesiophobia scores. Long-term deficits in strength and proprioceptive impairments are observed at the knee joint of the CRPS leg. This persistent functional disability has significant repercussions on the quality of life. We highlight the importance of including strength and proprioceptive exercises in the therapeutic approaches for CPRS patients. The long-term evolution of patients suffering from lower-limb Complex Regional Pain Syndrome is associated with persistent disability, pain and impacts the quality of life. Strength, proprioceptive, functional and subjective assessments are necessary to better identify deficits. Rehabilitation should focus on the overall deficit of the affected and contralateral limb.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was previously considered a disease presenting with multiorgan involvement and a wide range of symptoms. Today, the disease presents with no symptoms or mild symptomatology in most patients. Data regarding nonspecific symptoms such as pain, fatigue, memory loss, depression, and other neuropsychiatric signs have been ambiguous, and results from prospective long‐term randomized control trials are lacking. The Scandinavian Investigation on Primary Hyperparathyroidism (SIPH) is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 10‐year follow up, comparing parathyroidectomy (PTX) to observation without any treatment (OBS). From 1998 to 2005, 191 patients with mild PHPT were included from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. A total of 95 patients were randomized to PTX and 96 to OBS. The generic Short Form‐36 survey (SF‐36) and the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) were studied at baseline, 2, 5, and 10 years after randomization. After 10 years, the PTX group scored significantly better on vitality (PTX 65.1 ± 20.2 versus OBS 57.4 ± 22.7; p =.017) compared to the OBS group in SF‐36. We found no differences between the groups in the physical subscales. The OBS group had no significant change in any of the SF‐36 scores throughout the study. The CPRS showed an improvement of symptoms in both groups for single items and sum scores after 10 years compared to baseline. There were, however, no significant differences between the two groups in the CPRS data. The results of this large and long‐term RCT indicate improvement in some of the mental domains of SF‐36 following PTX. However, the treatment effects between the groups were subtle with uncertain clinical significance. The observation group had stable SF‐36 values and improvement in CPRS symptom‐scores. Thus, in considering only quality of life (QoL) and in the absence of declines in renal and skeletal parameters, it may be safe to observe patients with mild PHPT for a decade. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is a leading cause of mortality in post-cardiac arrest (post-CA) patients who successfully survive the initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but later die in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Therefore, a key priority of post-resuscitation ICU care is to prevent and limit the impact of HIBI by optimizing the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and demand. Traditionally, an optimal systemic oxygen balance is considered to ensure the brain's oxygen balance. However, the validity of this assumption is uncertain, as the brain constitutes only 2% of the body mass while accounting for approximately 20% of basal oxygen consumption at rest. Hence, there is a real need to monitor cerebral oxygenation realistically. Several imaging and bedside monitoring methods are available for cerebral oxygenation monitoring in post-CA patients. Unfortunately, each of them has its limitations. Imaging methods require transporting a critically ill unstable patient to the scanner. Moreover, they provide an assessment of the oxygenation state only at a particular moment, while brain oxygenation is dynamic. Bedside methods, specifically near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2), and jugular venous oxygen saturation monitoring (SjvO2), have not often been used in studies involving post-CA patients. Hence there is ambiguity regarding clear recommendations for using these bedside monitors. Presently, the most promising option seems to be using the NIRS as an indicator of effective CPR. We present a narrative review focusing on bedside methods and discuss the evidence for their use in adult patients after cardiac arrest.

AB  - Unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is in most cases due to ventricular fibrillation or rapid ventricular tachycardia. The usual therapeutic strategy in survivors starts with drug treatment, in case of failure followed by nonpharmacological therapy, which may include catheter ablation, ablative surgery, and finally defibrillator implantation. In most cases, this strategy is long lasting and very expensive. Implantation of a defibrillator as a first choice therapy may be cost effective, especially if the probability of successful drug treatment is low. However, cost-effective aspects have been studied only retrospectively and in models. In 1989 we started a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) as first choice therapy ("early" AICD implantation) in successfully resuscitated postinfarct patients. Evaluation is being done in a randomized way with one group having early AICD implantation and the other group following the usual conventional therapeutic strategy. We compare medical, economic, and quality-of-life aspects. As of June 1992, 46 patients have entered the study. Totally 60 patients will be included. Results are expected in 1993 and will be expressed as cost effectiveness ratios in both study arms. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background: T-wave alternans (TWA) is a promising electrocardiogram (ECG) predictor of sudden cardiac arrest, yet needs specialized recordings for conventional spectral analysis. Modified moving average (MMA) analysis is a new approach that can measure TWA from routine ECGs, thus widening its applicability. However, MMA-TWA has not been calibrated against spectral TWA nor outcome in high risk patients. We hypothesized that spectral and MMA-TWA would both predict arrhythmia-free survival on long-term prospective follow-up. Methods and Results: In 41 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 31 ± 13%), we studied TWA simultaneously using spectral and MMA during pacing (< 110 beats/min). MMA amplified TWA over spectral analyses (13.0 ± 8.28 μV vs 1.96 ± 5.15 μV, P < 0.001). On 542 ± 311 days' follow-up, from clinic visits, telephonic interviews, and device interrogations, there were 11 deaths or sustained ventricular arrhythmias (‘events’). Positive spectral TWA (≥1.9 μV) identified patients with from those without events (P = 0.02). Receiver-operating characteristics for MMA-TWA showed that the cutpoint ≥ 10.75 μV was optimal for the combined endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis using this MMA-TWA cutpoint trended to predict events (P = 0.06), while MMA combined with spectral TWA identified events (P = 0.01). Conclusions: MMA amplifies TWA compared to traditional spectral analyses, but both likely reflect similar pathophysiology. Validation in larger populations will enable MMA-TWA to be widely applied to stratify risk for sudden cardiac arrest. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are the most common cause for sudden cardiac death. The success of catheter ablation for supraventricular tachycardias led to the supposition that ablation could also be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias. Despite the promising results in bundle branch reentry and some forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, the success rate in patients with coronary artery disease is still low. There is hope that new approaches to reliably localize the critical region of the tachycardia and new ablation techniques to create larger areas of injury may lead to a wider application of ablation therapy in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. Survivors of cardiac arrest typically have more rapid and unstable arrhythmias than patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, and these rapid arrhythmias frequently degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. The instability of the arrhythmia makes it impossible to localize the arrhythmia origin with current mapping techniques. Experimental and clinical data, however, suggest that these arrhythmias also frequently start from a localized area of electrical activation. With developments in mapping techniques and energy delivery, catheter ablation may soon become a feasible therapeutic approach in some patients with unstable arrhythmias. The article discusses the prerequisites for this approach and suggests the patients who may be appropriate candidates for this technique. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - In a context of higher reliance on irrigation schemes to ensure food security, it is crucial to understand institutional success of water resource management. In addition to other factors explored in great depth by the CPR literature, the actions of long-term appropriators contribute to the success of institutions. However, only a limited amount of work has attempted to examine the actual relationship between length of tenure and institutional success. To examine these relationships, we analyze a long-enduring CPR, the Mwea irrigation scheme (MIS) in Kenya, a network created in the 1950s and whose appropriators have held different lengths of tenure. We explore payment of operation and maintenance (O&M) fees of 71 irrigation units over two consecutive years. We examine 422 household surveys in eight out of the 71 irrigation units on the practice of institutions. We find that length of tenure impacts institutional success by influencing the behaviors of appropriators. Appropriators with longer tenure promote institutional success by provisioning the resource in a more sustainable manner through achieving high payments of O&M fees. Relatively dissatisfied with the implementation of the rules, they use formal and informal means to criticize institutions and to promote institutional change and adaptation. In contrast, appropriators with shorter tenure achieve lower payments of O&M fees, they complain less, and are more satisfied with the existing implementation of the rules. They are satisfied with the status quo. Hence, it is through the pressure of experienced appropriators that institutions such as the MIS evolve and adapt to become more successful.

AB  - Objective: To summarize the literature relating to prehospital care at 5 km through marathon distance road races and present the epidemiology of common medical encounters, significant medical complications, and medical outcomes. Data Sources: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for the published literature pertaining to road race medical tent encounters at 5 km through marathon distance road races from 2000 to 2018. We included English-language, original articles reporting on injury and illness incidence. Main Results: Standard medical encounter definitions have recently been formulated in response to the previous lack of uniform definitions. The incidence of medical complications at road races may be influenced by environmental conditions and race distance. Minor and moderate medical encounters, such as dermatologic injuries, musculoskeletal injuries, and exercise-associated collapse, are common. Serious and life-threatening medical complications, including exertional heat stroke, exercise-associated hyponatremia, and cardiac arrest, are less frequent. Fatalities are also rare, with rates of 0.3 to 5 per 100 000 participants reported at marathons. The ratio of hospital transports to medical encounters is low. Conclusions: On-site medical services play a key role in the safety of both runners and the community. Future research and care initiatives in this field should focus on optimizing treatment protocols, promoting injury prevention efforts and reducing host community costs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - The intrinsic issue associated with the application of microbes for practical pollution remediation involves maintaining the expected activity of engaged strains or consortiums as effectively as that noted under laboratory conditions. Faced with various stress factors, degraders with dormancy ability are more likely to survive and exhibit degradation activity. In this study, a hydrocarbonoclastic and halotolerant strain, Gordonia polyisoprenivorans ZM27, was isolated via stimulation with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf). Long-term exposure to dual stresses of 10% NaCl and starvation induced ZM27 to enter a viable but nonculturable (VBNC)-like state, and ZM27 cells could be resuscitated upon Rpf stimulation. Notable changes in both morphological and physiological characteristics between VBNC-like ZM27 cells and resuscitated cells confirmed the response to Rpf and their robust resistance against harsh environments. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis indicated ZM27 could be a generalist degrader with dormancy ability. Subsequently, VBNC-like ZM27 was applied in a soil microcosm experiment to investigate the practical application potential under harsh conditions. VBNC-like ZM27 combined with Rpf stimulation exhibited the most effective biodegradation performance, and the initial n -hexadecane content (1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) decreased by 63.29% after 14-day incubation. Based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis, Gordonia exhibited a positive response to Rpf stimulation. The relative abundance of genus Gordonia was negatively correlated with that of Alcanivorax , a genus of obligate hydrocarbon degrader with the greatest abundance during soil incubation. Based on the degradation profile and community analysis, generalist Gordonia may be more efficient in hydrocarbon degradation than specialist Alcanivorax under harsh conditions. The characteristics of ZM27, including its sustainable culturability under long-term stress, response to Rpf and robust performance in soil microcosms, are valuable for the remediation of petroleum pollution under stressful conditions. Our work validated the importance of dormancy and highlighted the underestimated role of low-activity degraders in petroleum remediation. [Display omitted] • Gordonia polyisoprenivorans ZM27 can respond to resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf). • Dormancy is a strategy for ZM27 to keep activity in hypersaline environments. • Rpf combined with low-activity ZM27 enhanced n -hexadecane degradation in soil. • Outcompeting of Gordonia may be attributed to dormancy ability.

AB  - • This is an in-depth study of patients managed surgically for symptomatic non-union rib fractures. • This is the first study, to our knowledge, where both subjective and objective methods are used to assess the outcome of surgery for these patients. • Most patients are satisfied with the surgery and experience a decrease in symptoms. • Objective evaluation shows decreased lung function, chest wall movement, and QoL and persistent disability. Traumatic chest wall injuries are common however the incidence of non-union rib fractures is unknown. Previous studies have suggested that surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures could be beneficial in selected patients, although many experience persisting pain despite surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term outcome after surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures. This is a cross-sectional study including adults (≥18 years) managed surgically for symptomatic non-union rib fractures with plate fixation during the period 2010–2020 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Patients operated for acute chest wall injury or injury due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded. Patients answered standardized questionnaires concerning remaining symptoms and satisfaction with surgery, quality of life (QoL, EQ-5D-5 L) and disability (Disability Rating Index, DRI). Lung function, movement of chest wall and thoracic spine, and shoulder function (Boström index) were assessed. Sixteen patients, 12 men and four women, with mean age 61.6± 11.1 were included in the study. The mechanism of injury was trauma in 10 patients and cough-induced injuries in five patients. Lung disease was significantly more prevalent in cough-induced injuries compared to traumatic injuries, 5 vs 1 (p = 0.008). The mean follow-up time was 3.5 years. Ninety-four percent were satisfied with the surgery and reported that their symptoms had decreased, although 69 % had remaining symptoms, especially pain, from the chest wall. Quality of Life was decreased with EQ-5D-5 L index 0.819 (0.477–0.976) and EQ-VAS 69 (10–100). Disability Rating Index was 31.5 (1.3–76.7) with problems running, lifting heavy objects, and performing heavy work. Predicted lung function was decreased with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) 86.2 ± 14.2 %, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) 79.1 ± 10.7 % and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) 89.7 ± 14.5 %. Patients with cough-induced injuries had full shoulder mobility. Chest wall surgery for symptomatic non-union rib fractures results in decreased symptoms and patient satisfaction in most cases despite remaining symptoms, reduced lung function, chest wall movement, and QoL and persistent disability.

AB  - Trauma is a major cause of mortality globally, with post-traumatic hemorrhage being the leading cause of death amongst trauma patients. In this paper, the authors review the underlying pathophysiology of trauma-related hemorrhagic shock, specifically the factors which contribute to the development of the acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS). We then review the best available evidence for treatment strategies in the pre-hospital setting, as well as the in-hospital setting. Interventions that are strongly supported in the literature include utilization of a well-organized trauma system with direct transport to a designated trauma centre, the early use of tranexamic acid, and damage control orthopaedic surgical techniques and resuscitation protocols. Targeted resuscitation is an evolving field, with use of thromboelastography to guide resuscitation being a particularly promising area. Special trauma populations at particularly high risk are also reviewed, including the geriatric population, as well as unstable pelvic fractures, which are each at increased risk for poor outcomes, and deserve special attention. Major advances have been made in this important area, and ongoing research into the understanding and correction of ACoTS will continue to guide practice. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - To analyze the application value of damage control strategies combining pre-hospital emergency treatment with in-hospital treatment for multiple injuries in treating pelvic fracture complicated by multiple injuries. 120 patients with pelvic fracture complicated by multiple injuries admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to January 2023 were selected and divided into a damage control group (early temporary reduction after resuscitation, n = 60) and a control group (no reduction and resuscitation only, n = 60) by treatment methods. The control group was treated with conventional methods, while the damage control group was treated with the damage control strategy combining pre-hospital emergency treatment combined with in-hospital treatment in addition to conventional methods. The mortality rate, complication rate, fracture reduction quality, long-term efficacy, and patient satisfaction of the two groups were compared. The mortality rate of the damage control group was lower than that of the control group, and the difference has statistical significance (P <0.05); the incidence of infection, DIC, and MODS of the damage control group were lower than that of the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (P <0.05); the incidence of ARDS in the two groups is not that different (P >0.05); the fracture reduction quality and long-term therapeutic effect of patients in the two groups were statistically different, with the damage control group outperforming the control group in both aspects; the difference between the two groups in terms of patient satisfaction was statistically significant (P <0.05), with the patient satisfaction of the damage control group being higher than that of the control group. For patients with pelvic fracture, the application of the damage control strategy combining pre-hospital emergency treatment and in-hospital treatment is a boon to the standardization of the treatment process, the improvement of the treatment success rate and fracture reduction quality and the reduction of complications, and therefore is worth promoting in clinical practice. the early application of external fixation has helped with the definitive reduction at a time when the patuent was stable.

AB  - Among the various therapy options for survivors of ventricular tachycardia-ventricular fibrillation (VT-VF), the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) seems most promising. It reliably terminates VT-VF and thus significantly impacts sudden cardiac death (SCD) survival. It is more effective than any of the known antiarrhythmic drugs in prevention of SCD, particularly among survivors of cardiac arrest. Compared to VT surgery, the ICD therapy can be offered to a larger pool of patients and can be placed at a lower surgical risk. With proper patient selection, ICD therapy is of major benefits to its recipients since it markedly reduces the chances of VT-VF related mortality; the main cause of premature death in this population. The ICD therapy is cost effective when compared to other medical interventions and could be more so if the implant is carried out early in the course of VT-VF management. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background: Foundation course is an integral part of MBBS course and curriculum introduced by the National Medical Commission (NMC) that is cogently grounded to bridge conceptual and contextual gap of medical education placed at beginning of curriculum. Objective: This feedback evaluation was conducted on the First year 2019 MBBS students as a part of the foundation course program promulgated by the NMC to get candid reflection. Methods: An unlinked anonymous self-administered pretested open-ended questionnaire on feedback of content and outcome was used on internalization of 169 First year MBBS students regarding the month-long foundation course. Qualitative responses were analyzed on 'overall impression' on the course; 'best', 'worst' and 'unnecessary' parts of the course; lastly open question on 'How the Foundation course could have been better?. Results: Overall agreement on positive aspects was felt on schedule, facilitators, language of teaching, extracurricular activities. Best parts of the course were visits to the departments of College & Hospital including emergency and health centres, Basic Life Support, Immunization, History of Medicine, Taekwondo, Co-curricular physical activities, Communication, Interaction and Dedication of teachers, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Worst parts were Sports, Yoga, language class, strict 75% attendance. Unnecessary parts were Sports, Yoga, English compulsory class; Music, Computer. On 'How the Course could have been better' general comments was addition of subject specific classes and flexible attendance. Conclusions: This feedback analysis deduced acceptance and effectiveness of the course for undergraduate students to help them cope with stressful active professional learning later.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Early coagulation support (ECS) includes prompt infusion of tranexamic acid, fibrinogen concentrate, and packed red blood cells for initial resuscitation of major trauma patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effects, in terms of blood product consumption, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality, of the ECS protocol, compared to the massive transfusion protocol (MTP) in the treatment of major trauma patients.<bold>Patients and Methods: </bold>A retrospective analysis was conducted using the registry data of two Italian trauma centres. Adult major trauma patients with, or at risk of, active bleeding who were managed according to the MTP during the years 2011-2012, or the ECS protocol during the years 2013-2014 and were considered at risk of multiple transfusions, were enrolled. The primary endpoint was to determine whether the ECS protocol reduces the use of blood products in the acute management of trauma patients. Secondary endpoints were the outcome measures of length of stay in ICU, length of stay in hospital, and mortality at 24-hours and 28-days after hospital admission.<bold>Results: </bold>Among the 518 major trauma patients admitted to the trauma centres during the study period, 235 patients (118 in the pre-ECS period and 117 in the ECS period) matched one of the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Compared with the pre-ECS period, the ECS period showed a reduction in the average consumption of packed red blood cells (-1.87 units, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.40, -1.34), platelets (-1.28 units; 95% CI, -1.64, -0.91), and fresh frozen plasma (-1.69; 95% CI, -2.14, -1.25) in the first 24-hours. Furthermore, during the ECS period, we recorded a 10-day reduction in the hospital length of stay (-10 days, 95% CI, -11.6, -8.4) and a non-significant 28-day mortality increase.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The ECS protocol was effective in reducing blood product consumption compared to the MTP and confirmed the importance of early fibrinogen administration as a strategy of rapid coagulation. This novel approach may be adopted in real-life management of major trauma patients. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Training in trauma forms a fundamental component of general surgical training in Australia. It faces a number of challenges, including the limitations of working hours and increasing use of non-operative management techniques. Adjustment of rosters to encompass a "swing shift" (12pm-midnight) is one proposed solution to maximise exposure of junior surgical doctors to trauma. This proposal prompted a review of the timing of major trauma presentations and interventions at a Level 1 trauma centre.<bold>Methods: </bold>A retrospective observational study was performed of all major trauma presentations to Westmead Hospital, Australia over ten-years (2008-2017). Trauma operative procedures and major resuscitations were reviewed across three potential shifts: day shift (0730-1930), night shift (1930-0730) and "swing shift" (1200-midnight). Operative interventions included: laparotomy, thoracotomy/sternotomy, re-look laparotomy, rib fixation and tracheostomy. Descriptive statistics were obtained for between-shift comparisons.<bold>Results: </bold>Over the ten-years there were 3745 full trauma team activations (FTTAs). The "swing shift" had the highest number of FTTAs, patients with injury severity scores >15, patients requiring resuscitation and emergency operations (laparotomies, sternotomies/thoracotomies).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>More major trauma calls, laparotomies and thoracotomies occurred during a theoretical "swing shift" rather than the standard day and night shifts. Changing trauma rostering for junior doctors to reflect this peak in clinical and operative demand could change exposure to trauma training. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - In this study, high-efficient phenol-degrading bacterium Bacillus sp. SAS19 which was isolated from activated sludge by resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) addition, were immobilized on porous carbonaceous gels (CGs) for phenol degradation. The phenol-degrading capabilities of free and immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19 were evaluated under various initial phenol concentrations. The obtained results showed that phenol could be removed effectively by both free and immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19. Furthermore, for degradation of phenol at high concentrations, long-term utilization and recycling were more readily achieved for immobilized bacteria as compared to free bacteria. Immobilized bacteria exhibited significant increase in phenol-degrading capabilities in the third cycle of recycling and reuse, which demonstrated 87.2% and 100% of phenol (1600 mg/L) degradation efficiency at 12 and 24 h, respectively. The present study revealed that immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19 can be potentially used for enhanced treatment of synthetic phenol-laden wastewater.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are xenobiotic compounds that persists in the environment for long-term, though its productivity is banned. Abatement of the pollutants have become laborious due to it's recalcitrant nature in the environment leading to toxic effects in humans and other living beings. Biphenyl degrading bacteria co-metabolically degrade low chlorinated PCBs using the active metabolic pathway. bph operon possess different genetic arrangements in gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The binding ability of the genes and the active sites were determined by PCB docking studies. The active site of bph A gene with conserved amino acid residues determines the substrate specificity and biodegradability. Accumulation of toxic intermediates alters cellular behaviour, biomass production and downturn the metabolic activity. Several bacteria in the environment attain unculturable state which is viable and metabolically active but not cultivable (VBNC). Resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) and Rpf homologous protein retrieve the culturability of the so far uncultured bacteria. Recovery of this adaptive mechanism against various physical and chemical stressors make a headway in understanding the functionality of both environmental and medically important unculturable bacteria. Thus, this paper review about the general aspects of PCBs, cellular toxicity exerted by PCBs, role of unculturable bacterial strains in biodegradation, genes involved and degradation pathways. It is suggested to extrapolate the research findings on extracellular organic matters produced in culture supernatant of VBNC thus transforming VBNC to culturable state.

AB  - • Reduction of mesenteric perfusion is one of the first responses to blood loss; However, monitoring methods feasible in emergency care are lacking. • Methane level in exhaled air originates from intestinal anaerobic bacteria and being changed simultaneously with other markers of hemorrhage. • Monitoring methane in exhaled air is simple, non-invasive and it may possess high clinical value in the hemodynamic assessment of the injured. Identification of severe blood loss and hemorrhagic shock in polytrauma patients poses a key challenge for trauma teams across the world, as there are just a few objective parameters, on which clinicians can rely. We investigated the relationship between exhaled air methane (CH 4) concentration and blood loss in a polytrauma patient. Decreased blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is one of the first compensatory responses to blood loss. Gases produced by the anaerobic flora of the intestinal segment supplied by the SMA are the primary source of exhaled CH 4 , which diffuses through the intestinal microvessels into the circulation and is finally eliminated through the lungs. We hypothesized that diminution of exhaled CH 4 indicates blood loss and tested our theory in a severely injured patient. Exhaled CH 4 concentrations of a severely injured patient were measured using a photoacoustic spectroscope (PAS) attached to the exhalation side of the breathing circuit. The primary objective was to investigate the relationship between exhaled CH 4 and conventional indicators of hemorrhage including hemoglobin (Hb) levels, base deficit (BD) values and vital parameters (heart rate and systolic blood pressure) in the early phase of in-hospital care (first 4 h). A severely injured patient was admitted with unstable hemodynamic parameters and incomplete left lower limb amputation, (Injury Severity Score: 38, 74/36 mmHg, 76 bpm). At the time of arrival, considerably lower CH 4 levels were detected (22,800 PAU) in the exhaled air. During the first 4 h fluid and massive blood resuscitation, the exhaled CH 4 levels were continuously rising in parallel with Htc and Hb values. Corresponding to these changes, BD values displayed a decreasing tendency. Our study was conducted to characterize the changes in exhaled air CH 4 concentration in response to hemorrhagic shock and to provide data on a viable clinical use of an experimental technique. According to our results, the real-time detection of exhaled air CH 4 concentration is an applicable and promising technique for the early detection of bleeding and hemorrhagic shock in severely injured patients. Further research on large sample size and refinement of the PAS technique is required. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be interrupted for reliable rhythm analysis in current automatic external defibrillators because of artifacts produced by chest compressions. However, interruptions in CPR adversely affect the restoration of spontaneous circulation and survival. Suppressing CPR artifacts by digital signal processing techniques is a promising method to enable rhythm analysis during chest compressions, which would eliminate CPR interruptions for rhythm analysis. Although numerous methods have been developed to suppress CPR artifacts, the accuracy of rhythm analysis is still inadequate due to the residual artifact components in the filtered signal. This study proposes an enhanced adaptive filtering method to suppress CPR artifacts. A total of 183 shockable and 453 nonshockable segments of ECG signal, together with CPR-related reference signal, were extracted from 233 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients. The method was optimized on a training set with 85 shockable and 211 nonshockable segments, and evaluated on a testing set with 98 shockable and 242 nonshockable segments. Compared with artifact corrupted ECG signals, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increased from −9.8 ± 12.5 to 11.2 ± 11.8 dB, and the accuracy was improved from 74.1% to 92.0% after filtering with the proposed method. Compared with the traditional adaptive filter, the SNR was improved by 1.7 dB and the accuracy was improved by 5.6 points. These results indicated that the proposed method could effectively suppress the chest compression related artifacts and improve the accuracy of rhythm analysis during uninterrupted CPR.

AB  - Anxiety is a prevalent form of child psychopathology and has been predicted by maternal anxiety and mother–child attachment. Given that attachment processes are intertwined with emotion regulation, attachment-based therapies that foster regulatory skills may be effective in treating anxiety. The attachment-based therapeutic approach, Theraplay, therefore, demonstrates promise for family anxiety treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine Theraplay as a treatment for maternal anxiety and child anxiety in families where both mothers and children (ages 4–7) had clinically significant anxiety. Six mothers and six children (n = 12) with anxiety participated in treatment. Data were collected across three repeated baseline measurements, 12 Theraplay sessions, and a follow-up. Results indicated that all mother–child dyads’ anxiety scores decreased and were lower at the follow-up than at the baseline. In addition to reductions in anxiety, families demonstrated trends in increased closeness and decreased conflict posttreatment as measured by the Child–Parent Relationship Scale (CPRS; Pianta & Steinberg, 1992). Results demonstrate that Theraplay has a strong potential to be an effective anxiety treatment for both maternal and child anxiety. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Bystander CPR (BCPR) has been demonstrated to improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission, and quality of life in survivors. While previous studies have shown that African Americans are less likely to receive BCPR than Caucasians even after adjusting for variables such as socioeconomic status, BCPR rates in Latinos have not been reported. Objective: To describe BCPR rates in an urban African American and Latino population as compared to Caucasians. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Evaluation in Los Angeles (CARE-LA) database combined with the California Death Statistical Master File (CDSMF). The combined database included location, race/ethnicity/ethnic background, witnessed status, socioeconomic status, and other variables that have previously been associated with differing rates of BCPR. Results: There were 814 individuals included in the final study group (53% Caucasian, 28% African American, 19% Latino). African Americans and Latinos were younger than the Caucasians, had more events in the home and had a bystander CPR rate of 13% compared to 24% for the Caucasians (0R0.47 (95%Cl: 0.30-0.74) for African Americans and OR=0.48 (95%CI :0.28-0.80) for the Latinos). Bystander CPR was found to be an independent predictor of survival to hospital discharge and, after adjustment, Latino ethnicity was associated with lower rates of bystander CPR (OR 0.45 (95%CI:0.22-0.92)). Conclusion: After adjusting for other variables, Latinos in Los Angeles receive bystander CPR at approximately half the rate of Caucasians. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for adolescents is a prominent strategy to increase the number of community first responders who can recognize cardiac arrest and initiate CPR. More schools are adopting technology-based CPR training modalities to reduce class time and reliance on instructor availability and increase their capacity for wider training dissemination. However, it remains unclear whether these technology-based modalities are comparable with standard training. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review and perform meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based CPR training on adolescents' CPR skills and knowledge. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and Scopus from inception to June 25, 2021. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared technology-based training with standard training for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Studies were appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (The Cochrane Collaboration). Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Overall certainty of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: Seventeen RCTs involving 5578 adolescents were included. Most of the studies had unclear risks of selection bias (9/17, 53%) and high risks of performance bias (16/17, 94%). Interventions that included instructor guidance increased the likelihood of adolescents checking the responsiveness of the person experiencing cardiac arrest (risk ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.19-1.63) and calling the emergency medical services (risk ratio 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.24). Self-directed technology-based CPR training without instructor guidance was associated with poorer overall skill performance (Cohen d =–0.74, 95% CI –1.02 to –0.45). Training without hands-on practice increased mean compression rates (mean difference 9.38, 95% CI 5.75-13.01), whereas real-time feedback potentially yielded slower compression rates. Instructor-guided training with hands-on practice (Cohen d =0.45, 95% CI 0.13-0.78) and the use of computer programs or mobile apps (Cohen d =0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.86) improved knowledge scores. However, certainty of evidence was very low. Conclusions: Instructor-guided technology-based CPR training that includes hands-on practice and real-time feedback is noninferior to standard training in CPR skills and knowledge among adolescents. Our findings supported the use of technology-based components such as videos, computer programs, or mobile apps for self-directed theoretical instruction. However, instructor guidance, hands-on practice, and real-time feedback are still necessary components of training to achieve better learning outcomes for adolescents. Such a blended learning approach may reduce class time and reliance on instructor availability. Because of the high heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution. More high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes and follow-up data are needed. Finally, technology-based training can be considered a routine refresher training modality in schools for future research. J Med Internet Res 2022;24(12):e36423 doi:10.2196/36423

AB  - <bold>Objective: </bold>To study the palliative management of children dying on the wards of a tertiary referral centre. In particular to identify areas of difficulty and discuss ways in which these can be improved.<bold>Methodology: </bold>All children between the ages 1 and 19 years dying on the general paediatric wards of the John Hunter Children's Hospital (JHCH) (a tertiary referral centre in New South Wales Hunter Valley) between 1991 and 1998 were included in the study. The main outcome measures were the duration of 'terminal care only' treatment; time spent in hospital in the previous year; analgesia used, dose and route of administration; adjuvant medications; quality of life in the final 24 h.<bold>Results: </bold>Eighteen children (aged between 1 and 19 years) died on the general paediatric wards at JHCH between 1991 and 1998. The most common diagnosis was malignancy (five patients), with cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy and a degenerative neurological disorder each accounting for four patients, and one child had herpes simplex encephalitis. In all children the terminal nature of their condition was recognized and in all but three patients there was documentation of 'not for resuscitation' (NFR) orders following discussion with the child's parents. The mainstay of analgesia was an intravenous narcotic infusion with 11 (61%) children needing a morphine infusion. Fifteen patients (83%) required other medications including antiemetics, anticonvulsants and corticosteroids. Twelve (66%) children were semiconscious or unconscious on the day of death. Three children were uncomfortable and distressed, one alert and symptom free and in two cases the level of consciousness was not recorded. Three children continued to have seizures until their death.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The majority of terminally ill children were managed well with intravenous narcotics and adjuvant medications. There may be scope for such children to be managed successfully at home with appropriate support for the general practitioner by paediatric and palliative care specialists. Some cases in which palliation is difficult do remain in hospital and additional measures need to be employed to ensure a symptom free death for these children.

AB  - Objective: The purpose was to gain insight in the functioning of caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors at 12 months after a cardiac arrest. Secondly, the course of the wellbeing of the caregivers during the first year was studied. Finally, factors that are associated with a higher care burden at 12 months after the cardiac arrest were investigated. Subjects: A total of 195 family caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors were included. Main measures: Quality of life (SF-36, EuroQol-VAS), caregiver strain (CSI) and emotional functioning (HADS, IES) were measured at two weeks, three months and one year after the cardiac arrest. Thereby, the caregiver was asked to fill out the cognitive failure questionnaire (CFQ) to evaluate their view on the cognitive status of the patient. Results: Caregiver strain was high in 16 (15%) of the caregivers at 12 months. Anxiety was present in 33 (25%) caregivers and depression in 18 (14%) caregivers at 12 months. The repeated measures MANOVA showed that during the first year the following variables improved significantly: SF-36 domains social and mental health, role physical, role emotional and vitality, caregiver strain, HADS and IES (P<0.001). At 12 months caregiver strain correlated significantly (explained variance 63%, P=0.03) with caregiver HADS (P=0.01), EuroQol-VAS (P=0.02), and the CFQ (P<0.001), all measured at 12 months after the cardiac arrest. Conclusions: Overall wellbeing of the caregivers improves during the first year up to normal levels, but caregivers with emotional problems or perceived cognitive problems at 12 months are at risk for developing a higher care burden.

AB  - This narrative review aims to evaluate the efficacy of adjunct direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) in the treatment of adult damage control surgery (DCS) patients both with and without hemorrhagic shock, and its impact on associated outcomes. PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Cochrane were searched for relevant articles published through April 13th, 2023. Studies assessing the utilization of DPR in adult DCS patients were included. Outcomes included time to abdominal closure, intra-abdominal complications, in-hospital mortality, and ICU length of stay (ICU LOS). Five studies evaluating 437 patients were included. In patients with hemorrhagic shock, DPR was associated with reduced time to abdominal closure (DPR 4.1 days, control 5.9 days, p = 0.002), intra-abdominal complications including abscess formation (DPR 27 %, control 47 %, p = 0.04), and ICU LOS (DPR 8 days, control 11 days, p = 0.004). Findings in patients without hemorrhagic shock were conflicting. Closure times were decreased in one study (DPR 5.9 days, control 7.7 days, p < 0.02) and increased in another study (DPR 3.5 days, control 2.5 days, p = 0.02), intra-abdominal complications were decreased in one study (DPR 27 %, control 47 %, p = 0.04) and similar in another, and ICU LOS was decreased in one study (DPR 17 days, control 24 days, p < 0.002) and increased in another (DPR 13 days, control 11.4 days, p = 0.807). In patients with hemorrhagic shock, adjunct DPR is associated with reduced time to abdominal closure, intra-abdominal complications such as abscesses, fistula, bleeding, anastomotic leak, and ICU LOS. Utilization of DPR in patients without hemorrhagic shock showed promising but inconsistent findings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Catastrophic haemorrhage is recognised as the leading cause of preventable death in trauma and is also prevalent in medical and other surgical aetiology. Prehospital blood product transfusion is increasingly available for both military and civilian emergency teams. Hospitals have well-established massive transfusion protocols for the resuscitation of this patient group, however the use and impact in the prehospital field is less understood.<bold>Aim: </bold>To identify and evaluate the current knowledge surrounding prehospital blood product administration for patients with catastrophic haemorrhage.<bold>Methods: </bold>The integrative review method included systematic searching of online databases Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS and CINAHL alongside hand-searching for primary research articles published prior to 19 November 2018. Papers were included if the population studied patients with catastrophic haemorrhage who received prehospital transfusion of blood products. The level of evidence and quality was evaluated using the NHMRC hierarchy of evidence. All identified full text articles were reviewed by all authors.<bold>Results: </bold>Twenty-two papers were included in the final analysis, including both civilian (16) and military (6) practice. The earliest publication for prehospital transfusion was 1999, with increasing prevalence in recent years. Findings were extracted and into two main categories; (1) transfusion processes included team staffing, product selection, and criteria for transfusion and (2) transfusion outcomes; transfusion safety, haemoglobin, hospital intervention and mortality.<bold>Discussion: </bold>The level of evidence specific to prehospital blood product transfusion is low, with predominantly retrospective methods and rarely sufficient sample sizes to reach statistical significance. Prehospital research is challenged by clinical and logistical variability preventing accurate cohort matching, sample sizes and inconsistent data collection. Evaluation of prehospital transfusion in isolation is also particularly problematic as multiple factors and developments in clinical practice affect patient outcomes and all samples were subject to survival bias. Conclusion The volume and strength of the available evidence prevents accurate evaluation of the intervention and definitive practice recommendations however prehospital transfusion is shown to be logistically achievable and without serious incident. The reviewed evidence broadly supports the translation of recent in-hospital studies, such as PROMTT and PROPPR. Further research specific to prehospital practice is required to guide the development of evidence-based protocols. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - This series of articles for rehabilitation in practice aims to cover a knowledge element of the rehabilitation medicine curriculum. Nevertheless they are intended to be of interest to a multidisciplinary audience. The competency addressed in this article is ‘The trainee demonstrates a knowledge of diagnostic approaches for specific impairments including cognitive dysfunction as a result of cardiac arrest.’AbstractObjective: To describe a new early intervention service for survivors of cardiac arrest and their caregivers, and to explain the evidence and rationale behind it.Rationale: A cardiac arrest may cause hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury, which often results in cognitive impairments. Survivors of cardiac arrest can also encounter emotional problems, limitations in daily life, reduced participation in society and a decreased quality of life. A new early intervention service was designed based on literature study, expert opinion and patient experiences.Description of the intervention: The early intervention service is an individualized programme, consisting of one to six consultations by a specialized nurse for the patient and their caregiver. The intervention starts soon after discharge from the hospital and can last up to three months. The intervention consists of screening for cognitive and emotional problems, provision of information and support, promotion of self-management strategies and can include referral to further specialized care if indicated.Discussion: This intervention is assumed to reduce future problems related to hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury in the patient and caregiver, and its effectiveness is currently being investigated in a randomized controlled multicentre trial.

AB  - Abstract: We interviewed 308 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and matched controls who had suffered a myocardial infarction. The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) scores of controls were somewhat lower (better) than those of cases, but responses of cases and controls to additional questions about stair climbing, irritability and mood were virtually identical. Half as many (18 per cent) controls as cases (38 per cent) reported poorer memory function; nevertheless, 63 per cent of cases and 79 per cent of controls who had been working outside the home at the time of the event were employed at the time of the interview.

AB  - Arterial stiffness and augmentation of aortic blood pressure (BP) measured in office are known cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. This study examines the prognostic significance of ambulatory brachial BP, central BP, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and heart rate-adjusted augmentation index [AIx(75)] in this population. A total of 170 hemodialysis patients underwent 48-hour ambulatory monitoring with Mobil-O-Graph-NG during a standard interdialytic interval and followed-up for 28.1±11.2 months. The primary end point was a combination of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) cardiovascular mortality; and (3) a combination of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. During follow-up, 37(21.8%) patients died and 46(27.1%) had cardiovascular events. Cumulative freedom from primary end point was similar for quartiles of predialysis-systolic BP (SBP), 48-hour peripheral-SBP, and central-SBP, but was progressively longer for increasing quartiles for 48-hour peripheral-diastolic BP and central-diastolic BP and shorter for increasing quartiles of 48-hour central pulse pressure (83.7%, 71.4%, 69.0%, 62.8% [log-rank P=0.024]), PWV (93.0%, 81.0%, 57.1%, 55.8% [log-rank P<0.001]), and AIx(75) (88.4%, 66.7%, 69.0%, 62.8% [log-rank P=0.014]). The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and the combined outcome were similar for quartiles of predialysis-SBP, 48-hour peripheral-SBP, and central-SBP, but were increasing with higher ambulatory PWV and AIx(75). In multivariate analysis, 48-hour PWV was the only vascular parameter independently associated with the primary end point (hazard ratios, 1.579; 95% confidence intervals, 1.187-2.102). Ambulatory PWV, AIx(75), and central pulse pressure are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, whereas office and ambulatory SBP are not. These findings further support that arterial stiffness is the prominent cardiovascular risk factor in hemodialysis. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Background and Objectives: With increasing prevalence of heart diseases, a large number of patients refer to hospitals for treatment of heart diseases. These patients are prone to disturbances, such as cardiac arrest that is life threatening. Nurses have taught cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during their academic education, but the process of CPR changes and is updated every few years, which makes the education important and necessary in this area. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, skills, and satisfaction of nurses from participating in traditional and electronic CPR courses and to compare between them. Methods: This study was carried out as an intervention study on two groups (pre-test and post-test) on nurses working in Kashan Shahid Beheshti Hospital. Sampling was performed using Systematic Random Sampling, and the samples were divided alternatively into two groups of traditional and electronic trainings. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics tests of paired t- and one way ANOVA tests. Results: the scores of knowledge, skill, and satisfaction of the nurses in both groups of e-learning and traditional education significantly increased, but the level of awareness was significantly higher in the nurses in the e-learning group as compared to the nurses who participated in the traditional training group. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that both traditional and electronic methods have a positive effect on the promotion of nurses' awareness of CPR. Moreover, knowledge, skills, and satisfaction from CPR e-learning course, were higher than those in nurses participating in the traditional training method.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the level of daily functioning and quality of life of patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest and to investigate the predictive value of the duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia in long-term functioning. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: A Dutch rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Thirty-two patients with hypoxic brain injury caused by a cardiac arrest 2–7 years ago, who were admitted to a brain injury rehabilitation programme. Main outcome measures: Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Quality of Life after Brain Injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI). Data on duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia were retrieved from medical files. Results: A significant association was found between duration of coma, complaints of cognitive functioning ( r=0.57, P<0.05) and quality of life after brain injury ( r=-0.70, P<0.01). Duration of post-traumatic amnesia was associated with both daily functioning ( r=-0.70, P<0.01) and quality of life ( r=-0.70, P<0.01). Furthermore complaints of cognitive functioning were associated with both the level of participation in society ( r=0.76, P<0.01) and quality of life ( r=0.77, P<0.01). Conclusions: Long-term outcome of patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest shows that this group is limited in cognitive and daily functioning, participation and quality of life. Based on the duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia, an estimation of daily life functioning and quality of life 2–7 years after a cardiac arrest can be made. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical studies of septic shock support the concept that early resuscitation with fluid and inotropic therapies improves survival in a time-dependent manner. The new American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ACCM-PALS) Guidelines for hemodynamic support of newborns and children in septic shock recommend this therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to determine whether early septic shock reversal and use of resuscitation practice consistent with the new ACCM-PALS Guidelines by community physicians is associated with improved outcome. METHODS: A 9-year (January 1993-December 2001) retrospective cohort study was conducted of 91 infants and children who presented to local community hospitals with septic shock and required transport to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Shock reversal (defined by return of normal systolic blood pressure and capillary refill time), resuscitation practice concurrence with ACCM-PALS Guidelines, and hospital mortality were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 26 (29%) patients died. Community physicians successfully achieved shock reversal in 24 (26%) patients at a median time of 75 minutes (when the transport team arrived at the patient's bedside), which was associated with 96% survival and >9-fold increased odds of survival (9.49 [1.07-83.89]). Each additional hour of persistent shock was associated with >2-fold increased odds of mortality (2.29 [1.19-4.44]). Nonsurvivors, compared with survivors, were treated with more inotropic therapies (dopamine/dobutamine [42% vs 20%] and epinephrine/norepinephrine [42% vs 6%]) but not increased fluid therapy (median volume; 32.9 mL/kg vs 20.0 mL/kg). Resuscitation practice was consistent with ACCM-PALS Guidelines in only 27 (30%) patients; however, when practice was in agreement with guideline recommendations, a lower mortality was observed (8% vs 38%). CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and aggressive resuscitation of pediatric-neonatal septic shock by community physicians can save lives. Educational programs that promote ACCM-PALS recommended rapid, stepwise escalations in fluid as well as inotropic therapies may have value in improving outcomes in these children.

AB  - Aims: To determine whether delayed capillary refill time (>3 seconds) is a useful prognostic indicator in Kenyan children admitted to hospital. Methods: A total of 4160 children admitted to Kilifi District Hospital with malaria, malarial anaemia, acute respiratory tract infection (ARI), severe anaemia (haemoglobin <50 g/l), gastroenteritis, malnutrition, meningitis, or septicaemia were studied. Results: Overall, delayed capillary refill time (dCRT), present in 346/4160 (8%) of the children, was significantly more common in fatal cases (44/189, 23%) than survivors (7.5%), and had useful prognostic value. In children admitted with malaria, gastroenteritis, or malnutrition, likelihood ratio tests suggested that dCRT was useful in identifying high risk groups for mortality, but its prognostic value in anaemia, ARI, and sepsis was unclear due to low case fatality or limited numbers. The severity features of impaired consciousness and deep breathing were significantly associated both with the presence of dCRT and fatal outcome. In children, with either of these severity features, a less stringent value of dCRT (>2 s) identified 50% of children with hypotension (systolic BP <25D) and 40% of those requiring volume resuscitation (for metabolic acidosis). Conclusions: Although CRT is a simple bedside test, which may be used in resource poor settings as a guide to the circulatory status, dCRT should not be relied on in the absence of other features of severity. In non-severe disease, the additional presence of hypoxia, a moderately raised creatinine (>80 μmol/l), or a raised white cell count should prompt the need for fluid expansion.

AB  - Policymakers have been promoting the creation of Western-style markets for environmental services (ESMs) as beneficial to ecological conservation, public health and poverty alleviation. Yet, many communities successfully implementing ESM projects instead follow a common property regime framework, leading policymakers to encourage some vague rapprochement of the two institutional forms. However, formal capitalist institutions and common property regimes for environmental management are substitutes and not compliments, as demonstrated by models of political legitimacy, epistemology and transactions cost. First, formal markets employ marginal incentives directed at individuals yet CPRs use cultural hierarchy to produce a social consensus on agreements and their implementation, a form of governance threatened by individual incentives to defect. The partial presence of one system erodes the political legitimacy of the other. Second, incentives to maintain and create knowledge of ecological interactions and their applications are mutually exclusive in the two models. The CPR biocultural model relies on shared community interaction over the whole and long-term while the liberal bioprospecting model generates short-term individual research on a single issue. Finally, the liberal modelâs mechanisms of enforcement and dispute resolution are rightfully viewed with suspicion by politically marginalized groups. After demonstrating the successful implementation of both Western ESMs (Costa Rica, Colombia) and common property ESMs (Chiapas, Guatemalan highlands), this project shows the failure of ESMs with liberal structures in some Honduran and Salvadorenan communities otherwise governed by common property belief systems and institutions. The project shows a clash of not just academic disciplines but, more importantly, ideology and cosmology. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation in children and adolescents is a rare and often fatal injury. Although historically most reported cases have been fatal, the advent of modern prehospital care has led to an increase in survival following this injury. As a consequence, some patients may achieve or maintain satisfactory neurologic function following early intervention, stabilization, and definitive management. We analyzed the data on children and adolescents in whom traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation had been treated with modern resuscitation techniques at our institution.<bold>Methods: </bold>Atlanto-occipital dislocation is defined as disruption of the ligaments and other supporting soft tissues as indicated by displacement in either a transverse or vertical direction. With use of the Trauma Registry database at our institution, we identified sixteen such injuries that had occurred between 1986 and 2003. The hospital charts, clinic notes, and radiographs were reviewed. A careful neurological evaluation was performed for all of the survivors at the time of the latest follow-up.<bold>Results: </bold>The mean age of the sixteen patients at the time of the injury was 7.6 years. The mechanisms of injury were diverse. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7.4 points. Eleven of the sixteen patients underwent intubation in the field, two were intubated in the emergency department, and three were not intubated. Eight of the sixteen patients were declared dead on arrival in the emergency department. The eight surviving patients initially were immobilized with either a halo vest or another orthosis. All patients except one received intravenous steroids in the emergency department. Three of the patients who survived the initial injury subsequently died while undergoing neurosurgical procedures for the treatment of extensive intracranial injuries. Four of the remaining five survivors underwent occiput-C2 fusion, and one was managed with a Minerva cast. At the time of the final follow-up, at a mean of 4.2 years after the injury, one patient was neurologically normal, three had mild spastic hemiparesis and were very functional, and one had spastic quadriplegia and was ventilator-dependent.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Prompt recognition and treatment of traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation in children and adolescents can result in improved survival. Early diagnosis, prompt intubation, early and adequate immobilization of the head and neck, and the use of intravenous steroids appear to facilitate survival. We recommend arthrodesis from the occiput to C2 (or the nearest adjacent intact and stable vertebra caudad to C2) for all children who survive a traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation, particularly those with an incomplete spinal cord injury.

AB  - Background Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in athletes during exercise. The effectiveness of school-based automated external defibrillator (AED) programmes has not been established through a prospective study. Methods A total of 2149 high schools participated in a prospective observational study beginning 1 August 2009, through 31 July 2011. Schools were contacted quarterly and reported all cases of SCA. Of these 95% of schools confirmed their participation for the entire 2-year study period. Cases of SCA were reviewed to confirm the details of the resuscitation. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Results School-based AED programmes were present in 87% of participating schools and in all but one of the schools reporting a case of SCA. Fifty nine cases of SCA were confirmed during the study period including 26 (44%) cases in students and 33 (56%) in adults; 39 (66%) cases occurred at an athletic facility during training or competition; 55 (93%) cases were witnessed and 54 (92%) received prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A defibrillator was applied in 50 (85%) cases and a shock delivered onsite in 39 (66%). Overall, 42 of 59 (71%) SCA victims survived to hospital discharge, including 22 of 26 (85%) students and 20 of 33 (61%) adults. Of 18 student-athletes 16 (89%) and 8 of 9 (89%) adults who arrested during physical activity survived to hospital discharge. Conclusions High school AED programmes demonstrate a high survival rate for students and adults who suffer SCA on school campus. School-based AED programmes are strongly encouraged.

AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the primary arrhythmic event in the majority of patients suffering from sudden cardiac arrest. Attention has been focused on this particular rhythm since it is recognized that prompt therapy, especially electrical defibrillation, may lead to a successful outcome. However, current versions of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) mandate repetitive interruptions of chest compression for rhythm analyses since artifacts produced by chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preclude reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm analysis. Yet, repetitive interruptions in chest compression are detrimental to the success of defibrillation. The capability for rhythm analysis without requiring “hands-off” intervals will allow for more effective resuscitation. In this paper, a novel continuous-wavelet-transformation-based morphology consistency evaluation algorithm was developed for the detection of disorganized VF from organized sinus rhythm (SR) without interrupting the ongoing chest compression. The performance of this method was evaluated on both uncorrupted and corrupted ECG signals recorded from AEDs obtained from out-of-hospital victims of cardiac arrest. A total of 232 patients and 31 092 episodes of either VF or SR were accessed, in which 8195 episodes were corrupted by artifacts produced by chest compressions. We also compared the performance of this method with three other established algorithms, including VF filter, spectrum analysis, and complexity measurement. Even though there was a modest decrease in specificity and accuracy when chest compression artifact was present, the performance of this method was still superior to other reported methods for VF detection during uninterrupted CPR.

AB  - Introduction: Noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH) accounts for most potentially survivable deaths on the battlefield. Treatment of NCTH is challenging, especially in far-forward environments with limited capabilities. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has shown promise in the care of patients with NCTH. REBOA involves introducing a balloon catheter into the descending aorta in a specific occlusion region (zones 1, 2, or 3) and acts as a hemorrhage control adjunct with resuscitative support. The balloon is placed in zone 3 in the infrarenal aorta for high junctional or pelvic injuries and in zone 1 proximal to the diaphragm for torso hemorrhage. Zone 1 REBOA provides more resuscitative support than zone 3; however, the potential for ischemia and reperfusion injuries is greater with zone 1 than with zone 3 REBOA placement. This study aims to determine the possible benefit of transitioning the REBOA balloon from zone 3 to zone 1 to rescue a patient with ongoing venous bleeding and impending cardiovascular collapse. Materials and Methods: Yorkshire male swine (70–90 kg, n = 6 per group) underwent injury to the femoral artery, which was allowed to bleed freely for 60 s, along with a simultaneous controlled venous hemorrhage. After 60 s, the arterial bleed was controlled with hemostatic gauze and zone 3 REBOA was inflated. Five hundred milliliters of Hextend was used for initial fluid resuscitation. The controlled venous bleed continued until a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 30 mmHg was reached to create an impending cardiovascular collapse. The animals were then randomized into either continued zone 3 REBOA or transition from zone 3 to zone 1 REBOA. Following 30 min, a "hospital phase" was initiated, consisting of cessation of the venous hemorrhage, deflation of the REBOA balloon, and transfusion of one unit of whole blood administered along with saline and norepinephrine to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg or higher. The animals then underwent a 2-h observation period. Survival, hemodynamics, and blood chemistries were compared between groups. Results: No significant differences between groups were observed in hemodynamic or laboratory values at baseline, postinitial injury, or when MAP reached 30 mmHg. Survival was significantly longer in animals that transitioned into zone 1 REBOA (log-rank analysis, P = .012). The average time of survival was 14 ± 10 min for zone 3 animals vs. 65 ± 59 min for zone 1 animals (P = .064). No animals in the zone 3 group survived to the hospital phase. Zone 1–treated animals showed immediate hemodynamic improvement after transition, with maximum blood pressure reaching near baseline values compared to those in the zone 3 group. Conclusions: In this swine model of NCTH, hemodynamics and survival were improved when the REBOA balloon was transitioned from zone 3 to zone 1 during an impending cardiovascular collapse. Furthermore, these improved outcome data support the pursuit of additional research into mitigating ischemia–reperfusion insult to the abdominal viscera while still providing excellent resuscitative support, such as intermittent or partial REBOA.

AB  - Objective: Sudden cardiac arrest caused by cardiac arrhythmias is 1 of the leading causes of death worldwide. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are considered as standard care for patients with increased risk of arrhythmias. However, 1 in 4 ICD patients experiences psychological distress post-ICD implantation. The WEB-based distress management program for ICD patients (WEBCARE) was developed to mitigate anxiety and depression and enhance health-related quality of life in ICD patients. This study investigates the 6- and 12-months outcomes. Method: A total of 289 consecutive ICD patients from 6 referral hospitals in the Netherlands were randomized to either the WEBCARE (n = 146) or usual care (n = 143) group. Patients in the WEBCARE group received an online, 12-weeks fixed, 6 lesson behavioral treatment based on problem solving therapy. Patients in the usual care group receive care as usual. Results: Current findings show no significant difference on anxiety, depression or quality of life between the WEBCARE and Usual Care group at 6- and 12-months postimplantation. Conclusions: In this clinical trial of a Web-based behavioral intervention for ICD patients, the Web-based treatment was not superior to usual care on the long-term regarding patient reported outcomes. Future studies are warranted to examine the applicability of blended-care models and focus on further personalizing the program in order to increase adherence and improve outcomes.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death from potentially survivable civilian and military trauma. As projected conflicts move from settings of tactical and logistical supremacy to hyper-dynamic tactical zones against peer and near-peer adversaries, protracted medical evacuation times are expected. Treatment at the point-of-injury is critical. Although crystalloids like Lactated Ringer's (LR) are ubiquitous, whole blood (WB) is the preferred resuscitation fluid following hemorrhage; however, logistical constraints limit the availability of WB in prehospital settings. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) offer both hemodynamic support and oxygen-carrying capacity while avoiding logistical constraints of WB. We hypothesized that low-volume resuscitation of severe hemorrhagic shock with an HBOC (PEGylated carboxyhemoglobin, [PC]) would improve hemodynamic recovery and 72-hour survival; comparable to WB and superior to LR.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>A total of 21 anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent severe hemorrhagic shock followed by randomly assigned low-volume resuscitation with LR, WB, or PC, and then recovered from anesthesia for up to 72-hour observation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded continuously under anesthesia, and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline (BL), 60 minutes post-hemorrhage (HS1h), and 24 hours post-resuscitation (PR24h). Survival was presented on a Kaplan-Meier plot and significance determined with a log-rank test. Cardiovascular and blood gas data were assessed with one-way analysis of variance and post hoc analysis where appropriate.<bold>Results: </bold>All measured cardiovascular and blood chemistry parameters were equivalent between groups at BL and HS1h. BL MAP values were 90 ± 3, 86 ± 1, and 89 ± 2 mmHg for LR, PC, and WB, respectively. Immediately following resuscitation, MAP values were 57 ± 4, 74 ± 5, and 62 ± 3 mmHg, with PC equivalent to WB and higher than LR (P < 0.05). WB and LR were both lower than BL (P < 0.0001), whereas PC was not (P = 0.13). The PC group's survival to 72 hours was 57%, which was not different from WB (43%) and higher than LR (14%; P < 0.05).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>A single bolus infusion of PC produced superior survival and MAP response compared to LR, which is the standard fluid resuscitant carried by combat medics. PC was not different from WB in terms of survival and MAP, which is encouraging because its reduced logistical constraints make it viable for field deployment. These promising findings warrant further development and investigation of PC as a low-volume, early treatment for hemorrhagic shock in scenarios where blood products may not be available.

AB  - Introduction The combat experience during the re-entry stages of Operation Inherent Resolve was distinct from other recent operations, but there is no published literature regarding these "initial entry operations" experiences among forward surgical teams (FSTs) deployed to Role 2 facilities A descriptive analysis of patients treated by FSTs may provide valuable information for Role 2 surgical teams preparing to deploy in support of initial entry operations. The purpose of this analysis was to describe injury mechanism, wounding patterns and interventions performed by a small FST in the re-entry phase in Iraq. Materials and Methods From July 17, 2015 to January 31, 2016, a split surgical team with two surgeons and an ER physician documented care for all patients treated by their FST located in Iraq. Given their austere environment, FSTs have limited holding capacity, blood supply, and ability to triage and perform advanced procedures. Patients, who arrived to the Role 2 in asystole, were ineligible for the study. The patient population was Iraqi Security Forces as well as Iraqi civilians. No follow-up data were obtained. Using descriptive statistics, we described the basic demographics, health status, blood utilization, injury severity, and injury pattern of the patient population. Results The final study population included 300 Iraqi casualties. The majority of patients (96%) were discharged alive. Many patients were 16 years or older (96%), male (96%), Iraqi soldiers (86%), and injured during battle (96%). Over one-third of patients (35%) had a form of metabolic acidosis, 7% were hypothermic, and 18% were in shock at admission. The median amount of blood products used was 6 (interquartile ranges (IQR) = 2–12) units, while the median red blood cells:fresh frozen plasma ratio was 1.2:1. Six or more units of blood were given to 67 (22%) patients. The top three diagnoses were laceration (n = 197, 21%), penetrating injury (n = 185, 19%), and fracture (n = 174, 18%). A high number of injuries occurred in the extremities/pelvis and buttocks (n = 360, 38%) and in the abdomen and pelvic contents (n = 145, 15%). Over a quarter of patients (26%) had critical injuries (i.e. military injury severity score ≥25). Conclusions Given the Role 2 configuration, these results demonstrate FSTs must be capable of managing critically ill patients with markedly limited resources. This management will include general operations in both adult and pediatric patients, resuscitation with a limited blood supply, and patient assessment with minimal to no diagnostic tools. This analysis can inform resident training, pre-deployment training, as well as sustainment training for surgeons after residency.

AB  - Objective: To prospectively describe cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and evaluate factors associated with outcome in dogs and cats with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: University teaching hospital. Animals: One hundred twenty-one dogs and 30 cats that underwent CPR. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Supervising clinicians completed a data form immediately following completion of CPR. Eighty-seven (58%) animals attained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 49 (32%) had ROSC >20 minutes, 15 (10%) were alive at 24 hours, and 8 (5%) were discharged alive. Cardiovascular abnormalities were the most common suspected precipitating cause of CPA (51/151, 34%). Presence of an IV catheter before CPA (P=0.01) and the presence of palpable pulses during CPR (P=0.007) were both associated with ROSC. Increased time from CPA to CPR (P=0.04), longer duration of CPR (P<0.0001), and neurologic cause of arrest (P=0.02) were associated with not achieving ROSC. There was no association between ROSC and the initial arrest rhythm identified on ECG, animal weight, number of people present, and ventilation or compression rate. In patients achieving ROSC, those with a "survived event" were more likely to be euthanized and less likely to experience a second CPA than those with ROSC ≤20 minutes. Thirty-four percent of patients submitted for necropsy had gross and histological lesions considered secondary to CPR. Conclusions: Early CPR interventions were associated with a greater likelihood of ROSC, emphasizing the importance of prompt recognition, and initiation of CPR efforts. Although ROSC rates in this study were comparable or higher than previous human and veterinary studies, the rate of "survived events" was lower than that reported in human patients. This may suggest that advances in post CPR care could have benefits to the veterinary CPR patient in the future.

AB  - Introduction. Management of cardiogenic shock caused by severe drug intoxication is always challenging. In case of multidrug intoxication, a result, despite aggressive medical therapy, is often unpredictable. Utilization of extracorporeal life support devices in these cases has been suggested and reported results are promising. Case report. We presented a case of profound cardiogenic and distributive shock caused by suicidal intoxication with diltiazem and anionic surfactant ingestion in a 36-year-old woman. The patient ingested more than 90 tablets of diltiazem of 90 mg (ingested dose of 8.1 g), and 4 pieces of household toilet refresh agent containing anionic surfactant. During the admission, systemic blood pressure was 65/40 mmHg, heart rate 45 beats per minute, with signs of metabolic acidosis. The patient underwent several repeated gastric lavages. Emergent fluid resuscitation, calcium gluconate, insulin and vasopressive agents (dopamine and noradrenaline) infusions were administered with negligible effect. Due to progressive and refractory cardiogenic shock with signs of multiorgan failure, a decision was made to put the patient on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator. Immediately after starting the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, diuresis was established. During the next 36 h, an adequate end-organ perfusion was achieved with complete reversal of multiorgan failure. After the successful restoration of all major organ functions, the patient was successfully decannulated and discharged from the hospital after 10 days in a good condition. Conclusion. In severe cases of refractory cardiogenic and distributive shock due to diltiazem and other poison intoxication, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could allow additional circulatory support providing the bonus time for endogenous clearance of toxins. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could be used in conjunction with the optimal medical therapy aiming to the restoration of end-organ perfusion and allowing for intrinsic drug and toxin metabolism and natural elimination.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>In 2006, burn clinical practice guidelines were developed to provide recommendations for optimal care of U.S. military and local national burn casualties. As part of that effort, a paper-based Burn Flow Sheet (BFS) was included to document the burn resuscitation of combat casualties with ≥20% total body surface area burns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the BFS in terms of ongoing utilization, resuscitation management, and outcomes of patients transported.<bold>Materials and Methods: </bold>A retrospective review was performed of hard-copy BFSs received from January 2007 to December 2013. En route injury and treatment data from these flowsheets were manually transcribed into the research database. Outcomes and complications of BFS subjects were extracted from the Burn Center Registry and added to the research database.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 73 BFSs were collected from the study period. On average, BFSs were 61 ± 30% complete with a total of 14.7 ± 7 hours documented per patient in the first 24-hours postburn. Patients received nearly 7 L more fluid than estimated by traditional formulas. Sixteen patients (26%) received greater than 250 mL/kg of fluid, half of whom had concomitant traumatic injuries. Fifteen patients received a fasciotomy (21%), 4 received a laparotomy (5%), and 8 (11%) received both. No patients developed abdominal compartment syndrome associated with fluid resuscitation. Overall mortality was 21%.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Although the majority of providers did initiate a BFS, it was not always used as intended; problems included missing data and miscalculations. Although there was a clear improvement with decline in the incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, mortality did not change for severely burned patients. Simplification of the recommendations, additional built-in prompts, and automated tools such as computerized decision support software may help standardize practice and improve outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To assess outcome of Left Atrial reduction plasty and sinus rhythm restoration in patients undergoing Mitral valve surgery with chronic Atrial Fibrillation. Study Design: Longitudinal study. Place and Duration of Study: Adult Cardiac Surgery Unit, Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology/National Institute of Heart Diseases, Rawalpindi Pakistan, from Jan 2017-Jun 2022. Methodology: Thirty three (n=33) patients with mitral valve disease were recruited via convenience sampling, all of whom exhibited an enlarged left atrium and pre-operative Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Pre-operative cardiac evaluations were performed using Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE). Pre-and post-surgery trans-esophageal echocardiography studies were conducted as a routine procedure. Follow-up echocardiographic assessments were carried out at intervals of 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, alongside Electrocardiograms (ECGs). During surgery, median sternotomy was done. Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) time was established followed by cardiac arrest. After Mitral valve Repair/Replacement (MVR), Left Atrial (LA) plication was done by a double needle. Results: Out of thirty three (n=33) patients, 25(75.7%) females and 8(24.2%) male patients, with mean age of 44.3±15.5 years, underwent mitral valve surgery(repair/replacement) followed by LA reduction and sinus rhythm restoration procedure. Complete restoration of sinus rhythm with re-appearance of "a" wave on echocardiography, signifying LA transport function through mitral valve was observed in 31(93.9%) patients on 3rd month and only 1(3.0%) individual continued to have persistent AF after 6 months. A significant reduction in LA size before and after procedure was noticed in all patients (83.70±2.50 mm vs. 47.50±1.08 mm) (p<0.001). Conclusion: Left atrial reduction by "Plication technique" followed by "Diathermy Fulguration" as a part of mitral valve surgery has yielded promising results in managing patients with mitral valve disease and enlarged left atrium. This approach can potentially lead to improved cardiac rhythm and better outcomes in selected cases.

AB  - Objectives: Intraosseous (IO) access, enabling the rapid administration of epinephrine during cardiac arrest (CA), is crucial in promoting optimal postresuscitation outcomes in patients with poor vascular access. There is a question whether IO-administered epinephrine is equivalent to intravenously administered epinephrine during CA. Methods: The question guiding this evidence-based review was as follows: in adults suffering CA given epinephrine via the 10 route, what is the resulting serum concentration of the drug compared to when administered intravenously? A search was conducted and the evidence appraised and leveled. Results: Four animal studies met the inclusion criteria. The sources showed no definitive evidence supporting equivalence between intravenous and 10 epinephrine administered during CA. Intravenously administered epinephrine provides increased and faster appearing serum concentrations than IO-administered epinephrine. Evidence indicated epinephrine given via the sternal 10 route more closely approaches equivalence with intravenously administered epinephrine than when administered by the tibial 10 route. Conclusions: The clinician should consider using proximal 10 infusion sites such as the sternum or humérus when administering advanced cardiac life support drugs to rapidly achieve maximal therapeutic concentrations. Further studies are needed to determine the differences seen when epinephrine is administered by these routes during CA.

AB  - In this cross-sectional qualitative study, researchers performed in-depth, semistructured interviews with 30 pairs of patients and their primary care providers in an outpatient clinic of a large, urban Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center in the United States. During audiotaped interviews to assess their understanding of advance directive concepts, participants were asked what 'life-sustaining treatment' means to them and why they think of it in the way they do. The findings indicate that patients and providers in the United States tend to view and discuss life-sustaining treatment in terms of four goals for end-of-life care: (1) extending the length of life, (2) improving the quality of life, (3) maintaining or improving specific biological functions, and (4) assisting the body for a temporary period of time. Patients thought providers were more concerned with extending the length of life than with quality-based outcomes, and patients often discussed life-sustaining treatment as acceptable means for short-term but not long-term use. Many providers indicated that they struggle with conflicting quality-based and physiologic care goals. The findings highlight the importance of eliciting patient preferences not only for specific types of treatment, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but also for end-of-life care goals or desired health-related outcomes, such as maximizing the quantity of life. The findings also suggest that advance directives and patient-provider discussions that focus on acceptable health states and valued life activities may be better suited to patients' end-of-life care goals than those that focus on specific medical interventions.

AB  - Contracting has been used as a response to individuals at risk of suicide for over thirty years. In the present study almost 400 high school students were given a survey about their experiences with suicide. It found that they were unlikely to initiate contact with traditional counselors during a suicidal crisis, but over half of them admitted they would probably tell a friend. Training in 'No harm agreements', a form of peer contracting, was given to half the students. After training, these experimental subjects were significantly more likely than control subjects to recognize symptoms of suicide, to intervene appropriately, and to arrange for professional follow-up. They were also less likely to consider suicide an acceptable option. Greater recognition of two suicidal symptoms and increased likelihood of getting a promise not to commit suicide without talking with a counselor or minister were still present in the experimental group at seven weeks after the training. Responses about questions of safety with this method were promising but still need further attention.

AB  - <bold>Objectives: </bold>Conventional neuroleptics ameliorate symptoms in children with autistic disorder; however, they are known to cause dyskinesias. Atypical neuroleptics, including olanzapine, may have less risk for dyskinesia, but their efficacy in autistic disorder is not established. This study was designed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of open-label olanzapine as a treatment for children with autistic disorder by using haloperidol as a standard comparator treatment.<bold>Method: </bold>In a parallel groups design, 12 children with DSM-IV autistic disorder (mean age 7.8+/-2.1 years) were randomized to 6 weeks of open treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol. Mean final dosages were 7.9+/-2.5 mg/day for olanzapine and 1.4+/-0.7 mg/day for haloperidol. Outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS).<bold>Results: </bold>Both groups had symptom reduction. Five of six in the olanzapine group and three of six in the haloperidol group were rated as responders according to the CGI Improvement item. Subjects showed improvement on the CPRS Autism Factor (F1,9 = 24.4, p = .0008). Side effects included drowsiness and weight gain.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The findings suggest that olanzapine is a promising treatment for children with autistic disorder. Further placebo-controlled and long-term studies of olanzapine in autistic disorder are required.

AB  - Background: Brugada syndrome (BS) is a disorder characterized by syncope or sudden death associated with one of several electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns characterized by incomplete right bundle branch block and ST elevation in the anterior precordial leads. Patients with BS are prone to develop ventricular tachyarrhythmias that may lead to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death. Case report. A 58-year-old woman is the first described case of Brugada syndrome in Serbia with intermittent typical changes in basic electrocardiography (ECG): ST segment elevation in the precordial chest leads like dome or coved major form or type I. For the last 27 years the patient had suffered of palpitations and dizziness, without syncopal events. Her sister had died suddenly during the night in sleep. During 24-hour Holter monitoring the patient had ventricular premature beats during the night with R/T phenomenon and during the recovery phase of exercise testing had rare premature ventricular beats as the consequence of parasympatethic stimulation. Late potentials were positive. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. We performed coronary angiography and epicardial coronary arteries were without significant stenosis and structural heart disease was excluded. In the bigining of the electrophysiological study ECG was normal, and after administration of Propaphenon i.v. Brugada syndrome unmasked with appearance of type I ECG pattern. A programed ventricular stimulation induced non sustained ventricular tachycardia. One-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted and the patient was treated with a combination od amiodarone and metoprolol per os. After one-year follow-up, there were no episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Conclusion. Brugada syndrome is a myocardial disorder which prognosis and therapy are related to presence of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Electrophysiologicaly induced malignant ventricular disorders class I are indication for implantation of cardioverter defibrilator, as also occurred in presented patient.

AB  - Fewer than 10% of the 360,000 people who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest annually in the U.S. survive to hospital discharge. Many suffer brain injuries that greatly affect their daily activities and quality of life. Despite improvements in clinical outcomes from cardiac arrest as a result of therapeutic hypothermia, survival rates are still dismal. Additional interventions to be used alone or in combination with therapeutic hypothermia could potentially save many lives. The intermediate metabolite pyruvate has been proven to be neuroprotective when given acutely. The goal of this investigation is to examine the neuroprotective capabilities and mechanisms of pyruvate in a large animal model of cardiac arrest, closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and countershock induced defibrillation. The central hypothesis is that pyruvate therapy suppresses matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and thereby preserves blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, increases expression and content of the cytoprotective cytokine erythropoietin (EPO), and dampens inflammation following cardiac arrest, and, thus, improves neurobehavioral recovery from cardiac arrest. Experiments were conducted in Yorkshire swine, subjected to cardiac arrest, closed-chest cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR), defibrillation by trans-thoracic countershock, and recovery. The project was divided into two studies with different durations of cardiac arrest, producing different intensities of brain damage. In the first study, swine were subjected to 6 min of untreated cardiac arrest and 4 min of CCR, following by defibrillation and recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In the second study, untreated cardiac arrest was extended to 10 min before 4 min CCR. Animals were euthanized at 1, 4, and 72 h ROSC, and the brain was biopsied for histological and biochemical analyses. For animals in 72 h ROSC groups, neurological assessment and testing were performed at 24, 48, and 72 h ROSC. At 3 d ROSC, the number of viable cerebellar Purkinje cells fell by 30% vs. Sham control, but pyruvate infusion during CCR and the first 60 min ROSC preserved these neurons. EPO mRNA abundance was sharply increased at 4 h ROSC and in the non-arrest Sham, indicating the surgical protocol, hyperoxic ventilation and anesthesia induced neuroprotective EPO, which may have limited brain injury. There were no differences in neurological scores among Sham, CPR, and CPR+Pyruvate, prompting study of more prolonged cardiac arrest to intensify brain injury. At 4 h ROSC in 10 min untreated cardiac arrest group, cardiac arrest unexpectedly decreased hippocampal and cerebellar MMP-2 activities and cerebellar EPO content, regardless of treatment. 72 h survival rate fell from 100% in study one (6 min pretreatment arrest) to only 2 of 6 pigs in study two (10 min pretreatment arrest), which wide disparity in neurological function among the 2 survivors. Collectively, these results indicate the prolonging pre-intervention arrest from 6 to 10 min sharply intensified brain injury, depleted cytoprotective EPO, and inactivated oxyradical-sensitive enzymes. Pyruvate treatment did not exert favorable effects on these variables, indicating that pyruvate may have had limited ability to traverse the blood brain barrier and protect the brain parenchyma in this large animal model of cardiac arrest and CCR.

AB  - Background: intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation during ischemia and reperfusion leads to cytosolic Ca2<sup>+</sup> overload through reverse-mode operation of the sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup>- Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation promotes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>m</sub>) overload, leading to mitochondrial injury. We investigated whether limiting sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup> entry during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) attenuates Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>m</sub> overload and lessens myocardial dysfunction in a rat model of VF and closed-chest resuscitation. Methods: hearts were harvested from 10 groups of 6 rats each representing baseline, 15 mm of untreated VF, 15 mm of VF with chest compression given for the last 5 mm (VF/CC), and 60 mm postresuscitation (PR). VF/CC and PR included four groups each randomized to receive before starting chest compression the new NHE-1 inhibitor AVE4454B (1.0 mg/kg), the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker lidocaine (5.0 mg/kg), their ëombination, or vehicle control. The left ventricle was processed for intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>m</sub> measurements. Results: limiting sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup> entry attenuated cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> increase during VF/CC and the PR phase and prevented Ca<sup>2+</sup>, overload yielding levels that corresponded to 77% and 71% of control hearts at VF/CC and PR, without differences among specific Na<sup>+</sup>- limiting interventions. Limiting sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup> entry attenuated reductions in left ventricular compliance during VF and prompted higher mean aortic pressure (110 ± 7 vs. 95 ± 11 mmHg, P < 0.001) and higher cardiac work index (159 ± 34 vs. 126 ± 29 g·m·min<sup>-1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>, P < 0.05) with lesser increases in circulating cardiac troponin 1 at 60 min PR. Conclusions: Na<sup>+</sup>-limiting interventions prevented excess Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>m</sub> accumulation induced by ischemia and reperfusion and ameliorated myocardial injury and dysfunction.

AB  - Background: Palliative family conference (PFC) was included in the reimbursement of National Health Insurance to promote palliative care in Taiwan in 2012. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of PFC on death in intensive care unit (ICU) and receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within three days before death. Design: This is a cross-sectional study. Subjects: All patients who died in a public hospital and were admitted to ICU within 30 days before death, from 2013 to 2018, were included. Measurements: The medical records were analyzed to identify information on causes of death, receiving PFC, receiving palliative care consultation, death in ICU, and receiving CPR within three days before death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the independent effects of receiving PFC on the risk of death in ICU and receiving CPR within three days before death. Results: For patients who died and those who did not die in ICU, the proportion of receiving PFC was 45.8% (1818/3973) and 55.0% (808/1468), respectively. For patients who received and those who did not receive CPR within three days before death, the proportion of receiving PFC was 23.9% (140/585) and 51.2% (2486/4856), respectively. PFC was associated with a reduced risk of death in ICU (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.842; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.717–0.988) and a reduced risk of receiving CPR within three days before death (AOR: 0.361; 95% CI: 0.286–0.456). Conclusion: PFC reduces the risk of receiving nonbeneficial aggressive intervention and may improve the quality of end-of-life care. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract: Trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock who only transiently respond or do not respond to fluid therapy and/or the administration of blood products have exsanguinating injuries. Recognising shock due to (exsanguinating) haemorrhage in trauma is about constructing a synthesis of trauma mechanism, injuries, vital signs and the therapeutic response of the patient. The aim of prehospital care of bleeding trauma patients is to deliver the patient to a facility for definitive care within the shortest amount of time by rapid transport and minimise therapy to what is necessary to maintain adequate vital signs. Rapid decisions have to be made using regional trauma triage protocols that have incorporated patient condition, transport times and the level of care than can be performed by the prehospital care providers and the receiving hospitals. The treatment of bleeding patients is aimed at two major goals: stopping the bleeding and restoration of the blood volume. Fluid resuscitation should allow for preservation of vital functions without increasing the risk for further (re)bleeding. To prevent further deterioration and subsequent exsanguinations ‘permissive hypotension’ may be the goal to achieve. Within the hospital, a sound trauma team activation system, including the logistic procedure as well as activation criteria, is essential for a fast and adequate response. After determination of haemorrhagic shock, all efforts have to be directed to stop the bleeding in order to prevent exsanguinations. A simultaneous effort is made to restore blood volume and correct coagulation. Reversal of coagulopathy with pharmacotherapeutic interventions may be a promising concept to limit blood loss after trauma. Abdominal ultrasound has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage for detection of haemoperitoneum. With the development of sliding-gantry based computer tomography diagnostic systems, rapid evaluation by CT-scanning of the trauma patient is possible during resuscitation. The concept of damage control surgery, the staged approach in treatment of severe trauma, has proven to be of vital importance in the treatment of exsanguinating trauma patients and is adopted worldwide. When performing ‘blind’ transfusion or ‘damage control resuscitation’, a predetermined fixed ratio of blood components may result in the administration of higher plasma and platelets doses and may improve outcome. The role of thromboelastography and thromboelastometry as point-of-care tests for coagulation in massive blood loss is emerging, providing information about actual clot formation and clot stability, shortly (10min) after the blood sample is taken. Thus, therapy guided by the test results will allow for administration of specific coagulation factors that will be depleted despite administration with fresh frozen plasma during massive transfusion of blood components.

AB  - Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients sustaining a high level of tetraplegia (C1–C4) requiring mechanical ventilation have been shown to be at increased risk of mortality secondary to respiratory problems. Ageing population with increased premorbid comorbidities contributes to difficulties in managing these patients on the ward and when discharged into the community. Aims of the study: This study has been undertaken to evaluate outcome of ventilated patients admitted to a single SCI specialized rehabilitation centre in the United Kingdom as this has not previously been done. Method: All ventilated patients admitted from January 2012 to December 2015 were included (n = 34). Retrospective data analysis of medical records obtained following data: • Patient demographics; • Details of SCI; • Comorbidities and resuscitation status; • Admission details; • Ventilation status on discharge; • Readmission details; • Mortality rate. Basic statistical analysis of the data was undertaken to generate descriptive statistics. Results: The majority of patients were over the age of 60 (n = 20) and male (n = 21). Most common aetiology of SCI was trauma secondary to falls. Most patients (n = 24) had C1–C4 level of SCI and were complete injuries (n = 25). Average number of pre- SCI comorbidities was 3.39 with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes being the most common. Median length of admission was 295 days. Almost half (n = 15) were still ventilated on discharge. Of the 29 patients discharged – 14 were readmitted, majority due to chest infections or urosepsis. Two patients required re-cannulation with tracheostomy during readmission and remained on long-term ventilation, and 14 patients died with a median survival time from time of SCI to death of 1.92 years. In total, 10 of the 14 who died were still ventilated at the time of death. The cause of death was either aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure. Conclusion: These outcomes will be useful for discussing prognosis of patients admitted following SCI and could influence decisions regarding tracheostomies, long-term ventilation and resuscitation status. Future studies will be undertaken to obtain data nationally, evaluate risk factors and potentially develop a prognostic score for survival and to obtain substantial quality-of-life data to facilitate discussions on prognosis.

AB  - Bleeding oesophageal varices are a frequent and sometimes fatal complication of portal hypertension. Prompt resuscitation and arrest of haemorrhage are the immediate short term priorities. Vasoactive therapy to reduce portal pressure is administered on presentation. Early endoscopy is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy; usually emergency sclerotherapy or banding. After the acute bleeding episode, follow-up therapy is instituted either to obliterate the varices by sclerotherapy or banding, or to chronically lower portal pressure and hence reduce the risk of bleeding pharmacologically; a combination of both strategies may be also used. Active surveillance of those at risk of developing varices is advocated. Long term β-blocker therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in both the primary prevention of variceal haemorrhage and the prevention of rebleeding in those who have already bled. Despite a multitude of therapeutic regimes and ongoing clinical trials, mortality from this condition remains disappointingly high. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - The article focuses on the deteriorating health of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been moved to a prison hospital amid concerns for his well-being. Friends and colleagues claim the transfer is a Kremlin tactic to project an image of care while denying him adequate medical treatment, as he has been on a hunger strike protesting his lack of access to healthcare. Reports indicate that Navalny's health has significantly declined since his imprisonment, with alarming test results suggesting potential kidney failure and cardiac arrest. The international community, including U.S. officials and prominent figures, has expressed deep concern over his treatment, while Navalny's supporters are calling for protests against the Kremlin's actions.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started promptly in a situation of cardiorespiratory arrest (CRP). The Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) proposes clinical recommendations for the application of the procedure in dogs and cats and also recognizes the need for cognitive and psychomotor skills to perform the entire protocol in an agile and efficient manner. In this way, an ideal training should cover didactic components and practice of manual skills, with the use of discriminated models and simulators. The use of alternative methods with synthetic models is supported by the increase in concerns about animal welfare, a demand that is presented by Veterinary Medicine scholars and residents of the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). In addition to the high cost of commercially available models, the objective of this work is to present a low-cost model for training CPR in dogs. After acquisition of a plush dog, a representative structure of the internal part of the chest was elaborated with a plastic packaging of powdered chocolate filled with silicon fiber. Then, the larynx cartilages were produced in silicone rubber of medium flexibility, adhered to a corrugated trachea. The molds of the hard palate and upper and lower dental arches were made of resin, painted with acrylic paint and fixed to a modified dental articulator. For the oral mucosa and tongue it was made low viscosity silicone elastomer structures. The model allowed to perform the procedures of thoracic compression and endotracheal intubation, steps included in the CPR. The model was tested by Veterinary Medicine professionals with experience in CPR, and a good result was reported. The presented CPR model allowed the simulation of the basic support to life and, being of low cost, can be made by other educational institutions with this same purpose.

AB  - Several studies have been conducted among cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) survivors. Some studies have shown that positive and negative experiences coexist. Emotional distress and psychopathology in CPR survivors are related to the urgent need to make growth. Understanding the meaning of CPR survivors’ lived experiences of growth may facilitate their growth. The aim of the study was to illuminate the meaning of CPR survivor’s lived experiences of growth in southeast Iran. A qualitative design using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach influenced by Ricoeur was used in 12 CPR survivors. Three main themes emerged including: (1) opening up a new horizon in the meaning of life, (2) opening up a new horizon in the meaning of interpersonal connections and (3) opening up a new horizon in the meaning of God and spirituality. The interpreted comprehensive understanding conveyed a meaning that CPR survivors’ experience of growth seems to be like opening the doors of perception to the higher reality. The finding may assist other CPR survivors to learn from participants in this study. Exposure to suitable narratives under health care provider supervision could develop profound learning. Training sessions with an emphasis on meditation education and how to use connecting to God in the adaptation process may approve the quality of life of CPR survivors.

AB  - Simple cryopreservation of anaerobic ammonium-oxidation (anammox) consortia has become a promising preservation technology for the fast start-up of the anammox process. Here, we use genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to understand of the microbial interaction in a simple and effective resuscitation process for long-term cryopreserved anammox consortia by sequential addition of anammox SBR supernatant. Performance results showed that sequential addition of anammox supernatant significantly reduced the resuscitation time of the granule-based anammox process from 40 to 20 days. Genome-centric metagenomics were used to recover 19 high-quality draft genomes of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria. Comparative metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression of Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, the dominant anammox bacterium, and heterotrophic bacteria to better understand their potential interactions. Proteobacteria -affiliated bacteria found in the supernatant were highly active in producing the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate which are needed for growth of the auxotrophic anammox bacteria. In addition, the significantly higher expression levels of hzsA and CO 2 -fixtion genes in the Candidatus Kuenenia genome indicated the anammox bacteria were likely more active and growing faster after sequential anammox supernatant addition during the resuscitation process. The resuscitation treatment pulse assays confirmed that sequential addition of supernatant was an effective way for the rapid resuscitation of anammox consortia. Our findings offer the first evidence of cross-feeding during the rapid resuscitation of cryopreserved anammox consortia. Unlabelled Image • Sequential supernatant addition accelerates cryopreserved anammox resuscitation. • Cryopreserved AnAOB was recovery quickly by supernatant bioaugmentation. • AHLs that mediate quorum sensing are not a key factor for the rapid resuscitation. • Cross-feeding between Proteobacteria and AnAOB is responsible for rapid resuscitation.

AB  - Background: Approximately 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) annually in the United States. Less than 30% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today's youth (ie, the digital native generation). Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P<.001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P=.006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P=.05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P<.001). We found a significant positive correlation (P<.001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use. Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training.

AB  - Background: Currently, there is a lack of effective early assessment tools for predicting the onset and development of cardiac arrest (CA). With the increasing attention of clinical researchers on machine learning (ML), some researchers have developed ML models for predicting the occurrence and prognosis of CA, with certain models appearing to outperform traditional scoring tools. However, these models still lack systematic evidence to substantiate their efficacy. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the prediction value of ML in CA for occurrence, good neurological prognosis, mortality, and the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), thereby providing evidence-based support for the development and refinement of applicable clinical tools. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched from their establishment until May 17, 2024. The risk of bias in all prediction models was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Results: In total, 93 studies were selected, encompassing 5,729,721 in-hospital and out-of-hospital patients. The meta-analysis revealed that, for predicting CA, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity derived from the imbalanced validation dataset were 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93), 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.96), respectively. On the basis of the balanced validation dataset, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.90), 0.72 (95% CI 0.49-0.95), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.91), respectively. For predicting the good cerebral performance category score 1 to 2, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87), 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.81), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.88), respectively. For predicting CA mortality, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.85 (95% CI 0.82-0.87), 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.83), respectively. For predicting ROSC, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.77 (95% CI 0.74-0.80), 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.74), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.71-0.96), respectively. In predicting CA, the most significant modeling variables were respiratory rate, blood pressure, age, and temperature. In predicting a good cerebral performance category score 1 to 2, the most significant modeling variables in the in-hospital CA group were rhythm (shockable or nonshockable), age, medication use, and gender; the most significant modeling variables in the out-of-hospital CA group were age, rhythm (shockable or nonshockable), medication use, and ROSC. Conclusions: ML represents a currently promising approach for predicting the occurrence and outcomes of CA. Therefore, in future research on CA, we may attempt to systematically update traditional scoring tools based on the superior performance of ML in specific outcomes, achieving artificial intelligence–driven enhancements.

AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a severe and sudden medical emergency that is characterized by the abrupt cessation of circulatory function, leading to death or irreversible organ damage if not addressed immediately. Emergency department (ED)–based IHCA (EDCA) accounts for 10% to 20% of all IHCA cases. Early detection of EDCA is crucial, yet identifying subtle signs of cardiac deterioration is challenging. Traditional EDCA prediction methods primarily rely on structured vital signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which require additional preprocessing or specialized devices. This study introduces a novel approach using image-based 12-lead ECG data obtained at ED triage, leveraging the inherent richness of visual ECG patterns to enhance prediction and integration into clinical workflows. Objective: This study aims to address the challenge of early detection of EDCA by developing an innovative deep learning model, the ECG-Image-Aware Network (EIANet), which uses 12-lead ECG images for early prediction of EDCA. By focusing on readily available triage ECG images, this research seeks to create a practical and accessible solution that seamlessly integrates into real-world ED workflows. Methods: For adult patients with EDCA (cases), 12-lead ECG images at ED triage were obtained from 2 independent data sets: National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH). Control ECGs were randomly selected from adult ED patients without cardiac arrest during the same study period. In EIANet, ECG images were first converted to binary form, followed by noise reduction, connected component analysis, and morphological opening. A spatial attention module was incorporated into the ResNet50 architecture to enhance feature extraction, and a custom binary recall loss (BRLoss) was used to balance precision and recall, addressing slight data set imbalance. The model was developed and internally validated on the NTUH-ECG data set and was externally validated on an independent FEMH-ECG data set. The model performance was evaluated using the F <sub>1</sub>-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results: There were 571 case ECGs and 826 control ECGs in the NTUH data set and 378 case ECGs and 713 control ECGs in the FEMH data set. The novel EIANet model achieved an F <sub>1</sub>-score of 0.805, AUROC of 0.896, and AUPRC of 0.842 on the NTUH-ECG data set with a 40% positive sample ratio. It achieved an F <sub>1</sub>-score of 0.650, AUROC of 0.803, and AUPRC of 0.678 on the FEMH-ECG data set with a 34.6% positive sample ratio. The feature map showed that the region of interest in the ECG was the ST segment. Conclusions: EIANet demonstrates promising potential for accurately predicting EDCA using triage ECG images, offering an effective solution for early detection of high-risk cases in emergency settings. This approach may enhance the ability of health care professionals to make timely decisions, with the potential to improve patient outcomes by enabling earlier interventions for EDCA.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is associated with high mortality and health care costs in the recovery phase. Predicting adverse outcome events, including readmission, improves the chance for appropriate interventions and reduces health care costs. However, studies related to the early prediction of adverse events of IHCA survivors are rare. Therefore, we used a deep learning model for prediction in this study.<bold>Objective: </bold>This study aimed to demonstrate that with the proper data set and learning strategies, we can predict the 30-day mortality and readmission of IHCA survivors based on their historical claims.<bold>Methods: </bold>National Health Insurance Research Database claims data, including 168,693 patients who had experienced IHCA at least once and 1,569,478 clinical records, were obtained to generate a data set for outcome prediction. We predicted the 30-day mortality/readmission after each current record (ALL-mortality/ALL-readmission) and 30-day mortality/readmission after IHCA (cardiac arrest [CA]-mortality/CA-readmission). We developed a hierarchical vectorizer (HVec) deep learning model to extract patients' information and predict mortality and readmission. To embed the textual medical concepts of the clinical records into our deep learning model, we used Text2Node to compute the distributed representations of all medical concept codes as a 128-dimensional vector. Along with the patient's demographic information, our novel HVec model generated embedding vectors to hierarchically describe the health status at the record-level and patient-level. Multitask learning involving two main tasks and auxiliary tasks was proposed. As CA-mortality and CA-readmission were rare, person upsampling of patients with CA and weighting of CA records were used to improve prediction performance.<bold>Results: </bold>With the multitask learning setting in the model learning process, we achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.752 for CA-mortality, 0.711 for ALL-mortality, 0.852 for CA-readmission, and 0.889 for ALL-readmission. The area under the receiver operating characteristic was improved to 0.808 for CA-mortality and 0.862 for CA-readmission after solving the extremely imbalanced issue for CA-mortality/CA-readmission by upsampling and weighting.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study demonstrated the potential of predicting future outcomes for IHCA survivors by machine learning. The results showed that our proposed approach could effectively alleviate data imbalance problems and train a better model for outcome prediction.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Prompt and proficient basic life support (BLS) maneuvers are essential to increasing the odds of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, significant time can elapse before the arrival of professional rescuers. To decrease these delays, many countries have developed first responder networks. These networks are composed of BLS-certified lay or professional rescuers who can be dispatched by emergency medical communication centers to take care of those who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Many systems are, however, limited by a relatively low number of active first responders, and first-year medical and dental students may represent an almost untapped pool of potential rescuers. On top of providing an enhanced BLS coverage to the population, this could also help medical students be better prepared to their future role as certified health care providers and address societal expectations regarding health care students.<bold>Objective: </bold>Our objective was to describe the impact of a short motivational intervention followed by a blended BLS course (e-learning and practice session) designed to motivate first-year medical and dental students to enlist as first responders.<bold>Methods: </bold>A short, web-based, motivational intervention presenting this project took place, and first-year University of Geneva, Faculty of Medicine students were provided with a link to the study platform. Those who agreed to participate were redirected to a demographic questionnaire before registering on the platform. The participants were then asked to answer a second questionnaire designed to determine their baseline knowledge prior to following an interactive e-learning module. Upon completion, a web-based booking form enabling them to register for a 1-hour practice session was displayed. These sessions were held by senior medical students who had been trained and certified as BLS instructors. The participants who attended these practice sessions were asked to answer a postcourse questionnaire before receiving the certificate enabling them to register as first responders.<bold>Results: </bold>Out of the 529 first-year students registered at University of Geneva, Faculty of Medicine on January 14, 2021, 190 (35.9%) initially agreed to participate. Moreover, 102 (19.3%) attended the practice sessions, and 48 (9.1%) had completed all training and enlisted as first responders on the dedicated platform, Save a Life, at 6 months (July 14, 2021). Postcourse confidence in resuscitation skills was associated with a higher likelihood of registering as first responder (P=.03). No association was found between prior BLS knowledge and the probability of registering to a practice session (P=.59), of obtaining a course completion certificate (P=.29), or of enlisting as first responder (P=.56).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study shows that a motivational intervention associated with a short BLS course can convince medical students to enlist as first responders. Further studies are needed to understand the rather low proportion of medical students finally registering as first responders.<bold>International Registered Report Identifier (irrid): </bold>RR2-10.2196/24664.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation markedly increase the survival rate in the event of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). As future health care professionals, medical students should be trained to efficiently manage an unexpectedly encountered OHCA.<bold>Objective: </bold>Our aim was to assess basic life support (BLS) knowledge in junior medical students at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine (UGFM) and to compare it with that of the general population.<bold>Methods: </bold>Junior UGFM students and lay people who had registered for BLS classes given by a Red Cross-affiliated center were sent invitation links to complete a web-based questionnaire. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in a 10-question score regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge. Secondary outcomes were the differences in the rate of correct answers for each individual question, the level of self-assessed confidence in the ability to perform resuscitation, and a 6-question score, "essential BLS knowledge," which only contains key elements of the chain of survival. Continuous variables were first analyzed using the Student t test, then by multivariable linear regression. Fisher exact test was used for between-groups comparison of binary variables.<bold>Results: </bold>The mean score was higher in medical students than in lay people for both the 10-question score (mean 5.8, SD 1.7 vs mean 4.2, SD 1.7; P<.001) and 6-question score (mean 3.0, SD 1.1 vs mean 2.0, SD 1.0; P<.001). Participants who were younger or already trained scored consistently better. Although the phone number of the emergency medical dispatch center was well known in both groups (medical students, 75/80, 94% vs lay people, 51/62, 82%; P=.06), most participants were unable to identify the criteria used to recognize OHCA, and almost none were able to correctly reorganize the BLS sequence. Medical students felt more confident than lay people in their ability to perform resuscitation (mean 4.7, SD 2.2 vs mean 3.1, SD 2.1; P<.001). Female gender and older age were associated with lower confidence, while participants who had already attended a BLS course prior to taking the questionnaire felt more confident.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Although junior medical students were more knowledgeable than lay people regarding BLS procedures, the proportion of correct answers was low in both groups, and changes in BLS education policy should be considered.

AB  - Background: Transitions in care are vulnerable periods in health care that can expose patients to preventable errors due to incomplete or delayed communication between health care providers. Transitioning critically ill patients from intensive care units (ICUs) to other patient care units (PCUs) is particularly risky, due to the high acuity of the patients and the diversity of health care providers involved in their care. Instituting structured documentation to standardize written communication between health care providers during transitions has been identified as a promising means to reduce communication breakdowns. We developed an evidence-informed, computer-enabled, ICU-specific structured tool—an electronic transfer (e-transfer) tool—to facilitate and standardize the composition of written transfer summaries in the ICUs of one Canadian city. The tool consisted of 10 primary sections with a user interface combination of structured, automated, and free-text fields. Objective: Our overarching goal is to evaluate whether implementation of our e-transfer tool will improve the completeness and timeliness of transfer summaries and streamline communications between health care providers during high-risk transitions. Methods: This study is a cluster-specific pre-post trial, with randomized and staggered implementation of the e-transfer tool in four hospitals in Calgary, Alberta. Hospitals (ie, clusters) were allocated randomly to cross over every 2 months from control (ie, dictation only) to intervention (ie, e-transfer tool). Implementation at each site was facilitated with user education, point-of-care support, and audit and feedback. We will compare transfer summaries randomly sampled over 6 months postimplementation to summaries randomly sampled over 6 months preimplementation. The primary outcome will be a binary composite measure of the timeliness and completeness of transfer summaries. Secondary measures will include overall completeness, timeliness, and provider ratings of transfer summaries; hospital and ICU lengths of stay; and post-ICU patient outcomes, including ICU readmission, adverse events, cardiac arrest, rapid response team activation, and mortality. We will use descriptive statistics (ie, medians and means) to describe demographic characteristics. The primary outcome will be compared within each hospital pre- and postimplementation using separate logistic regression models for each hospital, with adjustment for patient characteristics. Results: Participating hospitals were cluster randomized to the intervention between July 2018 and January 2019. Preliminary extraction of ICU patient admission lists was completed in September 2019. We anticipate that evaluation data collection will be completed by early 2021, with first results ready for publication in spring or summer 2021. Conclusions: This study will report the impact of implementing an evidence-informed, computer-enabled, ICU-specific structured transfer tool on communication and preventable medical errors among patients transferred from the ICU to other hospital care units.

AB  - Code Blue is an emergency alert signal activated whenever a hospitalized patient experiences cardiac or respiratory arrest. This research aims to build an interpretable machine-learning model for predicting Code Blue events before they can happen. This study uses the electronic medical record data of the patient for the last 24 hours and the doctor's clinical notes. We use the technique of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract features from the doctor's clinical notes. The extracted features are combined with other electronic medical data, such as vital information, pre-existing diseases, and organ dysfunction, to build the final prediction model. We use Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to interpret the model. The enhanced ability to explain the model output will help healthcare professionals better understand the early warning signals of Code Blue. The prompt alert from an early warning signal ensures that patients receive immediate care from medical practitioners, thereby substantially increasing the potential for saving lives. Based on these findings, hospital managers can reframe the policy regarding the announcement of Code Blue. Hospitals can use a decision support tool to prioritize patients and manage the operations of the code blue team.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death is a worldwide public health problem. Although its incidence is not known, it is estimated to cause up to 50% of cardiac-related mortality and up to 20% of total mortality in adults. In Mexico, previous estimates suggest that it causes an average of 33 000 deaths per year; however, the data are not precise. Half of all sudden cardiac death events are due to out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest which, if not treated promptly, leads to sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the ability to respond promptly and adequately to these events with the necessary maneuvers and equipment improves the survival of the victims. To address this problem, in some states of the country, cardioprotected spaces have been created to allow timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiac defibrillation maneuvers to be performed in public access. As an objective, health professionals establish the importance of implementing cardioprotected spaces and creating public policies in this regard throughout the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most ambulance collisions happen in emergency driving conditions and are caused by human factors. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the influence of human factors associated with time pressure, patient-care intervention, and health status on the physiological responses of simulated emergency driving tasks. METHODS: A cohort of seventeen experienced paramedics performed a battery of three simulated diving tasks. The driving tasks were a non-urgent and two urgent driving simulations (one to the scene and one to the hospital). The second urgent driving task was preceded by a patient-care simulation (unstable cardiac patient with cardiopulmonary resuscitation). RESULTS: The physiological responses between the three driving tasks were not significantly different due to time pressure and patient-care intervention. It is postulated that the physiological response of experienced paramedics was influenced by the fact that they are accustomed to handling stressful situations daily. Furthermore, it was observed that paramedics with health conditions were more physiologically aroused during the urgent driving scenarios (pre and post-intervention), suggesting they might have an elevated risk of collision when they drive with urgency. Paramedics with health conditions also had higher physiological responses for the post-intervention baseline, leading to a longer recovery time period, which might represent an elevated risk of developing chronic health problems or amplifying existing ones. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research suggest that experienced paramedics manage the influence of time pressure and the impact of challenging patient-care well. Paramedics with health conditions represent an elevated risk of collision.

AB  - This article considers the analysis of complex monitored health data, where often one or several signals are reflecting the current health status that can be represented by a finite number of states, in addition to a set of covariates. In particular, we consider a novel application of a non-parametric state intensity regression method in order to study time-dependent effects of covariates on the state transition intensities. The method can handle baseline, time varying as well as dynamic covariates. Because of the non-parametric nature, the method can handle different data types and challenges under minimal assumptions. If the signal that is reflecting the current health status is of continuous nature, we propose the application of a weighted median and a hysteresis filter as data pre-processing steps in order to facilitate robust analysis. In intensity regression, covariates can be aggregated by a suitable functional form over a time history window. We propose to study the estimated cumulative regression parameters for different choices of the time history window in order to investigate short- and long-term effects of the given covariates. The proposed framework is discussed and applied to resuscitation data of newborns collected in Tanzania.

AB  - The paper explores the shift in laws and strategies aimed at promoting sustainable management of packaging waste in Spain, with a focus on flexible plastic packaging in the commercial and industrial sectors. The study delves into the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes mandated by Royal Decree 1055/2022, highlighting the crucial role of EPR in fostering a circular economy (CE) for packaging waste. Through review of EPR literature, case studies and analysis, the paper examines the challenges and opportunities in achieving sustainable management of flexible plastic packaging, drawing insights from companies already navigating EPR obligations and the choices between Collective EPR Schemes (CPR) and Individual EPR Schemes (IPR). The study focusses on the contribution of End-of-Waste (EoW) criteria to promoting sustainable resource management, and the influence of EPR regulations on reducing environmental externalities. The study concludes that the evolution of EPR regulations in Spain has significantly renewed country's approach to sustainable waste management, particularly concerning flexible plastic packaging. By aligning national legislation with European Directives (ED), Spain has demonstrated a commitment to promoting a CE for packaging waste. The conclusions emphasize the vital role of EPR in driving sustainable resource management, reducing environmental impact, and advancing the circularity of packaging materials in Spain. The study underscores the importance of continued adherence to EPR regulations, stakeholder collaboration, and public awareness for achieving long-term environmental sustainability in the management of flexible packaging waste in Spain.

AB  - This publication presents the 2005 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) of the pediatric patient and the 2005 American Academy of Pediatrics/AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC of the neonate. The guidelines are based on the evidence evaluation from the 2005 International Consensus Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations, hosted by the American Heart Association in Dallas, Texas, January 23-30, 2005. The '2005 AHA Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care' contain recommendations designed to improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest and acute life-threatening cardiopulmonary problems. The evidence evaluation process that was the basis for these guidelines was accomplished in collaboration with the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR). The ILCOR process is described in more detail in the 'International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations.' The recommendations in the '2005 AHA Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care' confirm the safety and effectiveness of many approaches, acknowledge that other approaches may not be optimal, and recommend new treatments that have undergone evidence evaluation. These new recommendations do not imply that care involving the use of earlier guidelines is unsafe. In addition, it is important to note that these guidelines will not apply to all rescuers and all victims in all situations. The leader of a resuscitation attempt may need to adapt application of the guidelines to unique circumstances. The following are the major pediatric advanced life support changes in the 2005 guidelines: There is further caution about the use of endotracheal tubes. Laryngeal mask airways are acceptable when used by experienced providers. Cuffed endotracheal tubes may be used in infants (except newborns) and children in in-hospital settings provided that cuff inflation pressure is kept <20 cm H2O. Confirmation of tube placement requires clinical assessment and assessment of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2); esophageal detector devices may be considered for use in children weighing >20 kg who have a perfusing rhythm. Correct placement must be verified when the tube is inserted, during transport, and whenever the patient is moved. During CPR with an advanced airway in place, rescuers will no longer perform 'cycles' of CPR. Instead, the rescuer performing chest compressions will perform them continuously at a rate of 100/minute without pauses for ventilation. The rescuer providing ventilation will deliver 8 to 10 breaths per minute (1 breath approximately every 6-8 seconds). Timing of 1 shock, CPR, and drug administration during pulseless arrest has changed and now is identical to that for advanced cardiac life support. Routine use of high-dose epinephrine is not recommended. Lidocaine is de-emphasized, but it can be used for treatment of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia if amiodarone is not available. Induced hypothermia (32-34 degrees C for 12-24 hours) may be considered if the child remains comatose after resuscitation. Indications for the use of inodilators are mentioned in the postresuscitation section. Termination of resuscitative efforts is discussed. It is noted that intact survival has been reported following prolonged resuscitation and absence of spontaneous circulation despite 2 doses of epinephrine. The following are the major neonatal resuscitation changes in the 2005 guidelines: Supplementary oxygen is recommended whenever positive-pressure ventilation is indicated for resuscitation; free-flow oxygen should be administered to infants who are breathing but have central cyanosis. Although the standard approach to resuscitation is to use 100% oxygen, it is reasonable to begin resuscitation with an oxygen concentration of less than 100% or to start with no supplementary oxygen (ie, start with room air). If the clinician begins resuscitation with room air, it is recommended that supplementary oxygen be available to use if there is no appreciable improvement within 90 seconds after birth. In situations where supplementary oxygen is not readily available, positive-pressure ventilation should be administered with room air. Current recommendations no longer advise routine intrapartum oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning for infants born to mothers with meconium staining of amniotic fluid. Endotracheal suctioning for infants who are not vigorous should be performed immediately after birth. A self-inflating bag, a flow-inflating bag, or a T-piece (a valved mechanical device designed to regulate pressure and limit flow) can be used to ventilate a newborn. An increase in heart rate is the primary sign of improved ventilation during resuscitation. Exhaled CO2 detection is the recommended primary technique to confirm correct endotracheal tube placement when a prompt increase in heart rate does not occur after intubation. The recommended intravenous (IV) epinephrine dose is 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per dose. Higher IV doses are not recommended, and IV administration is the preferred route. Although access is being obtained, administration of a higher dose (up to 0.1 mg/kg) through the endotracheal tube may be considered. It is possible to identify conditions associated with high mortality and poor outcome in which withholding resuscitative efforts may be considered reasonable, particularly when there has been the opportunity for parental agreement. The following guidelines must be interpreted according to current regional outcomes: When gestation, birth weight, or congenital anomalies are associated with almost certain early death and when unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors, resuscitation is not indicated. Examples are provided in the guidelines. In conditions associated with a high rate of survival and acceptable morbidity, resuscitation is nearly always indicated. In conditions associated with uncertain prognosis in which survival is borderline, the morbidity rate is relatively high, and the anticipated burden to the child is high, parental desires concerning initiation of resuscitation should be supported. Infants without signs of life (no heartbeat and no respiratory effort) after 10 minutes of resuscitation show either a high mortality rate or severe neurodevelopmental disability. After 10 minutes of continuous and adequate resuscitative efforts, discontinuation of resuscitation may be justified if there are no signs of life.

AB  - As more people are surviving cardiac arrest, focus needs to shift towards improving neurological outcomes and quality of life in survivors. Brain injury after resuscitation, a common sequela following cardiac arrest, ranges in severity from mild impairment to devastating brain injury and brainstem death. Effective strategies to minimise brain injury after resuscitation include early intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, restoration of normal physiology, and targeted temperature management. It is important to identify people who might have a poor outcome, to enable informed choices about continuation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Multimodal prediction guidelines seek to avoid premature withdrawal in those who might survive with a good neurological outcome, or prolonging treatment that might result in survival with severe disability. Approximately one in three admitted to intensive care will survive, many of whom will need intensive, tailored rehabilitation after discharge to have the best outcomes.

AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in youth athletes. Survival from out- of-hospital SCA depends on prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). This study evaluated parental knowledge, experience, and attitudes related to cardiovascular screening, SCA, and CPR/AED use in youth athletes and made comparisons between parents who are employed in healthcare and parents who are not employed in healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to evaluate knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of 91 parents of youth athletes who attended a community-based cardiovascular screening event. Although cardiovascular screening can reduce the risk of SCA, we found that 36% of parents incorrectly thought cardiovascular screening could prevent SCA and there was no difference in knowledge between the two groups of parents. This initial evaluation of parental knowledge of cardiovascular screening issues in youth athletes should guide educational efforts to prevent and respond to SCA in youth athletes.

AB  - People with Chagas disease are at a higher risk of death due to cardiac arrest (CA). Considering that Chagas disease remains a serious health problem in Latin America, studies in this regard are still needed. The aim of this study was to present 2 patients with Chagas that developed CA and were treated at the emergency department of a reference hospital in Brazil (Sao Paulo city). Case one: Male (73 years old and Caucasian) with a history of systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and Chagas disease associated with megacolon and megaesophagus. After cardiac collapse and 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), unfortunately the patient died. Case two: A female patient (64 years old and Caucasian), with a history of systemic arterial hypertension, obesity, and Chagas disease. After 23 days of hospitalization, pharmacological therapy, and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, the patient was discharged. People with Chagas disease are at a higher risk of CA. The researchers believe that a prompt and efficient treatment (advanced life support) allied with educational programs on CA recognition targeted at health professionals and caregivers (basic life support knowledge) could improve the prognoses of these patients.

AB  - Background: Invasive intensive care unit (ICU) treatments for patients with advanced medical illnesses and poor prognoses may prolong suffering with minimal benefit. Unfortunately, the quality of care planning and communication between clinicians and critically ill patients and their families in these situations are highly variable, frequently leading to overutilization of invasive ICU treatments. Time-limited trials (TLTs) are agreements between the clinicians and the patients and decision makers to use certain medical therapies over defined periods of time and to evaluate whether patients improve or worsen according to predetermined clinical parameters. For patients with advanced medical illnesses receiving aggressive ICU treatments, TLTs can promote effective dialogue, develop consensus in decision making, and set rational boundaries to treatments based on patients' goals of care. Objective: The aim of this study will be to examine whether a multicomponent quality-improvement strategy that uses protocoled TLTs as the default ICU care-planning approach for critically ill patients with advanced medical illnesses will decrease duration and intensity of nonbeneficial ICU care without changing hospital mortality. Methods: This study will be conducted in medical ICUs of three public teaching hospitals in Los Angeles County. In Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and semistructured interviews with key stakeholders to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing TLTs among ICU patients with advanced medical illnesses. In Aim 2, we will train clinicians to use protocol-enhanced TLTs as the default communication and care-planning approach in patients with advanced medical illnesses who receive invasive ICU treatments. Eligible patients will be those who the treating ICU physicians consider to be at high risk for nonbeneficial treatments according to guidelines from the Society of Critical Care Medicine. ICU physicians will be trained to use the TLT protocol through a curriculum of didactic lectures, case discussions, and simulations utilizing actors as family members in role-playing scenarios. Family meetings will be scheduled by trained care managers. The improvement strategy will be implemented sequentially in the three participating hospitals, and outcomes will be evaluated using a before-and-after study design. Key process outcomes will include frequency, timing, and content of family meetings. The primary clinical outcome will be ICU length of stay. Secondary outcomes will include hospital length of stay, days receiving life-sustaining treatments (eg, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy), number of attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation, frequency of invasive ICU procedures, and disposition from hospitalization. Results: The study began in August 2017. The implementation of interventions and data collection were completed at two of the three hospitals. As of September 2019, the study was at the postintervention stage at the third hospital. We have completed focus groups with physicians at each medical center (N=29) and interviews of family members and surrogate decision makers (N=18). The study is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020, and results are expected to be available in mid-2020. Conclusions: The successful completion of the aims in this proposal may identify a systematic approach to improve communication and shared decision making and to reduce nonbeneficial invasive treatments for ICU patients with advanced medical illnesses.

AB  - Sustainability figures prominently in the rhetoric around the nonfinancial responsibilities of business, as is manifest in the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Often, however, sustainability assumes a narrow social and ecological meaning. A more comprehensive and apt concept would instead focus on the political dimension of sustainability. The long‐term success of business depends primarily on sound institutions as embodied in the liberal democratic state. Therefore, companies should invest politically in strengthening the public realm—to their own benefit. CSR misses this strategic nexus; rather, the business case lies in the adoption of a corporate political responsibility (CPR). Advocating for a broad definition of what is political, the paper lays out concrete CPR fields of action that allow companies to become political brands. As a holistic concept to conceive of the interface between business and politics, CPR does not only help to secure a company's longevity, but also reorients our understanding and practice of public affairs.

AB  - Objective. In canonical modern bioethics, withholding and withdrawing medical interventions for dying patients are considered morally equivalent. However, electing not to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) struck us as easily distinguishable from withdrawing mechanical ventilation. Moreover, withdrawing mechanical ventilation from a moribund infant "feels" different from withdrawing mechanical ventilation from a hemodynamically stable child with a severe neurologic insult. Most previous descriptions of withdrawing and withholding intervention in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have blurred many of these distinctions. We hypothesized that clarifying them would more accurately portray the process of end-of-life decision-making in the NICU. Methods. We reviewed the charts of all newborn infants who had birth weight >400 g and died in our hospital in 1988, 1993, and 1998 and extracted potential ethical issues (resuscitation, withdrawal, withholding, CPR, do-not-resuscitate orders, neurologic prognosis, ethics consult) surrounding each infant's death. Results. Using traditional definitions, roughly half of all deaths in our NICU in 1993 and 1998 were associated with "withholding or withdrawing." In addition, by 1998, >40% of our NICU deaths could be labeled "active withdrawal," reflecting the extubation of infants regardless of their physiologic instability. This practice is growing over time. However, 2 important conclusions arise from our more richly elaborated descriptions of death in the NICU. First, when CPR was withheld, it most commonly occurred in the context of moribund infants who were already receiving ventilation and dopamine. Physiologically stable infants who were removed from mechanical ventilation for quality-of-life reasons accounted for only 3% of NICU deaths in 1988, 16% of NICU deaths in 1993, and 13% of NICU deaths in 1998. Moreover, virtually none of these active withdrawals took place in premature infants. Second, by...

AB  - The types of tenurial arrangements and incentives appropriate for the sustainable management of common pool resources (CPRs), such as forests, remain a topic of debate. In this study, we aim to (i) investigate the extraction level of forest resources under short and long-term property rights, and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of introducing mechanisms that leverage reputation and feelings of guilt in promoting cooperation among CPR users with short-term property rights to reduce over-harvesting. We develop a simple theoretical model to predict the optimal extraction level of a shared forest resource and validate the predictions using data from a framed field experiment conducted in rural Ethiopia. Our findings demonstrate that extraction levels under short-term property rights are higher compared to long-term property rights, aligning with the model predictions. Leveraging reputation and feelings of guilt is effective in bridging the gap in extraction intensity between short- and long-term property rights. However, as implementing reputation requires reliable monitoring that can be costly and challenging in the study context, we propose extending the duration of property rights over shared forest resources as a preferred strategy for curtailing over-extraction. • We develop a theoretical model to describe forest resource extraction strategies. • We use a framed-field experiment to validate model predictions. • Extraction is higher under short-term compared to long-term property rights. • Non-monetary incentives can reduce extraction levels.

AB  - In 2010, prompted by compelling evidence that demonstrated better patient outcomes in hospitals with higher percentages of nurses with a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), the Institute of Medicine recommended that 80 percent of the nurse workforce be qualified at that level or higher by 2020. Using data from the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines-Resuscitation registry (for 2013-18), RN4CAST-US hospital nurse surveys (2015-16), and the American Hospital Association (2015), we found that each 10-percentage-point increase in the hospital share of nurses with a BSN was associated with 24 percent greater odds of surviving to discharge with good cerebral performance among patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest. Lower patient-to-nurse ratios on general medical and surgical units were also associated with significantly greater odds of surviving with good cerebral performance. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports policies to increase access to baccalaureate-level education and improve hospital nurse staffing.

AB  - Introduction: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a critical and lethal emergency, particularly in out-of-hospital settings, with shockable rhythms like ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) presenting significant challenges. Antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone and lidocaine, are commonly used alongside defibrillation to stabilize cardiac rhythms. While amiodarone is the guideline-recommended choice, lidocaine serves as an alternative. Evidence from studies shows both drugs improve hospital admission rates, especially in bystander-witnessed cases, but their impact on survival to discharge and neurological outcomes remains uncertain. This review evaluates the comparative efficacy of these drugs to guide clinical practice and improve resuscitation outcomes. Materials and methods: A thorough literature review was performed using electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar. The search strategy employed a combination of keywords, including "lidocaine," "amiodarone," "VF," "ventricular fibrillation," "pulseless ventricular tachycardia," "pVT" and "cardiac arrest." The search was restricted to Englishlanguage articles published from 1970 to 2024. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to systematically review and compare the efficacy of lidocaine and amiodarone in the treatment of cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in adults. This review seeks to evaluate the existing literature to determine the effectiveness and clinical outcomes associated with each medication. Conclusions: The comparative analysis of amiodarone and lidocaine highlights their respective strengths and limitations in managing cardiac arrest, offering valuable insights for clinical practice. Amiodarone stands out as the preferred antiarrhythmic agent due to its significant efficacy in improving short-term outcomes, such as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital admission. Its potential to enhance functional survival further reinforces its role, particularly when administered promptly during resuscitation efforts. In contrast, lidocaine remains a viable alternative, particularly in resource-limited settings or when contraindications to amiodarone exist. However, its limited impact on long-term survival and neurological recovery restricts its broader applicability. Overall, amiodarone's efficacy and broader applicability position it as the first-line agent for shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT). Lidocaine serves as an important alternative in specific scenarios. Future research should aim to optimize antiarrhythmic protocols, improve long-term survival and neurological outcomes, and explore innovative approaches to resuscitation.

AB  - One hundred clinically stable outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were surveyed at home by respiratory nurse specialists (RNS) about their views towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and in hospital ventilation. Written information about COPD, CPR and ventilation was provided and consent obtained. The breathing problembased quality-of-life questionnaire (BP-QoL) was completed. The following information was recorded: age, sex, spirometry, hospital admissions, and antidepressant and oxygen usage in the previous year. Patients were then asked to imagine a scenario in which they were admitted to hospital and their chest condition deteriorated in spite of standard treatment. 'Having reached that stage would you wish to have noninvasive ventilation (NIV), invasive ventilation (IV) or CPR?' Three months later patients were asked to complete a postal patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Of 100 patients 41 were male and the mean age was 74.1 years. Fifty four patients had a FEV1 B<sub>/</sub> 40% and 37 had a FEV1 between 40 and 59% predicted. Twenty-four patients were on long-term oxygen therapy, eight had taken antidepressants and 56 had been admitted to hospital in the previous year. Forty-eight patients wanted all additional treatments to be attempted if needed and 12 wanted none. Nineteen patients said 'no' for CPR and 10 said 'no' for CPR and IV. There was no significant statistical difference between the groups answering 'yes' or 'no'. Seventy-six per cent of patient satisfaction questionnaires were returned. All patients were satisfied with the way they had been approached and the information received, and 98% of them thought that this issue should be discussed with all patients. Conclusion: Attitudes towards resuscitation can be discussed with COPD patients by RNS without causing distress. Attitudes to resuscitation could not be predicted from parameters of respiratory disease severity or age.

AB  - Clinicians who rarely perform neonatal resuscitation exhibit skill deterioration. Telehealth addresses this challenge by facilitating video connections between neonatologists at tertiary care centers and providers at smaller hospitals. However, there is little empirical evidence about the benefits of telehealth programs for neonatal resuscitation. Thus, we conducted a multiple-baseline study to evaluate the effect of video-assisted resuscitation on the transfer of newborns from eight community hospitals that implemented neonatal telehealth in the period November 2014--December 2015 to level 3 newborn intensive care units. The intervention was associated with a reduction of 0.70 transfers per facility-month and a 29.4 percent reduction in a newborn's odds of being transferred. Annually, this corresponds to 67.2 fewer transfers and an estimated savings of $1,220,352 per year. Avoiding transfers keeps families closer to home, increases community hospital revenue, and eliminates transfer-associated risk. Yet lack of reimbursement for telehealth limits its adoption. Policy changes are necessary to align payment incentives and promote the use of telehealth services.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have previously demonstrated that standardized handoff from prehospital to hospital clinicians can improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in a pediatric emergency department (ED). We leveraged our previous quality improvement initiative to standardize performance of a bundle of 5 discrete aspects of resuscitation for OHCA patients: intravenous or intraosseous catheter (IV/IO) access, epinephrine administration, advanced airway placement, end-tidal capnography (ETCO2) application, and cardiac rhythm verbalization. We aimed to reduce time to completion of the bundle from 302 seconds at baseline to less than 120 seconds within 1 year. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team performed video-based review of actual OHCA resuscitations in our pediatric ED. We designed interventions aimed at key drivers of bundle performance. Interventions included specific roles and responsibilities and a standardized choreography for each bundle element. To assess the effect of the interventions, time to performance of each bundle element was measured by standardized review of video recordings from our resuscitation bay. Balancing measures were time off the chest and time to defibrillator pad placement. RESULTS: We analyzed 56 cases of OHCA from May 2019 through May 2021. Time to bundle completion improved from a baseline of 302 seconds to 147 seconds. Four of 5 individual bundle elements also demonstrated significant improvement. These improvements were sustained without any negative impact on balancing measures. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized choreography for the initial minutes of ED cardiac arrest resuscitation shows promise to decrease time to crucial interventions in children presenting to the pediatric ED with OHCA.

AB  - Continuous medical education (CME) is an essential component of postgraduate education to improve trainees' competencies level to be at par with the current clinical practice thereby improving overall quality of patient healthcare delivery. As a postgraduate trainee in addition to being a part of hospital workforce, providing a compact CME session is essential albeit the learning challenges. Therefore, a framework for the trauma CME program was developed to integrate trainee-led immersive active learning (AL) activities based on our emergency medicine postgraduate training curriculum. It comprised of three components which were mini-conferences on trauma management principles updates; hands-on skill stations session utilizing pre-prepared learning packages, simulated scenarios, manikins and phantoms; and immersive trauma simulation on prehospital response, radio communication and patient resuscitation combined with formative assessments and debriefing session. Google Form platform was used to gather the trainees' self-appraisals of the learning experience. Feedbacks from the trainees revealed that the sessions were engaging and appropriate to their level of training. In conclusion, by incorporating AL activities into immersive trauma CME, it promotes trainees' engagement towards teaching and learning activities thus consolidating their knowledge and skills on handling trauma patients.

AB  - Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Calixto Machado et al. (see record [rid]2017-53563-016[/rid]) and Gabriele Melegari et al. (see record [rid]2017-53563-017[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2017-23949-015[/rid]). The authors appreciate the comments of Machado et al. and Melegari et al. on their guideline, which provided recommendations to reduce brain injury following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Despite the promising results in animal studies (many used hypothermia during resuscitation or minutes thereafter in controlled circumstances) with the early initiation of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), as mentioned by Machado et al., multiple human studies (5 Class I and 1 Class II) failed to demonstrate any benefit of pre-hospital TH followed by TH in-hospital vs only TH in-hospital for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Many factors may have contributed to the difference in outcomes between animal studies and human trials, including the difference in time of initiation, methods, and application consistency of TH in relation to CPR. While case reports exist of good survival of people who had extreme accidental hypothermia followed by cardiac arrest, the pathophysiologic mechanism is quite different from the controlled clinical trials of TH after OHCA included in the practice guideline. The comments of Melegari et al. are based on their observation of 32 patients post CPR who were treated with mild TH. A population-based cardiac arrest study showed the associations of non-shockable cardiac rhythm to preexisting non-cardiovascular diseases and shockable cardiac rhythms to preexisting cardiovascular diseases. Although some association has been attributed to preexisting conditions (e.g., cardiac disease and lung disease) and measures during CPR (e.g., cardiac rhythm and arrest time) to the outcomes after successful CPR, these conditions were found less reliable as predictors of neurologic outcome. More research is needed. Until better data are available, the recommendations remain as provided in the guideline. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The article focuses on cardiologist Pim van Lommel's exploration of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) and their implications for understanding consciousness. Initially skeptical about consciousness existing beyond death, van Lommel's perspective shifted after he encountered patients who reported vivid memories during cardiac arrest, despite the prevailing belief that consciousness ceases during such events. His research, including a study of 344 cardiac arrest survivors, revealed that a significant portion reported NDEs, challenging traditional materialistic views of consciousness as solely brain-dependent. The findings suggest that NDEs may indicate a continuity of consciousness beyond physical death, prompting a call for a paradigm shift in scientific understanding of consciousness.

AB  - Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for children worldwide, including >3 million deaths annually and, among survivors, risk for new or worsening functional impairments, including reduced quality of life, new respiratory, nutritional, or technological assistance, and recurrent severe infections. Advances in understanding sepsis pathophysiology highlight a need to update the definition and diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock, whereas new data support an increasing role for automated screening algorithms and biomarker combinations to assist earlier recognition. Once sepsis or septic shock is suspected, attention to prompt initiation of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation, and vasoactive medications remain key components to initial management with several new and ongoing studies offering new insights into how to optimize this approach. Ultimately, a key goal is for screening to encompass as many children as possible at risk for sepsis and trigger early treatment without increasing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics and preventable hospitalizations. Although the role for adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids and other metabolic therapies remains incompletely defined, ongoing studies will soon offer updated guidance for optimal use. Finally, we are increasingly moving toward an era in which precision therapeutics will bring novel strategies to improve outcomes, especially for the subset of children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and sepsis subphenotypes for whom antibiotics, fluid, vasoactive medications, and supportive care remain insufficient.

AB  - Background: Children with cardiac channelopathies face significant challenges, including exposure to medical trauma, complex genetic testing options, activity restrictions, lifelong surveillance, and increased risk of sudden death. This study assessed parental perceptions of child health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and unmet cardiac care needs, as well as predictors of traumatic stress among parents of children with a cardiac channelopathy. Methods: Parents of children diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, or Brugada Syndrome were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Sixty-eight parents from 45 families (response rate: 75%) completed measures assessing child HRQOL, unmet cardiac care needs, and parent symptoms of traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Results: Prior to attending their first multidisciplinary arrhythmia clinic, parents reported an average of 12 unmet needs. Half of mothers (50%) and 38% of fathers indicated their child was at-risk in terms of emotional functioning. Having a cardiac implantable electronic device, lower social support, and greater parental psychological stress predicted lower child HRQOL. Child out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was the strongest predictor of parent post-traumatic stress. Conclusions: Psychosocial screening and access to integrated, trauma-informed, family-centered psychological care should form part of best practice recommendations for children with cardiac channelopathies.

AB  - A previously healthy 14-year-old boy developed right-sided neck pain, tachycardia, a diffuse erythematous rash, and subjective fevers over 2 days. He sought medical attention in a local urgent care clinic, where he had a negative Sars-CoV-2 antigen test and was referred to the local emergency department (ED) for persistent tachycardia and further workup. After fluid resuscitation, his tachycardia was not improved, so he was admitted to the Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service. Physical examination showed large areas of erythema and erythroderma of multiple body sites, perioral sparing, increased erythema in flexor skin folds, posterior soft palate petechiae, and a white strawberry tongue. There was a small, tender lesion with surrounding erythema without discharge on his right neck thought to be a possible entry point for infection. Laboratory results showed thrombocytopenia, normal white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin concentration, absolute lymphopenia, and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) to 130 mg/L. He was started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics for a presumed infectious cause of the rash and laboratory findings. The next morning, an expanded diagnostic workup was undertaken including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, ferritin, triglycerides, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), brain natriuretic peptide, coagulation studies, and fibrinogen. With treatment and supportive care, his tachycardia and energy improved, so he was discharged with oral antibiotics and follow-up with the Infectious Disease Clinic in 2 days. When seen in follow-up, he was immediately admitted to the hospital for worsening fatigue, tachycardia, and new findings that prompted multiple consultations, and transfer to pediatric critical care services.

AB  - Introduction Historically, the quality and performance of prehospital emergency care (PEC) has been assessed largely based on surrogate, non-clinical endpoints such as response time intervals or other crude measures of care (eg, stakeholder satisfaction). However, advances in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems and services world-wide have seen their scope and reach continue to expand. This has dictated that novel measures of performance be implemented to compliment this growth. Significant progress has been made in this area, largely in the form of the development of evidence-informed quality indicators (QIs) of PEC. Problem Quality indicators represent an increasingly popular component of health care quality and performance measurement. However, little is known about the development of QIs in the PEC environment. The purpose of this study was to assess the development and characteristics of PEC-specific QIs in the literature.<bold>Methods: </bold>A scoping review was conducted through a search of PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA); EMBase (Elsevier; Amsterdam, Netherlands); CINAHL (EBSCO Information Services; Ipswich, Massachusetts USA); Web of Science (Thomson Reuters; New York, New York USA); and the Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration; Oxford, United Kingdom). To increase the sensitivity of the literature, a search of the grey literature and review of select websites was additionally conducted. Articles were selected that proposed at least one PEC QI and whose aim was to discuss, analyze, or promote quality measurement in the PEC environment.<bold>Results: </bold>The majority of research (n=25 articles) was published within the last decade (68.0%) and largely originated within the USA (68.0%). Delphi and observational methodologies were the most commonly employed for QI development (28.0%). A total of 331 QIs were identified via the article review, with an additional 15 QIs identified via the website review. Of all, 42.8% were categorized as primarily Clinical, with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest contributing the highest number within this domain (30.4%). Of the QIs categorized as Non-Clinical (57.2%), Time-Based Intervals contributed the greatest number (28.8%). Population on Whom the Data Collection was Constructed made up the most commonly reported QI component (79.8%), followed by a Descriptive Statement (63.6%). Least reported were Timing of Data Collection (12.1%) and Timing of Reporting (12.1%). Pilot testing of the QIs was reported on 34.7% of QIs identified in the review.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Overall, there is considerable interest in the understanding and development of PEC quality measurement. However, closer attention to the details and reporting of QIs is required for research of this type to be more easily extrapolated and generalized.

AB  - Time is critical with any out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The possibility of brain cell death increases, and the likelihood of a "good" outcome decreases with time. The most prominent impairments involve memory and attentional difficulties. Limited research and few cases have shown positive cognitive results following an OHCA to the extent that this case study depicts. The current case study presents a right-handed male in his late 40s, with master's and law degrees, and a high-level functioning in the workplace who experienced an OHCA. He was treated for his OHCA and subsequently underwent neuropsychological testing less than 2 months following his hospital discharge. Expected results suggest impairments in key cognitive areas; however, a neuropsychological exam less than 2-months post-incident, testing pre-morbid IQ, overall cognitive ability, processing speed, attention, executive functioning, language, visuospatial abilities, and memory; each showing normal or better results. Additionally, self and collateral report questionnaires examining cognitive and emotional functioning reported no difficulties and no major changes since his cardiac arrest. We speculate that this patient's exceptional outcome might be due to his cognitive reserve, and the immediateness of his intervention (5–10 min of CPR and return-of-spontaneous-circulation from an AED shock) and use of a saline cooling procedure upon arrival to the hospital. Overall, we highlight a patient with a remarkable cognitive outcome, utilizing data from neuropsychological testing within 2-months post-incident, and propose protective factors in neuropsychological functioning following an OHCA.

During pregnancy, several complications can occur, the same ones that could lead to a speedy delivery, which leads us to ask ourselves what the chances of survival of newborn babies are. It was possible to reach the conclusion that there is a deterioration in the longterm quality of life of premature newborns and that it is necessary to be able to implement preventive and effective methods to avoid a tragic outcome.

AB  - Objective: Approximately half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors have enduring cognitive impairment. This study investigated the effectiveness of a combined cognitive rehabilitation approach, combining metacognitive strategy training with direct computerized-training, to improve cognitive functioning in daily life after OHCA. Method: A single-case experimental design with a non-concurrent multiple baseline was used including five participants. The intervention (6-10 weeks) entailed therapist-guided metacognitive and direct training, with a randomized starting date. Participants completed daily visual analog scales on personal problems and subjective cognition (memory, attention, executive functioning). Cognitive tests and questionnaires on cognition, memory failures, societal participation, and quality of life were administered pre- and post-intervention. Statistical analysis included visual analysis, (weighted) TAU-U tests, and multilevel regression. Results: Visual analysis showed improvements in personal daily problems for all adherent participants (n=4). Weighted TAU-U scores were small but significant for the personal problems (TAU-U=.19, p<.01) and attention (TAU-U=.18, p=.02). Three participants showed a significant decrease in personal problem severity during and after treatment. Descriptive cognitive test scores suggested an improvement. Participants reportedfewer memory failures and greater societal participation, but no statistical analyses were conducted. Subjective cognitive changes were mixed, life satisfaction remained stable. Conclusions: The combined treatment improved daily cognitive functioning after OHCA.

AB  - To compare the effectiveness of VR based training and traditional simulation in improving the knowledge, psychomotor skills, attitudes, learning styles and self-directed learning skills of nursing students participating in CPR training. Randomized controlled trial with a pre-test/post-test control group design. Study was conducted with 144 s-year nursing students at an accredited state university in Turkey. Participants were randomly assigned to either a VR group or a traditional simulation group. Both groups received theoretical instruction in CPR followed by VR-based training using Oculus Quest 2 headsets or a traditional simulation-based exercise. Data were collected using the CPR Knowledge Test, the Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, the Simulation Design Scale and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for CPR skills. Both groups showed significant improvements in CPR skills after the intervention, with no significant difference between groups. The traditional simulation group showed a significant increase in self-directed learning skills, while no significant change was observed in the VR group. The VR group showed a supportive effect on abstract conceptualization in learning styles, but had no significant effect on learning preferences. Students in the VR group outperformed the control group on several critical psychomotor CPR skills measured by OSCE. Both groups rated their simulation experiences favorably. VR-based CPR training is an effective, scalable, and engaging teaching method that enhances psychomotor skill acquisition and promotes cognitive engagement. Future research should explore hybrid models and long-term outcomes to optimize the use of VR in CPR education.

AB  - Introduction: For effective bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be achievable, potential bystander CPR providers must be able to retain sufficient CPR knowledge for a reasonable time frame after training. This study aimed at ascertaining the retained CPR theoretical knowledge of some Nigerian teachers after 15 months of CPR training. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental study design was used. From the initial cohort of forty one (41) teachers, thirty one (31) of them participated in the last phase of the study. The same self-administered questionnaire with seven (7) questions on their theoretical CPR knowledge, used initially immediately after their CPR training in 2016 to assess them was used again in December 2017 without further training. The data was analysed using both descriptive and paired samples t-test statistics. Results: Generally, the participants had good retention of the CPR theoretical knowledge that were not statistically significantly different from their post-training knowledge earlier (P>0.05) except in two questions where the differences (CPR knowledge losses) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions/Recommendations: The Nigerian teachers retained satisfactory CPR theoretical knowledge after 15 months of initial training, which holds promise for their ability to provide bystander CPR for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) and the training of their students with the possible incorporation of CPR programme into Nigerian schools' curricula. There is need to repeat the study with larger sample sizes.

AB  - In real practice, there is a paradox in the management of patients with 'long-term Covid-19.' Indeed, Family physicians (FPs) are on the front line in the management process of these patients. For 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and according to the World Health Organization guideline, the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) should be provided not only at tertiary- or secondary care but mainly at primary care with a real implication of FPs. However, specific guidelines/recommendations were addressed for FPs. Therefore, an alternative including the CPR minimal advice that an FP should provide to 'long-term Covid-19' patients, seems to be necessary to respond to the needs of FPs to face their involvement with 'long-term Covid-19' patients. Thus, this paper aimed to report the CPR 'minimal advice' that should be provided by FPs managing 'long-term Covid-19' patients with incapacity (i.e.; alteration of the cardiorespiratory and muscular chain). According to the authors, FPs should be more cautious in the prescription of exercise and nutrition program and informed about the minimal advices related to nutritional and physical exercise rehabilitation guidelines when taking care of 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and how these guidelines can relieve the mental and physical problems, improve immunity, and accelerate the recovery process of the patients. With the occurrence of new variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the nutritional and exercise rehabilitation guidelines implemented by FPs become indispensable to promote the recovery of Covid-19 patients and support a return to normal life.

AB  - Objective: Comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) pose a complex challenge for physicians reliant on imperfect studies to determine the extent of neurologic injury. Clinically available imaging is frequently relied upon despite limited sensitivity. We conducted a prospective pilot study comparing diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-MRI and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in comatose survivors of CA to investigate the benefit of utilizing higher diffusion b-values to enhance prediction of arousal recovery. Methods: Survivors of CA admitted from June 2015 through November 2019 with DKI-MRI and SSEPs were evaluated. Advanced diffusion metrics differentiating present or absent SSEPs were analyzed using whole-brain voxelwise nonparametric permutation inference with threshold-free cluster enhancement. Results: Twenty survivors of CA were included, mean age 52, 45% female and out-of-hospital arrests accounting for 75% of cases. Baseline characteristics and examination findings were not statistically different between groups at admission or 48 h after achieving normothermia. A decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and increase in mean kurtosis (MK) was demonstrated in subjects without arousal recovery potential, most prominently in the posterior mesial temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Conclusion: DKI-MRI may improve early arousal recovery prediction during the immediate phase of post-CA care, especially where SSEPs are unavailable or unreliable.

AB  - To describe the knowledge and attitude of Chinese patients with advanced cancer towards advanced care planning (ACP), a convenience sample of 275 patients with advanced cancer was recruited from a tertiary cancer hospital in Beijing, China, between February and December 2017. The multi-item questionnaire focused on patients' demographics, disease characteristics and knowledge about and attitude towards ACP and was administered to eligible patients. Descriptive statistics were performed. Most patients had never heard about ACP (82.2%) and had never talked about ACP (83.0%), but only a few (18.3%) were not willing to talk about ACP. A total of 67.8% patients chose to refuse resuscitation attempts or life-sustaining medical interventions, and 70.8% of patients hoped to have surrogate decision makers when they became unconscious. By binary logistic regression analysis, patients who were of greater age, female and living in urban areas preferred to refuse resuscitation attempts or life-sustaining medical interventions (OR = 1.023, P = 0.042; OR = 2.011, P = 0.020; OR = 0.254, P < 0.01); patients who had very rich or rich family economic status preferred to involve surrogate decision makers compared with patients of very poor family economic status (OR = 0.250, P = 0.011). There is a large gap between the knowledge about ACP and the expectation of implementing ACP in Chinese patients with advanced cancer. To develop culturally appropriate and individualized programmes to promote knowledge and implementation in practice of ACP among Chinese patients with advanced cancer and their relatives is still a significant challenge.

AB  - Background: Frailty is common among patients with chronic coronary disease and is associated with worse outcomes. Methods: A pooled, post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA‐CKD trials was conducted. Baseline frailty was assessed using a Frailty Index (FI), and participants were categorized into data‐derived tertiles. Multivariable Cox models with multiplicative interaction terms (frailty × treatment arm) were constructed to evaluate whether baseline frailty status modified the treatment effect of the initial invasive (vs conservative) strategy on a composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest and the secondary outcome of HRQoL (Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]). Results: Among 5322 participants (mean 64 years, 24% female), a high frailty burden (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1) was associated with lower baseline SAQ scores and increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes on follow‐up. Baseline frailty burden did not significantly modify the effect of the initial invasive strategy on the primary composite outcome (Pinteractionfrailty × intervention arm = 0.30). However, frailty significantly modified the effect of the initial invasive strategy on HRQoL, with higher baseline frailty burden associated with greater improvement in SAQ scores at 1 year with initial invasive (vs. conservative) treatment (Pinteractionfrailty × intervention arm < 0.001). The treatment effect of an initial invasive vs. conservative strategy on 12‐month SAQ score change was most pronounced in individuals with lower baseline SAQ scores in both higher and lower frailty burden groups. Conclusion: Patients with chronic coronary disease with a higher frailty burden are more likely to experience greater improvements in HRQoL with initial invasive management without a higher risk of adverse clinical events. Lower baseline SAQ scores predicted greater improvement in HRQoL with initial invasive management, independent of frailty burden.

AB  - Background: Patient simulators are an increasingly important part of medical training. They have been shown to be effective in teaching procedural skills, medical knowledge, and clinical decision-making. Recently, virtual and augmented reality simulators are being produced, but there is no research on whether these more realistic experiences cause problematic and greater stress responses as compared to standard manikin simulators. Objective: The purpose of this research is to examine the psychological and physiological effects of augmented reality (AR) in medical simulation training as compared to traditional manikin simulations. Methods: A within-subjects experimental design was used to assess the responses of medical students (N=89) as they completed simulated (using either manikin or AR) pediatric resuscitations. Baseline measures of psychological well-being, salivary cortisol, and galvanic skin response (GSR) were taken before the simulations began. Continuous GSR assessments throughout and after the simulations were captured along with follow-up measures of emotion and cortisol. Participants also wrote freely about their experience with each simulation, and narratives were coded for emotional word use. Results: Of the total 86 medical students who participated, 37 (43%) were male and 49 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 25.2 (SD 2.09, range 22-30) years and 24.7 (SD 2.08, range 23-36) years, respectively. GSR was higher in the manikin group adjusted for day, sex, and medications taken by the participants (AR-manikin: -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.03; P=.009). The difference in negative affect between simulation types was not statistically significant (AR-manikin: 0.41, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.53; P=.48). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in self-reported stress (AR-manikin: 0.53, 95% CI -2.35 to 3.42; P=.71) or simulation stress (AR-manikin: -2.17, 95% CI -6.94 to 2.59; P=.37). The difference in percentage of positive emotion words used to describe the experience was not statistically significant between simulation types, which were adjusted for day of experiment, sex of the participants, and total number of words used (AR-manikin: -4.0, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.10; P=.12). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in terms of the percentage of negative emotion words used to describe the experience (AR-manikin: -0.33, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.46; P=.41), simulation sickness (AR-manikin: 0.17, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.62; P=.47), or salivary cortisol (AR-manikin: 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.13; P=.41). Finally, preexisting levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, perceived stress, and reported depression were not tied to physiological responses to AR. Conclusions: AR simulators elicited similar stress responses to currently used manikin-based simulators, and we did not find any evidence of AR simulators causing excessive stress to participants. Therefore, AR simulators are a promising tool to be used in medical training, which can provide more emotionally realistic scenarios without the risk of additional harm.

AB  - Background The incidence of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation continues to increase worldwide largely due to greater awareness of the symptoms of cardiac events and increased attention to cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in the community. Globally, predicted survival rates after cardiopulmonary resuscitation have remained at 10% for decades and although patient outcome remains unpredictable, there is a positive trend in life expectancy. For a resuscitation attempt to be classed as successful, not only survival but also quality of life has to be evaluated. Aim The aim of this review was to examine literature that explores the quality of life ( QOL) for survivors' after CPR and the influence cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) has had on their QOL. Review methods This review follows Whittemore and Knafl's framework for an integrative literature review. Electronic databases EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed and EMBASE were searched. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, thirty-six papers published from January 2000 to June 2015 were included in this review. Results These papers represent a broad spectrum of research evaluating quality of life for survivors of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The heterogeneous research methods and vast number of different research tools make it challenging to compare the findings. The majority of papers concluded that quality of life for survivors of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was generally acceptable. However, studies also described survivors' experience of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and cognitive dysfunction. Conclusion A majority of papers reported an acceptable quality of life if the patient survived to hospital discharge. The heterogeneity in quantitative papers was noticeable and indicates a marked variance in patient outcomes. This review highlights the absence of specialized tools used to investigate survivors' experience of the event. Further exploration of the impact cardiopulmonary resuscitation has on the individual may improve ongoing rehabilitation and quality of life levels for survivors.

AB  - Background: Medical schools face the challenge of equipping medical graduates with the skills and knowledge required in the early detection and management of acutely unwell patients. Studies reveal that junior doctors are inadequately prepared to manage acute illness, and lack the ability to resuscitate patients in cardiac arrest. A modified programme of learning, focusing on recognition and management of the acutely ill patient and cardiac arrest, was introduced for final-year medical students at the James Cook University Hospital. Evaluating the effectiveness of the teaching was vital, as junior doctors are often the first responders to deteriorating patients who require prompt life-saving interventions. Methods: This qualitative study involved interviewing a purposive sample of graduate doctors following 4 months of acute clinical experience. The study explored their encounters of acute illness and their levels of preparedness to manage such patients within the clinical environment upon qualifying. Content-thematic analysis was utilised to examine interview data. Results: Although anxious, participants expressed that they were adequately prepared to manage the acutely unwell patient and cardiac arrest upon qualifying. The programme of learning proved effective in providing learning experiences, mainly through clinical simulation, the use of the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure) structured approach, and the Immediate Life Support course (Resuscitation Council, UK), and in equipping graduate doctors with the knowledge and skills required to manage critically ill patients. Discussion: In essence, clinical tutors are indirectly responsible for saving patients lives. Evaluating the effectiveness of acute illness teaching is essential, as this ultimately will impact on patient outcome and survival.

AB  - This study examined differential responses among partners who participated in a RCT designed to compare two social cognitive theory interventions, one designed for patients only (P-only) and one for patients and their intimate partners (P + P). The interventions were delivered following the patient receiving an initial ICD implant. Partner health outcomes were examined longitudinally from baseline at hospital discharge to 3, 6, and 12 months. Outcomes included 6 measures: partner physical and mental health status (Short-Form-36 PCS and MCS), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), caregiver burden (Oberst Caregiver Burden Scale), and self-efficacy in ICD management (Sudden Cardiac Arrest Self-efficacy scale). Growth mixture and mixed effect modeling were used to identify and compare trajectories of 6 health outcomes within the P-only and P + P arms of the study. Partners (n = 301) were on average 62 years old, female (74.1%) and Caucasian (83.4%), with few co-morbidities (mean Charlson Co-morbidity index, 0.72 ± 1.1). Two types of profiles were observed for P-only and P + P, one profile where patterns of health outcomes were generally better across 12 months and one with outcome patterns that were generally worse across time. For PCS, no significant partner differences were observed between P-only or P + P in either the better (p = 0.067) or the worse (p = 0.129) profile types. Compared to P-only, partners in the worse profile improved significantly over 12 months in MCS (p = 0.006), caregiver burden P + P (p = 0.004) and self-efficacy P + P (p = 0.041). Compared to P-only, P + P partners in the low anxiety profile improved significantly (p = 0.001) at 3 months. Partners with more psychosocial distress at hospital discharge benefited most from the P + P intervention. Among partners with generally low levels of anxiety, those in the P + P intervention compared to P-only showed greater improvement in anxiety over 12 months.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training is a mandatory competency, especially for healthcare professionals. However, the spread of COVID-19 caused a sharp decline in the number of participants on advanced life support training, thereby accelerating the diversification of educational methods. Gamification is an increasingly popular method of diversifying instruction, but its effectiveness remains controversial. To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification learning in advanced life support training. A cluster randomized controlled trial. A single advanced life support training center. Clinical nurses who are currently practicing in a hospital. A part of the existing advanced life support course was gamified using Kahoot! platform. Conventional learning and gamified learning were each conducted 11 times, and the level of knowledge after training was assessed. The assessment questions were categorized into advanced life support algorithms, teamwork, and cardiac arrest rhythms. A total of 267 were enrolled in the study, and 148 and 139 learners were assigned to CL and GL, respectively. There was no difference in post-training knowledge related to teamwork, and cardiac arrest rhythms between the conventional learning and gamified learning groups, but knowledge related to the advanced life support algorithm was low in the gamified learning group. Even if the learners are the same, advanced life support gamification training can lead to negative outcomes depending on the simplicity or goal of the training content. To improve the effectiveness of the training, various methods of gamification training should be applied depending on the goal and content of the training. • COVID-19 prompted a decline in ALS training, accelerating innovative methods. • Despite popularity, gamification's effectiveness in ALS training remains debated. • Conducted at an ALS center, evaluating gamified vs. conventional learning. • Tailored gamification methods are crucial for effective training.

AB  - We developed an innovative decision model combined with an integer programming model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of semi-automated early defibrillators (AEDs) for the Austrian Red Cross. To estimate the costs of this intervention per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, we calculated the acquisition and maintenance costs of defibrillators, training costs for emergency medical technicians, hospitalisation costs for patients with sudden cardiac arrest and future health care costs for surviving patients discharged from a hospital as well as the improved survival and quality-of-life benefits from the use of AEDs. AED programmes produced cost-effectiveness ratios of less than 55,000 Euro per QALY over a wide range of assumptions regarding uncertain parameters in the analysis. The AED costs for a full AED programme would amount to a maximum of approximately 10.3 million Euro for the Red Cross. The first step would be to equip ambulances in rural areas, then in urban areas and finally in Vienna.

AB  - To explore associations between four methods assessing long-term neurocognitive outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and early hypoxic-ischemic neuronal brain injury assessed by the biomarker serum neurofilament light (NFL), and to compare the agreement for the outcome methods. An explorative post-hoc study was conducted on survivor data from the international Target Temperature Management after Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest trial, investigating serum NFL sampled 48/72-hours post-arrest and neurocognitive outcome 6 months post-arrest. Among the long-term surviving participants (N = 457), serum NFL (n = 384) was associated to all outcome instruments, also when controlling for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Associations between NFL and the patient-reported Two Simple Questions (TSQ) were however attenuated when adjusting for vitality and mental health. NFL predicted results on the outcome instruments to varying degrees, with an excellent area under the curve for the clinician-report Cerebral Performance Category (CPC 1–2: 0.90). Most participants were classified as CPC 1 (79%). Outcome instrument correlations ranged from small (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]–TSQ) to strong (CPC–MMSE). The clinician-reported CPC was mostly related to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, but with a ceiling effect. These results may be useful when selecting methods and instruments for clinical follow-up models.

AB  - Background: Hospitals are best places to provide prevention and health promotion services along with healthcare services. This study aims to determine the effect of health promoting hospitals' standards on hospitals indicators in Fatemieh hospital, Shahroud, Iran. Methodology: This is a comparative study and was conducted in Fatemieh (case) and Khatamolanbia (control) hospitals in 1392. The standards of health promoting hospitals as an independent variable were established in Fatemieh hospital. Data related to indicators of leaving hospital with personal satisfaction, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and neonatal mortality were collected in both hospitals in second half of 1391 and first half of 1392. Data analysis was performed by Chi-square and Fisher tests. To analyze the data SPSS version 16 was used. Finally, the results were displayed as comparative tables. Results: The neonatal mortality rate in case hospital before and after the intervention was 7.28 and 14.03, while this rate in control hospital was respectively 5.26 and 10.83. The percentage of leaving hospital with personal satisfaction in case hospital before and after interventions was respectively 3.43% and 2.93% and success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this group was respectively 56.1% and 61.3%. There was no significant relation between establishment of standards of health promoting hospitals and indicators of leaving hospital with the personal satisfaction and neonatal mortality in Fatemieh hospital, while the significant relationship was observed between the success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the standards of health promoting hospital in this hospital (P=0/001). Conclusions: Initial results show that establishment of health promoting hospitals' standards in Fatemieh hospital have positive effects and leading to improvements of a number of indicators.

AB  - Objective. We undertook a survey of all practicing neonatologists in New England to determine their attitudes and practices regarding prenatal consultations for infants at the border of viability. Methods. A self-administered anonymous survey, mailed to every practicing neonatologist in the 6 Northeast states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, explored respondent attitudes and practices with respect to a hypothetical clinical scenario of a prenatal consultation for an infant at the border of viability. Results. Our final sample included 149 surveys from 175 eligible neonatologists, giving a response rate of 85%. Seventy-seven percent of respondents indicated that they thought neonatologists and parents should make the decision jointly to withhold resuscitation. Only 40% indicated that the decision actually is made by both parties. A majority of neonatologists (58%) saw their primary role during the prenatal consultation as providing factual information to the parents. Far fewer (27%) thought that their main role was to assist the parents in weighing the risks and benefits of various management options. A majority of respondents indicated that parental understanding of the mother's current medical situation (96%), desired parental role (77%), and parental prior experience with premature or handicapped children (64%) were frequently or always discussed. However, far fewer respondents reported frequently or always asking about parental interpretations of a "good quality of life" (42%), parental prior experiences with death or dying (30%), and parental religious or spiritual beliefs (25%). Short-term outcomes and complications such as the need for surfactant/ respiratory distress syndrome (89%) and the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (81%) were discussed more extensively than long-term outcomes such as motor delays or cerebral palsy (68%), cognitive delays or learning disabilities (63%), and chronic lung disease (61%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed 2 characteristics that were significant predictors of shared decision-making for the final decision regarding resuscitation in the delivery room for extremely premature infants, ie, believing that the main role of the neonatologist during prenatal consultations is to help parents weigh the risks and benefits of each resuscitation option (odds ratio: 4.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.6-10.9) and having >10 years of clinical experience (odds ratio: 3.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-8.8). Conclusions. Overall, our results showed that neonatologists are quite consistent in discussing clinical issues but quite varied in discussing social and ethical issues. If neonatologists are to perform complete prenatal consultations for infants at the border of viability as described by the latest American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, then they will be expected to address quality-of-life values more robustly, to explain long-term outcomes, and to incorporate parental preferences during their conversations. Potential barriers to shared decision-making have yet to be outlined.

AB  - Abstract. Predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims treated by Seattle and King County's prehospital emergency services were studied. Victims less than 20 years old were identified from hospital admissions and paramedic and medical examiners' reports. The proportion of fatal or severe outcomes in patients were compared with various risk factors. Of 135 patients, 45 died and 5 had severe neurologic impairment. A subset of 38 victims found in cardiopulmonary arrest had a 32% survival rate, with 67% of survivors unimpaired or only mildly impaired. The two risk factors that occurred most commonly in victims who died or were severely impaired were submersion duration greater than 9 minutes (28 patients) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration longer than 25 minutes (20 patients). Both factors were ascertained in the prehospital phase of care. Submersion duration was associated with a steadily increasing risk of severe or fatal outcomes: 10% risk (7/67) for 0 to 5 minutes, 56% risk (5/9) for 6 to 9 minutes, 88% risk (21/ 25) for 10 to 25 minutes, 100% risk (4/4) for >25 minutes. None of 20 children receiving >25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation escaped death or severe neurologic impairment. Our rates for saving all victims, particularly victims in cardiopulmonary arrest, are considerably higher than has been reported before for children. Prompt prehospital advanced cardiac life support is the most effective means of medical intervention for the pediatric submersion victim. Prehospital information provided the most valuable predictors of outcome.

AB  - Background: Dementia is a leading cause of death for older adults and is more common among persons from racial/ethnic minoritized groups, who also tend to experience more intensive end‐of‐life care. This retrospective cohort study compared end‐of‐life care in persons with and without dementia and identified dementia's moderating effects on the relationship between race/ethnicity and end‐of‐life care. Methods: Administrative claims data for 463,590 Medicare fee‐for‐service decedents from 2016 to 2018 were analyzed. Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses examined the association of dementia with 5 intensive and 2 quality of life‐focused measures. Intensity measures included hospital admission, ICU admission, receipt of any of 5 intensive procedures (CPR, mechanical ventilation, intubation, dialysis initiation, and feeding tube insertion), hospital death, and Medicare expenditures (last 30 days of life). Quality of life measures included timely hospice care (>3 days before death) and days at home (last 6 months of life). Models were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Results: 54% of Medicare decedents were female, 85% non‐Hispanic White, 8% non‐Hispanic Black, and 4% Hispanic. Overall, 51% had a dementia diagnosis claim. In adjusted models, decedents with dementia had 16%–29% lower odds of receiving intensive services (AOR hospital death: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.70–0.72; AOR hospital admission: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.83–0.86). Patients with dementia had 45% higher odds of receiving timely hospice (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.42–1.47), but spent 0.74 fewer days at home (adjusted mean: −0.74, 95% CI: (−0.98)–(−0.49)). Compared to non‐Hispanic White individuals, persons from racial/ethnic minoritized groups were more likely to receive intensive services. This effect was more pronounced among persons with dementia. Conclusions: Although overall dementia was associated with fewer intensive services near death, beneficiaries from racial/ethnic groups minoritized with dementia experienced more intensive service use. Particular attention is needed to ensure care aligns with the needs and preferences of persons with dementia and from racial/ethnic minoritized groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the change over time of attitudes about withdrawal of care from hopelessly ill children among a cohort of pediatric residents. DESIGN. Prospective data collection via surveys. SETTING. A pediatric residency program in a children's hospital. SUBJECTS. Pediatric residents beginning training in 1987 and 1988; 29 residents completed the study. INTERVENTIONS. Study participants completed a structured case-oriented questionnaire yearly from June 1988 through the completion of their residency training. The withholding of vasoactive agents or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the withdrawal of intravenous fluids, nutrition, or mechanical ventilation were the specific therapeutic options presented for a patient in a persistent vegetative state. The effects of time (further training) and parental wishes on resident decisions were assessed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS. No resident wanted to provide intensive care to a child in a persistent vegetative state who was in respiratory failure; all residents would withhold vasoactive agents and CPR from such a child. At the conclusion of training, most (97%) would withdraw mechanical ventilation. A minority would withdraw intravenous (IV) fluids (41%) or nutrition (35%). Residents became more willing to withdraw IV fluids from these patients (0/16 vs 6/16; P = .03) and to withhold or withdraw therapies in general (P = .03) over the course of their training. All of this change occurred over the first year of training. Parental wishes altered treatment plans for these patients significantly, both when parents desired additional treatment (P < .0001), and when parents wanted treatment stopped (P = .04). The residents' level of training had no effect on responses to parents' therapeutic requests. CONCLUSION. Although exposure to level of care issues occurs throughout pediatric residency training, almost all changes in trainees' attitudes occur during the first year. Efforts to promote effective learning and coping should be concentrated in this period.

AB  - This article reports that a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, the meconium aspiration syndrome is the result of perinatal stress induced by reflex evacuation of meconium, followed by aspiration of the meconium-containing amniotic fluid. Preventive and therapeutic approaches to the syndrome include fetal monitoring of the high risk pregnancy to detect possible asphyxia early; appropriate resuscitation in the delivery room; and intensive neonatal care implemented by chest physiotherapy, positive end-expiratory pressure and mechanical ventilation. For the past 15 years, laryngoscopy and incubation, and direct tracheal suctioning through the endotracheal tube promptly after birth have been recommended for newborns with meconium staining. Infants treated with this method have minimal morbidity and almost never succumb. Another method, with vertex presentations, is to suction the oral pharynx as soon as the head presents and before delivery is completed. Between January 1972 and August 1974, all newborn infants born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and observed in the Intensive Care Nursery were managed with the same delivery room protocol.

AB  - Near fatal asthma is a life-threatening disorder that requires mechanical ventilation. Near fatal asthma and COPD with sudden cardiac arrest can worsen the outcomes. Previous studies demonstrated that ECMO is a live-saving measure for near fatal asthma that does not respond to traditional treatment. A patient with near fatal asthma (NFA) and COPD presented with high airway resistance, life-threatening acidemia and severe hypoxemia that failed to respond to conventional therapy. His hospital course was complicated by sudden cardiac arrest when preparing to initiate V-V mode extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The mode immediately changed from V-V to V-A, then to V-AV and finally to V-V mode in order to improve cardiac function and promote recovery of lung function. On the sixth day, ECMO was removed and on the ninth day, he was extubated and transferred to the ward. Finally, the patient was discharged home on the nineteenth day after admission to be followed up in the pulmonary clinic. The early application of ECMO and mode changing plausibly resulted in dramatic improvement in gas exchange and restoration of cardiac function. This case illustrates the critical role of ECMO mode changing as salvage therapy in NFA and COPD with sudden cardiac arrest.

AB  - Race and inequalities in health and health services are addressed in 3 papers in this issue. Escarce et al., in an analysis of Medicare data detailing 32 frequently used procedures and tests, report that whites are more likely than blacks to receive 23 of the 32 services analyzed. Whites received the benefits of advanced technology and newer services significantly more often. Lieu et al. found that Hispanic and black adolescents have less insurance coverage and make fewer visits to doctors than whites, despite having worse health status. Cowie at al. found that sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more frequently in blacks than in whites. Resuscitation and survival until hospital discharge were poorer for blacks. These reports clearly show that equitable health care for all has yet to be achieved.

About the size of a laptop, an AED instructs users through voice and visual prompts, but works best in conjunction with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The American Heart Association estimates that half of all people who collapse from sudden cardiac arrest survive when CPR and defibrillation are performed within the first five minutes.

AB  - Background: Palliative care has been widely implemented in clinical practice for patients with cancer but is not routinely provided to people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Aim: The study aims were to compare palliative care services, medications, life-sustaining interventions, place of death, symptom burden and health-related quality of life among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer populations. Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42019139425). Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched for studies comparing palliative care, symptom burden or health-related quality of life among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer or populations with both conditions. Quality scores were assigned using the QualSyst tool. Results: Nineteen studies were included. There was significant heterogeneity in study design and sample size. A random effects meta-analysis (n = 3–7) determined that people with lung cancer had higher odds of receiving hospital (odds ratio: 9.95, 95% confidence interval: 6.37–15.55, p < 0.001) or home-based palliative care (8.79, 6.76–11.43, p < 0.001), opioids (4.76, 1.87–12.11, p = 0.001), sedatives (2.03, 1.78–2.32, p < 0.001) and dying at home (1.47, 1.14–1.89, p = 0.003) compared to people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People with lung cancer had lower odds of receiving invasive ventilation (0.26, 0.22–0.32, p < 0.001), non-invasive ventilation (0.63, 0.44–0.89, p = 0.009), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (0.29, 0.18–0.47, p < 0.001) or dying at a nursing home/long-term care facility (0.32, 0.16–0.64, p < 0.001) than people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Symptom burden and health-related quality of life were relatively similar between the two populations. Conclusion: People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receive less palliative measures at the end of life compared to people with lung cancer, despite a relatively similar symptom profile.

AB  - Team performance, communication and leadership enhance the quality and effectiveness of interprofessional collaborations between midwifery students and anaesthetists in obstetric emergencies. The realistic setting of hybrid simulation provides practice for interprofessional competencies in a stressful environment without putting women at risk during childbirth. We investigated how full-scale interprofessional hybrid simulation affects the attitudes towards interprofessionalism of final year midwife students. Two-centre prospective cohort study. Bern Simulation and CPR Centre of the Department of Anaesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the Bern University Hospital (Bern, Switzerland) and Zürich University of Applied Sciences. Final year midwife students from Bern University of Applied Sciences and Zürich University of Applied Sciences, both from the German-speaking Switzerland. One cohort was exposed to hybrid simulation and the other served as control. The simulation group filled in the German Interprofessional Attitude Scale (G-IPAS) before and after simulation, and then again three months later. The control group filled in two sets of G-IPAS questionnaires three months apart. The total G-IPAS score increased significantly towards a more positive interprofessional attitude directly after the hybrid simulation. This increase was not sustained over the observation period of three months, although the score remained significantly higher than the score of the cohort without simulation. A novel interprofessional hybrid simulation for obstetric emergencies for midwifery students promoted improved attitudes towards interprofessionalism immediately after simulation. These attitudes were improved compared to a control cohort without simulation, and the difference between the two cohorts remained three months after simulation. Future studies might focus on whether improved interprofessional attitudes lead to better healthcare and safety for women and children during childbirth.

AB  - Background: <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emitted tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising yet unexplored functional neuroimaging tool in the study and prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) after cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. The present study aimed to correlate clinical data and FDG-PET scans for both analysis and prognostic use. Methods: 24 patients from an intensive rehabilitation ward were retrospectively evaluated. Data collected included age, gender, cause of anoxic event, length of stay in acute and rehabilitation units, discharge destination, and evaluation at admission and discharge using three clinical scales to assess cognitive function, independence and disability. Subjects were identified as good and bad performers on the basis of quantitative analysis of FDG-PET scans with the Cortex ID software. The relation between glucose uptake reduction and neurological outcome was evaluated. Results: good and bad performers presented no statistically significant difference regarding demographical data and in-hospital length of stay. The two categories significantly differed for impairment and disability levels both at admission and at discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Conclusions: FDG-PET considerably facilitates the early identification of patients with HIE who will have poor neurological outcome and could inform planning for their rehabilitation and care.

AB  - Background and purpose: Post‐hypoxic movement disorders and chronic post‐hypoxic myoclonus are rare complications after cardiac arrest in adults. Our study investigates the clinical spectrum, neuroimaging results, therapy and prognosis of these debilitating post‐hypoxic sequelae. Methods: This retrospective study included 72 patients from the neurological intensive care unit at a university hospital, who were diagnosed with hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest between January 2007 and September 2018. Clinical records were screened for occurrence of post‐hypoxic movement disorders and chronic post‐hypoxic myoclonus. Affected patients were further analysed for applied neuroprognostic tests, administered therapy and treatment response, and the outcome of these movement disorders and neurological function. Results: Nineteen out of 72 screened patients exhibited post‐hypoxic motor symptoms. Basal ganglia injury was the most likely neuroanatomical correlate of movement disorders as indicated by T1 hyperintensities and hypometabolism of this region in magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography computed tomography. Levomepromazine and intrathecal baclofen showed first promising and mostly prompt responses to control these post‐hypoxic movement disorders and even hyperkinetic storms. In contrast, chronic post‐hypoxic myoclonus best responded to co‐application of clonazepam, levetiracetam and primidone. Remission rates of post‐hypoxic movement disorders and chronic post‐hypoxic myoclonus were 58% and 50%, respectively. Affected patients seemed to present a rather good recovery of cognitive functions in contrast to the often more severe physical deficits. Conclusions: Post‐hypoxic movement disorders associated with pronounced basal ganglia dysfunction might be efficiently controlled by levomepromazine or intrathecal baclofen. Their occurrence might be an indicator for a more unfavourable, but often not devastating, neurological outcome.

AB  - It seems to be taken as self evident in health care and other organisations that teams and teamwork are beneficial, often based on little evidence. This paper uses data from a small study of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a trust hospital to reflect upon teamwork in a situation which is stressful, requires prompt, brief action and has clear-cut notions of success and failure. GPR teams resemble what Sundstrom et al. (1990) term action and negotiation teams; their examples include sports teams, combat units and surgery teams. However, although the GPR 'team' in this setting had to perform together, they generally did not work together nor practice their skills together, and it is argued that there may be misuse of the concept of teamwork in this and similar instances in health care.

AB  - A 15-month old boy was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) cyanotic, unresponsive, apneic, pulseless, with fixed, dilated pupils and a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3/15. Prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated and cardiac function was resumed after 10 minutes. The boy was intubated but could not be ventilated because of a thick, viscous secretion obstructing the trachea and causing total airway obstruction. Bronchoscopy revealed laryngotracheitis as the reason for airway obstruction. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed diffuse edema and ischemic brain injury, which were considered responsible for the boy's comatose situation. Clinical status remained unchanged for 11 days, after which the boy was transported to another hospital. In children presenting with upper airway obstructing syndromes, not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of bacterial tracheitis should be considered and the child should be monitored in a pediatric intensive care unit.

AB  - Background and purpose Established prognostication markers, such as clinical findings, electroencephalography ( EEG) and biochemical markers, used by clinicians to predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest ( CA) are altered under therapeutic hypothermia ( TH) conditions and their validity remains uncertain. Methods MEDLINE and Embase were searched for evidence on the current standards for neurological outcome prediction for out-of-hospital CA patients treated with TH and the validity of a wide range of prognostication markers. Relevant studies that suggested one or several established biomarkers and multimodal approaches for prognostication are included and reviewed. Results Whilst the prognostic accuracy of various tests after TH has been questioned, pupillary light reflexes and somatosensory evoked potentials are still strongly associated with negative outcome for early prognostication. Increasingly, EEG background activity has also been identified as a valid predictor for outcome after 72 h after CA and a preferred prognostic method in clinical settings. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, can identify functional and structural brain injury but are not readily available at the patient's bedside because of limited availability and high costs. Conclusions A multimodal algorithm composed of neurological examination, EEG-based quantitative testing and somatosensory evoked potentials, in conjunction with newer magnetic resonance imaging sequences, if available, holds promise for accurate prognostication in CA patients treated with TH. In order to avoid premature withdrawal of care, prognostication should be performed more than 72 h after CA.

AB  - Despite dramatic improvement in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other techniques for cardiac arrest (CA), the majority of survivors continue to show signs of decreased memory or executive cognitive function. Such memory impairment may be due to hippocampal CA1 neuronal death, which is delayed by several days after CA/CPR. Classical microgliosis in the CA1 region may contribute to neuronal death, yet the role of a key activation receptor Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) has not been previously investigated for such neuronal death after CA/CPR. We show that (+)-naltrexone was neuroprotective after CA/CPR. TLR4 blockade was associated with decreased expression of markers for microglial/macrophage activation and T cell and B cell infiltration, as well as decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Notably, IL-10 expression was elevated in response to CA/CPR, but was not attenuated by (+)-naltrexone, suggesting that the local monocyte/microglial phenotype had shifted towards alternative activation. This was confirmed by elevated expression of Arginase-1, and decreased expression of NFκB p65 subunit. Thus, (+)-naltrexone and other TLR4 antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate the substantial burden of memory or executive cognitive function impairment after CA/CPR.

AB  - Objective: This study observed the results of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) under different types of models of pre-hospital emergency on pre-hospital sudden death in patients. Methods: Literature concerning 6504 pre-hospital emergency CPR cases were collected and analysed. Results: The success rate of pre-hospital rescue using CPR was highest in the Independent-based Model. The success rate of pre-hospital rescue using CPR in the Command-based Model was higher than the Pre-hospital-based Model, showing no statistically significant difference. Conclusions: The pre-hospital first aid standardization in China is a pressing problem, and the research in this field cannot come to a convincing conclusion. More efforts should be done to promote the development of the Utstein-Style. Training of professional staff for pre-hospital first aid is the prerequisite condition for enhancing the success rate of pre-hospital first aid by CPR for patients.

AB  - Background: People with advanced heart failure have repeated hospital admissions. Advance care planning can support patient preferences, but studies in people with heart failure have not been assessed. Aim: To evaluate the literature regarding advance care planning in heart failure. Design: Systematic review and narrative analysis (PROSPERO CRD42017059190). Data sources: Electronic databases were searched (1990 to 23 March 2017): MEDLINE(R), Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Scopus. Four journals were hand searched. Two independent researchers screened against eligibility criteria. One reviewer extracted all data and a sample by a second. Quality was assessed by Cochrane Risk of Bias or the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tool for Cohort Studies. Results: Out of the 1713 articles, 8 were included representing 14,357 participants from in/outpatient settings from five countries. Two randomised controlled trials and one observational study assessed planning as part of a specialist palliative care intervention; one randomised controlled trial assessed planning in addition to usual cardiology care; one randomised controlled trial and one observational study assessed planning in an integrated cardiology–palliative care model; one observational study assessed evidence of planning (advance directive) as part of usual care and one observational study was a secondary analysis of trial participants coded Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Advance care planning: (1) reduced hospitalisation (5/7 studies); (2) increased referral/use of palliative services (4/4 studies); and (3) supported deaths in the patient-preferred place (2/2 studies). Conclusion: Advance care planning as part of specialist palliative care reduces hospitalisation. Preliminary studies of planning integrated into generic care, accessing specialist palliative care support if needed, are promising.

AB  - Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is one the most commonly performed procedures in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, success rate of CPR vary widely from 3.1% to 16.5%. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of all cardiac arrests prompting CPR in our ICU for a period of 12 months. Data retrieved from ICU records included patients demographic characteristics, diagnosis at admission, length of ICU stay, time and day of cardiac arrest, cardiac rhythm, duration of CPR and outcome of CPR. Results: A total of 156 CPRs were performed within the study period with 8.3% success rate. Male:female ratio was 1.2:1. Indications for ICU admission, length of stay in ICU, time and day of cardiac and duration of CPR were found to be determinants of outcome. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to constitute a cardiac arrest team (CAT) which will be available at all times for improved successful outcome after cardiac arrest in our ICU.

AB  - Background: Palliative care services were not available in nursing homes in Singapore. Project CARE (Care At the end-of-life for Residents in homes for the Elderly) was a pilot programme that aimed to promote advance care planning and improve end-of-life care in nursing homes. Aim: We aimed to examine end-of-life care preferences among nursing home residents, and identify factors associated with preference for medical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and place of death. Design and setting/participants: A cross-sectional study using data from advance care planning discussions was conducted from September 2009 to April 2012 across seven nursing homes. The advance care planning discussion was conducted with the resident (with a prognosis of 6 months or 1 year), their families and staff from the nursing home and hospital. Results: A total of 600 residents and their families completed the advance care planning discussion. Majority (93.2%) preferred not to proceed with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 52.3% opted for limited additional intervention at the nursing home with escalation to the hospital if necessary and 77.0% preferred to die at the nursing home. Residents 85+ years (relative risk ratio: 3.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.13–9.93, p = 0.030) were more likely to prefer medical intervention at the nursing home only. No associations were found with the preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Residents who were single, or who were Christians or Catholics (adjusted odds ratio: 2.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.04–4.19, p = 0.039), were more likely to prefer to die at the nursing home. Conclusion: Preferences for medical interventions in nursing homes provide support to extend palliative care services to nursing homes, which may benefit residents who are older, single, or Christians or Catholics.

AB  - Background There is no national reporting system for marathon sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and death in the US. Objective This study assessed the prevalence of SCA and death during USA marathons to assist with emergency planning at events. Design/Setting/Participants A retrospective, web-based survey to assess details of SCA and death was sent out to 400 US marathon directors in the autumn of 2009 and summer of 2010. Results 78/400 (19%) of marathons responded. Participants ranged from 30 to 30 000 runners with a total of 1 411 482 runners from 1976 through 2009. There were 31 SCA's including 11 deaths. The prevalence of SCA was 1 in 45 531, and 1 in 128 316 runners died. 30/31 runners with SCA were male with an average age of 46.7 years (range 19–82). Runners collapsed at the finish line (6), in the final 2 miles (6), from miles 17–23 (6), and before mile 16 (10), and three of the runner's locations were unknown. An automated external defibrillator (AED) was used in 20 cases, not used in two cases, and unknown in nine cases. The 11 non-survivors had eight non-shockable rhythms, and 11 of the 20 survivors had shockable rhythms treated with an AED. The autopsy diagnoses were coronary artery disease (8) and one runner died of congenital heart disease complications. Two causes of death were not known. Conclusion SCA occurs in approximately 1 in 45 000 marathon runners, is more common in middle to late aged males, and can occur anywhere along the race course with the majority of cases in the final 10 miles. Prompt resuscitation including use of an AED provides a high survival rate for the victims of SCA. Emergency planning with availability of AED's throughout the race course is recommended.

AB  - Background. The effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in psychosis is increasingly reported in terms of reductions in different symptom dimensions. It remains unclear, however, to what degree such symptomatic changes are accompanied by improvement in other measures such as service use, quality of life, and needs for care. Methods. A sample of 708 patients with chronic psychotic illness was assessed on three occasions over 2 years (baseline, year 1 and year 2). A multilevel analysis was conducted to examine to what degree reduction in psychopathological scores derived from factor analysis of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), was associated with improvement in service use, disability, subjective outcomes and measures of self-harm. Results. Reduction in positive, negative, depressive and manic symptoms over the study period were all independently associated with lessening of social disability. Reduction in negative symptoms, and to a lesser extent in positive and manic symptoms, was associated with less time in hospital and more time living independently, whereas changes in positive and manic symptoms resulted in fewer admissions. Subjective outcomes such as improvement in quality of life, perceived needs for care and dissatisfaction with services showed the strongest associations with reduction in depressive symptoms. Reduction in positive symptoms was associated with decreased likelihood of parasuicide. Results did not differ according to diagnostic category. Conclusion. The findings suggest that changes in distinct psychopathological dimensions independently and differentially influence outcome. Therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of more than one dimension are likely to have more widespread effects.

AB  - Background. The usefulness of any diagnostic scheme is directly related to its ability to provide clinically useful information on need for care. In this study, the clinical usefulness of dimensional and categorical representations of psychotic psychopathology were compared. Method. A total of 706 patients aged 1665 years with chronic psychosis were recruited. Psychopathology was measured with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Lifetime RDC, DSM-III-R, and ICD-10 diagnoses and ratings of lifetime psychopathology were made using OPCRIT. Other clinical measures included: (i) need for care; (ii) quality of life; (iii) social disability; (iv) satisfaction with services; (v) abnormal movements; (vi) brief neuropsychological screen; and (vii) over the last 2 years  illness course, symptom severity, employment, medication use, self-harm, time in hospital and living independently. Results. Principal component factor analysis of the 65 CPRS items on cross-sectional psychopathology yielded four dimensions of positive, negative, depressive and manic symptoms. Regression models comparing the relative contributions of dimensional and categorical representations of psychopathology with clinical measures consistently indicated strong and significant effects of psychopathological dimensions over and above any effect of their categorical counterparts, whereas the reverse did not hold. The effect of psychopathological dimensions was mostly cumulative: high ratings on more than one dimension increased the contribution to the clinical measures in a dose-response fashion. Similar results were obtained with psychopathological dimensions derived from lifetime psychopathology ratings using the OCCPI. Conclusions. A dimensional approach towards classification of psychotic illness offers important clinical advantages.

AB  - Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy do not experience satisfactory seizure control with current front-line antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy and often require polytherapy. The potential usefulness of AED combinations, in terms of efficacy and adverse effects, is therefore of major importance. The present study sought to identify potentially useful AED combinations with levetiracetam (LEV), recently introduced as an effective AED for refractory partial seizures. The mouse maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizure model was investigated with regard to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin, phenobarbital (PB), valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate (TPM), and oxcarbazepine (OXC), administered singly and in combination with LEV. Acute adverse effects were ascertained by use of the chimney test, evaluating motor performance, and the passive avoidance task, assessing long-term memory. Brain AED concentrations were determined to ascertain any pharmacokinetic contribution to the observed antiseizure effect. LEV in combination with TPM exerted supraadditive (synergistic) interactions in the MES test. Likewise, the combinations of LEV with CBZ and OXC were supraadditive in this test. In contrast, all other LEV/AED combinations displayed additivity. Furthermore, none of the investigated combinations altered motor performance and long-term memory. LEV brain concentrations were unaffected by concomitant AED administration, and LEV had no significant effect on brain concentrations of concomitant AEDs. These preclinical data would suggest that LEV in combination with TPM is associated with beneficial anticonvulsant pharmacodynamic interactions. Similar, but less profound effects were seen with OXC and CBZ. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a serious concern for epilepsy patients and their families. DBA/2 mice may be a useful animal model of SUDEP. This strain of mouse inherits susceptibility to sound-induced seizures, and most DBA/2 mice stop breathing immediately after seizure. Breathing difficulties also are implicated in some cases of human SUDEP. Normal breathing is controlled partly by a brain neurochemical called serotonin. We evaluated whether drugs that either increase or decrease the effect of serotonin can change whether these mice stop breathing after seizures. Although most DBA/2 mice (75%) stopped breathing after seizure, nearly 99% survived, if promptly resuscitated. DBA/2 mice that stopped breathing and were resuscitated were then given a drug that increases serotonin, called fluoxetine. Thirty minutes after fluoxetine injection (15–25 mg/kg), most mice no longer stopped breathing after seizure, and the highest dose also reduced seizure severity. These effects were gone 72 h after drug administration. Ten percent of untreated DBA/2 mice do not stop breathing after seizure, and these mice were given a drug that blocks serotonin, called cyproheptadine. Thirty minutes after injection of cyproheptadine (1–2 mg/kg), most of these mice stopped breathing after seizure and needed resuscitation. This effect was gone 72 h after drug administration. These findings show that fluoxetine prevented breathing cessation after seizures in most DBA/2 mice, suggesting that this drug, which is widely used to treat depression, should be tested for SUDEP prevention in patients likely to show SUDEP. The findings also suggest that cyproheptadine should be avoided in this patient population. Electrical stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is receiving increased attention and interest as a potentially novel means of controlling intractable epilepsy and has entered human clinical trials. All animal data supporting the anticonvulsant benefit of ANT stimulation, however, have been obtained from acute chemoconvulsant models of epilepsy rather than models of chronic epilepsy with spontaneous seizures. It is unknown whether ANT stimulation is effective in models of chronic epilepsy. To address this question, the effects of bilateral ANT stimulation were evaluated in rats with chronic epilepsy after acute status epilepticus (SE) produced by systemic kainic acid (KA) administration. In the course of this study, it was necessary to monitor the evolution of epilepsy after KA SE by using continuous video-EEG recordings. After KA SE, most rats have two to eight seizures per day, and the average seizure rate increases over time, doubling over the course of 14 weeks. Behavioral seizure severity, after the initial development of epilepsy, remains stable. ANT stimulation consistently exacerbated seizure frequency. The effects of stimulation were specific to stimulation applied to the ANT, because stimulation applied to electrodes placed outside the ANT did not significantly worsen seizure frequency. Experimental models are suitable for studying mechanisms involved in the propagation and generalization of seizure activity in the convulsive and nonconvulsive components of epilepsy. In the present study, we compared the widely used model of temporal lobe epilepsy called amygdala kindling in normal rats and in WAG/Rij rats, a model of absence epilepsy. Electrodes were implanted into the amygdala of rats for stimulation and recording and into the cortex for recording. After a recovery period, the animals were stimulated electrically via the electrodes. EEG was recorded to analyze spike-and-wave discharges, which characterize absence epilepsy, and afterdischarge durations, which characterize the kindling process. The seizure severity was evaluated by using Racine's five-stage scale. All nonepileptic control animals and four of seven WAG/Rij animals reached a stage 5, generalized convulsive seizure state (the most intense seizure stage), whereas three animals failed and stayed at stage 2 after application of 30 stimulations. Interestingly, kindling-resistant WAG/Rij rats demonstrated a significantly longer duration of spike-and-wave discharges on the first day of the experiment before kindling stimulation than did the kindled WAG/Rij animals. Additionally, the cumulative total duration and the number of spike-and-wave discharges after the kindling stimulation were statistically increased compared with spike-and-wave discharges before kindling stimulation. The results of our study demonstrate that the progress of amygdala kindling is changed in rats with genetic absence epilepsy, perhaps as a consequence of the hundreds of daily spike-and-wave discharges. Electrical amygdala kindling in the rat, in which repeated small electrical stimulations are applied to the brain, resulting in a progressive and permanent change in the epileptic threshold, is one of the most widely studied animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the processes underlying the development of epilepsy in this model remain incompletely understood. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique that allows sequential visualization of structural and functional changes occurring in live animals. This makes it possible to uncover the contribution of such changes to the development of epilepsy. Here we report, for the first time, serial MR image acquisitions during the development of epilepsy in this model of TLE. We demonstrated MR signal changes (reflecting increased water content) in restricted parts of the hippocampus, an area of the brain particularly vulnerable to epileptic insults. This signal change occurred without a change in volume of the structure, suggesting that it may occur independent of cell loss in this region. This is important, given that cell loss had previously been proposed to be critically important for the development of TLE. This study validates a method for acquiring serial MRIs during kindling in the rat, and with the detection of changes in restricted regions of the hippocampus. These regions may be important sites for the neurobiologic changes that contribute to the development of epilepsy in this model and in human TLE. Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) channels play major roles in neuronal activity. This is well exemplified by a genetic form of epilepsy called benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNCs), which is caused by a K<sup>+</sup> channel malfunction produced by mutations in the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes. Mutations are carried throughout the whole life, but BFNC is expressed only in neonates. Here we attempted to develop an in vitro model to study this disease. Knowing that channels formed by mutated KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits have a reduced function, we tested whether pharmacologic reduction of the native channels, with their specific blocker linopirdine, induces seizure-like activity in brain slices. We also tested whether differences existed in the effects of linopirdine throughout postnatal ages, as occurs for clinical manifestations of BFNC. Using brain slices obtained from animals at different ages, we observed that linopirdine induced seizure-like activity only in slices from neonatal rats. In contrast, on slices from adult rats, linopirdine induced erratic abnormal activity. Our results show that pharmacologic blockade of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels induces seizure-like activity with an age pattern that closely resembles the developmental characteristics of BFNC. We believe this could be an in vitro model that can be used to study the cellular mechanisms of developing epilepsy and the developmental pattern of BFNCs, as well as to develop some therapeutic strategies. Genetically epileptic model rats of the Ihara epileptic rat (IER/F) substrain have neuropathologic abnormalities and develop generalized convulsive seizures when they reach approximately age 5 months. Structural abnormalities are centered in the hippocampus, which is the most seizure-prone part of brain, and also a part involved in memory in rats of positions in space. Therefore we expected to observe spatial cognitive deficits in the model rats. The present study aimed to evaluate learning ability of the F substrain of IER. To determine whether deficits are caused by inborn structural brain abnormalities or by repeated generalized convulsions, we tested nine 6- to 12-week-old IER/F rats that had not yet experienced seizures (experiment 1) and nine 7- to 9-month-old IER/F rats that had repeatedly experienced seizures (experiment 2) with identical tasks. These tasks comprised an open field test to assess spontaneous behaviors and the Morris water maze place and cue tasks to assess spatial cognition and learning abilities. Both groups of IER/Fs showed behaviors that were different from those of normal rats in the open field test. Extensive learning impairments were seen in both the place task, which requires spatial cognition, and the cue task, which does not require spatial cognition but requires simple association learning. Their impaired performance of the cue task indicates that their deficiency was not limited to spatial cognition. These results suggested that structural abnormalities of brain cells in the hippocampus may be more responsible for the severe learning deficits of IER/Fs than are the seizures themselves.

AB  - PROMINENT racehorse owner Dai Walters and trainer Sam Thomas have been injured in a terrifying helicopter crash. Successful businessman Walters, who was largely responsible for the creation of Ffos Las racecourse and remains honorary chairman at the South Wales venue, was one of five people involved in the incident which occurred in woods in Llanelidan, near Ruthin, Denbighshire. They were returning home from a shoot when the helicopter came down in high winds and heavy rain. Walters was reported to have suffered serious injuries and was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital near Rhyl for treatment. Thomas, who was allowed to return home with minor injuries, reportedly assisted in carrying Walters from the wreckage before a local runner administered CPR to the 76-year-old millionaire. Sophie Vaughan-Evans, 30, told MailOnline: 'My husband was out jogging when the chopper crashed. One of the gamekeepers flagged him down and asked if he knew first aid. Luckily my husband was ex-forces so he knew what to do. The elderly trainer was unconscious and my husband did CPR and brought him round. He was then talking so seemed to be all right.

AB  - Case Diagnosis: Lance-Adams syndrome. Case Description: A 31-year old male sustained a cardiopulmonary arrest due to a heroin overdose. He recovered a pulse shortly after resuscitation. While in the hospital, he remained unresponsive and developed a myoclonus. Head imaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) were consistent with hypoxic encephalopathy. He was discharged to hospice on hospital day 12. After 1 week in hospice, he regained consciousness. He was ultimately admitted to rehabilitation 33 days after cardiopulmonary arrest. On examination, he exhibited severe myoclonic jerks of his limbs and face, which were triggered by touch, sound, emotion, and voluntary action. His myoclonus disappeared during sleep and at rest. Despite normal muscle strength, he was entirely dependent for activities of daily living. Discussions: While in rehabilitation, he was clinically diagnosed with Lance-Adams syndrome. Initial treatment with valproic acid, lacosamide, and levetiracetam produced a marginal response. The addition of clonazepam and optimization of levetiracetam reduced his myoclonus so he could safely participate in therapies. He underwent 5 weeks of rehabilitation with improvement in transfers and ambulation. At discharge, he ambulated 200 feet with a 20-pound weighted walker. He relapsed after an interim wean of levetiracetam. At 2-month follow up, he was maintained on valproic acid, levetiracetam, and clonazepam, and ambulated 1700 feet with a 5-pound weighted walker. Conclusions: Survivors of cardiopulmonary arrest can develop an action myoclonus associated with anoxic brain injury called Lance-Adams syndrome. Physiatrists should be aware of this rare movement disorder since recognition is important to preclude inappropriate early withdrawal of medical treatment and to initiate early rehabilitative services. Clinical diagnosis and aggressive treatment with anti-epileptics and benzodiazepines were essential for our patient's participation in rehabilitation and positive functional outcome. Lance-Adams syndrome may result in significant impairments, but antiepileptic and benzodiazepine drug treatment combined with comprehensive rehabilitation can lead to an overall improved quality of life.

AB  - This article focuses on the need for deploying a workplace defibrillation program, that can protect several workers dying due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) every year while working, in the U.S. Studies show that 95 percent of SCA victims die before reaching the hospital. The solution is through the prompt delivery of a defibrillation shock, an electrical pulse through the heart-delivered by an automated external defibrillator, which restores a normal heart rhythm. The reason behind companies implementing these measures is quite obvious, as they need to protect all employees and customers from health dangers and honor their commitment that their employees and customers are their most valuable assets. INSET: HOW MANY? WHERE?.

AB  - Background: Bioethicists and professional associations give specific recommendations for discussing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Objective: To determine whether attending hospitalist physicians’ discussions meet these recommendations. Design: Cross-sectional observational study on the medical services at two hospitals within a university system between August 2008 and March 2009. Participants: Attending hospitalist physicians and patients who were able to communicate verbally about their medical care. Main Measures: We identified code status discussions in audio-recorded admission encounters via physician survey and review of encounter transcripts. A quantitative content analysis was performed to determine whether discussions included elements recommended by bioethicists and professional associations. Two coders independently coded all discussions; Cohen’s kappa was 0.64–1 for all reported elements. Key Results: Audio-recordings of 80 patients’ admission encounters with 27 physicians were obtained. Eleven physicians discussed code status in 19 encounters. Discussions were more frequent in seriously ill patients (OR 4, 95% CI 1.2–14.6), yet 66% of seriously ill patients had no discussion. The median length of the code status discussions was 1 min (range 0.2–8.2). Prognosis was discussed with code status in only one of the encounters. Discussions of patients’ preferences focused on the use of life-sustaining interventions as opposed to larger life goals. Descriptions of CPR as an intervention used medical jargon, and the indication for CPR was framed in general, as opposed to patient-specific scenarios. No physician quantitatively estimated the outcome of or provided a recommendation about the use of CPR. Conclusion: Code status was not discussed with many seriously ill patients. Discussions were brief, and did not include elements that bioethicists and professional associations recommend to promote patient autonomy. Local and national guidelines, research, and clinical practice changes are needed to clarify and systematize with whom and how CPR is discussed at hospital admission.

AB  - Introduction: Microparticles are elevated in patients after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and may play a role in the development of endothelial dysfunction seen in post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), a life threatening disease with high mortality. To identify mechanisms of endothelial activation and to develop novel approaches in the therapy of PCAS, the impact of selenium, a trace element with antioxidative properties, was characterized in endothelial dysfunction induced by microparticles of resuscitated patients. Additionally, course of plasma selenium levels was characterized in the first 72 hours post-CPR. Methods: Endothelial cells were exposed to microparticles isolated of the peripheral blood of resuscitated patients, and leukocyte-endothelial interaction was measured by dynamic adhesion assay. Expression of adhesion molecules was assessed by immunoblotting and flow chamber. Blood samples were drawn 24, 48 and 72 hours after CPR for determination of plasma selenium levels in 77 resuscitated patients; these were compared to 50 healthy subjects and 50 patients with stable cardiac disease and correlated with severity of illness and outcome. Results: Microparticles of resuscitated patients enhance monocyte-endothelial interaction by up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Selenium administration diminished ICAM-1 and VCAM-1-mediated monocyte adhesion induced by microparticles of resuscitated patients, suggesting that selenium has anti-inflammatory effects after CPR. Lowered selenium plasma levels were observed in resuscitated patients compared to controls and selenium levels immediately and 24 hours after CPR, inversely correlated with clinical course and outcome after resuscitation. Conclusions: Endothelial dysfunction is a pivotal feature of PCAS and is partly driven by microparticles of resuscitated patients. Administration of selenium exerted anti-inflammatory effects and prevented microparticle-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Decline of selenium was observed in plasma of patients after CPR and is a novel predictive marker of ICU mortality, suggesting selenium consumption promotes inflammation in PCAS.

AB  - The efficiency of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation techniques have always been challenged regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in humans. In Veterinary Medicine it has not been different despite the recommendations of the small animal CPR guideline RECOVER 2012 (Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation). In spite of the support given by evidence in human medicine suggesting the use of this technique, there are several controversies about this procedure that should be clarified before the final decision on its utilization as well as the real risks, validity and long term results of the procedure. The aim of this paper is to promote a critical analysis of the literature related and, also depict a clínical opinion based on practical principles of CPR account not only the RECOVER but also publications in other languages.

AB  - Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains a significant clinical challenge despite advances in resuscitation and critical care. Enhanced inpatient monitoring and post-IHCA management have improved survival rates and better neurological outcomes at discharge. This study aims to evaluate the IHCA survival rate and analyse key determinants influencing survival status. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using retrospective secondary data from a northern referral tertiary public hospital's cardiac arrest registry, encompassing IHCA cases in patients aged 18 and above between February 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. The data included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, IHCA event timing, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival status, and post-arrest neurological outcomes. Patient survival was measured from the initiation of resuscitation to discharge or death, with survival analysis performed. Factors associated with IHCA survival were explored using logistic regression. Results: A total of 934 IHCA cases were analyzed. The mean patient age was 60.8 years, with most being male (63.9%) and of Chinese ethnicity (45.5%). IHCA commonly occurred in non-critical care areas (61.0%), with 79.6% admitted for medical conditions. Successful ROSC was achieved in 43.5% of cases, and 8.2% had a shockable first rhythm. Only 6.4% survived to discharge or 30-day, with 45% having good neurological outcomes. Conclusion: The IHCA survival rate remains low despite advances in resuscitation. Key survival factors include arrest location, shockable rhythms, and CPR-adrenaline dosage ratio. Strengthening early recognition, prompt intervention, and optimized post-arrest care may enhance IHCA outcomes, particularly in non-critical care areas.

AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a major global health challenge with low survival rates. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance early detection, response, and management of OHCA cases. This study explores the current use of AI in OHCA, identifying challenges and opportunities related to its implementation. This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, utilizing a systematic search of international databases to identify relevant literature. A total of 10 studies were included, comprising cohort studies, observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and pilot projects from 10 different countries. AI implementation in OHCA management demonstrated several opportunities, including improved early detection (increasing sensitivity by 5.5-15% and reducing EMS response time by up to 26 seconds), enhanced decision support for termination of resuscitation (with specificity up to 99.0%), and increased bystander engagement through real-time CPR guidance. However, challenges remain, such as data privacy, ethical concerns (especially with visual surveillance and GDPR compliance), infrastructure limitations, and variability in local protocol. The paradox between faster detection and improved CPR quality was also noted. AI has significant potential to improve OHCA outcomes by optimizing detection, response, and clinical decision-making. Successful implementation requires multidisciplinary collaboration, robust external validation, and ethical considerations to address privacy and local adaptation. Integrating AI into emergency systems and public training can enhance survival rates, but further large-scale studies are needed to ensure effectiveness and equity.

AB  - A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of fever and chest pain that led her to collapse, prompting her father to call the emergency medical services (EMS). Both an EMS ambulance and a physician-staffed ambulance were dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, the EMS crew discovered that the patient was in cardiac arrest, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the initial heart rhythm. Due to the patient's refractory VF, the physician requested the receiving hospital to prepare for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), which was successfully initiated 105 minutes after the patient's collapse. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, where her cardiac function gradually improved. On the eighth day, she was successfully weaned off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and discharged from the hospital on the thirty-third day without any neurological complications. The presumed cause of the cardiac arrest was fulminant myocarditis, based on the patient's clinical history and findings from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, early mechanical cardiopulmonary support is crucial for patients with fulminant myocarditis. However, cases resulting in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest generally have poor outcomes, even with ECPR. This particular case demonstrated that optimal resuscitation, spanning from the prehospital phase to the intensive care unit, utilizing ECPR, played a vital role in achieving a favorable neurological outcome.

AB  - Background: Catheter ablation is superior to drug therapy in selected atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, yet the impact of prior non-ablation rhythm control remains unclear. Methods: We analyzed data from Catheter Ablation vs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial, which assessed whether catheter ablation was more effective than drugs for improving outcomes in AF patients, including paroxysmal, persistent and long-standing persistent AF. In this study, patients were stratified by whether they had pharmacological or direct current cardioversion (P/DCCV) before randomization. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. The secondary outcomes included all-cause death, death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiovascular death, AF recurrence and composite of all-cause death, stroke, or cardiovascular hospitalization. Results: In CABANA trial, 1,035 (47.0%) had a history of P/DCCV. The effect of catheter ablation on primary outcome did not differ significantly between patients with prior P/DCCV and those without (HR = 1.00, 95%CI [0.66–1.51] and HR = 0.68, 95%CI [0.45–1.03], respectively). For the secondary outcome of death or cardiovascular hospitalization, catheter ablation reduced risk in both groups, with a greater effect observed in patients with prior P/DCCV (HR = 0.72, 95%CI [0.61–0.85] vs. HR = 0.91, 95%CI [0.78–1.07], respectively; P for interaction = 0.032). Ablation also significantly reduced AF recurrence in both groups and improved AF-related quality of life over 60 months of follow-up. Conclusion: In this post-hoc analysis of the CABANA trial, catheter ablation was associated with greater benefit in reducing the composite outcome of death or cardiovascular hospitalization among patients with prior P/DCCV.

AB  - A 7-month-old dog presented with a 10-minute history of upper respiratory tract obstruction and secondary loss of consciousness in the minute before its arrival to the hospital. The dog was found to be dead on arrival. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, which led to successful return of spontaneous circulation 20 minutes later, with subsequent regain of consciousness. Symptomatic therapy and supportive care were provided for 3.5 weeks before discharging the dog into the care of its owners. Despite having made an initial improvement, it was subsequently euthanised 4 weeks later due to persistent severe neurological deficits. Although the neurological improvement was not deemed sufficient for the dog to have a good quality of life, this case report highlights that return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and a prolonged period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is feasible, and neurological improvement thereafter is possible.

AB  - The influence of stress on gas sorption behavior and sorption-induced swelling in coal is critical for the success of CO<sub>2</sub>-enhanced coalbed methane recovery (CO<sub>2</sub>-ECBM) and geological carbon sequestration—a key strategy for mitigating climate change and promoting clean energy transitions. However, this influence remains insufficiently understood, largely due to experimental limitations (e.g., overreliance on powdered coal samples) and conflicting theoretical frameworks in existing studies. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates the effects of two distinct stress constraints—constant confining pressure and constant volume—on CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics, and associated swelling deformation of intact anthracite coal cores. An integrated experimental apparatus was custom-designed for this study, combining volumetric sorption measurement with high-resolution strain monitoring via the confining fluid displacement (CFD) method and the confining pressure response (CPR) method. This setup enables the quantification of CO<sub>2</sub>–coal interactions under precisely controlled stress environments. Key findings reveal that stress conditions exert a regulatory role in shaping CO<sub>2</sub>–coal behavior: constant confining pressure conditions enhance CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity and sustain adsorption kinetics by accommodating matrix swelling, thereby preserving pore accessibility for continuous gas uptake. In contrast, constant volume constraints lead to rapid internal stress buildup, which inhibits further gas adsorption and accelerates the attainment of kinetic saturation. Sorption-induced swelling exhibits clear dependence on both pressure and constraint conditions. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> pressure leads to increased strain, while constant confining pressure facilitates more gradual, sustained expansion. This is particularly evident at higher pressures, where adsorption-induced swelling prevails over mechanical constraints. These results help resolve key discrepancies in the existing literature by clarifying the dual role of stress in modulating both pore accessibility (for gas transport) and mechanical response (for matrix deformation). These insights provide essential guidance for optimizing CO<sub>2</sub> injection strategies and improving the long-term performance and sustainability of CO<sub>2</sub>-ECBM and geological carbon storage projects, ultimately supporting global efforts in carbon emission reduction and sustainable energy resource utilization.

AB  - Background: Prompt, effective CPR greatly increases the chances of survival in out-of-hospital c ardiac arrest. However, it is often not provided, even by people who have previously undertaken training. Psychological and behavioural factors are likely to be important in relation to CPR initiation by lay-people but have not yet been systematically identified. Methods: Aim: to identify the psychological and behavioural factors associated with CPR initiation amongst lay-people. Design: Systematic review Data sources: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Google Scholar. Study eligibility criteria: Primary studies reporting psychological or behavioural factors and data on CPR initiation involving lay-people published (inception to 31 Dec 2021). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Potential studies were screened independently by two reviewers. Study characteristics, psychological and behavioural factors associated with CPR initiation were extracted from included studies, categorised by study type and synthesised narratively. Results: One hundred and five studies (150,820 participants) comprising various designs, populations and of mostly weak quality were identified. The strongest and most ecologically valid studies identified factors associated with CPR initiation: the overwhelming emotion of the situation, perceptions of capability, uncertainty about when CPR is appropriate, feeling unprepared and fear of doing harm. Current evidence comprises mainly atheoretical cross-sectional surveys using unvalidated measures with relatively little formal testing of relationships between proposed variables and CPR initiation. Conclusions: Preparing people to manage strong emotions and increasing their perceptions of capability are likely important foci for interventions aiming to increase CPR initiation. The literature in this area would benefit from more robust study designs. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO: CRD42018117438.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be used by default on patients suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital in the UK unless there is an order that specifies otherwise in the patient's notes. Guidelines recommend that the decision involves competent and willing patients or, in the case of incapacitation, their families. In practice, patient autonomy is often compromised. Ideally, discussion of preferences for end-of-life care should take place prior to hospitalisation. The majority of research on this topic has been conducted on hospitalised patients, so little is known about the views of older, but healthy, people about resuscitation decision-making. The present study was designed to address this gap. A series of eight focus groups involving a total of 48 participants over the age of 65 was conducted to explore people's views about the factors guiding resuscitation decision-making. A qualitative analysis, which emphasised the dilemmatic nature of resuscitation decision-making, identified two broad thematic dilemmas that subsumed six specific themes which contribute to resolving the dilemmas: quality of life (medical condition, mental versus physical incapacity, age and ageing, and burden), and the involvement of others (doctors and families) versus loss of autonomy. The dilemma underlying quality of life is that an acceptable quality of life after CPR cannot be assured. The dilemma underlying the involvement of others is that individual autonomy may be lost. The themes and subthemes provide the basis for guiding these difficult discussions in advance of serious illness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is different in etiology compared to medical cardiac arrest. In case of TCA, it is important to initiate early fluid resuscitation. Initial cardiac rhythm serves as an indicator of outcomes in case of cardiac arrest. We aimed to find the association between prehospital hydration and outcomes of TCA according to initial cardiac rhythm. This is a retrospective, observational, crosssectional study. An examination was undertaken involving patients afflicted with TCA within the timeframe of 2014 to 2019. Exposure was defined to encompass prehospital hydration; interactive exposure was categorized by initial cardiac rhythm (non-shockable vs. shockable); the primary outcome was defined as good neurological status at discharge, whereas the secondary outcome was defined as survival to discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A comprehensive analysis was conducted on a cumulative of 20,247 patients. Rates of good neurological status and survival to discharge were 0.2% and 8.3% (non-shockable rhythm group) and 3.0% and 16.7% (shockable rhythm group), respectively. However, rates of good neurological status and survival to discharge were 0.2% and 7.9% (non-prehospital hydration group) and 0.3% and 10.0% (hydration group), respectively. Compared to the non-hydration group, the AORs for good neurological status at discharge was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.77-2.69) for the hydration group. Moreover, compared to the non-shockable rhythm group, the AORs for good neurological status at discharge was 19.74 (95% CI: 10.46-27.26) in the shockable rhythm group. The interaction analysis conducted between prehospital hydration and initial rhythm unveiled the efficacy of prehospital hydration in promoting favorable survival to discharge outcomes in the non-shockable rhythm group. Therefore, prehospital hydration is recommended for those with TCA characterized by a nonshockable rhythm before transport from the incident location.

AB  - Background: Decisions regarding Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders remain demanding, as does including patients in the process. Objectives: To explore physicians’ justification for CPR/DNAR orders and decisions regarding patient inclusion, as well as their reports of how they initiated discussions with patients. Methods: We administered a face-to-face survey to residents in charge of 206 patients including DNAR and CPR orders, with or without patient inclusion. Results: Justifications were provided for 59% of DNAR orders and included severe comorbidity, patients and families’ resuscitation preferences, patients’ age, or poor prognosis or quality of life. Reasons to include patients in CPR/DNAR decisions were provided in 96% and 84% of cases, and were based on respect for autonomy, clinical assessment of the situation as not too severe, and the view that such inclusion was required. Reasons for not including patients were offered in 84% of cases for CPR and in 70% for DNAR. They included absent decision-making capacity, a clinical situation viewed as good (CPR) or offering little hope of recovery (DNAR), barriers to communication, or concern that discussions could be emotionally difficult or superfluous. Decisions made earlier in the patient’s management were infrequently viewed as requiring revision. Residents reported a variety of introductions to discussions with patients. Conclusions: These results provide better understanding of reasons for CPR/DNAR decisions, reasons for patient inclusion or lack thereof, and ways in which such inclusion is initiated. They also point to potential side-effects of implementing CPR/DNAR recommendations without in-depth and practical training. This should be part of a regular audit and follow-up process for such recommendations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction and objective: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a significant cause of adult mortality, categorized into in-hospital (IHCA) and out-of-hospital (OHCA). Survival in OHCA depends on early diagnosis, alerting Emergency Medical Service (EMS), high-quality bystander resuscitation, and prompt Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) use. Accelerating technological progress supports faster AED retrieval and use, but there are barriers in real-life OHCA situations. The study assesses 6th-year medical students' ability to locate AEDs using smartphones, revealing challenges and proposing solutions. Material & Methods: The study was conducted in 2022–2023 at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland. Respondents completed a survey on AED knowledge and characteristics, followed by a task to find the nearest AED using their own smartphones. As common sources did not list the University AEDs, respondents were instructed to locate the nearest AED outside the research site. Results: A total of 300 6th-year medical students took part in the study. Only 3.3% had an AED locating app. Only 32% of students claimed to know where the AED nearest to their home is. All 300 had received AED training, and almost half had been witness to a resuscitation. Out of the 291 medical students who completed the AED location task, the median time to locate the nearest AED was 58 s. Most participants (86.6%) found the AED within 100 s, and over half (53%) did so in under 1 min. Conclusions: National registration of AEDs should be mandatory. A unified source of all AEDs mapped should be created or added to existing ones. With a median of under one minute, searching for AED by a bystander should be considered as a point in the chain of survival.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) orders, to define factors associated with CPR/DNAR orders and to explore how physicians make and document these decisions. Methods: We prospectively reviewed CPR/DNAR forms of 1,446 patients admitted to the General Internal Medicine Department of the Geneva University Hospitals, a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Switzerland. We additionally administered a face-to-face survey to residents in charge of 206 patients including DNAR and CPR orders, with or without patient inclusion. Results: 21.2% of the patients had a DNAR order, 61.7% a CPR order and 17.1% had neither. The two main factors associated with DNAR orders were a worse prognosis and/or a worse quality of life. Others factors were an older age, cancer and psychiatric diagnoses, and the absence of decision-making capacity. Residents gave four major justifications for DNAR orders: important comorbid conditions (34%), the patients’ or their family’s resuscitation preferences (18%), the patients’ age (14.2%), and the absence of decision-making capacity (8%). Residents who wrote DNAR orders were more experienced. In many of the DNAR or CPR forms (19.8 and 16%, respectively), the order was written using a variety of formulations. For 24% of the residents, the distinction between the resuscitation order and the care objective was not clear. 38% of the residents found the resuscitation form useful. Conclusion: Patients’ prognosis and quality of life were the two main independent factors associated with CPR/DNAR orders. However, in the majority of cases, residents evaluated prognosis only intuitively, and quality of life without involving the patients. The distinction between CPR/DNAR orders and the care objectives was not always clear. Specific training regarding CPR/DNAR orders is necessary to improve the CPR/DNAR decision process used by physicians. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We aimed to determine the incidence of bacteremia and prognostic effects of prompt administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AAT) on nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients achieving a sustained return of spontaneous circulation (sROSC), compared with non-OHCA patients. In the multicenter case-control study, nontraumatic OHCA adults with bacteremia episodes after achieving sROSC were defined as case patients, and non-OHCA patients with community-onset bacteremia in the emergency department were regarded as control patients. Initially, case patients had a higher bacteremia incidence than non-OHCA visits (231/2171, 10.6% vs. 10,430/314,620, 3.3%; p < 0.001). Compared with the matched control (2288) patients, case (231) patients experienced more bacteremic episodes due to low respiratory tract infections, fewer urosepsis events, fewer Escherichia coli bacteremia, and more streptococcal and anaerobes bacteremia. Antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, were frequently evident in case patients. Notably, each hour delay in AAT administration was associated with an average increase of 10.6% in crude 30-day mortality rates in case patients, 0.7% in critically ill control patients, and 0.3% in less critically ill control patients. Conclusively, the incidence and characteristics of bacteremia differed between the nontraumatic OHCA and non-OHCA patients. The incorporation of blood culture samplings and rapid AAT administration as first-aids is essential for nontraumatic OHCA patients after achieving sROSC.

AB  - This article helps evaluate the preparedness and response to medical emergencies within the Edo State healthcare system. Having a functional emergency medical response could reduce deaths in low and middle-income countries by about 25%. This entails efficient pre-hospital care, functional ambulance services, a prompt and designated emergency call centre and number, trained first responders, efficient transportation to a ready healthcare facility, and more. This study was conducted in the three senatorial regions of Edo State. The study design was cross-sectional, with data collected via a semi-structured questionnaire. Five hundred and twenty-four people were sampled in the research, and the analysis was conducted using SPSS software. The research revealed that three quarters of the participants have no available call centre and/or call number in their location. More than four-fifths of the respondents reported having no ambulance services and no available Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in their localities. Two-thirds of the participants are unable to carry out CPR, and only about one-fourth had training in CPR in the last two years. To have an effective preparedness and prompt response to medical emergencies, the following are recommended: 1. The government needs to set up a functional emergency response centre in every Local Government Area. 2. The government should provide functional ambulance vehicles and position them in strategic locations across the state. 3. The training of the first responders should be prioritized to shorten response time.

AB  - Introduction: Malnutrition is a prevalent issue in hospitalized patients, affecting up to 50% of this population in Peru, and is linked to various factors, including gastrointestinal alterations, comorbidities, and prolonged hospital stays. Ultrasound has emerged as a promising tool for evaluating muscle mass, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods. Objective: To assess the factors associated with inadequate muscle mass (IMM), evaluated by ultrasound in adult patients treated by the Surgery Service of a Peruvian hospital. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted. The thickness of the femoral quadriceps muscle (FQM) was measured by ultrasound, with IMM considered for values below the reference. Evaluated factors included age, sex, nutritional status, admission diagnosis, illness duration, comorbidities, gastrointestinal symptoms, risk of malnutrition, anemia, and lymphopenia. Crude prevalence ratios (cPR) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated, along with their respective 95% confidence intervals. Results: Out of 126 patients, 55.6% presented with IMM. Age ≥60 years (aPR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09 - 1.91; p=0.011) and a longer duration of illness (aPR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.03; p=0.034) were significantly associated with IMM. Overweight and obesity showed a lower prevalence of IMM (aPR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.89; p=0.009), but the interaction between overweight/obesity and cardiometabolic comorbidity was significant, indicating an increased risk of IMM in this population. Conclusion: Advanced age, prolonged illness duration, and the presence of cardiometabolic comorbidities in overweight and obese patients, were the main factors associated with IMM.

AB  - Objective: To describe the in-hospital postcardiac arrest (PCA) care and short- and long-term functional outcomes of dogs and cats surviving to hospital discharge after naturally occurring cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and CPR. Design: Multicenter retrospective observational study. Setting: Three veterinary teaching hospitals. Animals: Client-owned dogs (n = 25) and cats (n = 15). Measurements and Main Results: Medical records of animals that underwent CPR and survived to discharge were retrospectively reviewed, and information was recorded regarding CPR event, PCA hospitalization, and short- and long-term outcomes. Ninety-two percent of CPA events occurred in hospital and were witnessed, and 8% occurred out of hospital. Eighty-five percent of events occurred during general anesthesia or sedation. CPR efforts ranged from <1 to 18 min, and animals remained hospitalized between 0.5 and 15.5 days after return of spontaneous circulation. Seventy-three percent of animals required supplemental oxygen, 13% required mechanical ventilation, and 20% required vasopressor, positive inotropic, or glucocorticoid therapy. Hyperosmolar therapies were administered to 38% of animals, anticonvulsants were given to 18%, and 8% of animals developed new-onset PCA seizures. The median (range) modified Glasgow Coma Scale score before CPA was 18 (11-18), 12 h PCA was 16 (6-18), and 72 h PCA was 17.5 (14-18). Median survival time was 455 days (range: 11-2650 days). Twenty-five percent of owners perceived a persistent disability in their pets, from behavioral changes to required nutritional and recumbent care. Nonetheless, all owners reported their pet's PCA quality of life to be good. Conclusions: Good short- and long-term functional outcomes post-CPA can be achieved in dogs and cats. Functional survival remains possible in some cases of out-of-hospital CPA and after prolonged CPR, suggesting a benefit of high-quality CPR in all scenarios. Patient stabilization and neurological improvement may take 48-72 h, and early discouraging findings should not prevent continuation of PCA care.

AB  - Background: Severe burn injuries are associated with profound hypermetabolic and catabolic responses that significantly increase nutritional requirements. Effective nutritional management is crucial for promoting wound healing, minimising complications, and improving recovery outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Purpose: This case report aims to highlight the practical and individualised nutritional strategies used to manage a patient with extensive burn injuries in a low-resource ICU setting. Methods: A 30-year-old male was admitted to Muhimbili National Hospital-Mloganzila following a motor traffic accident, sustaining deep second-degree burns over 53% of his total body surface area (TBSA), including the trunk, back, forearms, lower limbs, and buttocks. Upon admission, he presented with fluid imbalance, hypoalbuminemia, and functional feeding limitations. Nutritional needs were calculated using the Curreri formula, and a tailored nutrition care plan was developed. Fluid resuscitation followed the Parkland formula. Meals were provided from both hospital and home sources, supplemented with high-protein oral feeds, zinc (15 mg), and vitamin C (500 mg). Caregiver involvement and nursing support were integrated into the feeding process. Key Results: The individualised nutrition plan, supported by interdisciplinary collaboration and caregiver education, contributed to achieving target nutritional intake and clinical improvements. The patient showed gradual recovery with stabilised albumin levels, improved wound healing, and reduced complications. Conclusion: In resource-limited settings, effective burn nutrition therapy is feasible using locally available foods, targeted supplementation, and multidisciplinary coordination. Early assessment, tailored interventions, caregiver engagement, and regular monitoring are critical to successful burn recovery outcomes.

AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that often arises in the context of sepsis, perinatal asphyxia, and other neonatal complications. Early identification and appropriate management are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the aetiological profile, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of AKI among neonates admitted to a tertiary care NICU in India. Materials and Methods: A Retrospective observational study was conducted in the NICU of a tertiary care hospital over a 24-month period (August 2022 to July 2024). A total of 3200 neonates were screened, of whom 168 met the criteria for AKI based on modified KDIGO definitions. Demographic data, clinical and laboratory parameters, etiology of AKI, interventions, and outcomes (recovery, mortality, and progression to chronic kidney disease) were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among 168 neonates with AKI, the mean age was 5.3 ± 3.1 days, with a male predominance (58.3%). The leading causes of AKI were sepsis (48.8%), perinatal asphyxia (32.1%), and dehydration/ hypovolemia (26.2%). The majority of cases were intrinsic renal AKI (56%), followed by prerenal (41.1%) and postrenal (3%). Laboratory findings showed elevated serum creatinine (1.8 ± 0.5 mg/dL) and BUN (48.5 ± 12.7 mg/dL), with 36.3% showing metabolic acidosis. Interventions included antibiotics (88.1%), fluid resuscitation (60.7%), and peritoneal dialysis in 14.3%. Complete renal recovery was seen in 64.2% of cases, while 4.8% progressed to chronic kidney disease. The overall mortality rate was 30.9%, significantly higher among those with intrinsic renal AKI (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Sepsis and perinatal asphyxia remain the most common etiological factors for neonatal AKI in Indian NICUs. Intrinsic renal AKI is associated with significantly higher mortality. Early diagnosis and prompt management are essential to improve outcomes and reduce long-term renal complications in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Introduction: Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is one of the most common and important causes of premature births and peripartum mortality. Maternal antibiotic treatment affects the infantile prognosis. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of Ampicillin and Cefotaxime administered for the parturients on neonatal outcomes. Material and Methods: A comparison between the effects of Cefotaxime and Ampicillin on infantile complications of PROM was done in this clinical trial. Two hundred and twenty parturients with PROM who needed antibiotic therapy were randomized in two groups of control (Ampicillin) and intervention (Cefotaxime) treatments. The maternal/fetal statuses up to accouchement and the infants' status up to transfer to neonatal intensive care unit, death, or discharge from hospital were followed. The Apgar score, cardiac, respiratory and nervous systems, infection, immaturity, asphyxia, and mortality rates were compared in both groups. Results: The differences between the two groups were significant in: Apgar score min1 and min5, need for resuscitation, asphyxia, need for hospitalization, infection, and mortality rate. Conclusion: Administration of Cefotaxime in parturients with PROM improved the Apgar scores and decreased respiratory complications, infection, asphyxia, mortality rate, and need for ICU hospitalization in infants.

AB  - This article reports a fatal case of Japanese spotted fever(JSF) caused by Rickettsia japonica, providing reference experience for early identification and treatment of JSF in primary medical institutions. The patient presented fever of unknown cause for 6 days, with the highest temperature reaching 39.5°C, accompanied by chills, fatigue, and myalgia. The initial symptoms were similar to those of the common cold. Local treatment was ineffective, the patient was admitted to People's Hospital of Zigui County on April 27, 2021. On admission, laboratory tests revealed normal white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, and varying degrees of abnormalities in coagulation function, liver function, myocardial enzyme spectrum, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and urine protein. Imaging showed a small amount of pleural effusion bilaterally. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly the day after admission, and the patient died despite resuscitation efforts. The diagnosis of Rickettsia japonica infection was confirmed on the blood specimen by metagenomic next-generation sequencing and specific gene PCR techniques. This case highlights that in patients with non-specific clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging results, and fever of unknown and a history of outdoor activities, clinicians should be highly vigilant for possibility of rickettsial infection. Empirical anti-infective treatment should be initiated promptly before the pathogen detection report is available, with doxycycline being the preferred choice, which is crucial for improving patient prognosis. Meanwhile, it is essential to strengthen training for primary care physicians and public health education in potential epidemic areas.

AB  - Phenol and its chlorinated derivatives are introduced into the environment with wastewater effluents from various industries, becoming toxic pollutants. Phenol-degrading bacteria are important objects of research; among them, representatives of the genus Rhodoccocus are often highlighted as promising. Strain 7Ba was isolated by enrichment culture. A new isolate was characterized using culturing, biochemistry, high-throughput sequencing, microscopy (including electron microscopy), and functional genome analysis. Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 7Ba is able to grow on phenol and chlorophenols without losing its properties during long-term storage. It was shown that strain 7Ba is able to form viable but nonculturable (VBNC) forms during long-term storage under nutrient limitation, preserving both cell viability and the ability to degrade phenols. The ultrastructural organization of the vegetative forms of cells and VBNC forms was characterized. The following distinctive features were found: modifications (thickening) of cell membranes, cell size reduction, nucleoid condensation. Functional analysis of the genome showed the presence of genes for the degradation of alkanes, and two branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation of aromatic compounds. Also, the genome of strain 7Ba contains several copies of Rpf (resuscitation promoting factor) genes, a resuscitation factor of resting bacterial forms. The new isolate strain 7Ba is a promising biotechnological agent that can not only utilize toxic aromatic compounds but also remain viable during long-term storage. For this reason, its further application as an agent for bioremediation can be successful under changing conditions of climate and given the deficiency of nutrient compounds in nature. Minor biostimulation will allow the strain to recover its metabolic activity and effectively degrade pollution.

AB  - Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, frequently complicates pneumonia, a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality. This review synthesizes current evidence on optimizing early recognition and management of sepsis secondary to pneumonia, highlighting critical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the predominant pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), though antimicrobial resistance and atypical organisms pose growing challenges. Key risk factors include comorbidities (e.g., renal/liver disease, diabetes), immunosuppression, and socioeconomic determinants. Early diagnosis combines clinical assessment (e.g., SOFA, qSOFA scores) with biomarkers like procalcitonin, lactate, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Innovative tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analysis of blood count data, show promise for rapid sepsis detection. The cornerstone of management is the "1-hour bundle": immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics (tailored to local resistance patterns), fluid resuscitation with crystalloids, and vasopressors for refractory hypotension. Antibiotic selection must account for pathogen profiles, with macrolides or fluoroquinolones recommended for severe CAP. Fluid balance is critical to avoid pulmonary edema, while organ support (e.g., mechanical ventilation) is often required for respiratory failure. Despite therapeutic advances, sepsis mortality remains high (24-65% in Indonesia), driven by delays in treatment and comorbid conditions. Survivors frequently face long-term physical and cognitive impairments, necessitating comprehensive rehabilitation. Future efforts should prioritize rapid diagnostics, personalized therapy, and post-sepsis care to improve outcomes. This review underscores the importance of early, protocol-driven interventions to mitigate the global burden of sepsis complicating pneumonia.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection of tourism and environmental theories, highlighting how sustainability serves as a critical bridge between the two disciplines. Tourism theories such as Butler's Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) provide insights into destination development and tourist behavior but often lack an ecological perspective. The environmental framework, including Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) and Common-Pool Resource (CPR) Theory, emphasizes sustainable resource management and the interconnectedness of human activities and natural systems. This paper examines common concepts such as carrying capacity, sustainable development, and behavioral insights while also identifying tensions between economic growth and environmental preservation. Case studies from Costa Rica, Hawaii, and Thailand illustrate practical applications of these theories in real-world settings, revealing how tourism can be both a threat and a tool for conservation. My paper concludes that integrating environmental impact assessment (EIA) and community-based tourism (CBT) models into tourism planning can lead to better long-term resource management. It recommends the adoption of stricter regulations on tourism development in fragile ecosystems, the implementation of eco-certifications, and the promotion of locally governed tourism initiatives. These strategies will ensure the sustainability of both tourism activities and the ecosystems on which they depend.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and resource shortages-such as limited intensive care unit (ICU) beds, COVID-19 testing, and personal protective equipment (PPE)-placed significant burdens on emergency departments (EDs). These constraints contributed to high levels of moral distress among front-line clinicians. Objectives: To address these challenges, one health system implemented a two-physician resuscitation policy for changing code status to "do not resuscitate" (DNR) during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This policy aimed to support clinician decision-making around potentially non-beneficial care, promote responsible resource utilization, and mitigate the ethical and psychological burdens faced by clinicians. The current study sought to evaluate frontline clinicians' awareness, use, and experiences with this contingency policy, focusing on its ethical and psychological impact. Methods: This mixed-methods quality improvement study included clinicians from emergency medicine, critical care, and other specialties who managed COVID-19-positive patients. Data were collected through an online survey assessing awareness and acceptance of the two-physician DNR policy and its impact on moral distress. Correlation analyses were performed to examine relationships between resource shortages and moral distress. Qualitative data were gathered through open-ended survey responses and interviews thematically coded to elucidate clinicians' experiences with policy implementation and its influence on care delivery. Results: Over half of participants (53%) reported moral distress, which was significantly correlated with the severity of resource shortages (p < 0.05). ED staff in particular attributed distress to inadequate ICU bed capacity (64%), limited COVID-19 tests (64%), and insufficient (63%). Most respondents (70.2%) felt supported by the policy, especially in emergency medicine (79%) and critical care (79%). Qualitative findings indicated that the policy supported difficult decision-making around nonbeneficial care, reinforced resource stewardship, and enabled flexibility to reverse DNR status if patients' clinical conditions improved. Conclusion: These findings underscore the value of contingency policies in reducing moral distress and facilitating resource allocation during crises. By providing a clear framework for end-of-life decisions, the two-physician DNR policy was perceived by most clinicians as fostering shared accountability and prudent use of scarce resources. The flexibility inherent in this policy-such as the option to revise code status-was particularly important as patient conditions evolved. Notably, EDs continue to face "everyday crises" marked by supply shortages (e.g., IV fluids, blood culture bottles) and boarding. This study highlights the need for proactive stewardship and robust contingency planning beyond pandemic settings. Integrating lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic will help hospital systems and EDs better navigate ongoing shortages and enhance preparedness for future public health emergencies.

AB  - In septic shock, administration of large fluid volumes is associated with poor outcomes. Recent evidence shows that non-resuscitation fluids are the major modifiable source of fluids for patients with septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs). This clinical trial is designed to test the hypothesis that restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids improves outcomes compared to usual care. Adult patients admitted to ICUs with septic shock will be randomly assigned within 12 h of admission to receive protocolized restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids or usual care. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes are complications during ICU stay up to 90 days (defined as any acute kidney injury or cerebral, coronary, intestinal, or limb ischemia), mechanical ventilation free days within 90 days, and for survivors cognitive function (by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA-BLIND]) and Health-Related Quality of Life (by the EQ Visual Analogue Scale [EQ-VAS]), both at 6 months. In addition, the climate impact of the interventions will be assessed. To detect an absolute reduction in mortality of 7.5%, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 90%, we aim to include 1850 patients. The trial is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Results of primary and secondary clinical outcomes and the environmental outcome will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: To summarise our experiences of anaesthetic management under field conditions after the Wenchuan earthquake, China, on 12 May 2008. Methods: Medical records of earthquake victims who received emergency operations under anaesthetic techniques in our field hospital were retrospectively analysed, including patient''s demographic data, injury types, surgical procedures, anaesthetic techniques and perioperative care. Results: Among the 111 patients who required anaesthesia, the eldest was 81 years old, and the youngest was 5 months old. The methods of anaesthesia included general anaesthesia (19 cases), intrathecal anaesthesia (40 cases), monitored anaesthesia care (41 cases) and brachial plexus block (11 cases). Most of the patients were stable and safe during intra- and postoperative period, including successful resuscitation of two newborns, no major complications occurred. Conclusions: Earthquake-related injuries are complex. In view of dehydration, hypovolaemia and crush injury are common in earthquake victims, it is essential to perform adequate fluid therapy preoperatively, to ensure safety and reduce complications. Monitored anaesthesia care and regional anaesthesia are highly suitable for anaesthesia under field conditions, they are safe and efficacious. General anaesthesia also can be performed to avail the prompt treatment for the severe injuries in a well-equipped deployable field hospital nowadays. Appropriate anaesthetic management can improve the outcomes to a great extent and is an important component of medical assistance after disasters. Copyright &y& Elsevier

AB  - The implementation of medical drones can quickly and efficiently expand the coverage range of an area, allowing for a faster response to incidences of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and improving the subsequent survival rate of such incidences, while promoting sustainable health development goals under the configuration standards for automatic external defibrillators in China. In response to the problem of the selection of locations for medical drone vertiports (for take-off and landing) that are equipped with automatic external defibrillation facilities, a survival function was introduced to establish a model for site selection, with the primary optimization objective of maximizing the average survival rate of patients and taking the operating costs of a system into account. At the same time, considering the constraints of drone phase operation time, energy consumption, coverage range, etc., a medical drone vertiport site selection model was established for emergency cardiac arrest needs. An improved immune algorithm was applied to the model's calculations and the analysis of the results, using the Jinnan District in Tianjin as an example. The results show that the proposed model and algorithm are feasible and applicable. The Jinnan District in the city of Tianjin requires a total of 24 medical drone vertiports in order to achieve full coverage of an area under the "golden 4-minute" rescue time. When the average survival rate of patients is 0.9, the operation results are deemed optimal, and the average survival rate of patients is 64.06%. Compared to ground ambulances currently used in hospitals, the implementation of medical drones could significantly shorten response time, improve the average survival rate of patients by 41.96%, and effectively improve the existing low survival rate and the accessibility of medical services. The results of this study can provide decision-making support for the planning of automatic external defibrillators in public places and the construction of sustainable and efficient emergency medical service systems.

AB  - An iatrogenic vessel injury occurring during lumbar fusion is a rare but potentially serious complication. In this case report, we present a case of hypovolemic cardiac arrest attributable to an iatrogenic lumbar artery injury that occurred during posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), which is difficult to diagnose using CECT. A 70- year-old woman underwent PLIF surgery in a primary hospital for the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis (L2–L5). During the procedure, she experienced a blood loss of 3 liters, which necessitated the transfusion of packed red blood cells (6 units, about 200–250 mL per unit), fresh frozen plasma (6 units, about 150–170 mL per unit). Despite the transfusions, her vital signs remained unstable, leading to her transfer to our hospital. Upon arrival at our facility, the patient went into cardiac arrest, but spontaneous circulation was successfully restored after two cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In the emergency department, her hemoglobin level was measured at 2.7 g/dL, platelet level at 56,000/µL, and prothrombin international normalized ratio at 3.56. CECT did not indicate any active bleeding. For the initial 2 hours, her vital signs remained stable with a blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, heart rate of 104 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 bpm. However, her blood pressure suddenly dropped to 78/43 mmHg. Subsequent angiography revealed active bleeding from the right fourth lumbar artery, prompting the performance of embolization. Following the procedure, the patient’s vital signs stabilized, and she was discharged on the 16th day of hospitalization. Iatrogenic vessel injuries during PLIF may pose challenges in their detection using CECT, especially when extravasation is not definitively visible or when artifacts are created by metal implants. Therefore, it is advisable for emergency physicians to consider emergency angiography in the diagnosis and treatment of such vessel injuries.

AB  - Background: The case fatality rate of untreated dengue is 20%; it can be reduced to less than 1% with optimal management. The leading causes of death in dengue patients are shock, bleeding, and acute liver injury. We describe the clinical features of patients who died of dengue and discuss the therapeutic challenges and pitfalls of complicated dengue. Methods: This retrospective study was done in the intensive care unit (MICU) of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka over 30 months between 2021 and 2023. All patients who died of serologically confirmed dengue were incorporated. Results: Of the 1722 ICU admissions, 44 (2.6%) patients were treated for dengue-of them, 11 (25.0%) died. Two patients were excluded as their deaths were not directly linked to dengue. Six were females. The average age was 40.2 years. The leading causes of death included shock (n = 5), acute liver failure (n = 6), intracranial bleeding (n = 2), and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). Patient 1 had concomitant leakage and bleeding, which did not respond to fluids or blood products. He developed fluid overload and acute liver failure (ALF) and died of multiorgan dysfunction. Patients 2-5 were in shock for a prolonged period due to leakage ± bleeding. Patients 2-5 developed ALF and lactic acidosis followed by multiorgan dysfunction. Patient 8 developed acute hepatitis and ALF without preceding shock. The patient was treated with immunosuppressants for myasthenia gravis. Patients 6 and 7 experienced intracranial bleeding. Patient 9 died of pulmonary embolism after prolonged ventilation for dengue encephalitis. Conclusions: Prolonged shock, fluid overload and acute liver failure were common causes of dengue related deaths, in our study. Fluid overload occurred when vigorous crystalloid resuscitation was continued in patients who were poorly responding. A prompt switch to colloids or blood could have prevented overload. Patients who were in shock for a prolonged period become unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. How to manage dengue in patients who take anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulators, or antiplatelets is not known. Balancing the bleeding risk of dengue in patients predisposed to bleeding or thrombosis is a challenge.

Limited study compared two risk scores, the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores in the current East Asian NSTEMI patients.<bold>Methods: </bold>This retrospective observational study consecutively collected patients in a large academic hospital between 01/01 and 11/01/2017 and followed for 4 years. Patients were scored by TIMI and GRACE scores on hospital admission. In-hospital endpoints were defined as the in-hospital composite event, including mortality, re-infarction, heart failure, stroke, cardiac shock, or resuscitation. Long-term outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality in 4-year follow-up.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 232 patients were included (female 29.7%, median age 67 years), with a median follow-up of 3.7 years. GRACE score grouped most patients (45.7%) into high risk, while TIMI grouped the majority (61.2%) into medium risk. Further subgrouping the TIMI medium group showed that half (53.5%) of the TIMI medium risk population was GRACE high risk (≥ 140). Compared to TIMI medium group + GRACE < 140 subgroup, the TIMI medium + GRACE high-risk (≥ 140) subgroup had a significantly higher in-hospital events (39.5% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.05), long-term all-cause mortality (22.2% vs. 0% p < 0.001) and cardiac death (11.1% vs. 0% p = 0.045) in 4-year follow-up. GRACE risk scores showed a better predictive ability than TIMI risk scores both for in-hospital and long-term outcomes. (AUC of GRACE vs. TIMI, In-hospital: 0.82 vs. 0.62; long-term mortality: 0.89 vs. 0.68; long-term cardiac mortality: 0.91 vs. 0.67, all p < 0.05). Combined use of the two risk scores reserved both the convenience of scoring and the predictive accuracy.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>GRACE showed better predictive accuracy than TIMI in East Asian NSTEMI patients in both in-hospital and long-term outcomes. The sequential use of TIMI and GRACE scores provide an easy and promising discriminative tool in predicting outcomes in NSTEMI East Asian patients.

AB  - Background: Respiratory viruses are linked to cardiovascular complications. We aim to compare cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19, influenza and RSV. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from hospitalized children and young adults (≤ 20 years) from 2020 and 2021 using National Inpatient Sample (NIS). We included individuals hospitalized for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza, and weighted data were used to compare cardiovascular complications. Results: Of 212,655 respiratory virus admissions, 85,055 were from COVID-19, 103,185 were from RSV, and 24,415 were from influenza. Myocarditis was higher in COVID-19 [0.9%, n = 740] as compared to influenza [0.2%, n = 55] and RSV [0.1%, n = 65]. In the adjusted logistic regression, the odds of myocarditis was 61% lower in influenza [aOR = 0.39 (0.20-0.76), P = 0.006], and 85% lower in RSV [aOR = 0.15 (0.07-0.34) P < 0.001] as compared to COVID-19. Bradyarrhythmias/heart block was higher in COVID-19 [0.8%, n = 690] versus influenza [0.5%, n = 110] and RSV [0.2%, n = 205]. After adjusting for confounders for bradyarrhythmias/heart block, compared to COVID-19, the odds were 49% lower in RSV [aOR = 0.51 (0.33-0.80), P = 0.004] but no statistically significant difference in influenza [aOR = 0.79 (0.48-1.31), P = 0.374] was seen. Tachyarrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, and in-hospital mortality showed no differences after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: Individuals with COVID-19 infection are more likely to develop cardiovascular complications compared to influenza and RSV, highlighting the need for higher index of suspicion and prompt treatment, as well as steps to limit infection and transmission of this virus in children.

AB  - The nationwide Women in Healthy Transition (KISO) Survey Cohort is a population-based longitudinal prospective cohort study established to explore the significant data gap on women's symptoms through different stages of menopause in a Northern European context. The KISO Survey Cohort was set up to represent women aged 45-59 years living in Denmark. In total 575,863 women were invited to participate in the study at baseline. Data were collected through digital questionnaires from June to December 2024 and included self-reported information on stages of menopause, menopausal symptoms, quality of life, physical activity, and work productivity loss using validated scales as well as information on various health, social and lifestyle factors. The follow-up of the KISO Survey Cohort will be conducted through digital questionnaires every three years over a 15-year period, inviting baseline respondents and eligible women aged 45-59 at follow-up. A total of 153,800 women completed the baseline questionnaire, yielding a 27% response rate. Among the participants, 8% were in premenopause, 24% in perimenopause, and 45% in postmenopause. Moreover, 13% had induced menopause and 10% were undergoing menopausal hormone therapy. The KISO Survey Cohort is the first large-scale longitudinal study on menopausal symptoms among women in Denmark. Data are coupled with the personal identification numbers (CPR) enabling opportunities to link data to national administrative registers. This ongoing study, thus, offers unique and extensive data, enabling future research to advance our understanding of menopause, how it affects women, and its long-term effects on women.

AB  - Background: As society ages, the need for nursing home care is steadily increasing and end-of-life care of nursing home residents has become increasingly more important. End-of-life care differs between Germany and the neighbouring Netherlands. For example, a much higher proportion of German compared to Dutch nursing home residents is hospitalized at the end of life. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate end-of-life care in German and Dutch nursing homes. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a postal survey was sent to 600 randomly selected German and Dutch nursing homes each and addressed to the nursing staff management. Participants were asked to estimate the percentage of nursing home residents whose wishes for emergency situations (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation) are known and to indicate whether facilities offer advanced care planning (ACP). They were also asked to estimate whether general practitioners (GPs)/elder care physicians (ECPs) and nursing home staff are usually well trained for end-of-life care. Finally, participants were asked to estimate the proportion of nursing home residents who die in hospital rather than in the nursing home and to rate overall end-of-life care provision. Results: A total of 301 questionnaires were included in the analysis; 199 from German and 102 from Dutch nursing homes (response 33.2% and 17.0%). German participants estimated that 20.5% of residents die in the hospital in contrast to the Dutch estimation of 5.9%. In German nursing homes, ACP is offered less often (39.2% in Germany, 75.0% in the Netherlands) and significantly fewer wishes for emergency situations of residents were known than in Dutch nursing homes. GPs were considered less well-trained for end-of-life care in Germany. The most important measures to improve end-of-life care were comparable in both countries. Conclusion: Differences in (the delivery and knowledge of) end-of-life care between Germany and the Netherlands could be observed in this study. These could be due to structural differences (ECPs available 24/7 in the majority of Dutch nursing homes) and cultural differences (more discussion on quality of life versus life-sustaining treatments in the Netherlands). Due to these differences, a country-specific approach is necessary to improve end-of-life care.

AB  - Introduction: International consensus guidelines support the initial administration of 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids for haemodynamic resuscitation of newly diagnosed septic shock. Practice variation exists between the volume of fluids administered and timing of vasopressor commencement. The optimal approach in patients with septic shock is uncertain. Methods and analysis: Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation: FLUid or vasopressors In emergency Department Sepsis is a 1000-participant multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel group clinical trial conducted in patients with septic shock presenting to the emergency department in participating sites in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. Participants are randomised (1:1) to either restricted fluids and early vasopressors or a larger initial intravenous fluid volume and later vasopressors. The primary outcome is days alive and out of hospital at day 90 postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at day 90, time from randomisation until death (to day 90), days alive and at home at day 90 and ventilator-free, vasopressor-free and renal replacement-free days to day 28 postrandomisation and death or disability at 6-month and 12-month postrandomisation. Health-related quality of life will be assessed at day 180 and 12 months following randomisation. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by Northern Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC2020/ETH02874) on 21 January 2021. Patients will be enrolled under a waiver of prior consent. The patient or next-of-kin (or equivalent according to local jurisdiction) is approached at the first available opportunity and given a trial information sheet. According to local approvals, the patient or next-of-kin chooses to either continue in the trial or opt-out/decline continued participation. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences. Trial registration number: NCT04569942.

AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) account for a major cause of morbidity and mortality, representing the second most common sepsis-related death with a hospital mortality of 23-38%. Prompt identification of sepsis source, appropriate resuscitation, and early treatment with the shortest delay possible are the cornerstones of management of IAIs and are associated with a more favorable clinical outcome. The aim of source control is to reduce microbial load by removing the infection source and it is achievable by using a wide range of procedures, such as definitive surgical removal of anatomic infectious foci, percutaneous drainage and toilette of infected collections, decompression, and debridement of infected and necrotic tissue or device removal, providing for the restoration of anatomy and function. Damage control surgery may be an option in selected septic patients. Intra-abdominal infections can be classified as uncomplicated or complicated causing localized or diffuse peritonitis. Early clinical evaluation is mandatory in order to optimize diagnostic testing and establish a therapeutic plan. Prognostic scores could serve as helpful tools in medical settings for evaluating both the seriousness and future outlook of a condition. The patient's conditions and the potential progression of the disease determine when to initiate source control. Patients can be classified into three groups based on disease severity, the origin of infection, and the patient's overall physical health, as well as any existing comorbidities. In recent decades, antibiotic resistance has become a global health threat caused by inappropriate antibiotic regimens, inadequate control measures, and infection prevention. The sepsis prevention and infection control protocols combined with optimizing antibiotic administration are crucial to improve outcome and should be encouraged in surgical departments. Antibiotic and antifungal regimens in patients with IAIs should be based on the resistance epidemiology, clinical conditions, and risk for multidrug resistance (MDR) and Candida spp. infections. Several challenges still exist regarding the effectiveness, timing, and patient stratification, as well as the procedures for source control. Antibiotic choice, optimal dosing, and duration of therapy are essential to achieve the best treatment. Promoting standard of care in the management of IAIs improves clinical outcomes worldwide. Further trials and stronger evidence are required to achieve optimal management with the least morbidity in the clinical care of critically ill patients with intra-abdominal sepsis.

AB  - Thermoregulation constitutes one of the most important homeostatic systems of the human body. The human thermoregulatory system is highly complex and intertwined with other regulatory homeostatic systems. Different evolutionary adaptations have evolved to ensure a well-regulated body temperature, encompassing simple behavioural (e.g., seeking shelter, going underground) as well as physiological changes (e.g., vasodilatation, sweating). However, when the heat, cold or other stimuli cause a disruption in the thermoregulatory state and our adaptations can no longer cope with the additional stress, the body enters a pathological state. In such instances other measures must be undertaken. In medicine there are several pathological states associated with disruptions in temperature homeostasis. Consequently, these patients have to be, in broad terms, thermoregulated. Speaking specifically, the most common application of thermoregulation is therapeutic temperature management. A prominent example is the utilisation of this technique in post-cardiac arrest patients, who remain comatose after resuscitation. This technique has been in use for almost 20 years since the first major reports on its benefits in improving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest survival as well as improving neurological outcome. Recently, the findings from one of the biggest targeted temperature international and multicentre trials to date have been published (TTM2 trial; https://ttm2trial.org/). The study surprisingly showed no difference in mortality between patients after out of hospital cardiac arrest, who underwent normo- or hypothermia. Consequently, we might need to re-evaluate certain guidelines, recommendations, and perspectives. The aim of the current review is to present an overview of targeted temperature management in the field of intensive care medicine and cardiac arrest.

AB  - Background: Pediatric shock accounts for significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Shock approximately occurs in 2% of children admitted to pediatric ICU worldwide as per most western literature. Shock is classified based on severity as compensated or decompensated shock. Etiology based classification of Shock: Hypovolemic shock, Septic shock, cardiogenic shock, Distributive shock, Obstructive shock. The outcome of shock depends on severity at the time of presentation, etiology and resources available for intervention. It is necessary to monitor the patients in shock with clinical and laboratory parameters which guide the therapeutic intervention and defines the outcome. Early recognition and prompt intervention are extremely important in the treatment of all forms of shock. Aims and objectives: To study the Etiology, Severity and outcome of shock in children of age 1 to 10 years. To evaluate the response to treatment in various forms of shock. Materials and Methods: Hospital based observational study at PICU, King George Hospital, and Visakhapatnam for a period of one year. All children of age 1 to 10 years admitted with shock were taken detailed history, thorough physical examination and relevant laboratory investigations were done. The final statistical analysis was done with the use of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 21.0. Results: A total of 60 cases were enrolled in the study of which the predominant age group involved was 1 to 3 years. Hypovolemic shock is most common followed by septic and mixed shock. Decompensated shock and compensated shock constituted 63.4% and 36.65% respectively. Most common etiology was Severe acute malnutrition (16.7%) followed by ADD with severe dehydration (13.3%); Dengue (13.3%) and severe Pneumonia (10%). 40% of the patients with shock responded to fluid resuscitation alone and 55% of the patients required inotrope support. Overall mortality rate was 31.7%. Mortality rate was more among the age group of 1 to 3 years. Mortality was highest in mixed followed by septic shock. Conclusion: As the age of the patients increased, the mortality rate decreased and this is statistically significant with p value <0.05. Compensated shock had a survival rate of 100% while only 45% of decompensated shock survived. Abnormal ABG and high S. Lactate levels showed higher mortality. Most cases of decompensated shock leading to mortality were due to sepsis. This indicates the significance of early diagnosis of shock in compensated stage, etiology of shock and its timely management.

AB  - The gastric-dilatation volvulus syndrome is a lethal digestive disease if it's not addressed promptly because it causes an obstructive shock. Upon admission, the assessment of perfusion clinical parameters and lactatemia monitoring are necessary because they are the reflection of the disease severity. Their follow-up will enable to assess the medical resuscitation efficacy. Medical resuscitation consists mostly in rapid onset of fluidotherapy in association with gastric decompression by nasogastric tube placement or orogastric intubation or gastric trocharization. In the post-operative period, ischemic-reperfusion injuries are the main cause of complications, with the frequent occurence of ventricular arrythmias, not all of which requiring specific therapy.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding the key factors which affect out hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) outcomes is essential in order to promote patient treatment. The main objective of this research was to describe the correlations between the capnographic values obtained during the first minute of monitoring on cardiopulmonary resuscitation, assisted by basic life-support units, with the results as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and alive hospital admission. The secondary objectives were to describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients assisted, and to analyze any correlations between receiving basic life-support units and/or defibrillation prior to the arrival of basic life-support units, and the results of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers. Methods: A prospective, descriptive, observational study of adult non-traumatic out hospital cardiac arrest patients was conducted. The patients were initially assisted by basic life-support units on the island of Mallorca, with one minute of initial capnography monitoring. Results: From July 2018 to March 2020, fifty-nine patients meeting the inclusion criteria were assisted, 76% were men and their mean age was 64.45 (±15.07) years old. The number of emergency lifesaving technicians who participated in the study was 58, they had a mean work experience of 14.05 (±6.7) years. Thirty-seven (63.7%) patients underwent basic life-support by bystanders and in 91.5% of cases the semi-automatic external defibrillator was used. Capnometry values during the first minute were obtained in 34 (58.6%) patients, their mean values were 22 (±19.07) mmHg, 35.5% of patients had values < 10 mmHg. In 25.4% of the patients, spontaneous circulation returned during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 18.6% were admitted to hospital alive. Conclusion: No correlations were found between initial capnography values scoring above or below 10 mmHg and survival, however, basic life-support maneuvers, and defibrillation by bystanders and first responders, did correlate with survival rates. The average patient assisted in out of hospital cardiac arrest by the basic life-support units sampled was an adult male aged over 65 years.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>High levels of arterial oxygen pressures (PaO2) have been associated with increased mortality in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), but there is limited information regarding possible mechanisms linking hyperoxia and death in this setting, notably with respect to its hemodynamic consequences. We aimed therefore at evaluating a possible association between PaO2, circulatory failure and death during ECPR.<bold>Methods: </bold>We retrospectively analyzed 44 consecutive cardiac arrest (CA) patients treated with ECPR to determine the association between the mean PaO2 over the first 24 h, arterial blood pressure, vasopressor and intravenous fluid therapies, mortality, and cause of deaths.<bold>Results: </bold>Eleven patients (25%) survived to hospital discharge. The main causes of death were refractory circulatory shock (46%) and neurological damage (24%). Compared to survivors, non survivors had significantly higher mean 24 h PaO2 (306 ± 121 mmHg vs 164 ± 53 mmHg, p < 0.001), lower mean blood pressure and higher requirements in vasopressors and fluids, but displayed similar pulse pressure during the first 24 h (an index of native cardiac recovery). The mean 24 h PaO2 was significantly and positively correlated with the severity of hypotension and the intensity of vasoactive therapies. Patients dying from circulatory failure died after a median of 17 h, compared to a median of 58 h for patients dying from a neurological cause. Patients dying from neurological cause had better preserved blood pressure and lower vasopressor requirements.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In conclusion, hyperoxia is associated with increased mortality during ECPR, possibly by promoting circulatory collapse or delayed neurological damage.

AB  - Background: Despite advances in resuscitation care, mortality rates following cardiac arrest (CA) remain high. Between one-quarter (in-hospital CA) and two-thirds (out of hospital CA) of patients admitted comatose to intensive care die of neurological injury. Neuroprognostication determines an informed and timely withdrawal of life sustaining treatment (WLST), sparing the patient unnecessary suffering, alleviating family distress and allowing a more utilitarian use of resources. The latest Resuscitation Council UK (2015) guidance on post-resuscitation care provides the current multi-modal neuroprognostication strategy to predict neurological outcome. Its modalities include neurological examination, neurophysiological tests, biomarkers and radiology. Despite each of the current strategy's predictive modalities exhibiting limitations, meta-analyses show that three, namely PLR (pupillary light reflex), CR (corneal reflex) and N20 SSEP (somatosensory-evoked potential), accurately predict poor neurological outcome with low false positive rates. However, the quality of evidence is low, reducing confidence in the strategy's results. While infrared pupillometry (IRP) is not currently used as a prognostication modality, it can provide a quantitative and objective measure of pupillary size and PLR, giving a definitive view of the second and third cranial nerve activity, a predictor of neurological outcome. Methods: The proposed study will test the hypothesis, "in those patients who remain comatose following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after CA, IRP can be used early to help predict poor neurological outcome". A comprehensive review of the evidence using a PRISMA-P (2015) compliant methodology will be underpinned by systematic searching of electronic databases and the two authors selecting and screening eligible studies using the Cochrane data extraction and assessment template. Randomised controlled trials and retrospective and prospective studies will be included, and the quality and strength of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Discussion: IRP requires rudimentary skill and is objective and repeatable. As a clinical prognostication modality, it may be utilised early, when the strategy's other modalities are not recommended. Corroboration in the evidence would promote early use of IRP and a reduction in ICU bed days. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42018118180

AB  - Sudden cardiac death is a worldwide public health problem. Although its incidence is not known, it is estimated to cause up to 50% of cardiac-related mortality and up to 20% of total mortality in adults. In Mexico, previous estimates suggest that it causes an average of 33 000 deaths per year; however, the data are not precise. Half of all sudden cardiac death events are due to out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest which, if not treated promptly, leads to sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the ability to respond promptly and adequately to these events with the necessary maneuvers and equipment improves the survival of the victims. To address this problem, in some states of the country, cardioprotected spaces have been created to allow timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiac defibrillation maneuvers to be performed in public access. As an objective, health professionals establish the importance of implementing cardioprotected spaces and creating public policies in this regard throughout the country.

AB  - Background: Global hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (GHIBI) results in variable degrees of neurological dysfunction. Limited data exists to guide prognostication on likelihood of functional recovery. Hypothesis: Prolonged duration of hypoxic-ischemic insult and absence of neurological improvement in the first 72 hours are negative prognostic indicators. Animals: Ten clinical cases with GHIBI. Methods: Retrospective case series describing 8 dogs and 2 cats with GHIBI, including clinical signs, treatment, and outcome. Results: Six dogs and 2 cats experienced cardiopulmonary arrest or anesthetic complication in a veterinary hospital and were promptly resuscitated. Seven showed progressive neurological improvement within 72 hours of the hypoxic-ischemic insult. Four fully recovered and 3 had residual neurological deficits. One dog presented comatose after resuscitation at the primary care practice. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed diffuse cerebral cortical swelling and severe brainstem compression and the dog was euthanized. Two dogs suffered out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest, secondary to a road traffic accident in 1 and laryngeal obstruction in the other. The first dog was euthanized after MRI that identified diffuse cerebral cortical swelling with severe brainstem compression. In the other dog, spontaneous circulation was recovered after 22 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the dog remained blind, disorientated, and ambulatory tetraparetic with vestibular ataxia and was euthanized 58 days after presentation. Histopathological examination of the brain confirmed severe diffuse cerebral and cerebellar cortical necrosis. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Duration of hypoxic-ischemic insult, diffuse brainstem involvement, MRI features, and rate of neurological recovery could provide indications of the likelihood of functional recovery after GHIBI.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between high and low temperature and outof- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with cardiac etiology. Methods: The study was conducted under a case-crossover design. Subjects were 97,500 patients aged 40 years or older with OHCA having a cardiac etiology in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka Prefecture from 2005 to 2012. We used national data with an Utstein-style resuscitation registration. Temperature was categorized into five categories with cut points of 5, 10, 24, and 30 °C. The reference category was 10–23.9 °C. Conditional logistic regression was used with adjustment for daily means of relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and daily amount of precipitation and hours of daylight. Results: Exposure to high temperature (≥30 °C) increased the risk of OHCA (OR = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.18). Further, low temperature (<5 °C) and relatively low temperature (5–9.9 °C) were also associated with OHCA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.16–1.25; OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.07–1.13, respectively). The temperature-OHCA association curves were U-shaped or J-shaped, and the association was more prominent among those aged 80 years or older. Conclusion: This study shows that the occurrence of OHCA with cardiac etiology is associated with low temperature. In addition, the occurrence is also associated with high temperature in those aged 80 years or older.

AB  - Introduction: Prompt recognition and treatment of patients with sepsis improve survival. Patients transported to hospital with sepsis often do not receive treatment until they are assessed in emergency departments. Initiation of treatments by paramedics at the point of first contact may improve outcomes for these patients. Methods and analysis: The study design involves two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted using a 2×2 factorial design comparing use of (1) early intramuscular ceftriaxone versus placebo and (2) an early liberal intravenous fluid strategy (up to 2 L normal saline) versus usual care resuscitation guided by paramedic medical directives. Patients who are ≥18 years of age will be eligible for inclusion if they have sepsis, defined as (1) paramedic suspicion of infection, (2) fever (temperature ≥38.0°C measured by paramedic or history of fever during the previous 24 hours), and (3) hypotension: SBP < 100 mm Hg. The primary outcome is mortality prior to hospital discharge or within 90 days of admission. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at 90 days after enrolment; organ dysfunction during first 24 hours (mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, dialysis) and hospitalisation (mechanical ventilation; dialysis); rates and duration of hospital admission; rates of ICU admission during index hospitalisation; discharge destination; proportion of patients with positive blood cultures obtained in hospital (first 24 hours); microbiological profile including distribution of microorganism species and resistant organisms; proportion of patients receiving additional antibiotics within 6 hours and within 24 hours of hospital admission; frequency distribution of first antibiotics (if any) delivered within 24 hours of hospital arrival; mean time to antibiotics delivered within 24 hours of hospital arrival (if any); proportion of patients receiving fluid bolus (>250 mL) within 24 hours of hospital arrival; total amount of crystalloid infused during transport and first 24 hours of hospitalisation; and proportion of enrolled patients not suspected to have sepsis or infection by emergency department physicians. Safety outcomes include the proportion of patients with pulmonary oedema during transport to hospital and on initial chest X-ray and the proportion of patients with anaphylaxis or suspected allergic reactions to study medication. Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved through Clinical Trials Ontario's streamlined ethics review process (board of record, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre). It will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulatory requirements. The final results will be disseminated to participating paramedic services through educational materials, presentations and interactive training. We anticipate our trial will achieve wide dissemination through publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presentation at international conferences targeting the fields of prehospital and emergency medicine, resuscitation and critical care. Trial registration number: NCT03068741.

AB  - Meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is a common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in neonates. Meconium has been considered as a sign of fetal distress occurring due to hypoxia which remains a major concern for obstetricians and Neonatologists. Good intrapartum care, timely interventions of all babies and selective approach of endotracheal intubation can reduce its complications to a greater extent. This was a hospital based retrospective cross-sectional study of neonates admitted at Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital (NMCTH) during the period of January 2021 to Dec 2022. A total of 4171 deliveries was conducted during the study period. Only 265 (6.35%) cases were with meconium stained amniotic fluid. Among them, 74 (27.9%) cases were vaginal deliveries and 191 (72.1%) cases born via caesarian section. Out of 265 babies with MSAF, 165 (62.3%) and 100 (37.7%) were male and female respectively. Baby's weight range was 2.5 to 3.5 kg. Among 265 neonates, two hundred and thirty-five newborns (88.7%) were vigorous and thirty neonates (11.3%) were non -vigorous and required resuscitation. Maternal risk factors for MSAF in increasing frequency were thick meconium, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, diabetes mellitus, premature rupture of membrane (PROM) and post term pregnancy. Babies with APGAR scoring less than 7 had Odds ratio (95% Cl): 9.31 (3.54- 24.43) that is babies had 9.31 times more risk of developing meconium aspiration syndrome than with babies of APGAR score more than 7. Out of 265 cases, 88.3% required resuscitation in the form of orogastric suction at birth followed by bag and mask ventilation in 9.8% cases. 117 (44.1%) babies were put on respiratory support. Out of 265 cases, 261 (98.5%) babies were discharged, 2 (0.8%) cases died and 2 (0.8%) babies were left against medical advice.

AB  - Background: In Taiwan, as the population ages, palliative care services (PCS) have expanded significantly to include comprehensive benefit plans for critically ill individuals, supported by reimbursements from the National Health Insurance program. However, incorporating palliative care into the medical management of these patients presents several challenges. We aim to evaluate the effects of palliative care interventions on medical resources in end-of-life scenarios, to promote earlier palliative care access and provide high-quality healthcare services for patients. Methods: A total of 2202 patients were included in this study. Primary diagnosis and referral for PCS were assessed using ICD-10 and HNI code. All study subjects were divided into three groups: patients who did not receive PCS (no-PCS), patients who received PCS before their final hospital admission (PCS-before), and patients who received PCS after their final admission (PCS-after). We evaluated (i) the effects of PCS on eight medical resource utilization outcomes within the 30 days preceding death and (ii) the effects of early intervention on two major diseases. Results: Initiating PCS before a patient's last hospital admission was associated with less aggressive medical interventions in the 30 days before death, including reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.25], and rates of endotracheal intubation (OR = 0.12), respiratory ventilator support (OR = 0.20), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR = 0.18), and blood transfusion (OR = 0.65). Among patients with cancer and lung diseases, those who received PCS prior to their final hospitalization of over 14 days experienced reduced hospitalization duration (OR = 0.52 and 0.24, respectively). Patients with lung disease also had significantly lower odds of ICU stays (OR = 0.44) and respiratory ventilation (OR = 0.33). Conclusion: The timing of palliative care intervention critically impacts on duration of hospitalization and ICU stay and the need for intubation procedures or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The findings can help the government and medical providers in developing comprehensive palliative care policies and programs to improve care quality and patient rights.

AB  - Anesthesiologists are broadly trained members of the health care workforce, managing patients daily using advanced stabilization/resuscitative techniques. They work in a collaborative, team-based model and lead multidisciplinary teams. Their work includes prioritizing patients according to the complexities of their disease presentations, and threats to life and limb. Trauma care is a regular part of the anesthesiologist's job. The presence of anesthesiologists is required in hospitals to achieve the designation "level 1" trauma center. Anesthesiology is a specialty known for promoting safe practice principles and improving quality of care, utilizing crisis resource management and implementing cognitive aids. Despite these skillsets, anesthesiologists are generally overlooked in disaster preparedness. The number of trained anesthesiologists is similar to that of emergency medicine physicians, and they are nearly twice as abundant as general surgeons. In countries outside the US, anesthesiologists are often included in the pre-hospital team. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the skillsets of anesthesiologists and to advocate for their inclusion in disaster preparedness teams. Due to their presence and comfort throughout the hospital system, broad training in emergent and elective cases, resuscitation skills, procedural skills, communication skills, daily triage, and team management, anesthesiologists should be considered essential leaders during mass casualty incident preparation and response.

AB  - Background: Despite recent improvements in the overall health status of Nepal's population, newborn morbidities and mortalities have remained a challenge. This study explores the situation and care strategies for newborn health problems in the Gandaki Province of Nepal. Methods: This is a retrospective hospital records analysis. A structured questionnaire was employed to collect data on socio-demographic, clinical, and outcome variables in 1,355 newborns admitted to the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) between May 1, 2021, and April 30, 2022, in five hospitals within the Gandaki Province. Results: Among all newborns, 60% were male, and 40% belonged to Janajati indigenous families. The mean age of mothers at the time of delivery was 24.4 years; the average birth weight of babies was 2.8 kg; and the gestational week was 38 weeks. Around 96% of births occurred in healthcare facilities. The average inpatient hospital stay was 4.7 days. The reasons for SNCU admission were newborn sepsis (51%), neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (23%), respiratory distress syndrome (18%), and low birth weight (11%). Approximately 7% of the newborns were found to have died due to various causes, including sepsis, asphyxia, and indirect medical reasons. Female newborns had a 0.45-times (CI: 0.23-0.84) lower risk of mortality compared to male newborns. Underweight newborns had 8.8 times (CI: 4.5-17.2) higher risk of death than newborns with a normal birth weight, even after adjusting for other factors like sex, delivery site, mode of delivery, mother's age, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal sepsis, and age at admission to SNCU. The most common treatments included injectable antibiotics (73%), intravenous fluids (53%), oxygen delivery (39%), and phototherapy (36%), while 3% received "Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)". Conclusions: The study showed that newborns suffered from multiple health complications such as sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, or asphyxia, and many newborns received essential medical services from hospitals. Birth weight, sex of the newborn, and respiratory distress syndrome were significantly associated with neonatal mortality. Hospitals should focus on reinforcing KMC, neonatal resuscitation, and early infection control measures.

AB  - Background Scrub typhus is a zoonotic disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi infection and transmitted by the bite of scrub typhus larvae. The diagnosis and treatment of scrub typhus and the level of care of health care workers in different regions are uneven, and the way of its nursing measures has become a clinical focus and difficulty, and there is an urgent need to summarize the nursing experience report of this type of serious cases to provide evidence-based basis for scientific care in clinical care. Aim Summarize the nursing experience of a patient with multiple organ failure due to scrub typhus. Methods By reviewing the severe cases of scrub typhus admitted to the hospital and selecting cases with typical characteristics by purposive sampling, data and information were collected through a circular form review method combined with semi-structured interviews in a multidisciplinary team to summarize the nursing priorities and difficulties. Results Nursing key points: a multidisciplinary health care team was formed to make joint decisions to implement treatment and care; Transnasal endotracheal intubation with ventilator-assisted respiration combined with prone position ventilation was implemented for the patient to improve acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive nursing care management to promote fluid resuscitation, highly efficient cooperation with electronic tracheoscopy professional nursing care to promote the recovery of organ function, and psychological nursing care combined with health education to alleviate the anxiety of the patient and his family. After active treatment and multidisciplinary teamwork, the patient's condition improved, and he was transferred to a specialist to continue treatment and was discharged on the 14th day of admission.

AB  - Background: Pleural tuberculous is difficult to diagnose. Culture is still considered the gold standard, especially in resource-limited settings where quick, cheap, and easy techniques are needed. The aim of the study was to evaluate resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs)-based thin layer agar (TLA) culture method for quick detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pleural fluid. Methods: Patients with suspected pleural TB were enrolled prospectively in our hospital, pleural fluid of all patients were collected, stained with Ziehl–Neelsen for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), cultured on Rpfs-TLA, TLA, and Löwenstein–Jensen (LJ) medium, and identified according to recommended procedures. Results: A total of 137 suspected pleural TB were enrolled and categorized, including 103 pleural TB (49 confirmed and 54 probable pleural TB) and 34 non-TBP patients. The sensitivity of Rpfs-TLA for total pleural TB was 43.7% (34.5∼53.3%), higher than that of TLA 29.1% (21.2∼38.5%) and LJ 26.2% (18.7∼35.5%) (p < 0.01), and all specificity was 100% in the diagnosis of pleural TB. Median time to detection of a positive culture was 11.8 days (95% CI 10.4∼13.4) for Rpfs-TLA, 21.0 days (95% CI 19.1∼22.9) for TLA, and 30.5 days (95% CI 28.5∼32.5) for LJ (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Rpfs-TLA is an accurate, rapid, cheap, and easy culture method, which makes it promising for use in clinical laboratories.

AB  - Objective: To understand the awareness and practice of delayed cord clamping (DCC) among obstetric medical staff in Jiangsu Province. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Obstetricians and midwives practising in Jiangsu Province, China. Participants: The online survey was created using the Wenjuanxing app and distributed through hospital administrators to WeChat groups of obstetricians and midwives for participation. Outcome: The questionnaire includes 28 items covering the respondents' basic information, their knowledge and understanding of DCC, and its implementation status. Data analysis was based on frequencies and descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 1001 people completed and submitted the questionnaire, with 866 included in the detailed analysis. This included 460 obstetricians (53.1%) and 406 midwives (46.9%). Among them, 50.7% reported being very familiar with DCC, and 49.3% reported being somewhat familiar with DCC. The overall routine implementation rate of DCC was 81.2%, with midwives (91.4%) having a significantly higher implementation rate than obstetricians (72.2%). In cases of caesarean section (89.8%), preterm birth (82.9%) and twin or multiple births (61.5%), most respondents chose to implement DCC. In cases of maternal infectious diseases, fewer chose to implement DCC: hepatitis B (31.9%), syphilis (24.4%) and HIV (18.4%). The main reasons for not implementing DCC were maternal bleeding or other emergencies (92.7%) and the need for neonatal resuscitation (88.8%). Conclusion: The awareness and implementation rate of DCC among obstetric medical staff in Jiangsu Province are relatively high, but there are differences in specific details of cognition and practice, and no standard protocols have been formed. The application of DCC should continue to be promoted, and the early introduction of localised practice guidelines and standards should be advocated.

AB  - Introduction: the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns restricted movement with non-essential hospital trips discouraged to prevent spread of the virus. Disruption of medical services can lead to increased seeking of medical advice and symptom management online. With COVID-19 known to worsen existing cardiovascular disease or precipitate a new one, we sought to explore online search trends of the Nigerian public regarding cardiac events before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: using Google Trends™, relative search volume for the terms 'cardiac arrest', 'heart attack', and 'heart arrest' were analyzed for the periods 27th February to 30th September in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test for relative search volume, search terms comparison in both years and Kendall's correlation coefficient for examining relationships between time frames and search terms were used. Results: searches for terms 'heart attack' (p < 0.001) and 'heart arrest' (p=0.01) were higher in 2020 compared to 2019, with a correlation between searches for 'cardiac arrest' and 'heart arrest' (p < 0.001) and between 'heart attack' and 'heart arrest' (p=0.01). There was a strong positive correlation between search for 'heart attack' in 2019 and 2020 (tau b=0.35, p < 0.001); and a moderate positive correlation for 'heart arrest' (tau b=0.13, p=0.01). Conclusion: increased online activity relating to cardiac arrest was recorded during the early months of the pandemic when compared to the year prior. Notable increases in search activity aligned with the timing of heart-related illnesses and deaths of Nigerian celebrities during the pandemic. Further understanding of health-related online search activity in Nigeria could inform the development of health promotion interventions and support health-related information seeking for cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - The global impact of life-saving medical devices is directly related to their availability. Access may be limited by cost, availability, or lack of information regarding effectiveness and safety. Addressing the inequity in access requires concerted effort from device developers, the research community, global agencies and professional organisations. We discuss, with examples, three strategies to promote equity: low-cost, purpose-built innovation, improvisation and off-label use. First, developing simple, safe and low-cost innovative devices can be an effective way of increasing global access. For example, the BabySaver Kit facilitates intact-cord neonatal bedside resuscitation. Re-usability is an important design feature for both cost and environment, exemplified by the MaternaWell tray for blood loss monitoring after birth. A second strategy is improvisation using commonly available hospital items. This can extend device availability into settings where purpose-designed devices are unavailable or unaffordable. Examples include the use of condoms or glove balloons for uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) to treat postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), elastic catheters for uterine tourniquet, and plastic tubing for posterior axilla sling traction in shoulder dystocia. However, the lack of systematically developed evidence and governance approvals can lead to wide variation in training, technique, and device specifications. Finally, some of these quality issues are addressed by using approved medical devices 'off-label.' However, they can have similar problems of variation in technique and depend on the uncoordinated efforts of researchers and clinicians to generate an evidence base. Examples include the Foley catheter for labour induction and the Levin stomach tube for suction tube uterine tamponade for PPH. WHO has pathways to facilitate global access to important public health device innovations. Global agencies and professional organisations also have a major role to play in providing co-ordination, platforms for data sharing, practice guidelines, instructions for use on off-label devices and robust data on their safety and effectiveness.

AB  - A 67-year-old, male patient presented with persistent epistaxis. A fever had developed five days before admission while the patient was staying in an urban area in Dacca, Bangladesh. He had no history of insect bites or dengue fever. On admission, his vital signs were temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure 119/78 mmHg. A physical examination revealed a diffuse, erythematous, maculopapular, pruritic rash with multiple, white patches (Figure 1), which were absent prior to admission. Laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia with platelet count 13 000/microL and normal hematocrit (46.7%). A dengue nonstructural protein 1 antigen test returned positive, confirming dengue fever. With supportive care, his symptoms and thrombocytopenia improved, and he was discharged on day 6. At the follow-up visit on day 9, the rash had completely resolved.... Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne, infectious disease primarily found in tropical and subtropical areas. However, the current increase in the number of cases worldwide due to the massive volume of global travel and expansion of vector habitats is raising significant public health concerns.1 The rash occurs in approximately half of dengue cases and is more common in primary than secondary infections.2 It is a convalescent feature that typically develops 2-5 days after fever onset.2 The erythematous, maculopapular rash with multiple, normal skin islets, often described as 'white islands in a sea of red', is characteristic of dengue fever and is thought to arise from an immune response to the virus or direct cutaneous viral invasion.1,3 The rash usually appears during the defervescence phase, which coincides with the period of thrombocytopenia, as observed in the present case. Although a large proportion of dengue patients recover shortly after the defervescence phase, some patients experience the development of critical systemic vascular leak syndrome requiring prompt fluid resuscitation in this period.1 Therefore, while white islands in a sea of red can be a sign of recovery in most dengue patients, it can also serve as a warning that the critical phase, which may be accompanied by fatal plasma leakage, is imminent. When encountering this characteristic rash pattern, clinicians should not only consider dengue fever in the differential diagnosis but also perform a careful evaluation, including an assessment of the platelet count and hematocrit, to identify any signs of severe dengue.

AB  - Generalized myoclonus (GM) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) implies a poor prognosis. Postanoxic GM is usually classified as one type of convulsive status epilepticus, which is also reflected by terms like myoclonic status, myoclonic status epilepticus, or postanoxic status epilepticus. Antiepileptic drugs commonly used in the treatment of status epilepticus such as phenytoin or valproate, however, are ineffective in the majority of these patients. Reports of single patients and our own observations indicated that propofol may control GM. This prompted us to use propofol as standard treatment of postanoxic GM in 60 consecutive comatose survivors of CPR. Even though propofol does not change the poor prognosis of patients with postanoxic GM, control of GM justifies its use. Cessation of GM is a relief for the relatives, who are often considerably distracted by the sight of their loved ones shaken by GM. It also eases nursing and ventilation of these patients.

AB  - Background: Methylergonovine is a vasoconstrictive agent historically used as a provocative agent in the lab for coronary vasospasm; it is also a first line uterotonic agent for management of postpartum hemorrhage. Case Presentation: A 29-year-old female with history of smoking and idiopathic thrombocytopenia received intramuscular methylergonovine after delivery of twins for intrauterine hemorrhage management. Subsequently, she had episodes of chest pain with high sensitivity Troponin I elevation to 1509 ng/L with accompanying septal T wave inversions, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction to 49% and basal septal wall hypokinesis. Computed tomography (CT) coronary angiogram showed patent coronary arteries and no coronary arterial dissection. The patient was conservatively managed with aspirin and metoprolol, and on follow up had fully recovered left ventricular function with resolution of wall motion abnormalities. Given this, coronary vasospasm due to intramuscular methylergonovine is the most likely cause of patient's chest pain and associated myocardial ischemia. Conclusions: Intramuscular, intrauterine, intravenous, and even oral methylergonovine can rarely cause coronary vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia. Cardiologists caring for postpartum patients should be aware of these potential lethal complications; prompt identification and administration of sublingual nitroglycerin can prevent severe complications of arrythmias, heart block, or cardiac arrest.

AB  - Aims at investigating the impact of early identification and timely interventions in the management of pediatric sepsis in the ED of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. The study is positioned to explore the impact of early diagnosis and prompt treatment on patient outcomes. It was a prospective observational study carried out in the ED of Lady Reading Hospital that included pediatric patients suspected of 450 cases of sepsis. Data collection was made regarding clinical presentation, recognition timelines, and emergency interventions like fluid resuscitation and the use of antibiotics and mechanical ventilation. Survival rate and length of stay in the hospital were assessed by relation to the timing of interventions. Early detection, within the first 30 minutes of the time of the occurrence, impacted positively on the survival outcome while early intervention had a positive impact on the survival outcome - within one hour after the event had occurred. The survival outcome was 90 percent when treatment occurred early. However, the survival outcome was 60 percent when the treatment occurred late. The average hospital stay was five days among early interventions, in contrast to an average of 10 days of hospital stay as recorded among the delayed interventions. The mortality was seen in correlation with delayed recognition and treatment, the count even going up to 30% in cases where treatment was delayed after one hour. An early diagnosis and timely intervention to manage pediatric sepsis is underscored by this study. Standardized management protocols in terms of sepsis should be introduced and improvement of triage and training systems in the ED should be done for easier diagnosis and treatment. These are many steps toward reduction in mortality by pediatric sepsis in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Background Cardiac arrest is a major health problem worldwide. For many of the afflicted, cardiac arrest is the natural end of life. For others, it is an unexpected event suddenly striking in the middle of life. During the last decades, major efforts in treatment have contributed to more people surviving their cardiac arrest. However, previous research has mainly focused on survival, while the knowledge about health-related quality of life in survivors is sparse. Hence, there is a need for more research in order to extend the knowledge about the living situations among survivors and their spouses. For example, factors associated with health-related quality of life are not sufficiently investigated. Knowledge about such factors is important in order to develop interventions and to be able to improve post cardiac arrest care. In addition, existing research shows incongruent results concerning differences in characteristics and survival between men and women. In order to provide equitable care between sexes, further studies are warranted. Aim The overall aim of this thesis was to increase the knowledge of survival and health-related quality of life among people suffering cardiac arrest with focus on sex and other related factors. The specific aims were: to describe in-hospital cardiac arrest events with regard to sex and investigate if sex is associated with survival after controlling for known predictors and interaction effects (study I), to describe health status and psychological distress among in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors in relation to sex (study II), to investigate factors associated with health-related quality of life among cardiac arrest survivors treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in relation to sex, and to compare their health-related quality of life with a general population, (study III) and to investigate if type D personality and perceived control among cardiac arrest survivors and their spouses were associated with their own and their partners' health-related quality of life (study IV). Methods The general design in all studies (I-IV) was quantitative, cross-sectional and correlational. This thesis is based on four different data collections. Data was systematically collected using national quality registries (I and II) or by sending questionnaires to survivors (III and IV) and their spouses (IV), treated at several different hospitals in Sweden. The sample size varied between 126 and 990 across the studies. The outcomes and explanatory study variables were chosen with respect to Wilson and Cleary's conceptual model of health-related quality of life. The main outcome variables were survival after resuscitation, survival at hospital discharge, survival at 30 days post cardiac arrest (I), and health-related quality of life measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (II and III) and the EuroQol-5 dimensions (II-IV). In this thesis descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. The main statistics consisted of logistic and linear regression analyses, and structural equation modelling. Results Male sex was associated with a better chance of survival to hospital discharge, but no associations between sex and survival after resuscitation or at 30 days were identified. More men than women received resuscitation attempts when suffering an in-hospital cardiac arrest (study I). Health-related quality of life among most cardiac arrest survivors was good (II-IV), even when compared to a general population (III). However, a significant proportion reported low health status and symptoms of anxiety and depression (II and III). Women reported worse health-related quality of life compared to men, and female sex was associated with poorer health-related quality of life in the multiple regression models (II and III).

AB  - Europa Oil & Gas (Holdings) plc / Index: AIM / Epic: EOG / Sector: Oil & Gas2 March 2015 Europa Oil & Gas (Holdings) plc (`Europa' or `the Company') Shareholder NewsletterEuropa Oil & Gas (Holdings) plc, the AIM quoted oil and gas exploration anddevelopment company with a combination of producing and exploration assets inEurope, is pleased to announce that a newsletter detailing ongoing and upcomingactivity across its portfolio of projects onshore UK, onshore France andoffshore Ireland has today been sent to subscribers and can be found at thefollowing link on the Company website:http://www.europaoil.com/documents/2015investorletter020315FINAL.pdfThe text of the newsletter, which does not contain any price sensitiveinformation, is repeated below:Dear InvestorThe first two months of 2015 have already brought several items of high impactnewsflow across our three areas of focus: onshore UK; onshore France; andoffshore Ireland.WressleOnshore UK, testing operations at the Wressle exploration discovery well inPEDL180 in the established East Midlands Petroleum Province commenced inJanuary 2015 and remain ongoing. The well was spudded in August 2014 and inSeptember we announced that we had discovered hydrocarbons in three levels. Thetesting operation is allowing us to evaluate hydrocarbon type through therecovery of oil, pressure data and other information that will enable us tobetter understand hydrocarbon phase, reservoir quality and reservoirperformance.The result of test 1 in the Ashover Grit was announced on 9 February andreported free flowing oil production rates equivalent to 80 barrels of oil perday (`bopd'), along with 47 thousand cubic feet (`mcf') of gas per day. Theresults of test 2 in the Wingfield Flags were announced on 19 February andreported free flowing oil production rates equivalent to up to 182 bopd, alongwith 456 mcf of gas per day. Test 3 in the Penistone Flags is ongoing. Clearlythis is a very promising start to operations and the data recovered is beinganalysed to enable an extended well test (`EWT').EWT operations typically involve production of hydrocarbons for a period ofweeks or months with the purpose of obtaining more detailed and insightfulinformation about reservoir performance. This information will be used todesign the optimum Field Development Plan (`FDP'). Europa and its partners willapply to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (`DECC') for approval ofthe EWT. When approving the EWT, DECC will specify the volume of hydrocarbonsthat we are allowed to produce. Any oil produced by the EWT will be sold.DECC approval of the FDP is also required before long term productionoperations can take place. It is currently anticipated that EWT operations,compilation of the FDP together with obtaining all relevant permissions andpermits for a development will take place during 2015. Exact timing of the EWTwill depend on the outcome of a reservoir engineering review which will definethe completion strategy and the surface package of equipment required. Europahas a very strong reservoir engineering capability and we will put theseabilities to full use in evaluating the Wressle test results.Kiln LaneOperations for the Kiln Lane exploration well in the adjacent PEDL181 haveproceeded according to plan and the well was spudded on 23 February 2015. KilnLane is a conventional oil prospect with gross mean un-risked prospectiveresources of 2.9 mmbo. In the event that we discover oil then operations willfollow a similar schedule to that at Wressle: after wireline loggingoperations, the well will be suspended and the drilling rig demobilised, wewill return with a dedicated test rig to undertake production testingoperations. Assuming exploration success, the timing of testing will depend onthe nature of hydrocarbons found which will inform detailed test design andspecification of equipment. Should production testing have a successful outcomethen we will follow up with an EWT and in parallel with this begin compilationof a FDP and other permitting requirements for a development.It is currently expected that these activities would take place during 2015 andthat any oil produced by the Kiln Lane EWT would be sold. Exploration successat Kiln Lane would be a playmaker and there are a number of conventional oilexploration leads elsewhere on the licence area that would be derisked and willbe further evaluated.HolmwoodThe planning inquiry for the Holmwood well in PEDL143 will be conducted in twoparts with the first for the original application site taking place in April2015. As a consequence of changes to the regulatory regime we have had to applyfor planning permission for the underground deviated well path. In the eventthat planning permission for the deviated well path is refused the planninginspector will hear the evidence in the second part of the planning enquiry andmake one decision for both the surface site and deviated underground well path.We are preparing very thoroughly for the inquiry. Following the inquiry it isexpected that the planning inspector's decision should be announced in H2 2015.A successful outcome would result in drilling the Holmwood exploration well,with 2016/17 being the most realistic timing for this activity. TheInfrastructure Act 2015 has recently become law and will facilitate subsurfaceaccess issues.14th Onshore UK Licensing RoundEuropa has bid in the 14th onshore UK licensing round and we anticipate thatthe results will become known in H1 2015. We understand that the round has beencompetitive with some 95 applications submitted and we hope that this highlevel of interest will result in a step up in exploration activity onshore UKover the next few years.Current ProductionOur onshore production remains an important source of revenue for the Company.As we have previously communicated, our existing fields are in long termdecline and the best way for us to increase production is through theexploration drill bit. We have got off to a good start with the Wresslediscovery and the Kiln Lane well offers another opportunity to find oil. Wecontinue to undertake initiatives to reduce operating costs at our fields andto minimise downtime. Obviously it is disappointing that the WF9 producing wellhas had to be shut in, however, at only 8 bopd, its contribution to our totalproduction was small. Rest assured that converting Wressle and Kiln Lane intorevenue generating production will be a priority should the EWT results bepositive.FranceIn France we announced on 16 February that we have farmed out the Tarbes Vald'Adour permit to Vermilion Energy. As should be expected, Europa does notprovide the market with a running commentary on progress of any of our farm-outactivity and will only make announcements once a farm-out document has beensigned. In this instance the Heads of Terms were signed in July 2014 and theintervening period was spent completing the detail of the farm-out. Under theterms of the farm-out, Vermilion will be assigned operatorship and an 80%interest in the Tarbes permit and will carry Europa for a €4.65 million workprogramme. Once the carry is fulfilled Europa will pay its 20% equity share ofany subsequent expenditure. Vermilion is the leading operator in onshore Franceand is the ideal partner for our operations. The farm-out is subject toobtaining government approval for the assignment of equity and operatorship andfor an extension to the term of the permit. The process for both of theserequired approvals began in H2 2014 and will take a number of months tocomplete. We hope to obtain the approvals at some point during 2015. The Berenxfarm-out process is on-going and announcements will be made when there issomething substantive to report.IrelandThe jewel in our crown is our Irish Atlantic offshore portfolio. Considerableprogress was made in 2014 and it is expected that a drilling decision will bemade during H1 2015. Following farm-out to Kosmos in April 2013 we converted toFrontier Exploration Licences (`FEL') in July 2013 and between July and OctoberKosmos acquired a 5,028 km2 3D seismic survey, the biggest ever in Ireland.Processed data became available in April 2014 and in early December 2014 Kosmosdelivered the prospect inventory. Across our two licences FEL 2/13 and FEL 3/13our new prospect inventory shows combined gross mean un-risked prospectiveresources of 1.5 billion barrels of oil (resources by definition arerecoverable). Prospects Beckett and Wilde in FEL 3/13 have gross meanprospective resources of 760 mmbo and 493 mmbo respectively and in FEL 2/13 theDoyle A and Doyle B prospects have gross mean prospective resources of 123 mmboand 69 mmbo.The new prospect inventory is based on state of the art 3D seismic which madefull use of all the latest technical developments in acquiring, imaging andinterpreting data in deepwater environments. The old prospect inventory wasbased on a sparse grid of historic 2D seismic of various vintages and dataquality. In these circumstances it is not unheard of for prospects to disappearcompletely once infill seismic is acquired. This is clearly not the case withour licences in Ireland: the new seismic has confirmed the presence ofprospects, with much greater confidence than before and the prospectiveresources are very large. This is a significant and positive development.Technical work is currently being conducted on prospect risking and ranking, inparticular using special seismic analysis to identify direct hydrocarbonindicators, flat spots, conformance and AVO anomalies. These are desktopstudies and do not require more seismic acquisition. It is currently expectedthat this work will be completed in H1 2015 and will enable a drill decision tobe made. If a decision is made to drill in summer 2016, then substantial workwill be conducted during 2015 to make the operation drill-ready. The IrishAtlantic Margin licensing round closes in September 2015 and we will beparticipating in it.Competent Persons ReportEuropa will complete and issue a Competent Persons Report during H1 2015. Thiswill be issued in two parts. Part 1 on the Irish portfolio will be issued firstand part 2 updating our UK and French portfolios will follow and will includeresults of Wressle testing and Kiln Lane drilling.OutlookOil is a cyclical industry and after three years of stable prices in excess ofUS$100 a barrel we are currently in a downturn. Three years ago the combinedvalue of the 100+ oil and gas companies on AIM was almost £20 billion, today itis just over £4 billion. Clearly these are difficult times for all oilcompanies, however, these circumstances do help crystallise action and createopportunities. As well as prudently managing our revenue and our cash wecontinue to evaluate consolidation opportunities and will not hesitate to actwhere we can identify value for Europa shareholders.Finally I would like to bid farewell to our outgoing Chairman Bill Adamson andwelcome Colin Bousfield as our new Chairman. Bill was responsible forrecruiting me into Europa and he has provided sound advice to the Board over anumber of challenging issues. We wish him well in his future endeavours. Colinis a proven deal maker and we hope to make full use of these talents.2015 has started well, with positive results from Wressle testing, commencementof drilling at Kiln Lane and the farm out of Tarbes to Vermillion. Themanagement and board at Europa are committed to maximising value forshareholders and we will continue to execute our plans to progress our licencesand expand our portfolio during the remainder of 2015. I am sure that when Iwrite to you again I will be reporting further success.Yours sincerelyHugh MackayCEO * * ENDS * *For further information please visit www.europaoil.com or contact:Hugh Mackay Europa + 44 (0) 20 7224 3770Phil Greenhalgh Europa + 44 (0) 20 7224 3770Matt Goode finnCap Ltd +44 (0) 20 7220 0500Simon Hicks finnCap Ltd +44 (0) 20 7220 0500Frank Buhagiar St Brides Partners Ltd +44 (0) 20 7236 1177Lottie Brocklehurst St Brides Partners Ltd +44 (0) 20 7236 1177NotesEuropa Oil & Gas (Holdings) plc has a diversified portfolio of multi-stagehydrocarbon assets that includes production, exploration and developmentinterests, in countries that are politically stable, have transparent licensingprocesses, and offer attractive terms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gastric and duodenal peptic ulcer disease (PUD) had been the nightmare to the doctors in the 19th to 21 century. The number of registered PUD cases increased at the time of industrial revolution. There has been sharp decline in the prevalence of PUD in the past few years. The concept of Helicobacter pylori has brought the drastic change in understanding the disease and its management. Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem consuming considerable amount of financial resources of the patient. In complicated peptic ulcers, successful management involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy and timely surgical and radiological treatment. METHODS: This is a prospective and observational study including 70 patients with Peptic Ulcer Disease who are undergoing treatment in the Department of General Surgery and Medical Gastroenterology. The study includes previously diagnosed patients appearing with complications in the EMD at Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre. The patient is followed up for 8 weeks. Data will be collected in person and from hospital records RESULTS: Majority of the patients from the studyhave the association of H.pylori as predisposing factory for the peptic ulcer disease(82%). These patients are treated effectively with appropriate medical management with no complications. Out of all the complicated peptic ulcer disease bleeding peptic ulcers(11.5%) were the major case followed by perforated peptic ulcer(2.8%) and oesophageal peptic stricture(2.8%). Bleeding peptic ulcers and oesophageal peptic strictures are better managed with minimal invasive procedure like hemoclip application and CRE dilatation respectively, where as perforated peptic ulcer is managed surgically with GRAHAM omentoplasty. CONCLUSIONS : Peptic Ulcer Disease, was a common disease in the past few decades, for which surgery was the main stray of treatment. In today's scenario, it can be treated effectively with conservative management. This study reveals that there is a high curable rate for PUD with appropriate medical management, yet complications developed due to improper medications and undiagnosed disease such are better treated with invasive procedures.

AB  - Aim To explore experiences of cardiac arrest in‐hospital and the impact on life for the patient who suffered the arrest and the family member who witnessed the resuscitation. Background Guidelines advocate that the family should be offered the option to be present during resuscitation, but little is known about family‐witnessed cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital and the impact on the patient and their family. Design A qualitative design consisting of joint in‐depth interviews with patients and family members. Methods Family interviews were conducted with seven patients and their eight corresponding family members (aged 19–85 years) 4–10 months after a family‐witnessed in‐hospital cardiac arrest. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The study followed the guidelines outlined in the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. Results The participants felt insignificant and abandoned following the in‐hospital cardiac arrest. Surviving patients and their close family members felt excluded, alone and abandoned throughout the care process; relationships, emotions and daily life were affected and gave rise to existential distress. Three themes and eight subordinate themes were identified: (1) the intrusion of death—powerless in the face of the fragility of life, highlights what it is like to suffer a cardiac arrest and to cope with an immediate threat to life; (2) being totally exposed—feeling vulnerable in the care relationship, describes how a lack of care from healthcare staff damaged trust; (3) learning to live again—making sense of an existential threat, pertaining to the family's reactions to a difficult event that impacts relationships but also leads to a greater appreciation of life and a positive view of the future. Conclusion Surviving and witnessing a cardiac arrest in‐hospital is a critical event for everyone involved. Patients and family members are vulnerable in this situation and need to be seen and heard, both in the hospital and after hospital discharge. Consequently, healthcare staff need to show compassion and attend to the needs of the family, which involves continually assessing how family members are coping during the process, and providing support and information during and after resuscitation. Relevance to clinical practice It is important to provide support to family members who witness the resuscitation of a loved one in‐hospital. Structured follow‐up care is crucial for cardiac arrest survivors and their families. To promote person‐centred care, nurses need interprofessional training on how to support family members during resuscitation, and follow‐up care focusing on providing resources for multiple challenges faced by survivors (emotional, cognitive, physical) and families (emotional) is needed. Patient or public contribution In‐hospital cardiac arrest patients and family members were involved when designing the study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest (CA) can activate blood coagulation. This study aimed to explore the potential prognostic value of prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (INR) in post-CA patients. Methods: The clinical data of eligible subjects diagnosed with CA was extracted from the MIMIC-IV database as the training cohort. Restricted cubic spline (RCS), Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve, and Cox regression analyses were conducted to elucidate the association between the INR and all-cause mortality of post-CA patients. Subgroup analysis, propensity score matching (PSM), and inverse probability of treatment (IPTW) were also conducted to improve stability and reliability. Data of the validation cohort were collected from the eICU database, and logistic-regression analyses were performed to verify the findings of the training cohort. Results: A total of 1,324 subjects were included in the training cohort. A linear correlation existed between INR and the risk of all-cause death of post-CA patients, as shown in RCS analysis, with a hazard ratio (HR) >1 when INR exceeded 1.2. K-M survival curve preliminarily indicated that subjects with INR ≥ 1.2 presented lower survival rate and shorter survival time, and the high level of INR was independently associated with 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, and in-hospital mortalities, with multivariate-adjusted HR of 1.44 (1.20, 1.73), 1.46 (1.23, 1.74), 1.44 (1.23, 1.69), and 1.37 (1.14, 1.64), respectively. These findings were consistent and robust across the subgroup analysis, PSM and IPTW analyses, and validation cohort. Conclusions: We systematically and comprehensively demonstrated that elevated INR was associated with increased short- and long-term all-cause mortality of post-CA patients. Therefore, elevated INR may be a promising biomarker with prognosis significance.

AB  - Background: A paucity of resuscitation studies have examined sex differences in patient-reported outcomes upon hospital discharge. It remains unclear whether male and female patients differ in health outcomes in their immediate responses to trauma and treatment after resuscitation. Objectives The aim of this study was to examine sex differences in patient-reported outcomes in the immediate recovery period after resuscitation. Methods: In a national cross-sectional survey, patient-reported outcomes were measured by 5 instruments: symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire [B-IPQ]), symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ESAS]), quality of life (Heart Quality of Life Questionnaire), and perceived health status (12-Item Short Form Survey). Results: Of 491 eligible survivors of cardiac arrest, 176 (80% male) participated. Compared with male, resuscitated female reported worse symptoms of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–Anxiety score ≥8) (43% vs 23%; <i>P</i> = .04), emotional responses (B-IPQ) (mean [SD], 4.9 [3.12] vs 3.7 [2.99]; <i>P</i> = .05), identity (B-IPQ) (mean [SD], 4.3 [3.10] vs 4.0 [2.85]; <i>P =</i> .04), fatigue (ESAS) (mean [SD], 5.26 [2.48] vs 3.92 [2.93]; <i>P</i> = .01), and depressive symptoms (ESAS) (mean [SD], 2.60 [2.68] vs 1.67 [2.19]; <i>P</i> = .05). Conclusions: Between sexes, female survivors of cardiac arrest reported worse psychological distress and illness perception and higher symptom burden in the immediate recovery period after resuscitation. Attention should focus on early symptom screening at hospital discharge to identify those in need of targeted psychological support and rehabilitation.

AB  - LONDON, March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The global airway management devices market is expected to reach USD 2.1 billion by 2025, according to a new study by Grand View Research, Inc. The growing prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases is a high impact rendering growth driver for this market. This increasing prevalence is presumed to be driving the clinical urgency to adopt airway management devices in order to improve the existing ventilation solutions and prevent conditions such as laryngospasms as well as reduce long-term cost associated with the conventional methods. In addition, advent of new-generation devices that incorporate a wide array of fiber optic, optical, video, and mechanical technologies to facilitate better view of and help management of difficult airways are gaining popularity. For instance, video laryngoscopes, which allow real-time and enhanced visualization, are rapidly becoming first-line measure in emergency care for efficient difficult airway management in hospitals as well as outpatient settings. The benefits of consistent technological advancements include improved optics, better aspiration capabilities, battery-powered light sources, increased angulation capabilities, and improved reprocessing procedures. The aforementioned benefits are anticipated to present the market with lucrative growth opportunities during the forecast period. Further key findings from the study suggest:Supraglottic segment is expected to exhibit lucrative growth during the forecast period. The exponential growth can be attributed to increasing adoption of laryngeal masks in wide range of clinical applications, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other medical emergencies Emergency medicine is anticipated to exhibit lucrative CAGR during the forecast period owing to increasing significance of these devices in rapid sequence intubation In 2016, North America held a dominant share of the global market as a consequence of local presence of prominent market players working toward extensive commercialization of their product portfolio Asia Pacific is anticipated to grow at an exponential CAGR due to unmet patient needs, continuous technological & infrastructural upgradation, and increasing healthcare expenditure The key participants such as Ambu A/S, Teleflex, Smiths Medical, Medtronic, Intersurgical, Armstrong Medical Limited and Becton Dickinson and Company are employing sustainability strategies to gain competitive advantage.

AB  - Background: The distinction between culture-positive sepsis and culture-negative sepsis regarding clinical characteristics and outcomes remains contentious. We aimed to elucidate these differences using large-scale nationwide data. Methods: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from the Korean Sepsis Alliance registry, comprising 21 intensive care units (ICUs) across 20 hospitals from September 2019 to December 2021. Patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were included. Results: Among 11,981 sepsis patients, 3501 were analyzed, all of whom were referred to the ICU through the emergency department (mean age: 72 ± 13 years; 1976 [56%] males). Of these, 2213 (63%) were culture-positive sepsis and 1288 (37%) were culture-negative sepsis. Compared to the culture-positive sepsis group, the culture-negative sepsis group exhibited less severe illness, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and less deteriorated vital signs. While pulmonary-origin sepsis was common in both groups, culture-negative patients primarily presented with pulmonary infections and had a higher incidence of respiratory failure. In comparison to the culture-positive sepsis group, blood cultures and the administration of empirical antibiotics were performed less promptly in the culture-negative sepsis group. Patients with culture-negative sepsis also showed lower compliance with fluid resuscitation (98.4% vs. 96.9%, p = 0.038; culture-positive sepsis vs. culture-negative sepsis) and received vasopressors earlier (31.1% vs. 35.9%, p = 0.012). In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (31.6% vs. 34.9%, p = 0.073); however, in patients with septic shock, culture-negative sepsis had higher mortality rates (37.6% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.029). The apparent appropriateness of empirical antibiotics in the culture-negative septic shock was higher than that of the culture-positive septic shock (85.2% vs. 96.8%, p < 0.001). Culture-negativity independently predicted poor prognosis in septic shock patients (OR: 1.462, 95% CI [1.060-2.017], p = 0.021). Conclusion: In patients with septic shock, culture-negativity was associated with increased mortality, despite the paradoxically higher appropriateness of empirical antibiotics than culture-positive patients. These contradictory findings suggest that the current criteria for determining the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy may not be valid for culture-negative sepsis.

AB  - The types of tenurial arrangements and incentives appropriate for the sustainable management of common pool resources (CPRs), such as forests, remain a topic of debate. In this study, we aim to (i) investigate the extraction level of forest resources under short and long-term property rights, and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of introducing mechanisms that leverage reputation and feelings of guilt in promoting cooperation among CPR users with short-term property rights to reduce over-harvesting. We develop a simple theoretical model to predict the optimal extraction level of a shared forest resource and validate the predictions using data from a framed field experiment conducted in rural Ethiopia. Our findings demonstrate that extraction levels under short-term property rights are higher compared to long-term property rights, aligning with the model predictions. Leveraging reputation and feelings of guilt is effective in bridging the gap in extraction intensity between short- and long-term property rights. However, as implementing reputation requires reliable monitoring that can be costly and challenging in the study context, we propose extending the duration of property rights over shared forest resources as a preferred strategy for curtailing over-extraction.

AB  - Importance: Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) are promising peripheral biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. However, their potential alterations due to alternative mechanisms, such as hypoxia in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, are not known. Objective: To evaluate whether the levels and trajectories of blood p-tau, Aβ42, and Aβ40 following cardiac arrest, in comparison with neural injury markers neurofilament light (NfL) and total tau (t-tau), can be used for neurological prognostication following cardiac arrest. Design, setting, and participants: This prospective clinical biobank study used data from the randomized Target Temperature Management After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM) trial. Unconscious patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were included between November 11, 2010, and January 10, 2013, from 29 international sites. Serum analysis for serum NfL and t-tau were performed between August 1 and August 23, 2017. Serum p-tau, Aβ42, and Aβ40 were analyzed between July 1 and July 15, 2021, and between May 13 and May 25, 2022. A total of 717 participants from the TTM cohort were examined: an initial discovery subset (n = 80) and a validation subset. Both subsets were evenly distributed for good and poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Exposures: Serum p-tau, Aβ42, and Aβ40 concentrations using single molecule array technology. Serum levels of NfL and t-tau were included as comparators. Main outcomes and measures: Blood biomarker levels at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Poor neurologic outcome at 6-month follow-up, defined according to the cerebral performance category scale as category 3 (severe cerebral disability), 4 (coma), or 5 (brain death). Results: This study included 717 participants (137 [19.1%] female and 580 male [80.9%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [13.5] years) who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Significantly elevated serum p-tau levels were observed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours in cardiac arrest patients with poor neurological outcome. The magnitude and prognostication of the change was greater at 24 hours (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), which was similar to NfL (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96). However, at later time points, p-tau levels decreased and were weakly associated with neurological outcome. In contrast, NfL and t-tau maintained high diagnostic accuracies, even 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Serum Aβ42 and Aβ40 concentrations increased over time in most patients but were only weakly associated with neurological outcome. Conclusions and relevance: In this case-control study, blood biomarkers indicative of AD pathology demonstrated different dynamics of change after cardiac arrest. The increase of p-tau at 24 hours after cardiac arrest suggests a rapid secretion from the interstitial fluid following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury rather than ongoing neuronal injury like NfL or t-tau. In contrast, delayed increases of Aβ peptides after cardiac arrest indicate activation of amyloidogenic processing in response to ischemia.

AB  - The intrinsic issue associated with the application of microbes for practical pollution remediation involves maintaining the expected activity of engaged strains or consortiums as effectively as that noted under laboratory conditions. Faced with various stress factors, degraders with dormancy ability are more likely to survive and exhibit degradation activity. In this study, a hydrocarbonoclastic and halotolerant strain, Gordonia polyisoprenivorans ZM27, was isolated via stimulation with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf). Long-term exposure to dual stresses of 10% NaCl and starvation induced ZM27 to enter a viable but nonculturable (VBNC)-like state, and ZM27 cells could be resuscitated upon Rpf stimulation. Notable changes in both morphological and physiological characteristics between VBNC-like ZM27 cells and resuscitated cells confirmed the response to Rpf and their robust resistance against harsh environments. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis indicated ZM27 could be a generalist degrader with dormancy ability. Subsequently, VBNC-like ZM27 was applied in a soil microcosm experiment to investigate the practical application potential under harsh conditions. VBNC-like ZM27 combined with Rpf stimulation exhibited the most effective biodegradation performance, and the initial n-hexadecane content (1000 mg kg-1) decreased by 63.29% after 14-day incubation. Based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis, Gordonia exhibited a positive response to Rpf stimulation. The relative abundance of genus Gordonia was negatively correlated with that of Alcanivorax, a genus of obligate hydrocarbon degrader with the greatest abundance during soil incubation. Based on the degradation profile and community analysis, generalist Gordonia may be more efficient in hydrocarbon degradation than specialist Alcanivorax under harsh conditions. The characteristics of ZM27, including its sustainable culturability under long-term stress, response to Rpf and robust performance in soil microcosms, are valuable for the remediation of petroleum pollution under stressful conditions. Our work validated the importance of dormancy and highlighted the underestimated role of low-activity degraders in petroleum remediation.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Transmural acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with a high risk for ventricular arrhythmia before, during and after treatment. Consequently, it is recommended that patients diagnosed with transmural AMI be monitored in a cardiac care unit (CCU) so life-threatening arrhythmias can be treated promptly. We examined the incidence and timing of in-hospital malignant ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac or arrhythmic death (SCD/AD) and resuscitation requirements in patients with transmural AMI recovering from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) undertaken within 12 h of symptom onset and without antecedent thrombolysis.<bold>Methods: </bold>This was a retrospective cohort study using the Duisburg Heart Center (Germany) cardiac patient registry. In total, 975 patients met the inclusion criteria. The composite endpoint was post-PCI ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, SCD/AD or requirement for resuscitation. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who met the composite endpoint with those who did not, recorded the timing of endpoint episodes, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with the endpoint criteria.<bold>Results: </bold>There was no significant difference in the length of CCU or hospital stay between the groups. In-hospital mortality was 6.5%, and the composite endpoint was met in 7.4% of cases. Malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurred in 2.8% of the patients, and SCD/AD occurred in 0.3% of the cases. There was a biphasic temporal distribution of endpoint events; specifically, 76.7% occurred < 96 h after symptom onset, and 12.6% occurred 240-360 h after symptom onset. Multivariable regression analysis identified positive associations between an endpoint episode and the following: age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.05] per year); left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.91-6.99); peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02 per 100 U/dl); leucocytosis (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.04-3.32), and coronary thrombus (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.04-3.27).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Most post-PCI malignant ventricular arrhythmias, SCD/AD and resuscitation episodes occurred within 96 h of transmural AMI (76.7%). A substantial minority (12.6%) of these events arose 240-360 h after symptom onset. Further study is needed to establish the influence of age, LVEF < 30%, peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration, leucocytosis and coronary thrombus on post-PCI outcomes after transmural AMI.

AB  - Background: Following successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, those survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) often suffer from severe brain injury, and the latter can result in significant mortality and morbidity. Emerging evidence implicates that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of post-resuscitation brain injury, and its regulatory mechanisms remain to be investigated. Recently, some studies manifested that long noncoding RNAs could be critical regulators of cell ferroptosis in diverse ischemia– reperfusion injuries of vital organs. This study was designed to explore the role and mechanism of a newly screened long noncoding RNA ENSSSCG00000035331 in alleviating post-resuscitation hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and further investigate its potential regulation by a novel antioxidant sulforaphane. Methods and Results: Healthy male pigs and mice were used to establish the models of CA and resuscitation in vivo. A hypoxia/ reoxygenation (H/R) model using primary porcine hippocampal neurons was constructed to replicate post-resuscitation brain injury in vitro. We found that the expression of ENSSSCG00000035331 was significantly decreased in the post-resuscitation impaired hippocampus using RNA sequencing analysis and verification. Subsequently, ENSSSCG00000035331 overexpression significantly reduced ferroptosis-related ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species production while markedly increased glutathione and further alleviated post-resuscitation brain injury. Mechanistically, ENSSSCG00000035331 interacted with miR-let7a, then inhibited its binding with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA and finally promoted the recovery of the latter's translation after H/R stimulation. In addition, sulforaphane treatment significantly increased ENSSSCG00000035331 and GPX4 expression while markedly decreased miR-let7a expression and hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and finally alleviated post-resuscitation brain injury. Conclusions: Our findings highlighted that ENSSSCG00000035331 was a critical regulator of hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis after CA and resuscitation by targeting the miR-let7a/ GPX4 axis, and additionally, sulforaphane might be a promising therapeutic agent for alleviating post-resuscitation brain injury by regulating the signaling axis mentioned above.

AB  - Background: Globally, approximately ¾ of new-born mortalities (NMs) occur within the first week of birth, and ¼ occur within 24 hours before discharge. Prematurity, infections, and birth asphyxia account for over 80% of global NM. Prompt and appropriate care including antibiotic prophylaxis, oxygen and surfactant therapy, thermal protection, feeding, and resuscitation can reduce NMs. The establishment and running of Neonatal Care units (NCUs) at the admitting health facilities (HFs) provides an avenue for needy new-borns to be admitted and managed. Therefore, this study evaluated the factors influencing the establishment and functionality of NCUs in the provision of quality inpatient new-born care (IPNC) to inform continuous improvement to accelerate NMs reduction. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted using a follow up explanatory mixed methods approach. The main study unit was an admitting HF where HF-based records and the characteristics that allows for the delivery of IPNC services were reviewed. Outcomes within each parameter were clarified through interviews with healthcare stakeholders to identify factors influencing the quality of IPNC provision at the HFs. The investigation was guided by a framework for maternal and neonatal care quality. Results: At least one NCU room was dedicated for the delivery of IPNC services in 12 (70.6%) HFs. Approximately 4819 (32.6%) of needy new-borns were admitted to NCU for management. Tetracycline eye ointment was unavailable in 90.3% of HFs. There was a mismatch between the availability and functioning of infant radiant warmers (92% vs 73%). Governance and access to resources were identified as key determinants of quality IPNC service provision. Conclusion: The establishment and performance of NCUs in Mtwara were sub-optimal. This study recommends further scope in the establishment and improvement in the functionality of NCU, not only in Mtwara but also in other similar settings.

AB  - Background: Post‐cardiopulmonary resuscitation brain injury (PBI) is essentially the cerebral ischemia reperfusion (CIR) injury, which is the main cause of death and long‐term disability in patients with cardiac arrest. So far, there is no treatment for PBI; thus, it is urgent to develop new drugs or therapies for the prevention and treatment of brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although multiple constituent herbs or active ingredients of Xinbao Pill (XBP) have shown neuroprotective effects, whether XBP could play a therapeutic role on PBI is still unknown. This study aimed to illustrate the neuroprotective effect of XBP on PBI and probe the underlying mechanisms. Method: We first performed the cell and animal experiments to validate the protective effect of XBP on neurological function. We next identified the potential differential metabolites via metabolomics analysis. We further conducted a comprehensive network pharmacology analysis including overlap gene analysis, protein–protein interaction network, and gene–biological process–module function network to preliminarily investigate the specific mechanism of action (MOA) of XBP against PBI. Finally, PCR, MTT, ELISA assay, as well as Western blotting experiments were made to validate our proposed molecular mechanisms. Result: The in vitro experiment showed that XBP could increase cell viability and ameliorate cell morphological damage in PC12 cells exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/RO) conditions. The in vivo experiment demonstrated that XBP improved the Neurologic Deficit Score (NDS), lowered the Neuron‐Specific Enolase (NSE) level as well as reversed the typical neuropathological changes in PBI rats, indicating its neuroprotective effect on PBI. Further metabolomics analysis identified 94 differential metabolites after XBP treatment, and multiple metabolites were highly related to CIR. Moreover, network pharmacology results revealed that the therapeutic effect of XBP on PBI may be relevant to mitochondrial quality control (MQC). Mechanistically, XBP could not only promote the expressions of marker proteins including PGC1α, NRF1, TFAM, OPA1, MFN1 as well as MFN2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion but also inhibit those proteins containing DRP1, MFF, FIS1, p62, PINK1, Parkin as well as LC3 in mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Finally, AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor was demonstrated to play a crucial role in regulating MQC. Conclusions: Our study first determined that XBP might be an underlying anti‐PBI formula, which also deciphered the potential MOAs of XBP against PBI by a network pharmacology approach combined with in vivo and in vitro experimental validation.

AB  - Introduction. Sepsis is an overwhelming reaction to infection with significant morbidity, requiring urgent interventions in order to improve outcomes. The 2016 Sepsis-3 guidelines modified the previous definitions of sepsis and septic shock, and proposed some specific diagnostic and therapeutic measures to define the use of fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. However, some open issues still exist. Methods. A literature research was performed on PubMed and Cochrane using the terms "sepsis" AND "intra-abdominal infections" AND ("antibiotic therapy" OR "antibiotic treatment"). The inclusion criteria were management of intra-abdominal infection (IAI) and effects of antibiotic stewardships programs (ASP) on the outcome of the patients. Discussion. Sepsis-3 definitions represent an added value in the understanding of sepsis mechanisms and in the management of the disease. However, some questions are still open, such as the need for an early identification of sepsis. Sepsis management in the context of IAI is particularly challenging and a prompt diagnosis is essential in order to perform a quick treatment (source control and antibiotic treatment). Antibiotic empirical therapy should be based on the kind of infection (community or hospital acquired), local resistances, and patient's characteristic and comorbidities, and should be adjusted or de-escalated as soon as microbiological information is available. Antibiotic Stewardship Programs (ASP) have demonstrated to improve antimicrobial utilization with reduction of infections, emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, and costs. Surgeons should not be alone in the management of IAI but ideally inserted in a sepsis team together with anaesthesiologists, medical physicians, pharmacists, and infectious diseases specialists, meeting periodically to reassess the response to the treatment. Conclusion. The cornerstones of sepsis management are accurate diagnosis, early resuscitation, effective source control, and timely initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Current evidence shows that optimizing antibiotic use across surgical specialities is imperative to improve outcomes. Ideally every hospital and every emergency surgery department should aim to provide a sepsis team in order to manage IAI.

AB  - Background: Over 30,000 people experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom annually, with only 7-8% of patients surviving. One of the most effective methods of improving survival outcomes is bystander intervention in the form of calling the emergency services and initiating chest compressions. Additionally, the public must feel empowered to act and use this knowledge in an emergency. This study aimed to evaluate an ultra-brief CPR familiarisation video that uses empowering social priming language to frame CPR as a norm in Scotland. Methods: In a randomised control trial, participants (n = 86) were assigned to view an ultra-brief CPR video intervention or a traditional long-form CPR video intervention. Following completion of a pre-intervention questionnaire examining demographic variables and prior CPR knowledge, participants completed an emergency services-led resuscitation simulation in a portable simulation suite using a CPR manikin that measures resuscitation quality. Participants then completed questionnaires examining social identity and attitudes towards performing CPR. Results: During the simulated resuscitation, the ultra-brief intervention group's cumulative time spent performing chest compressions was significantly higher than that observed in the long-form intervention group. The long-form intervention group's average compressions per minute rate was significantly higher than the ultra-brief intervention group, however both scores fell within a clinically acceptable range. No other differences were observed in CPR quality. Regarding the social identity measures, participants in the ultra-brief condition had greater feelings of expected emergency support from other Scottish people when compared to long-form intervention participants. There were no significant group differences in attitudes towards performing CPR. Conclusions: Socially primed, ultra-brief CPR interventions hold promise as a method of equipping the public with basic resuscitation skills and empowering the viewer to intervene in an emergency. These interventions may be an effective avenue for equipping at-risk groups with resuscitation skills and for supplementing traditional resuscitation training.

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether a fluid resuscitation strategy based on guidelines (at least 30 mL/kg IV crystalloids) vs. a restrictive approach with <30 mL/kg within three hours affects in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis and a history of heart failure (HF). Data sources: On 03/07/2023, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus for peer-reviewed papers and abstracts using the PRISMA guidelines. Study selection: The language was limited to English. Studies published since 2016 included if they had sepsis patients with a history of HF, or a subgroup of patients with HF, and in-hospital mortality data on these patients that did or did not meet the 30 mL/kg by 3 h (30 × 3) goal. Duplicate studies, studies that focused on a broader period than 3 h from the diagnosis of sepsis or without mortality breakdown for HF patients or with unrelated title/abstract, or without an IRB approval were excluded. Data extraction: In-hospital mortality data was taken from the final studies for HF patients with sepsis who did or did not meet the 30 × 3 goal. Data synthesis: The meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.4 program with ORs as the effect measure. The ProMeta program version 3.0 was used to evaluate the publication bias. Egger's linear regression and Berg and Mazumdar's rank correlation was used to evaluate the publication bias. The result was visually represented by a funnel plot. To estimate the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity, the I2 statistic was calculated. Results: The search yielded 26,069 records, which were narrowed down to 4 studies. Compared to those who met the 30 × 3 goal, the <30 × 3 group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.13-2.89, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Restrictive fluid resuscitation increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in HF patients with sepsis. More rigorous research is required to determine the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy for this population.

AB  - Background and aim: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue with low survival rates. Prompt bystander action can more than double survival odds. OHCA response training is primarily pursued due to work-related mandates, with few programs targeting communities with lower training levels. The aim of this research was to describe the development process of a targeted multicomponent intervention package designed to enhance confidence and training among laypeople in responding to an OHCA. Methods: An iterative, three-phase program development process was employed using a mixed methods approach. The initial phase involved establishment of a multidisciplinary panel that informed decisions on key messages, program content, format, and delivery modes. These decisions were based on scientific evidence and guided by behavioural theories. The second phase comprised the development of the intervention package, identifying existing information and developing new material to fill identified gaps. The third phase involved refining and finalising the material via feedback from panel members, stakeholders, and community members. Results: Through this approach, we collaboratively developed a comprehensive evidence-based education and training package consisting of a digital intervention supplemented with free access to in-person education and training. The package was designed to teach community members the specific steps in recognising and responding to a cardiac arrest, while addressing commonly known barriers and fears related to bystander response. The tailored program and delivery format addressed the needs of individuals of diverse ages, cultural backgrounds, and varied training needs and preferences. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of community engagement in intervention development and demonstrates the need of evidence-based and collaborative approaches in creating a comprehensive, localised, relatively low-cost intervention package to improve bystander response to OHCA.

AB  - Quick resuscitation of preserved anammox granular sludge (AnGS) is crucial for its engineering applications. In this study, the stimulation effect and its mechanism of folate addition on resuscitation of AnGS after the long-term cryopreservation were investigated. The folate addition was found to enhance the recovery of AnGS activity to 76.4% of the original level on the 8th day, which was 28.1% higher than the folate-free group (CK). The folate addition could also promote the community recovery of AnGS, in which the live cells and abundance of anammox bacteria (AnAOB) were 10.2% and 14.0% higher than those in the CK in the early phase of resuscitation. Besides, the folate addition was revealed to stimulate the AnAOB recovery of AnGS, with higher activity and cell number by 58.7% and 40.9% than those in the CK. Furthermore, the mechanism of folate stimulation was proposed on the resuscitation of preserved AnGS. The exogenous folate addition could enhance the CO2 fixation capacity of AnAOB, which further accelerated both activity and cell number recovery of AnAOB, leading to the strong stimulation effect on the resuscitation of AnGS. These findings could offer valuable insights for optimizing and innovating the preservation technology of AnGS.

AB  - Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality in the developed world. Timely detection of cardiac arrest and prompt activation of emergency medical services (EMS) are essential, yet challenging. Automated cardiac arrest detection using sensor signals from smartwatches has the potential to shorten the interval between cardiac arrest and activation of EMS, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival. Objective: This cross-sectional survey study aims to investigate users’ perspectives on aspects of continuous monitoring such as privacy and data protection, as well as other implications, and to collect insights into their attitudes toward the technology. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey in the Netherlands among 2 groups of potential users of automated cardiac arrest technology: consumers who already own a smartwatch and patients at risk of cardiac arrest. Surveys primarily consisted of closed-ended questions with some additional open-ended questions to provide supplementary insight. The quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and a content analysis of the open-ended questions was conducted. Results: In the consumer group (n = 1005), 90.2% (n = 906; 95% CI 88.1%-91.9%) of participants expressed an interest in the technology, and 89% (n = 1196; 95% CI 87.3%-90.7%) of the patient group (n = 1344) showed interest. More than 75% (consumer group: n = 756; patient group: n = 1004) of the participants in both groups indicated they were willing to use the technology. The main concerns raised by participants regarding the technology included privacy, data protection, reliability, and accessibility. Conclusions: The vast majority of potential users expressed a strong interest in and positive attitude toward automated cardiac arrest detection using smartwatch technology. However, a number of concerns were identified, which should be addressed in the development and implementation process to optimize acceptance and effectiveness of the technology.

AB  - Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rapidly progressive necrotizing bacterial dermo-hypodermitis of the perineum and external genitalia. It represents a real medical and surgical emergency requiring multidisciplinary care. Our study was based on the retrospective analysis of 18 cases of FG, collected in the Department of General and Visceral Surgery of Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital in Monastir over an 18-year period extending from January 2000 to December 2018. Our series included 18 cases of FG collected over an 18-year period, an annual incidence of one case per year. The average age of our patients was 58 years (36 to 77). The male prevalence was clear. Diabetes and old age were found to be the major risk factors. The treatment was based on an aggressive surgical debridement remains to be the cornerstone of therapy and is commonly preceded by patient preparation for the surgical act by perioperative resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, possibly accompanied by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The vaccum assisted closure (VAC) therapy is also used, which is a non-invasive system that promotes open wound healing. Healing techniques can be once the septic risk is controlled. Dressings topical treatments, such as fatty substances or calcium alginate, in addition to skin grafts, musculo-neurotic or musculo-cutaneous cover flaps can be used. During the follow-up period, no reccurrence occurred in 14 out of the 18 cases (2 patients were lost to follow-up and 2 patients died). A colostomy was closed in 10 out of 11 cases with simple follow-ups. Restorative surgery (partial thickness skin graft) at the perineal level was performed in only one case. Despite the better understanding of its etiopathogenesis, the advent of targeted antibiotic therapy, the establishment of a better codification of surgical procedures, the contribution of hyperbaric oxygenation and reconstruction techniques, mortality rates are still high and FG remains a real health threat, thus constituting a real medical and surgical emergency.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the effects of hysteroscopic uterine septum resection on the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), live birth rate (LBR) and miscarriage rate. Materials and Method(s): Hospital records of consecutive patients who underwent hysteroscopic uterine septum resection between February 2021 and December 2022 were reviewed. They were telephoned and interviewed about their reproductive performance after surgery, and pregnancy outcomes, if achieved. Results and Conclusions: Sixty-nine eligible patients were enrolled. Forty-one (59.4%) of these patients were referred to our clinic for otherwise unexplained infertility of at least 1 year and 28 (40.6%) for pregnancy loss. During the follow-up period, 32 patients conceived. The overall CPR was 46.4%, the LBR per woman was 36.2%, the LBR per pregnancy was 78.1% and the miscarriage rate was 12.5%. The LBRs per pregnancy were 83.3% and 71.4% in the infertility and miscarriage subgroups, respectively. The miscarriage rates per pregnancy were 0% and 28.6% in the infertility and miscarriage subgroups, respectively. Three of 6 patients whose uterine septum was incomplete but prominent became pregnant (CPR: 50.0%), and all pregnancies resulted in live birth (LBR per pregnancy:100%, LBR per woman:50%). Two patients with complete uterine septum didn’t achieve pregnancy. Hysteroscopic uterine septum resection may improve the CPR, LBR and miscarriage rates in subfertile population with and without previous pregnancy loss.

AB  - Introduction: Questioning is a key method in general information-seeking behaviour and teaching used by the dominant culture in Australia. Within an Australian health context the fundamental diagnostic tool used by medical staff is the biomedical interview or history taking, which is based on a battery of direct questions. Similarly, many health professionals rely on patient questions to prompt the sharing of information, or to make them aware of gaps in communication. This is problematic for many First Nations peoples, including Yolηu (First Nations people of North-East Arnhem Land), who are culturally less inclined to use direct questioning as it is deemed impolite within their cultural context. Methods: Semi-structured conversational interviews using culturally congruent communication processes were conducted with participants in their preferred language. Interviews were translated, transcribed and analysed inductively using NVivo v12. Results: A total of 30 participants were interviewed (10 health staff and 20 Yolηu with recent experience in engaging with health services). All participating health staff believed that questioning was essential for determining how to best treat patients but many felt that questions created problems for some Yolηu patients. They also felt that Yolηu patients ask fewer questions related to their health issues than patients of other cultures. Yolηu participants conveyed overwhelmingly negative experiences with the health system and at the tertiary hospital in particular. Yolηu participants described feelings of frustration, fear and trauma when talking of their experiences, and these feelings were often direct outcomes of poor communication with staff. Regarding the use of questions in health care specifically, Yolηu participants identified four key and interrelated conditions within which questioning was deemed an acceptable communication mechanism. Dhämanapan (connection) was identified as an essential condition for effective communication between health staff and patients. This connection was established and maintained through a shared understanding of matha (language), dukmaram (Yolηu understandings of healing) and djuηuny (Yolηu norms of polite communication). Strategies for overcoming barriers to effective communication related to the concept of dhuwurr (skill) in health communication, which could increase the acceptability of health staff asking questions of Yolηu and the confidence of Yolηu patients in asking questions of health staff. Conclusion: The findings from this study indicate a fundamental disconnect between the current health system and the needs of the Yolηu patients it seeks to serve. In order for this to change, Yolηu patients and health staff need to develop dhuwurr in health communication, which incorporates the four key conditions for effective communication identified in this study. To achieve this, ongoing and mandatory intercultural communication training for health staff is needed, just as mandatory training is required for hygiene and resuscitation training. Intercultural communication training must be comprehensive - reflecting the complexity involved in developing this dhuwurr - and sustained, for example with ongoing support from cultural communication mentors.

AB  - Global cerebral ischemia (GCI) during childhood is a leading cause of long‐term cognitive impairment, yet no therapies currently exist to promote recovery in survivors. We previously demonstrated that juvenile mice exhibit transient hippocampal synaptic dysfunction after GCI, associated with reduced brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and partial endogenous recovery over time. In this study, we tested whether delayed treatment with fluoxetine (FLX)—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) known to enhance BDNF–TrkB signaling—could accelerate synaptic recovery. Juvenile mice underwent cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, followed by in vivo FLX or vehicle administration from postinjury days 10–13. Electrophysiological recordings on day 14 revealed that FLX restored hippocampal long‐term potentiation (LTP) in males but not females. This effect was paralleled by an increase in hippocampal BDNF expression in FLX‐treated males, whereas no change was observed in females. Paired ex vivo experiments further confirmed that acute FLX exposure rescued LTP in GCI‐injured male slices. These findings suggest that FLX promotes synaptic recovery through BDNF–TrkB signaling in males, while recovery in females may proceed via alternate, hormone‐dependent mechanisms. Together, these results identify a novel therapeutic window for enhancing neuroplasticity after juvenile GCI and underscore the importance of developmental stage and biological sex in shaping responses to treatment.

AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of death and disability in humans. CA results in global cerebral ischemia (GCI), defined as a lack of blood and oxygen to the brain. It is well documented that resuscitated survivors experience neurological impairments, which negatively impact quality of life, and cognitive impairments in CA survivors are well documented in all age groups. Due to advances in resuscitative measures, the survival rate of CA patients has more than doubled in the past decade, resulting in an increasing population of CA survivors at risk of cognitive dysfunction. There are long-lasting deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning tasks and long-term potentiation, the cellular mechanism of learning and memory in CA survivors. However, much of the pre-clinical GCI literature focuses on cognitive impairment in adult animals. There are very few studies that evaluate cognitive function in juvenile CA survivors, in particular, juvenile female CA survivors. Thus, this study fills an important gap in knowledge about the neurological outcome in juvenile female survivors of CA.It is becoming apparent that CA survivors also experience emotional dysfunction. The presence of emotional dysfunction in CA survivors suggest amygdala dysfunction as an underlying cause, as the amygdala is considered the emotional center of the brain. Yet, amygdala dysfunction resulting from CA is not well characterized in clinical studies or pre-clinical animal studies. Thus, this study fills another important gap in knowledge by identifying deficits in amygdala function in adult CA survivors that may contribute to emotional dysfunction after GCI.We utilized behavioral tests, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, transcriptional assessments, sex hormone manipulation, and calcium imaging to evaluate the outcome of GCI on cognitive function in juvenile mice and to assess amygdala function in adults of both sexes. We found that juvenile female survivors of CA experience hippocampal dysfunction, which endogenously recovers within 30 days. We found that the cognitive deficit is due to inflammatory processes, which subside by the time of endogenous recovery, and that ablating gonadal sex hormone signaling prevents recovery and promotes a prolonged neuroinflammatory state in the hippocampus. We also provide evidence that endogenous recovery of cognitive function in juvenile female survivors is mediated by ERα signaling.In adults, we found that there is male specific amygdala dysfunction that manifests as a deficit in amygdala dependent associative learning and memory. We found that this associative learning and memory deficit is associated with a long-term potentiation deficit in a circuit that is known to be required for the acquisition of associative memories. But there is no LTP deficit in a downstream circuit. We determined that these deficits are not due to altered locomotor function or loss of neurons in the amygdala. We are, however, able to implicate elevated intrinsic and synaptic calcium signaling in BLA pyramidal neurons as the underlying cause of this amygdala dysfunction and exclude the possibility that NMDA receptors or spine calcium buffering or extrusion mechanisms are playing a role.

AB  - Background: Skilled birth attendants must be competent to provide prompt resuscitation to save newborn lives at birth. Both knowledge and skills (competence) decline with time after training but the optimal duration for refresher training among frontline-skilled birth attendants in low-resource settings is unknown. Objectives: We assessed the effect of an innovative Helping-Babies-Breathe simulation-based teaching method using video-debriefing compared to standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training on (1) neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills attainment and (2) competence retention among skilled birth attendants in Northern Uganda. Methods: A total of 26 health facilities with 86 birth attendants were equally randomised to intervention and control arms. The 2nd edition of the American Association of Pediatrics Helping-Babies-Breathe curriculum was used for training and assessment. Knowledge and skills were assessed pre- and post-training, and during follow-up at 6 months. A mixed effects linear regression model for repeated measures was used to assess the short and long-term effects of the intervention on neonatal resuscitation practices while accounting for clustering. Results: Eighty-two (95.3%) skilled birth attendants completed follow-up at 6 months. Approximately 80% of these had no prior Helping-Babies-Breathe training and 75% reported practicing neonatal resuscitation routinely. Standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training with video-debriefing improved knowledge and skills attainment post-training [adjusted mean difference: 5.34; 95% CI: 0.82-10.78] and retention [adjusted mean difference: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.52-4.41] over 6 months post-training compared to standard training after adjusting for confounding and clustering. Factors that reduced knowledge and skills retention among birth attendants were monthly resuscitation of one neonate or more and being in service for more than 5 years. Conclusion: Adding video-debriefing to standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training had an effect on birth attendants' competence attainment and retention over 6 months in Uganda. However, more research is needed to justify the proposed intervention in this context.

AB  - Cognitive impairment as a result of global cerebral ischemia (GCI) is a profound issue for survivors of cardiac arrest. The hippocampus is a region particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury due to its high metabolic requirements. Thus, large research efforts have focused on reducing the degree of acute neuronal cell death in the hippocampus to improve cognitive function; however, these neuroprotective strategies have yet to translate into the clinic, likely due to the narrow therapeutic window required for neuroprotection. Neurorestoration aims to fill this vacuum by restoring the surviving neural network through enhancement of synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation, broadening the therapeutic window for treatment. Our laboratory has previously modeled GCI-induced functional deficits in mice following cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). We observed hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning and memory impairments for up to a month following the injury. Intriguingly, we found genetic depletion or delayed pharmacologic blockade of the oxidative stress-sensitive, Ca2+-permeable TRPM2 ion channel restored hippocampal function after CA/CPR, offering a potential candidate for neurorestoration. While the TRPM2 channel has been extensively studied in the context of acute neuronal cell death, the mechanisms surrounding its role in synaptic plasticity remain unelucidated. Here, we provide overwhelming evidence of TRPM2 as a novel regulator of excessive GABAergic synaptic inhibition and excitatory/ inhibitory imbalance through activation of the Ca2+-dependent kinase CaMKII. We further find TRPM2 activation contributes to enhancement of GABAA receptor function and synaptic clustering at delayed timepoints following ischemia. Importantly, we implicate protracted astrocytosis via upregulation of CD38, an enzyme known to convert NAD to ADP-ribose, the TRPM2 ligand, as a potential upstream regulator of TRPM2 channel activation. We demonstrate delayed inhibition of CD38 restores hippocampal synaptic plasticity post-CA/CPR, phenocopying TRPM2 blockade. Our data further indicates CD38 as a regulator of GABAA receptor clustering via a TRPM2-dependent mechanism after ischemia. Overall, this research identifies a novel CD38-TRPM2-CaMKII pathway and astrocyte-neuron signaling as drivers of hippocampal dysfunction following GCI, highlighting promising new neurorestorative targets for drug development.

AB  - Background: As people age, survival after a heart attack can affect their quality of life and lead to a decrease in life satisfaction. After a myocardial infarction, elderly patients may experience physical, psychological, emotional and social changes that affect their thoughts and behaviour in relation to spirituality. Aims: To investigate the relationship between spiritual well-being and other sociodemographic and medical history-related factors on quality of life and life satisfaction among elderly people after myocardial infarction. Method: In a census-based cross-sectional study conducted at the Imam Reza Hospital in Amol, Iran, from May 2020 to May 2021, data on sociodemographics, medical history, subjective well-being, life satisfaction and quality of life were collected from 502 participants who were referred at the heart clinic. Results: The findings showed that spiritual well-being dimensions (religious well-being, [self-assessment of one's relationship with God], and existential well-being, [self-assessment of one's sense of purpose in life and life satisfaction]) were not significantly associated with life satisfaction, but a high perception of both dimensions of spiritual well-being were associated with higher self-reported quality of life. A history of past-year hospital admission and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were significant predictors of life satisfaction, and educational level was a predictor of quality of life. Conclusions: The study found no significant association between spiritual well-being and life satisfaction among elderly people following myocardial infarction.

AB  - Introduction: Orthopaedic trauma and fracture care commonly cause perioperative anaemia and associated functional iron deficiency due to a systemic inflammatory state. Modern, strict transfusion thresholds leave many patients anaemic; managing this perioperative anaemia is an opportunity to impact outcomes in orthopaedic trauma surgery. The primary outcome of this pilot study is feasibility for a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate intravenous iron therapy (IVIT) to improve patient well-being following orthopaedic injury. Measurements will include rate of participant enrolment, screening failure, follow-up, missing data, adverse events and protocol deviation. Methods and analysis: This single-centre, pilot, double-blind RCT investigates the use of IVIT for acute blood loss anaemia in traumatically injured orthopaedic patients. Patients are randomised to receive either a single dose infusion of low-molecular weight iron dextran (1000 mg) or placebo (normal saline) postoperatively during their hospital stay for trauma management. Eligible subjects include adult patients admitted for lower extremity or pelvis operative fracture care with a haemoglobin of 7-11 g/dL within 7 days postoperatively during inpatient care. Exclusion criteria include history of intolerance to intravenous iron supplementation, active haemorrhage requiring ongoing blood product resuscitation, multiple planned procedures, pre-existing haematologic disorders or chronic inflammatory states, iron overload on screening or vulnerable populations. We follow patients for 3 months to measure the effect of iron supplementation on clinical outcomes (resolution of anaemia and functional iron deficiency), patient-reported outcomes (fatigue, physical function, depression and quality of life) and translational measures of immune cell function. Ethics and dissemination: This study has ethics approval (Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Review Board, STUDY00022441). We will disseminate the findings through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Trial registration number: NCT05292001; ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Background: Poor knowledge of Basic Life Support (BLS) can lead to hesitation in delivering the prompt intervention, thus increasing mortality in people with cardiac arrest. We set out to determine the level of knowledge of Basic Life Support among doctors and nurses working in a teaching hospital in Nigeria. Methodology: Self-administered questionnaires were employed in a descriptive, cross-sectional study to assess the knowledge of doctors and nurses. The overall knowledge score and separate scores for doctors and nurses were calculated. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20. Results: Two hundred and fifty participants (18-59) years were evaluated. There were more females (153, 61.2%) and more nurses (149, 59.8%). Sixty (24%) participants had received at least one previous BLS training. One hundred and one (40.4%) participants scored ≥50%. The overall average score was 43.6%. The average score for doctors and nurses was 45.1% and 42.7%, respectively. Knowledge in some domains was very low, viz: sequence in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (2.8%), compression-to-breath ratio (2.8%) and compression rate (32.3%). There was no significant difference in knowledge score by profession, gender, previous exposure to BLS training, number of years post-qualified and number of years in service. Conclusion: Healthcare workers in Nigeria have poor knowledge of BLS. They require training and re-training in BLS via creative and innovative means that are best suited for resource-poor countries.

AB  - Background: In Taiwan, as the population ages, palliative care services (PCS) have expanded significantly to include comprehensive benefit plans for critically ill individuals, supported by reimbursements from the National Health Insurance program. However, incorporating palliative care into the medical management of these patients presents several challenges. We aim to evaluate the effects of palliative care interventions on medical resources in end-of-life scenarios, to promote earlier palliative care access and provide high-quality healthcare services for patients. Methods: A total of 2202 patients were included in this study. Primary diagnosis and referral for PCS were assessed using ICD-10 and HNI code. All study subjects were divided into three groups: patients who did not receive PCS (no-PCS), patients who received PCS before their final hospital admission (PCS-before), and patients who received PCS after their final admission (PCS-after). We evaluated (i) the effects of PCS on eight medical resource utilization outcomes within the 30 days preceding death and (ii) the effects of early intervention on two major diseases. Results: Initiating PCS before a patient’s last hospital admission was associated with less aggressive medical interventions in the 30 days before death, including reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.25], and rates of endotracheal intubation (OR = 0.12), respiratory ventilator support (OR = 0.20), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR = 0.18), and blood transfusion (OR = 0.65). Among patients with cancer and lung diseases, those who received PCS prior to their final hospitalization of over 14 days experienced reduced hospitalization duration (OR = 0.52 and 0.24, respectively). Patients with lung disease also had significantly lower odds of ICU stays (OR = 0.44) and respiratory ventilation (OR = 0.33). Conclusion: The timing of palliative care intervention critically impacts on duration of hospitalization and ICU stay and the need for intubation procedures or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The findings can help the government and medical providers in developing comprehensive palliative care policies and programs to improve care quality and patient rights.

AB  - Background: Reduction of Tanzania's neonatal mortality rate has lagged behind that for all under-fives, and perinatal mortality has remained stagnant over the past two decades. We conducted a national verbal and social autopsy (VASA) study to estimate the causes and social determinants of stillbirths and neonatal deaths with the aim of identifying relevant health care and social interventions. Methods: A VASA interview was conducted of all stillbirths and neonatal deaths in the prior 5 years identified by the 2015-16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey. We evaluated associations of maternal complications with antepartum and intrapartum stillbirth and leading causes of neonatal death; conducted descriptive analyses of antenatal (ANC) and delivery care and mothers' careseeking for complications; and developed logistic regression models to examine factors associated with delivery place and mode. Results: There were 204 stillbirths, with 185 able to be classified as antepartum (88 [47.5%]) or intrapartum (97 [52.5%]), and 228 neonatal deaths. Women with an intrapartum stillbirth were 6.5% (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.065, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.002, 1.132) more likely to have a C-section for every additional hour before delivery after reaching the birth attendant. Antepartum hemorrhage (APH), maternal anemia, and premature rupture of membranes (PROM) were significantly positively associated with early neonatal mortality due to preterm delivery, intrapartum-related events and serious infection, respectively. While half to two-thirds of mothers made four or more ANC visits (ANC4+), a third or fewer received quality ANC (Q-ANC). Women with a complication were more likely to deliver at hospital only if they received Q-ANC (neonates: aOR = 4.5, 95% CI 1.6, 12.3) or ANC4+ (stillbirths: aOR = 11.8, 95% CI 3.6, 38.0). Nevertheless, urban residence was the strongest predictor of hospital delivery. Conclusions: While Q-ANC and ANC4 + boosted hospital delivery among women with a complication, attendance was low and the quality of care is critical. Quality improvement efforts in urban and rural areas should focus on early detection and management of APH, maternal anemia, PROM, and prolonged labor, and on newborn resuscitation.

AB  - Background: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors’ physiological outcomes have been addressed, less is known on the holistic needs of individuals after OHCA, which hinders our ability to prioritize care around what really matters to survivors. Aim: The aim of this study was to interpretatively synthesize qualitative findings on OHCA survivors’ perceptions and meanings of life and death and existential issues. Methods: We used a meta-ethnographic synthesis of published qualitative studies addressing the experiences of OHCA survivors based on a systematic literature search (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed). Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The identified studies were subjected to a quality appraisal based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Results: Based on eligibility criteria, 6 phenomenological studies were included, of overall medium to high quality. One core theme, “the reality of death,” and 4 main themes were identified: “redefining existence”; “revaluing death”; “being familiar with, yet oblivious of death”; and “living consciously.” Emerging from the realization of death, the themes appeared to describe a gradual progression toward living consciously. Conclusions: An existential trajectory and a need for meaning are central in the experience of OHCA survivors. When existential issues are not addressed, the ongoing suffering may interfere with survivors’ recovery and quality of life. Future research needs to address specific needs and ways to support survivors’ meaning-making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Experimental reproducibility in aquatic microbial ecology is critical to predict the dynamics of microbial communities. However, controlling the initial composition of naturally occurring microbial communities that will be used as the inoculum in experimental setups is challenging, because a proper method for the preservation of those communities is lacking. To provide a feasible method for preservation and resuscitation of natural aquatic prokaryote assemblages, we developed a cryopreservation procedure applied to natural aquatic prokaryotic communities. We studied the impact of inoculum size, processing time, and storage time on the success of resuscitation. We further assessed the effect of different growth media supplemented with dissolved organic matter (DOM) prepared from naturally occurring microorganisms on the recovery of the initially cryopreserved communities obtained from two sites that have contrasting trophic status and environmental heterogeneity. Our results demonstrated that the variability of the resuscitation process among replicates decreased with increasing inoculum size. The degree of similarity between initial and resuscitated communities was influenced by both the growth medium and origin of the community. We further demonstrated that depending on the inoculum source, 45–72% of the abundant species in the initially natural microbial communities could be detected as viable cells after cryopreservation. Processing time and long-term storage up to 12 months did not significantly influence the community composition after resuscitation. However, based on our results, we recommend keeping handling time to a minimum and ensure identical incubation conditions for repeated resuscitations from cryo-preserved aliquots at different time points. Given our results, we recommend cryopreservation as a promising tool to advance experimental research in the field of microbial ecology.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic may have compounded social disparities in access to healthcare, with possible deleterious consequences on the functional prognosis of patients after a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the previous RECOVIDS study, we reported that despite comparable pulmonary sequelae and similar access to rehabilitation, socio-economically “vulnerable” patients had lower quality of life at 6 months after an ICU stay. We aimed to describe the barriers to, and facilitators of participation in rehabilitation, among patients from the RECOVIDS study, regardless of their socio-economic situation. Methods: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with adult patients admitted to ICU for PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, and who had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or had received high flow nasal oxygen. In addition, patients had to have been living at home for the month prior to the interview and had to be proficient in French. Eligible patients were randomly selected, aiming to select the same number of socially deprived and non-socially-deprived patients. Interviews were transcribed for thematic analysis. Results: In total, 31 interviews were performed from 10/2021 to 01/2022; 16 with socially deprived, and 15 with non-deprived participants. Average age was 65.2 (±11.6) years. Four themes emerged from the analysis of the interviews, namely: (1) the impact of the patient’s professional and socio-economic situation; (2) the feeling that age and socio-economic situation influence access to rehabilitation; (3) a perception that the healthcare system was saturated, and that inequalities exist in access to rehabilitation resources; (4) perception of previous own health and expectations of post-resuscitation health status. Conclusion: A precarious socio-economic situation has a substantial impact on access to rehabilitation after ICU admission for ARDS caused by COVID-19. It represents a barrier to rehabilitation through the combined action of various social determinants that deserve to be detected early, in order to take appropriate action to ensure that the most socially vulnerable individuals can benefit from access to rehabilitation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the current practice of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for Chinese cardiac arrest patients after the publication of 2015 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to healthcare providers of emergency departments (EDs) and/or Intensive Care Units (ICUs) across 52 hospitals in China from August to November 2016. Data collection ended in February 2017. The questionnaire included three parts: (1) characteristics of the departments and the respondents; (2) knowledge about ECPR; (3) practice of ECPR in cardiac arrest patients (case volume, inclusion/exclusion criteria, ECPR procedure). The characteristics of the departments/hospitals were only answered by the head of the department. Results: A total of 1 952 (86.8%) respondents fulfilled the survey. Only 2.5% of the respondents from 3 of 52 hospitals performed ECPR. Among the three hospitals, the case number of ECPR were ≤5 per year and none of them had written ECPR procedures. Only one hospital had formal inclusion/exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included age between 18 to 60 years, suspected cardiogenic cardiac arrest, beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation <5 min after cardiac arrest and duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation >10 min. The top three reasons for the nonuse of ECPR were unknown fields (31.2%), potential ECMO-related side effects (26.9%) and cost (18.7%). Conclusions: ECPR for cardiac arrest patients are not well understood by healthcare providers in the emergency department or ICUs and its application is still in the early stage in China. Educational training and other interventions are needed to promote the clinical practice.

AB  - Community-based conservation is advocated as an idea that long-term conservation success requires engaging with, providing benefits for, and establishing institutions representing local communities. However, community-based conservation's efficacy and impact in sustainable resource management varies depending on national natural resource policies and implications for local institutional arrangements. This paper analyses the significance of natural resource management policies and institutional design on the management of common pool resources (CPRs), by comparing Namibian conservancies and community forests. To meet this aim, we reviewed key national policies pertinent to natural resource governance and conducted 28 semi-structured interviews between 2012 and 2013. Key informants included conservancy and community forest staff and committee members, village headmen, NGO coordinators, regional foresters, wildlife officials (wardens), and senior government officials in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry. We explored the following questions: how do national natural resource management policies affect the operations of local common pool resource institutions? and how do external factors affect local institutions and community participation in CPRs decision-making? Our results show that a diversity of national policies significantly influenced local institutional arrangements. Formation of conservancies and community forests by communities is not only directly linked with state policies designed to increase wildlife numbers and promote forest growth or improve condition, but also formulated primarily for benefits from and control over natural resources. The often-assumed direct relationship between national policies and local institutional arrangements does not always hold in practice, resulting in institutional mismatch. We aim to advance theoretical and applied discourse on common pool resource governance in social-ecological systems, with implications for sustainable land management policies in Namibia and other landscapes across sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) and their family members often experience significant fear-based distress (cardiac fear; i.e., fear about the CA survivor’s heart). Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors’ outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (<i>N</i> = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants’ mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White). Recruitment (16/25 referred; 64.0%), retention (14/16 enrolled; 87.5%), and intervention adherence (7/10 completed; 70%) were promising. Most agreed that the ICU diary intervention was appropriate (7/10 completed; 70.0%), feasible (9/10 completed; 90.0%]), and acceptable (8/10 completed; 80.0%). Fear was nonsignificantly lower in intervention participants (v. control) at end of hospital care and 30 days later. FAID Fear represents a first step in building theory-based dyadic interventions that can be implemented to support family members of CA survivors in the ICU, with potential to improve outcomes in CA survivors.

AB  - The gastric-dilatation volvulus syndrome is a lethal digestive disease if it's not addressed promptly because it causes an obstructive shock. Upon admission, the assessment of perfusion clinical parameters and lactatemia monitoringare necessary because they are the reflection of the disease severity. Their follow-up will enable to assess the medical resuscitation efficacy. Medical resuscitation consists mostly in rapid onset of fluidotherapy in association with gastric decompression by nasogastric tube placement or orogastric incubation or gastric trocharization. In the postoperative period. ischemic-reperfusion injuries are the main cause of complications, with the frequent occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias disease, not all of which requiring specific therapy.

AB  - Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is one of the leading causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite the adequate neonatal resuscitation techniques, hypoxicischemic encephalopathy (HIE) may develop in survivors. Controlled therapeutic hypothermia (TH) became the gold standard care of asphyxiated babies, but its efficacy to prevent long-term disabilities is limited, therefore, additional neuroprotective interventions are required urgently. The newborn pig is regarded as one of the best models for human PA/HIE pathology and testing putative therapeutic interventions. The best methodology to elicit pathophysiologically/clinically relevant PA insult in animals is still being debated perhaps resulting in some of the failures of alleged neuroprotective therapies in clinical trials. Our major aim was to create a translationally relevant newborn piglet PA/HIE model. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) on cortical blood flow (CoBF), a routinely applied method in the literature to augment hypoxic stress. Then we developed and extensively characterized our new PA/HIE model of PA/HIE and subsequently tested the neuroprotective potential of molecular H2in our model. Newborn piglets were anesthetized, instrumented and mechanically ventilated. The effects of BCAO on CoBF were analysed through an implanted cranial window by laser speckle contrast imaging and analysis. PA (6%O2, 20%CO2, 20min) was induced in separate groups of animals to elicit HIE. One group served for testing the effects of H2 administered during reventilation (2.1%H2, 21%O2,4h) on brain electrical activity, neuronal damage and oxidative stress at 24h survival).BCAO did not reduce CoBF. PA elicited clinically relevant severe alterations in cardiovascular and blood gas/metabolic parameters, resulting in depressed electroencephalogram (EEG), extensive neuronal damage associated with oxidative stress assessed by 8-OHdG immunoreactivity. Molecular H2facilitated EEG recovery, ameliorated neonatal brain injury and alleviated oxidative stress. In conclusion, our new PA method was able to elicit reproducible, moderate/severe HIE without BCAO. The model was adequate to reveal the neuroprotective effect of molecular H2 administered in a clinically relevant, post-insult time window. The mechanism of neuroprotection appears to involve the reduction of oxidative stress. Encouraged by these promising results, to describe the effect of H2administration combined with TH remains our future direction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Respiratory distress in newborns is a very common reason for admission in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit which may be transient or pathological; morbidity is high if not prompted for early diagnosis and treatment. The present study is undertaken to find out the clinical profile of neonates with respiratory distress in infants in a tertiary care hospital in western Nepal. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in the western region of Nepal from April 2017 to March 2018 after approval from the Institutional Review Committee. Convenience sampling was done. Data were collected from the study population after taking consent and entered in a predesigned proforma. Data was then entered in a Statistical Package for Social Sciences for further calculations. Results: Tachypnea was the most common presentation 77 (69.36%). Out of 1694 live deliveries during the study period, the prevalence of respiratory distress was 6.55% in the total live deliveries while 30.83% in admitted cases in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Survival rate was 95.50% while mortality rate accounted for 4.50%. Conclusions: Perinatal asphyxia accounted for the commonest cause of respiratory distress. To lessen the morbidity and mortality of the neonates with respiratory distress it is advocated that we practice proper and timely neonatal resuscitation, recognize the risk factors as early as possible so that perinatal asphyxia can be minimized.

AB  - Importance: Brain injury affects neurologic function and quality of life in survivors after cardiac arrest. Objective: To compare the effects of 2 target temperature regimens on long-term cognitive function and quality of life after cardiac arrest. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multicenter, international, parallel group, assessor-masked randomized clinical trial performed from November 11, 2010, through January 10, 2013, we enrolled 950 unconscious adults with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause from 36 intensive care units in Europe and Australia. Eleven patients were excluded from analysis for a total sample size of 939. Interventions: Targeted temperature management at 33°C vs 36°C. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cognitive function was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and assessed by observers through the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Patients reported their activities in daily life and mental recovery through Two Simple Questions and their quality of life through the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2. Results: In the modified intent-to-treat population, including nonsurvivors, the median MMSE score was 14 in the 33°C group (interquartile range [IQR], 0-28) vs 17 in the 36°C group (IQR, 0-29) (<i>P</i> = .77), and the IQCODE score was 115 (IQR, 79-130) vs 115 (IQR, 80-130) (<i>P</i> = .57) in the 33°C and 36°C groups, respectively. The median MMSE score for survivors was within the reference range and similar (33°C group median, 28; IQR, 26-30; vs 36°C group median, 28; IQR, 25-30; <i>P</i> = .61). The median IQCODE score was within the minor deficit range (33°C group median, 79.5; IQR, 78.0-85.9; vs 36°C group median, 80.7; IQR, 78.0-86.9; <i>P</i> = .04). A total of 18.8% vs 17.5%of survivors reported needing help with everyday activities (<i>P</i> = .71), and 66.5% in the 33°C group vs 61.8%in the 36°C group reported that they thought they had made a complete mental recovery (<i>P</i> = .32). The mean (SD) mental component summary score was 49.1 (12.5) vs 49.0 (12.2) (<i>P</i> = .79), and the mean (SD) physical component summary score was 46.8 (13.8) and 47.5 (13.8) (<i>P</i> = .45), comparable to the population norm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Quality of life was good and similar in patients with cardiac arrest receiving targeted temperature management at 33°C or 36°C. Cognitive function was similar in both intervention groups, but many patients and observers reported impairment not detected previously by standard outcome scales.

AB  - Objectives: To examine long-term survival and quality of life of patients with early septic shock. Design: Prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial. Setting: Fifty-one hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Hong Kong, and the Republic of Ireland. Patients: One-thousand five-hundred ninety-one patients who presented to the emergency department with early septic shock between October 2008 and April 2014, and were enrolled in the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation trial. Interventions: Early goal-directed therapy versus usual care. Measurements and Main Results: Long-term survival was measured up to 12 months post-randomization. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQoL-5D-3L, Short Form 36 and Assessment of Quality of Life 4D at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months following randomization. Mortality data were available for 1,548 patients (97.3%) and 1,515 patients (95.2%) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Health-related quality of life data were available for 85.1% of survivors at 12 months. There were no significant differences in mortality between groups at either 6 months (early goal-directed therapy 21.8% vs usual care 22.6%; p = 0.70) or 12 months (early goal-directed therapy 26.4% vs usual care 27.9%; p = 0.50). There were no group differences in health-related quality of life at either 6 or 12 months (EuroQoL-5D-3L utility scores at 12 mo early goal-directed therapy 0.65 ± 0.33 vs usual care 0.64 ± 0.34; p = 0.50), with the health-related quality of life of both groups being significantly lower than population norms. Conclusions: In patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock, early goal-directed therapy compared with usual care did not reduce mortality nor improve health-related quality of life at either 6 or 12 months.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation is to contribute to the discussion about the potential impact of the advance care planning (ACP) process on end-of-life care. This dissertation aims to achieve this through three research studies that explore documentation of a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order and patient outcomes. In the first study, the association between end-of-life care and costs is explored in the context of increasing healthcare expenditures. Although the primary benefit of ACP is that it aligns patients' wishes with the treatment they receive, a secondary benefit may be cost-savings. Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample is used to examine whether a documented DNR order among 700,922 hospital inpatients with heart failure (HF) was associated with costs and other outcomes between the years of 2011 and 2016. The results indicate that the presence of a DNR among this population is associated with lower total costs, a shorter hospital stay, and a higher risk of mortality, particularly when a patient with a DNR in place dies. These findings add to the evidence that ACP may aid in containing health care costs, and policies that promote ACP may not only help patients get the care they prefer but may also lower healthcare costs The second study in this dissertation examines the validity of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (V49.86 for ICD-9 and Z66 for ICD-10) to identify the presence of a DNR order. Elderly HF patients (N=1,719) that were admitted to the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center between 2013 and 2016 were included in this study. Merging data from the electronic medical record (EMR) and the cost-accounting database allowed a comparison between a DNR in ICD codes to a DNR present in the EMR. Measures of agreement and disagreement suggested that the ICD code for DNR presence in the ICD codes is valid and has excellent diagnostic characteristics, including sensitivity and specificity. In addition, when the ICD measures of DNR were used in analyses focused on estimating the association between DNR and outcomes, they provided similar estimates of association compared to DNR in the EMR. This supports the use of ICD codes to identify DNR in future research studies. In addition, the use of ICD codes to identify DNR will facilitate the study of ACP as ICD codes are more readily available in large, observational datasets. The third study of this dissertation uses data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) to investigate the association between a recent payment rule that provides reimbursement for physicians to have ACP conversations with their patients and DNR use among racial and ethnic minorities—groups with well-documented disparities in end-of-life care. In addition, this study examines the timing of DNR orders among racial and ethnic minority groups, as early DNRs are thought to distinguish cases in which the DNR reflects patient preference regarding resuscitation on admission from those in which the DNR order results from failed salvage treatment. The results of this study suggest that although the reimbursement policy was associated with an increase in ACP participation overall, the rate of increase of DNR participation was lower for racial and ethnic minorities. This paper adds to the discussion about how to best decrease disparities in end-of-life care and suggests that reimbursement incentives alone do not appear to be enough to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in DNR participation. Future interventions may need to be multilevel and specific to the targeted group they are intended to benefit from. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Despite advancements in antibiotic therapy and resuscitation protocols, sepsis and septic shock remain major contributors to morbidity and mortality in children. We aimed to investigate the utility of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) for the early detection of septic shock and to evaluate its accuracy in predicting mortality. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED), enrolling patients diagnosed with the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. In addition to assessing infection biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, suPAR levels were quantified upon admission using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Results: Overall 72 patients and 80 healthy children included. Plasma suPAR levels demonstrated a statistically significant elevation in the sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups compared with the control group (p < 0.001 for all). The septic shock group exhibited the highest suPAR levels upon admission, surpassing both the sepsis and severe sepsis groups (p = 0.009 and 0.042). ROC analysis underscored the promising potential of suPAR with an AUC of 0.832 for septic shock. Analysis of mortality prediction revealed significantly higher suPAR levels in nonsurvivors than survivors (9.7 ng/mL vs. 4.2 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Employing plasma suPAR levels to discriminate between mortality and survival, a threshold of ≥7.0 ng/mL demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 71.0%. Conclusion: Plasma suPAR levels have the potential as a biomarker for predicting mortality in children with septic shock. In pediatric septic shock, the presence of plasma suPAR ≥7 ng/mL along with an underlying disease significantly increases the risk of mortality.

AB  - Background: Injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for Alaska Native (AN) people. Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) is supporting the development of a burn care system that includes a partnership between Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) in Anchorage, AK and UW Medicine Regional Burn Center at Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in Seattle, WA. We aimed to better understand the experiences of AN people with burn injuries across the care continuum to aid development of culturally appropriate care regionalization. Methods: We performed focus groups with twelve AN people with burn injury and their caregivers. A multidisciplinary team of burn care providers, qualitative research experts, AN care coordinator, and AN cultural liaison led focus groups to elicit experiences across the burn care continuum. Transcripts were analyzed using a phenomenological approach and inductive coding to understand how AN people and families navigated the medical and community systems for burn care and areas for improvement. Results: Three themes were identified: 1-Challenges with local burn care in remote communities including limited first aid, triage, pain management, and wound care, as well as long-distance transport to definitive care; 2-Divergence between cultural values and medical practices that generated mistrust in the medical system, isolation from their support systems, and recovery goals that were not aligned with their needs; 3-Difficulty accessing emotional health support and a survivor community that could empower their resilience. Conclusion: Participants reported modifiable barriers to culturally competent treatment for burn injuries among AN people. The findings can inform initiatives that leverage existing resources, including expansion of the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) telementoring program, promulgation of the Phoenix Society Survivors Offering Assistance in Recovery (SOAR) to AK, coordination of regionalized care to reduce time away from AK and provide more comfortable community reintegration, and define rehabilitation goals in terms that align with personal goals and subsistence lifestyle skills. Long-distance transport times are non-modifiable, but better pre-hospital care could be achieved by harnessing existing telehealth services and adapting principles of prolonged field care to allow for triage, initial care, and resuscitation in remote environments.

AB  - Background Lacosamide (LCM) has become commonly used for focal onset seizures due to its high tolerability and low drug interactions. Unlike patients on hemodialysis (HD), pharmacokinetic data and dosing recommendations for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) are scant. Case report A 2-year-old girl with end-stage kidney disease undergoing PD suffered prolonged focal onset seizures. The patient had congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract associated with branchio-oto-renal syndrome due to an <i>EYA1</i> gene mutation. She also had neurological sequelae from post-resuscitation encephalopathy at the age of one month. Antiseizure medication with few drug interactions, less impact on the neurodevelopmental state and possibility of intravenous administration was preferred. LCM met those criteria and was carefully administered. Although the patient had recurrent prolonged seizures during the titration periods, LCM could be continued without any apparent side effects. The blood levels of LCM increased linearly to the optimal level. We confirmed excretion of LCM in the PD fluid. Kidney transplantation was done three months after and her seizures were well controlled. Conclusions LCM might be a promising option for patients undergoing PD. Due to the lower removal efficacy in PD compared with in HD, close attention should be paid to possible drug excess. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyse the risk factors for sepsis in patients with trauma and develop a new scoring system for predicting sepsis in patients with trauma based on these risk factors. This will provide a simple and effective early warning method for the rapid and accurate detection and evaluation of the probability of sepsis in patients with trauma to assist in planning timely clinical interventions. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 216 patients with trauma who were admitted to the emergency intensive care unit of the emergency medicine department of the Hebei Medical University Third Hospital, China, between November 2017 and October 2022. We conducted a preliminary screening of the relevant factors using univariate logistic regression analysis and included those factors with a p value of <0.075 in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, from which the risk factors were screened and assigned, and obtained a total score, which was the sepsis early warning score. The incidence of sepsis in patients in the intensive care unit with trauma was 36.9%, and the mortality rate due to sepsis was 19.4%. We found statistically significant differences in several factors for patients with sepsis. The risk factors for sepsis in patients with trauma were the activated partial thromboplastin time, the New Injury Severity Score, growth differentiation factor-15 levels, shock, mechanical ventilation and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the sepsis early warning score for predicting sepsis in patients with trauma was 0.725. When the cutoff value of the early warning score was set at 5.0 points, the sensitivity was 69.9% and the specificity was 60.3%. The incidence of sepsis in patients with trauma can be reduced by closely monitoring patients' hemodynamics, implementing adequate fluid resuscitation promptly and by early removal of the catheter to minimize the duration of unnecessary invasive mechanical ventilation. In this study, we found that the use of the sepsis early warning score helped in a more accurate and effective evaluation of the prognosis of patients with trauma.

AB  - Patient safety is a major concern in medicine. Approximately, 4 million infants die each year worldwide and 23% of these deaths are caused by perinatal asphyxia. To prevent the long-term damage of asphyxia, the resuscitation flowchart must be perfectly and promptly performed. However, high effectiveness in performing resuscitation can only be achieved and maintained if the algorithm is frequently executed. Therefore, maintaining a high level of patient care is difficult in some remote centres. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new organizational model of care-network between Hub & Spoke hospitals to improve both the safety of the newborns in hospitals with a low number of births and the well-being of operators. Our project, NEO-SAFE (NEOnatal SAFety and training Elba), began in 2017 and involved the neonatal intensive care unit and the NINA Center of the Pisa University Hospital (hub) and the Hospital of Elba Island (spoke). It consisted of a continuous training program, both with ‘classic’ training course and ‘on-job tutoring’ (on side and remotely), of the health workers at spoke (i.e. nurses, midwives, and paediatricians). All four milestones of the study design were achieved. During the project, NINA Center instructors organized training courses for the staff in Portoferraio. These courses were based on learning technical and non-technical skills in a training course of increasing difficulty. Staff training needs were also monitored during the project by means of periodic questionnaires, sentinel events, and specific requests. The curve described by the rate of newborns transfer to the Pisa neonatal intensive care unit (hub) shows a monotonous decreasing trend line. On the other hand, this project allowed operators to develop greater self-confidence and greater safety in managing emergency situations, reducing stress for them and improving patient safety. The project allowed the creation of a safe, effective, low-cost, and reproducible organizational model for centres with a low number of births. Moreover, the tele-medicine approach is an important improvement in the assistance and is a window on the future. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background/aim: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is defined as the venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support in a patient who experienced a sudden pulseless condition attributable to cessation of cardiac mechanical activity and circulation. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of our ECPR experience in a pediatric patient population. Materials and methods: Between September 2014 and November 2017, 15 children were supported with ECPR following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in our hospitals. VA-ECMO setting was established for all patients. Pediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) scales and long-term neurological prognosis of the survivors were assessed. Results: The median age of the study population was 60 (4-156) months. The median weight was 18 (4.8-145) kg, height was 115 (63-172) cm, and body surface area was 0.73 (0.27-2.49) m2. The cause of cardiac arrest was a cardiac and circulatory failure in 12 patients (80%) and noncardiac causes in 20%. Dysrhythmia was present in 46%, septic shock in 13%, bleeding in 6%, low cardiac output syndrome in 13%, and airway disease in 6% of the study population. Median low-flow time was 95 (range 20-320) min. Central VAECMO cannulation was placed in only 2 (13.3%) cases. However, the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained in 10 (66.6%) patients, and 5 (50%) of them survived. Overall, 5 patients were discharged from the hospital. Finally, survival following ECPR was 33.3%, and all survivors were neurologically intact at hospital-discharge. Conclusion: ECPR can be a life-saving therapeutic strategy using a promising technology in the pediatric IHCA population. Early initiation and a well-coordinated, skilled, and dedicated ECMO team are the mainstay for better survival rates.

AB  - Cavities made by birds are an important microhabitat for many taxa in forests. Long-term dynamics of cavity patterns and the effect of forest management on cavities are, however, largely unknown. We studied cavity production, measured as nest cavity production rates (CPR = no. of new cavities/km2/year), of woodpeckers and tits in forests with different management intensity in southern Finland, based on a data from 37 years. Forests were divided into managed, seminatural and natural stands. The data covered 56 forest stands with the total area of 1690 ha. Stands were inventoried annually for new cavities. The total numbers of woodpecker and tit cavities were 2238 and 329, respectively. There were large differences in CPRs between forest stands with different management intensity. For woodpeckers, the CPR was highest in natural forests (5.7) and lowest in managed forests (1.5). For the tit species, the respective numbers were 0.9 and 0.3. The CPRs of different cavity-making bird species and cavity tree characteristics (e.g. tree condition and species) were consistent, suggesting that different cavity-makers benefit from similar forest and tree characteristics. The results also suggest that forests managed with currently prevailing methods limit the production of cavities. To promote cavities, the results from this and other studies suggest that managed forests should include more features of natural forests, such as more diverse tree species and within-stand structural variability distribution (tree-level heterogeneity), larger amount of decayed wood, more retention trees and snags and longer rotation periods.

AB  - Objectives: In France, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, all care workers have been mobilized. Despite this, the strong demand for care has put the health system under great strain. To overcome this overload of world, 86 medical students of Paris-Saclay University came to help some hospital services. They replaced caregivers, nurses or stretcher bearers under “degraded care” conditions. At the university level, the closure of the faculty due to generalized lockdown disrupted the training of these future doctors who were in second, third or fourth year of training (pre-clinical). This exploratory study proposes to collect the impact of the experience of these students during the first wave of the pandemic in order to better understand the difficulties they encountered, as well as the resources they exploited during this period. Materials and methods: Using a mixed approach, both quantitative on the one hand and qualitative on the other hand, medical students from Paris-Saclay were interviewed through a retrospective questionnaire distributed in December 2020. The quantitative part of the questionnaire assessed their psychological distress (6-item Kessler scale) and their resilience (Brief Resilience Scale). The qualitative part of the questionnaire included various open questions concerning the motivations to participate, the difficulties encountered, the impact of the situation on their interpersonal relationships or their university course. Results: A total of 46 responses from medical students from the University of Paris-Saclay were collected. This constitutes a response rate of 55%. Half of them were second or third year medical students. They were assigned to emergency departments, resuscitation or units dedicated to the care of patients with COVID-19. The average psychological distress score is 7.13. The average resilience score is 3.14. From these results, several categories of students were analyzed according to the elements found in their answers to the open questions. Almost all the students reported wanting to contribute to the collective effort and help hospital services. For some students, it was also a way of making themselves useful while escaping lockdown. The students were exposed to difficult working conditions, the distress of families and the deaths of numerous patients. Their involvement also had an impact on their relationships with their families: they could feel more isolated, or be afraid of infecting them. Their university work was very disrupted by their investment in the hospital: fatigue, concentration problems, lack of motivation could lead them to a form of dropping out of university. Conclusions: The results of this study are part of the context of a particular health crisis. They show medical students exposed to significant psychosocial risks in a period of stress. It seems important to identify what leads some students to develop good resilience capacities. The COVID-19 pandemic acts as an indicator of difficulties that were already present but that it is exacerbating: the link between the faculty, the student and the hospital, mentoring, supervision, support, university workload, hospital working conditions, psycho-pedagogical support for students and support for most struggling students… These results invite us to rethink the educational engineering of medical studies so that they make it possible, even in a health crisis, to ensure the quality of training and the quality of life of medical students.

AB  - Background: Over the past 25 years Sierra Leone has made progress in reducing maternal and child mortality, but the burden of preventable paediatric deaths remains high. Further progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require greater strengthening of the health care system, including hospital care for perinatal and paediatric conditions. Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment Plus (ETAT+) may offer a useful tool. Methods: The five-day ETAT+ course was adapted as a six-month programme of in-situ training and mentoring integrated with patient flow and service delivery improvements in 14 regional and district government hospitals across the country. Nurses were trained to carry out the initial resuscitation and assessment of the sick paediatric patient, and to administer the first dose of medication per protocol. The course was for all clinical staff; most participants were nurses. Results: The intervention was associated with an improvement in the quality of paediatric care and a reduction in mortality. In 2017 mortality decreased by 33.1%, from 14.5% at baseline to 9.7% after six months of the intervention. Mortality at the start of the 2018 intervention was 8.5% and reduced over six months to 6.5%. Care quality indicators showed improvement across the two intervention periods, with some evidence of sustained effect. Conclusions: These results suggest that adapted ETAT+ training with in-situ mentoring alongside improved patient flow and service delivery supports improvements in the quality of paediatric care in Sierra Leonean hospitals. ETAT+ may provide an affordable framework for improving the quality of secondary paediatric care in Sierra Leone and a model of nurse-led resuscitation may allow for prompt and timely emergency paediatric care in Sierra Leonean hospitals where there are fewer physicians and other resources for care.

AB  - Discusses short and long term psychological adaptation after successful out-of-hospital resuscitation. Advanced resuscitation techniques all over the industrialized world are providing countless patients suffering from cardiac arrest with a second chance for life. This reduction of mortality may lead to increased psychic morbidity to an extent which is so far unknown. The most important reason to consider that there may be distress in cardiac arrest survivors, is the fact that all of these patients have experienced a stressful event of an exceptional nature. Furthermore, the patients are faced with an event that is more or less unforeseeable. A clinically relevant proportion of these patients suffer from postacute psychopathological conditions, whose most prominent features have been identified as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Undoubtedly, patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest must achieve the "impossible." They must adapt psychologically to the reality of surviving their own death experience.

AB  - Background: Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is a newborn resuscitation training program designed to reduce neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries. However, skills decay after initial training is a significant barrier to sustained impact. Objective: To test whether a mobile app, HBB Prompt, developed with user-centred design, helps improve skills and knowledge retention after HBB training. Methods: HBB Prompt was created during Phase 1 of this study with input from HBB facilitators and providers from Southwestern Uganda recruited from a national HBB provider registry. During Phase 2, healthcare workers (HCWs) in two community hospitals received HBB training. One hospital was randomly assigned as the intervention hospital, where trained HCWs had access to HBB Prompt, and the other served as control without HBB Prompt (NCT03577054). Participants were evaluated using the HBB 2.0 knowledge check and Objective Structured Clinical Exam, version B (OSCE B) immediately before and after training, and 6 months post-training. The primary outcome was difference in OSCE B scores immediately after training and 6 months post-training. Results: Twenty-nine HCWs were trained in HBB (17 in intervention, 12 in control). At 6 months, 10 HCW were evaluated in intervention and 7 in control. In intervention and control respectively, the median OSCE B scores were: 7 vs. 9 immediately before training, 17 vs. 21 immediately after training, and 12 vs. 13 at 6 months after training. Six months after training, the median difference in OSCE B scores was -3 (IQR -5 to -1) in intervention and -8 (IQR -11 to -6) in control (p = 0.02). Conclusion: HBB Prompt, a mobile app created by user-centred design, improved retention of HBB skills at 6 months. However, skills decay remained high 6 months after training. Continued adaptation of HBB Prompt may further improve maintenance of HBB skills.

AB  - Background: Pericardial tamponade is a serious condition which may eventually lead to severe haemodynamic disturbances and cardiac arrest. It is most often caused by the accumulation of fluid inside the pericardium, as a result of different aetiological factors such as pericarditis, neoplastic diseases, lymphatic dysfunctions, or idiopathic pericardial disease. Pericardial tamponade can develop after cardiac surgical procedures or as a complication of myocardial infarction. Collection of blood inside the pericardial sack can be the result of pericardial or cardiac trauma. It is exceedingly rare for the injury to be caused by a migrating foreign body. Although a typical picture of pericardial tamponade has been previously described, the disorder may clinically resemble an acute myocardial infarction. Case presentation: We report the case of a 58-year-old female patient complaining of new onset thoracic pain and shortness of breath. Electrocardiographic examination results were suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction. However, echocardiography revealed significant pericardial tamponade. The cause was found to be a needle which remained inside the pelvis following a previous cesarean delivery, which the patient had undergone 18 years prior. In emergency setting, the needle was removed and the pericardial tamponade was resolved. Due to the prompt and efficient management, the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and presented no recurrence at the follow-up examinations. Conclusions: The migration of foreign bodies through tissues is exceedingly rare. If present, it may cause life-threatening complications. Since the aetiology of pericardial tamponade is vast, a thorough assessment is highly important. Therefore, echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice. We wish to highlight the possibility of migrating foreign bodies as probable cause for pericardial tamponade, as well as the importance of echocardiographic methods in the fast-track evaluation of such critical conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with mental illness experience stigma and marginalization, which affects the quality of their health care. In most settings, end-of-life decisions, including goals of care, must be discussed with all patients upon hospital admission, including determining cardiopulmonary resuscitation preferences in the event of a medical emergency. Despite this requirement, these conversations do not routinely occur in inpatient psychiatry. By default, patients become a ‘full code status’, mandating life-sustaining interventions. Aim: To explore how and why resuscitation status conversations occur, or do not occur, in inpatient psychiatry from the perspectives of healthcare providers. Method: Qualitative descriptive study using focus groups with nurses working in psychiatry. Results: Nurses’ experiences with initiating and engaging in resuscitation status conversations related to Working in Psychiatry, which represents the current practices and the participants’ views of the nursing role; Caring for Psychiatric Patients, which describes how fluctuating competency and suicidality influence determination; and The Influence of Physical Health Status, which details how differences in physical health status affect how healthcare providers engage in resuscitation status determination. Discussion: Although the importance of completing resuscitation status conversations with patients admitted to psychiatry was expressed by participants, they seldomly occur. There is ambiguity about when and how to determine patient wishes. Implications for practice: Tailored strategies are needed to ensure patients’ rights to self-determination are upheld when they are admitted to psychiatry. Nurses working in this setting would benefit from education, training and support to adequately initiate and engage in these conversations.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the current practice of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for Chinese cardiac arrest patients after the publication of 2015 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to healthcare providers of emergency departments (EDs) and/or Intensive Care Units (ICUs) across 52 hospitals in China from August to November 2016. Data collection ended in February 2017. The questionnaire included three parts: (1) characteristics of the departments and the respondents; (2) knowledge about ECPR; (3) practice of ECPR in cardiac arrest patients (case volume, inclusion/exclusion criteria, ECPR procedure). The characteristics of the departments/hospitals were only answered by the head of the department. Results: A total of 1 952 (86.8%) respondents fulfilled the survey. Only 2.5% of the respondents from 3 of 52 hospitals performed ECPR. Among the three hospitals, the case number of ECPR were ≤5 per year and none of them had written ECPR procedures. Only one hospital had formal inclusion/exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included age between 18 to 60 years, suspected cardiogenic cardiac arrest, beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation <5 min after cardiac arrest and duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation >10 min. The top three reasons for the nonuse of ECPR were unknown fields (31.2%), potential ECMO-related side effects (26.9%) and cost (18.7%). Conclusions: ECPR for cardiac arrest patients are not well understood by healthcare providers in the emergency department or ICUs and its application is still in the early stage in China. Educational training and other interventions are needed to promote the clinical practice.

AB  - Objectives: Postresuscitation care bundle treatment after return of spontaneous circulation in patients experiencing in-hospital cardiac arrest can improve patients' survival and quality of life. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy of Shenfu injection and postresuscitation care bundle in these patients. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study. Setting: Fifty hospitals in China. Patients: Adult patients had experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2015. Interventions: Based on the standardized postresuscitation care bundle treatment, patients were randomized to a Shenfu injection group (Shenfu injection + postresuscitation care bundle) or control group (postresuscitation care bundle) for 14 days or until hospital discharge. In the Shenfu injection group, 100 mL Shenfu injection was additionally administered via continuous IV infusion, bid. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was 28-day survival after randomization. The secondary outcomes included 90-day survival as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and the hospital stay and the total cost of hospitalization. Of 1,022 patients enrolled, a total of 978 patients were allocated to the two groups: the control (n=486) and Shenfu injection (n=492) groups. The Shenfu injection group had a significantly greater 28-day survival rate (42.7%) than the control group (30.1%). Also, the Shenfu injection group had a significantly higher survival rate at 90 days (39.6%) than the control group (25.9%). Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the Shenfu injection group had lower risks of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89; p=0.009) and 90-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.79; p=0.002). In the Shenfu injection group, the duration of mechanical ventilation (8.6±3.2 vs 12.7±7.9 d; p<0.001) and the hospital stay (8.7±5.9 vs 13.2±8.1 d; p<0.001) were significantly less than in the control group. Irreversible brain damage was the main cause of death in both groups. No serious drug-related adverse event was recorded. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Shenfu injection in combination with conventional postresuscitation care bundle treatment is effective at improving clinical outcomes in patients with return of spontaneous circulation after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

AB  - We present a case of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) in a patient with COVID-19 infection and multiple TdP risk factors including QT-interval prolongation, hemodialysis, bradycardia, and treatment with remdesivir, citalopram, and quetiapine. The case was complicated by post-resuscitation anxiety superimposed on a history of medical trauma since childhood. Top experts in the field of consultation-liaison psychiatry, trauma informed care, and cardiac electrophysiology provide perspectives on this case with a review of the literature. Key teaching topics include identification of TdP risk factors in patients with a complex illness; the necessity for prompt electrophysiology consultation in clinical scenarios with high risk for TdP; and the approach to patients with medical trauma using a trauma-informed lens. We highlight the contributions of COVID-19, the pharmacokinetics of QT-interval-prolonging psychotropic medications, the risks of hemodialysis, and the role of remdesivir-induced bradycardia in this first reported case of TdP in a patient treated with remdesivir.

AB  - Introduction: Contemporary data on the epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Vietnam are extremely limited. Methods: We established population-based registries of residents from 2 provinces in a northern urban (Hai Phong), and a central rural (Thanh Hoa), province of Vietnam hospitalized with a validated first AMI in 2018. We described patient characteristics, in-hospital management and clinical complications, and estimated incidence rates of AMI in these two registries. Results: A total of 785 patients (mean age = 71.2 years, 64.7% men) were admitted to the two hospitals with a validated first AMI. Approximately 64% of the AMI cases were ST-segment-elevation AMI. Patients from Thanh Hoa compared with Hai Phong were more likely to delay seeking acute hospital care. The incidence rates (per 100,000 population) of initial AMI in Thanh Hoa and Hai Phong were 16 and 30, respectively. Most patients were treated with aspirin (Thanh Hoa: 96%; Hai Phong: 90%) and statins (both provinces: 91%) during their hospitalization. A greater proportion of patients in Hai Phong (69%) underwent percutaneous revascularization than those in Thanh Hoa (58%). The most common in-hospital complications were heart failure (both provinces:12%), cardiogenic shock (Thanh Hoa: 10%; Hai phong: 7%); and cardiac arrest (both provinces: 9%). The in-hospital case-fatality rates for patients from Thanh Hoa and Hai Phong were 6.8% and 3.8%, respectively. Conclusions: The incidence and hospital case-fatality rates of AMI were low in two Vietnamese provinces. Extent of pre-hospital delay and in-hospital use of evidence-based therapies were suboptimal, being more prominent in the rural province.

AB  - Background: The ethical principle of justice demands that resources be distributed equally and based on evidence. Guidelines regarding forgoing of CPR are unavailable and there is large variance in the reported rates of attempted CPR in in-hospital cardiac arrest. The main objective of this work was to study whether local culture and physician preferences may affect spur-of-the-moment decisions in unexpected in-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: Cross sectional questionnaire survey conducted among a convenience sample of physicians that likely comprise code team members in their country (Indonesia, Israel and Mexico). The questionnaire included details regarding respondent demographics and training, personal value judgments and preferences as well as professional experience regarding CPR and forgoing of resuscitation. Results: Of the 675 questionnaires distributed, 617 (91.4%) were completed and returned. Country of practice and level of knowledge about resuscitation were strongly associated with avoiding CPR performance. Mexican physicians were almost twicemore likely to forgo CPR than their Israeli and Indonesian/Malaysian counterparts [OR1.84 (95% CI 1.03, 3.26), <i>p</i> = 0.038]. Mexican responders also placed greater emphasison personal and patient quality of life (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, degree of religiosity was most strongly associated with willingness to forgo CPR; orthodox respondents were more than twice more likely to report having forgone CPR for apatient they do not know than secular and observant respondents, regardless of the country of practice [OR 2.12 (95%CI 1.30, 3.46), <i>p</i> = 0.003]. Conclusions: In unexpected in-hospital cardiac arrest the decision to perform or withhold CPR may be affected by physician knowledge and local culture as well as personal preferences. Physician CPR training should include information regarding predictors of patient outcome at as well as emphasis on differentiating between patient and personal preferences in an emergency.

AB  - Introduction: Neonatal septicaemia is one of the most common leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. It is estimated to affect more than 30 million people worldwide annually, potentially leading to 6 million deaths. Objective(s)To determine the prevalence, bacteriological profile, antibiotic susceptibility and factors associated with neonatal septicaemia among neonates suspected to sepsis at Kilembe mines hospital. Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study, where purposive sampling technique was used and blood was drawn from 122 neonates suspected to sepsis attending Kilembe Mines Hospital during the period (July to November 2020). Specimens were inoculated in Brain heart infusion broth, transported to Fortportal Regional Referral Hospital, plated daily up to 7 days on blood, chocolate, MacConkey agar and incubated in aerobic and 5% carbondioxide. Pure colonies were identified by Gram stain, biochemical tests and antibiotic sensitivities obtained by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Associations were tested using Chi square with Fisher's exact or Yates correction tests where necessary and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Stata (version 14) used for statistical analysis. Results: Blood cultures were positive in 59.0% cases with 55.5% male and 44.4% female. EOS was present in 56.9% and LOS 43.1% of the cases. Gram negative (56.9%) organisms were most implicated with neonatal septicaemia than Gram positives ones (43.1%). Gram positive organisms exhibited better susceptibility to amikacin, linezolid and vancomycin but more resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin. Of the aminoglycosides, amikacin exhibited a verge over netilmicin and gentamicin against Gram negative isolates. Risk factors of neonatal septicaemia were mother's age of ≥25 years, employed mothers, tertiary-level of education, SVD, ANC attendance of ≥4 times, UTI during pregnancy, PROMS, foul Smelling liquor, urban residence, neonatal birth weight of ≥2500 g, Apgar score 1st and 5th min ≥6 and resuscitation. Conclusion: Multi-drug resistant organisms were isolated. Therefore caution is required in selection of antibiotic therapy and avoid empirical treatmen.

AB  - The CHAMPIONS NETWork program trains Chicago high school students as health advocates while preparing them to become future health professionals. We added digital badging to the curriculum in its third year of programming (2018). This article describes methods and student feedback about digital badging, allowing others to implement similar technology-driven opportunities to engage youth and promote healthy living. Program staff created seven online experiences (XPs) on health advocacy that made up a playlist. Students adopted three adults as clients and completed four XPs themselves and three with clients. Completion of all XPs resulted in a digital badge—an electronic portfolio of health advocacy experiences to be shared with employers and colleges. Following the 2019 cohort’s completion of the digital badge, we conducted two focus groups with students about their feedback on the digital badge. Results showed that students most liked the healthy eating and cardiopulmonary resuscitation XPs. They had more positive reactions to the experience than negative, and especially appreciated aspects of active learning, as well as the badge’s long-term benefits. This technology can potentially help any student with access to an electronic device become a health advocate, and could become a new tool for career development while improving population health.

Our work has furthersupported our belief that this is a highly prospective area and we feelconfident in our position going forward."We are continuing with our plans to move to AIM which we hope will provide uswith the funds to accelerate the development of the Company."Extract from the Strategic ReportThe following is an extract from the Strategic Report, full details of whichcan be found in the annual report.ObjectivesThe Company's objective is to create significant shareholder value from theexploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas projects.The Company has a number of secondary objectives, including promoting thehighest level of health and safety standards, developing our staff to theirhighest potential and being a good corporate citizen in our chosen countries ofoperation.StrategyThe Company's long-term strategy is to build an attractive portfolio of oil andgas exploration and production assets predominantly in the North Sea andnorthern Europe, where the board has significant and relevant experience.In the short term the Company will seek to maximise the exploration andappraisal potential within the existing Licence 1/13held in the Danish NorthSea.Business modelThe Company seeks to increase shareholder value by acquiring low cost oil andgas exploration and production assets with highly prospective characteristics,reduced geographical and political risk, and the potential for rapidadvancement. This focus is demonstrated by the acquisition and developmentactivities that have already taken place on Licence 1/13 in Denmark and issupported by a current application to the Danish Energy Agency for additionalblocks. Management focus is on value creation through cost effectiveacquisitions and judicious expenditure focussed on exploration and development.The Company has identified a number of approaches which may be employed tocreate value, including: the acquisition of further licence areas, strategicjoint ventures, including farm-in agreements, disposals, and the development ofprojects to production by the Company itself or spin-offs to new entities.Review of the Company's business using key performance indicatorsThe Company's shares were admitted to trading on the Plus Markets (now ISDXGrowth Market) in October, 2012, when the company raised £444,000 by way of anequity placing.In September, 2013 the Company acquired operatorship and an 80% workinginterest of Danish Hydrocarbons Exploration and production Licence 1/13in theDanish North Sea from Nikoil Limited (an entity controlled by a director of theCompany) via the establishment of its wholly owned subsidiary ESP Oil & GasApS.Since this time the Company has undertaken extensive geological structuralinterpretation and mapping work using existing 2D-seismic data aided by avolume of Pseudo 3D-seismic data. The Company now holds a sizeable licencearea, a library of seismic information, data logs, structural interpretationsand mapping, creating a large Hydrocarbon Prospect Portfolio.The work has been funded in part by the original equity investment and in partfrom a further equity raise for gross proceeds of £189,000 completed in April,2014. The Company commissioned a Competent Persons Report which was completedin June, 2014 providing an independent evaluation of the recoverablehydrocarbons expected for the asset Licence 1/13.Business performance overviewDuring the early part of the year under review Nordic through its wholly-ownedDanish subsidiary, ESP Oil & Gas ApS, acquired the Exploration and ProductionLicence 1/13covering an area of 3633km2 in the Danish North Sea. Following thisaward Nordic has commenced activities in meeting work programme commitmentsover the licence area and has acquired well and seismic data both 2D and Pseudo3D and has carried out structural interpretation and mapping work that has ledto the identification of a gas discovery and 20 oil and gas prospects across anumber of geological play types and varying depth as follows:Play type Target depth Likely resourceMiocene 1,100ft Shallow GasUpper Cretaceous 6,725ft OilRotliegendes 8,200ft OilCarboniferous (Pre-Permian) 9,800ft GasThis work has resulted in the commissioning of an independent Competent Personsreport ("CPR") that was completed in June, 2014.In addition as a result of the potential identified through the initialinterpretation and mapping work the Company through its subsidiary, ESP Oil &Gas ApS made an application for a further licence area of a total of 8 blockscovering an area of 1,750km2 adjacent to existing Licence 01/13.Work programmeFollowing the year-end Nordic completed further technical work principally amaturation and migration study and plans to complete a seismic attribute study,together with the balance of the interpretation work over a remaining volume of2D-seismic.This will allow for a further maturing of the assets in theportfolio and the commissioning of an updated CPR.Set out below are the Company's Reserves and Resources as provided in theIndependent Competent Persons Report provided by Xodus Group Limited in theirreport dated 6 June 2014.Contract Area Prospect Gross Nordic Net Interest MM Boe MM Boe %01/13 Contingent Resource (best) 14.4 11.5 80 Prospective Resource (best) 2,590.0 2,072.0 80Key objectivesIn the 2013 annual report we set ourselves the principal objective ofprogressing the low cost development programme to further define theprospectivity of the licence.

Significant accounting policiesBasis of preparationThe consolidated financial statements and company financial statements ofNordic Energy Plc have been prepared for the first time in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as adopted by theEuropean Union, and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable tocompanies reporting under IFRS. The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerningthe transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in Note 18.Since the transition date, being the first day of the comparative period, noexemptions available under IFRS 1 have been taken.The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis andare presented in GB Pounds sterling. Foreign operations are included inaccordance with the policies set out in Note 1.Standard and Interpretations issued but not yet effectiveAny Standards and Interpretations that have been issued but are not yeteffective, and that are available for early application, have not been appliedby the Company in these financial statements. Application of these Standardsand Interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the financialstatements in the future.Going concernThe Company is at an early stage of exploration and in common with many oil andgas exploration companies, it raises financing for its exploration andappraisal activities in discrete tranches. The Company had working capital of £278,644 at 31 May 2014. In view of this, the directors consider that sufficientfunds will be available to progress the Company's planned explorationprogrammes and that it has adequate working capital for at least the nexttwelve months. The directors therefore consider it appropriate to prepare thesefinancial statements on the going concern basis.However, the existing funds will not be sufficient to bring the projects intodevelopment and production should it be warranted and, in due course, furtherfunding will be required. In the event that the Company is unable to securefurther finance it may not be able to fully develop its projects which may havea consequential impact on the recoverability of the carrying value of therelated intangible assets. Additionally, if the Company is unable to developits projects then it will have a consequential impact on the recoverability ofthe carrying value of investments in subsidiaries held by the parent company.Loss of parent companyAs permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the statement ofcomprehensive income of the parent company is not presented as part of thesefinancial statements. The parent company's loss for the financial year was £179,633 (2013 - £172, 253).2. Prior period adjustmentIn preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2014, theDirectors identified that 39,000,000 warrants issued in the period ending 31May 2013 had not been fair valued at their grant date in line with therequirements of IFRS 2 "Share-based payments". The Directors haveretrospectively fair valued the warrants during the year as though thevaluation had been prepared as at the grant date. This has resulted in anincrease of £61,702 to the loss for the period ended 31 May 2013 and theformation of a share warrants reserve for the same amount.3. Loss per shareThe calculation of basic loss per share at 31 May 2013 was based on the lossattributable to ordinary shareholders of £184,552 (2013 - £172,253) and aweighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period ended31 May 2014 of 95,585,439 (2013 - 78,363,178) calculated as follows: 2014 2013 Restated £ £Loss attributable to ordinary shareholdersLoss for the period 184,552 172,253 _________ _________Loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 184,552 172,253 _________ _________Weighted average number of ordinary shares Number NumberNumber of shares in issue at beginning of year 94,880,000 -Effect of shares issued during the year 705,439 78,363,178 _________ _________Weighted average number or ordinary shares in issue 95,585,439 78,363,178for the year _________ _________There is no difference between the basic and diluted loss per share.4.

AB  - Background: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is one of the causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The increase in survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is closely related to early detection and shortening the first defibrillation time. The implementation of AEDs deployment plan in public places in Hangzhou City provides an opportunity to improve the survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and the benefits and potentials are enormous. Aims and Objective: Placing AEDs in public areas can effectively treat patients with pre-hospital cardiac arrest, by evaluating the configuration and usage of public AEDs in Hangzhou during the past five years, to provide the basis for improving the public areas' configuration AEDs network layout and related training management. Materials and Methods: The number of AEDs in public areas, the use of AEDs and the treatment effect in Hangzhou city from 2015 to 2020 were collected. Results: The number of AEDs in public areas, the use of AEDs and the treatment effect in Hangzhou city from 2015 to 2020 were collected. In 5 years, a total of 1201 AEDs were configured, Placed in densely populated areas such as transportation hubs, schools, and scenic spots as the main locations. 32 patients suffered prehospital cardiac arrest and used AEDs, the average age of the patients was 40.56 ± 17.20, and the ratio of male to female was 3.57:1, In 26 cases, the initial heart rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation, Before the first aid personnel arrived, the first witnesses Implement rescue, 22 patients with ventricular fibrillation were resuscitated successfully, 10 cases failed to ROSC. In 6 patients with suspected cardiac arrest, there was no electric shock defibrillation, and the device correctly indicates that the problem is not caused by ventricular fibrillation, In 4 cases, there was no defibrillating rhythm. Conclusion: AEDs in public areas are effectively used to assist in the treatment of patients with cardiac arrest; It can increase the rate of main circulation recovery. We will further increase the number of AEDs in public places, promote first aid training programs for non-professionals, Improving the public health emergency network system is essential to improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest.

AB  - The controlled, prospective intervention study without randomization with a non-inferiority study design investigates the effectiveness of psychoanalytic treatments without medication in comparison to behavioral therapy treatments with and without medication in children aged 6 to 11 years with a diagnosis of ADHD and/or conduct disorder. 73 children (58 boys and 15 girls) were included in the study. Diagnostics before treatment, at end of treatment and at follow-up after 38 months included a standardized clinical interview (DISYPS-KJ), questionnaires for parents, teachers and children (DISYPS-KJ, CBCL, TRF, CPRS, CTRS, ILK), intelligence test and behavioral observation of the child. Primary outcome criterion was disorder-specific symptom reduction at end of treatment and follow-up. Both treatment groups showed significant symptom reductions at end of treatment and at follow-up. There were no significant differences between treatment groups. Parent and teacher ratings showed significant improvements in both groups at end of treatment and at follow-up on the ADHD index, oppositional behavior, and hyperactivity/impulsivity scales, as well as on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems scales. Quality of life improved for children in both treatment groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - From January 2020 to December 2022, there was a total of 8,872,955 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. In addition, a total of 15,253 COVID-19 related deaths were reported. During these three years, the government and health authority did many efforts to response this pandemic. In the early pandemic, Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center was established in the early 2020 to organize associated resource, develop effective policy and implement strict intervention. In response to COVID-19 pandemic, many infection control policy and interventions, including universal mask wearing with increasing production of face mask, hand hygiene, border control, introduce of digital technology incorporating big data, quarantine of COVID-19 cases, travel and gathering restriction, were implemented. In the meanwhile, two COVID-19 vaccines, namely MVC-COV1901 and UB-612, have been developed under the support of government. Furthermore, MVC-COV1901 was taken into clinical practice after received emergency use approval. In addition, two traditional Chinese medicines, including NRICM101 and NRICM102 showed their promising effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and were recommended as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19. During the pandemic, the nonpharmacologic intervention help reduce many infectious diseases, especially for airborne/droplet-transmitted diseases. However, COVID-19 exhibited some adverse impacts on the healthcare systems, such as emergency medical service on out of hospital cardiac arrest, cancer screening, HIV screening and prevention services, and public health, namely the psychosocial status of healthcare workers. Although the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections may gradually subsided, we should keep monitoring its associated impact and appropriately response to this pandemic.

AB  - Commons scholarship has improved our understanding of how to govern resources for sustainability. However, it has also been critiqued for its focus on traits (e.g. well-defined system boundaries) that are increasingly threatened by social and environmental trends. Fisheries are a key example of this challenge. While small-scale fisheries are critically important to the diets and livelihoods of millions, industrial fisheries from developed countries now dominate fishing around the world. While these two systems are governed separately, there is substantial overlap between them, conceptualized as the growing influence of globalization on local common pool resource (CPR) systems. One of the most impactful, but least understood consequences of this convergence are the emerging conflicts and competition between small-scale and industrial fisheries. In these systems, the interaction between small-scale CPRs and globalized commodity chains has meant the creation of a new, hybrid resource system, addressed by neither conventional industrial nor traditional small-scale governance approaches. We use empirical data from 396 cases of interactions at sea between globalized industrial and local small-scale fishers in Ghana from 1984 to 2013 to examine the conditions under which resource users conflict or cooperate, linking them to broader political and economic dynamics across scales. We consider the institutional factors that mediate these interactions, identifying policies to promote cooperative, and avert conflictual incidents. We further consider the long-term effects of these patterns of conflict and cooperation for the resilience or vulnerability of the resource base, the fishers, and the institutions governing the system. We suggest that specific governance arrangements that reduce disparities between groups, promote bridging social capital, and enhance hybrid and cross-scale institutions offer the best potential to govern resource systems where traditional CPRs and market-oriented industries converge.

AB  - An increasing number of patients are able to survive traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) with advanced resuscitation. However, the role of their pre-injury health status in mortality in the following years is not known. Here, we followed 77,088 consecutive patients (59% male) who survived the TBI event in Ontario, Canada for more than a decade, and examined the relationships between their pre-injury health status and mortality rates in excess to the expected mortality calculated using sex- and age-specific life tables. There were 5792 deaths over the studied period, 3163 (6.95%) deaths in male and 2629 (8.33%) in female patients. The average excess mortality rate over the follow-up period of 14 years was 1.81 (95% confidence interval = 1.76–1.86). Analyses of follow-up time windows showed different patterns for the average excess rate of mortality following TBI, with the greatest rates observed in year one after injury. Among identified pre-injury comorbidity factors, 33 were associated with excess mortality rates. These rates were comparable between sexes. Additional analyses in the validation dataset confirmed that these findings were unlikely a result of TBI misclassification or unmeasured confounding. Thus, detection and subsequent management of pre-injury health status should be an integral component of any strategy to reduce excess mortality in TBI patients. The complexity of pre-injury comorbidity calls for integration of multidisciplinary health services to meet TBI patients' needs and prevent adverse outcomes.

AB  - Approximately 11% of infants are born preterm, and complications of prematurity are the most common cause of death in children aged under five years. Almost one million preterm infants die each year across low, high and middle income countries. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a Guideline Development Group (GDG) to examine evidence and formulate recommendations for care of preterm or low birthweight (LBW) infants according to WHO Guideline Review Committee (GRC) criteria. GRADE methods were used to assess the certainty of evidence and the GDG developed judgements using the DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating Communication strategies to support Informed Decisions and practice based on Evidence) framework. Twenty-five recommendations were made; 11 recommendations were new, and 16 were for preventive and promotive care. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) was recommended to start immmediately after birth as routine care for all preterm or LBW newborns (except for critically ill infants who are in shock, unable to breath spontaneously after resuscitation, or require ventilatory support) both in the facility and at home. New recommendations were also made for caffeine to treat apnoea and for extubation; family involvement in routine care for preterm or LBW infants; and for post-discharge home-visit follow-up care. New recommendations were also made to consider use of probiotics, emollient therapy, caffeine for prevention of apnoea, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) immediately after birth (with or without respiratory distress) in infants less than 32 weeks gestational age; and for family support to enable the care of preterm or LBW infants. The recommendations confirm the pivotal role of preventive and promotive care for preterm and LBW infants, especially the importance of keeping the baby and mother together, and empowering and supporting families to care for their preterm or LBW infant. WHO is now working to help scale up care for small and sick newborns, including organizational shifts in all 'health system building blocks' such as infrastructure, commodities, workforce and monitoring.

AB  - Objective: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in Mexico, but many survival and prognostic factors are unknown. The aim of this study was to assess out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a Mexican city. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study that evaluated the records of the major ambulance services in the city of Queretaro, Mexico. Means, standard deviation, and percentages for the categorical variables were obtained. Logistic regression was performed to determine the effects between interventions, times, and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Results: For an 11-month period, 148 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases were recorded. The mean age of the victims was 54±22.6 years and 90 (65.3%) were males. Forty-nine cases were related to cardiac disease, 46 to other disease, 27 to trauma, 18 to terminal illnesses, and three to drowning. Twelve (8.6%) patients had a pulse upon hospital arrival, but none survived to discharge. No victims were defibrillated prior to ambulance arrival. The collapse-assessment interval was 22.5±19:1 minutes, the mean value for the ambulance response times was 13:6±10:4 minutes. Basic emergency medical technicians applied chest compressions to 40 victims (27.2%), controlled the airway in 32 (21.8%), and defibrillated seven (4.8%). Chest compressions and airway control showed an OR of 8 and 12 respectively for ROSC. Conclusions: The poor survival rate in this study emphasizes the need to improve efforts in provider training and public education. Authorities must promote actions to enhance prehospital emergency services capabilities, shorten response times, and provide community education to increase the chances of survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims in Mexico.

AB  - Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the optimal threshold for national early warning score in clinical practice. Background: The national early warning score is an aggregate early warning score aiming to predict patient mortality. Studies validating national early warning score did not use standardised patient outcomes or did not always include clinical workload in their results. Since all patients with a positive national early warning score require a clinical workup, it is crucial to determine the optimal threshold to limit false-positive alerts. Design: An external validation study using retrospectively collected data of patient admissions in six Belgian hospitals. Methods: We adhered to the STARD guideline for reporting. Two sample groups were selected: the cross-sectional sample (admitted patients, 1 day every 4 months) and the serious adverse event sample (all patients with unexpected death, cardiac arrest and unplanned admission to the intensive care unit). The maximum registered national early warning score value was collected in both groups. Predictive values were used as estimates for clinical workload. Results: We collected 1,523 in the cross-sectional sample and 390 patients in the serious adverse event sample. A national early warning score ≥5 had a positive predictive value of 6.8% and a negative predictive value of 99.5% to predict unexpected death, cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation or unplanned admission to intensive care (AUROC 0.841). The performance of national early warning score differed between outcome measures. Considering the predictive value, the optimal threshold for national early warning score is ≥5. Conclusions: We validated national early warning score to be applied in general hospital wards and confirmed the optimal threshold (≥5). Relevance to clinical practice: When a patient has a national early warning score <5, we may assume that in the next 24 hr this patient is less likely to die unexpectedly, receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation or be transferred to the ICU. Because of the significant number of false positives when national early warning score is ≥5, hospitals should create workable guidelines for clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Severe leptospirosis can have a case-fatality rate of over 50%, even with intensive care unit (ICU) support. Multiple strategies–including protective ventilation and early renal replacement therapy (RRT)–have been recommended to improve outcomes. However, management guidelines vary widely around the world and there is no consensus on the optimal approach. Methodology/Principal findings: All cases of leptospirosis admitted to the ICU of Cairns Hospital in tropical Australia between 1998 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients' demographics, presentation, management and clinical course were examined. The 55 patients' median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 47 (32–62) years and their median (IQR) APACHE III score was 67 (48–105). All 55 received appropriate antibiotic therapy, 45 (82%) within the first 6 hours. Acute kidney injury was present in 48/55 (87%), 18/55 (33%) required RRT, although this was usually not administered until traditional criteria for initiation were met. Moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in 37/55 (67%), 32/55 (58%) had pulmonary haemorrhage, and mechanical ventilation was required in 27/55 (49%). Vasopressor support was necessary in 34/55 (62%). Corticosteroids were prescribed in 20/55 (36%). The median (IQR) fluid balance in the initial three days of ICU care was +1493 (175–3567) ml. Only 2/55 (4%) died, both were elderly men with multiple comorbidities. Conclusion: In patients with severe leptospirosis in tropical Australia, prompt ICU support that includes early antibiotics, protective ventilation strategies, conservative fluid resuscitation, traditional thresholds for RRT initiation and corticosteroid therapy is associated with a very low case-fatality rate. Prospective studies are required to establish the relative contributions of each of these interventions to optimal patient outcomes. Author summary: Severe leptospirosis continues to carry a high mortality. To improve outcomes, several countries have developed national guidelines for the management of severe disease. However, there is substantial variation in these guidelines despite the fact that severe leptospirosis has a very similar presentation around the world. In tropical Australia, the case-fatality rate of severe leptospirosis is only 4%. This retrospective study reviewed 55 patients with leptospirosis requiring support in an Australian Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in an effort to identify the management strategies that might explain these excellent outcomes. The low case-fatality rate was associated with prompt multimodal ICU support that included early antibiotics, protective ventilation strategies, conservative fluid resuscitation, traditional thresholds for renal replacement therapy initiation and corticosteroid therapy. However prospective, multinational studies–which include the resource-poor settings that bear the greatest burden of disease–are necessary to define which of these interventions have the greatest therapeutic value.

AB  - Background: Although nurses are the most likely first responders to witness an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and provide treatment, little research has been undertaken to determine what features of nursing are related to cardiac arrest outcomes. Objectives: To determine the association between nurse staffing, nurse work environments, and IHCA survival. Research Design: Cross-sectional study of data from: (1) the American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database; (2) the University of Pennsylvania Multi-State Nursing Care and and Patient Safety; and (3) the American Hospital Association annual survey. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association of the features of nursing and IHCA survival to discharge after adjusting for hospital and patient characteristics. Subjects: A total of 11,160 adult patients aged 18 and older between 2005 and 2007 in 75 hospitals in 4 states (Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and New Jersey). Results: Each additional patient per nurse on medical-surgical units was associated with a 5% lower likelihood of surviving IHCA to discharge (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.99). Further, patients cared for in hospitals with poor work environments had a 16% lower likelihood of IHCA survival (odds ratio = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.99) than patients cared for in hospitals with better work environments. Conclusions: Better work environments and decreased patient-to-nurse ratios on medical-surgical units are associated with higher odds of patient survival after an IHCA. These results add to a large body of literature suggesting that outcomes are better when nurses have a more reasonable workload and work in good hospital work environments. Improving nurse working conditions holds promise for improving survival following IHCA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Advance directives towards end of life decisions are seldom used among Arabs. Aims: This study aimed at investigating advance care preferences among a sample of Arab patients. Method: This cross-sectional study was undertaken over the period March 2012-March 2013 on a sample of 300 patients with chronic illness in King Fahad National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, a major tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. Results: Mean age of patients in the study was 48.7 years (standard deviation 16.4). There were 104 patients on haemodialysis, 73 with advanced malignancy, 81 with chronic liver disease and 35 with chronic respiratory disease. More than 80% of the respondents felt that the physician should make the decision about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Over 60% wished to remain at home when their condition deteriorated to impending death. There were no significant correlations between the patients' end of life decision preferences and religiosity, quality of life, disease duration, or other demographic characteristics. Conclusion: Despite a significant lack of knowledge among our participants regarding resuscitation, a majority of patients with chronic illness were willing to discuss the options and were capable of making advance directive plans regarding their health status.

AB  - Background: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and management are critical to improve outcomes. Methods: We conducted a survey among nurses and physicians of all adult departments of the Lausanne University Hospital (LUH) and paramedics transporting patients to our hospital. Measured outcomes included professionals' demographics (age, profession, seniority, unit of activity), quantification of prior sepsis education, self-evaluation, and knowledge of sepsis epidemiology, definition, recognition, and management. Correlation between surveyed personnel and sepsis perceptions and knowledge were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Between January and October 2020, we contacted 1'216 of the 4'417 professionals (27.5%) of the LUH, of whom 1'116 (91.8%) completed the survey, including 619 of 2'463 (25.1%) nurses, 348 of 1'664 (20.9%) physicians and 149 of 290 (51.4%) paramedics. While 98.5% of the participants were familiar with the word "sepsis" (97.4% of nurses, 100% of physicians and 99.3% of paramedics), only 13% of them (physicians: 28.4%, nurses: 5.9%, paramedics: 6.8%) correctly identified the Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Similarly, only 48% and 49.3% of the physicians and 10.1% an 11.9% of the nurses knew that SOFA was a sepsis defining score and that the qSOFA score was a predictor of increased mortality, respectively. Furthermore, 15.8% of the physicians and 1.0% of the nurses knew the three components of the qSOFA score. For patients with suspected sepsis, 96.1%, 91.6% and 75.8% of physicians respectively chose blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation as therapeutic interventions to be initiated within 1 (76.4%) to 3 (18.2%) hours. For nurses and physicians, recent training correlated with knowledge of SOFA score (ORs [95%CI]: 3.956 [2.018-7.752] and 2.617 [1.527-4.485]) and qSOFA (ORs [95%CI]: 5.804 [2.653-9.742] and 2.291 [1.342-3.910]) scores purposes. Furthermore, recent training also correlated with adequate sepsis definition (ORs [95%CI]: 1.839 [1.026-3.295]) and the components of qSOFA (ORs [95%CI]: 2.388 [1.110-5.136]) in physicians. Conclusions: This sepsis survey conducted among physicians, nurses and paramedics of a tertiary Swiss medical center identified a deficit of sepsis awareness and knowledge reflecting a lack of sepsis-specific continuing education requiring immediate corrective measures.

AB  - Background: The fundamental priority program for controlling Tuberculosis (TB) is accurate and rapid diagnosis. Variable Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) phenotypes were discovered in sputum samples from pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. Active replicating bacteria and differentially culturable tubercle bacteria (DCTB) are present in the sputum. Differentially culturable tubercle bacilli did not grow on the standard medium. Culture filtrate (CF) H37Rv supplementation containing resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs) has the potential to increase sensitivity and reduce time to detection (TTD) on culture-based diagnostics. Methods: This study was a true experimental laboratory. A clinical sample was taken from the sputum of 15 PTB patients, which was "MTB detected" by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Sputum samples were divided into two groups and inoculated on MGIT 960 in one group with CF-H37Rv supplementation and without in the other as standard MGIT medium. Results: On both standard MGIT medium and MGIT+CF H37Rv, the recovery rate was 100%. Seven samples (47%) show a growth promotion effect with CF H37Rv supplementation (ΔTTD > 10 hours), while eight samples (53%) show no change in TTD (ΔTTD < 10 hours). There is no evidence that CF H37Rv supplementation inhibits growth. Six of the seven samples with ΔTTD > 10 jam (85,7%) were dominated by samples with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) grading 1+, which could be an assumption related to re-treatment PTB cases, chronic cases, treatment stages, TB-HIV, or follow up of treatments. Conclusion: There was no difference in recovery rate or TTD between standard MGIT medium and MGIT+CF H37Rv. The supplementation of culture filtrate H37Rv has a greater advantage on samples with low bacterial load (AFB 1+).

AB  - Background: Advanced care planning (ACP) provides an opportunity for individuals to explore and document their values concerning medical care decisions prior to an acute event. This manuscript explores the value of ACP and compares and contrasts 2 ACP models currently in practice. Methods: This hypothetical case describes an elderly, frail patient with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who is also a high user of health care resources. A new palliative care-led outpatient ACP clinic model is described using this example. Results: Using the ACP clinic model in this case reveals how different a patient’s end of life experience may be when proper, proactive planning measures are in place. With proper education and discussion around this patient and family’s wishes pertaining to the end of his life, this man was able to change his plan of care from aggressive resuscitation treatment in hospital to a peaceful palliative experience at home. Conclusions: In this case description, the valuable role of ACP in preserving quality of life for patients, increasing satisfaction with care, and decreasing distress among family members during a medical event is demonstrated.

AB  - Background: Hyperkalemia is a modifiable risk factor for sudden cardiac death, a leading cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The optimal treatment of hyperkalemia in hospitalized end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is nonexistent in literature, which has prompted studies from outpatient dialysis to be extrapolated to inpatient care. The goal of this study was to determine if low-potassium dialysate 1 mEq/L is associated with higher mortality in hospitalized ESRD patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium >6.5 mmol/L). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of all adult ESRD patients admitted with severe hyperkalemia between January 2011 and August 2016. Results: There were 209 ESRD patients on HD admitted with severe hyperkalemia during the study period. Mean serum potassium was 7.1 mmol/L. In-hospital mortality or cardiac arrest in ESRD patients with severe hyperkalemia was 12.4%. Median time to dialysis after serum potassium result was 2.0 h (25, 75 interquartile range 0.9, 4.2 h). Totally, 47.4% of patients received dialysis with 1 mEq/L concentration potassium bath. The use of 1 mEq/L potassium bath was associated with significantly lower mortality or cardiac arrest in ESRD patients admitted with severe hyperkalemia (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.80, P = 0.01). Conclusion: We conclude that use of 1 mEq/L potassium bath for treatment of severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mmol/L) in hospitalized ESRD patients is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality or cardiac arrest.

AB  - Aim: To explore how masculinities shape the experiences of men and their partners after survival from out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest. Background: Survivors of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest report depression, dependence on others for daily functioning, decreased participation in society and significant decreases in quality of life. There is growing evidence that masculine gender identities play a central role in the recovery experiences of men and their families following other major cardiac events. However, to date, there has been no examination of how masculinities shape men's experiences of recovery following out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest. Design; Interview study guided by an interpretive description approach. Data were subjected to thematic analysis. Method: A purposive sample of seven male sudden cardiac arrest survivors and 6 female partners was recruited in 2010 from a secondary care centre in British Columbia, Canada. Results: Three themes were prominent in the experiences of the participants: (1) Support and self‐reliance; (2) Dealing with emotional (in) vulnerability; and (3) No longer a ‘He‐man’. Conclusion; Masculinities played a role in men's experiences of recovery and adaptation following out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest. Hegemonic masculinity partly explained men's experiences, notably their reluctance to seek professional support and reactions to changes in lifestyle. However, the study also suggests that the popular stereotype of men being ‘strong and silent’ in the face of ill‐health may only be a part of a more complex story. Nurses would benefit from taking into consideration the potential influence of male gender identities on men's recovery postcardiac arrest.

AB  - Background: Intrapartum-related hypoxia accounts for 30% of neonatal deaths in Tanzania. This has led to the introduction and scaling-up of the Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) programme, which is a simulation-based learning programme in newborn resuscitation skills. Studies have documented ineffective ventilation of non-breathing newborns and the inability to follow the HBB algorithm among providers. Objective: This study aimed at exploring barriers and facilitators to effective bag mask ventilation, an essential component of the HBB algorithm, during actual newborn resuscitation in rural Tanzania. Methods: Eight midwives, each with more than one year's working experience in the labour ward, were interviewed individually at Haydom Lutheran Hospital, Tanzania. The audio recordings were transcribed and translated into English and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Midwives reported the ability to monitor labour properly, preparing resuscitation equipment before delivery, teamwork and frequent ventilation training as the most effective factors in improving actual ventilation practices and promoting the survival of newborns. They thought that their anxiety and fear due to stress of ventilating a non-breathing baby often led to poor resuscitation performance. Additionally, they experienced difficulties assessing the baby's condition and providing appropriate clinical responses to initial interventions at birth; hence, further necessary actions and timely initiation of ventilation were delayed. Conclusions: Efforts should be focused on improving labour monitoring, birth preparedness and accurate assessment immediately after birth, to decrease intrapartum-related hypoxia. Midwives should be well prepared to treat a non-breathing baby through high-quality and frequent simulation training with an emphasis on teamwork training.

AB  - Survivors of critical illness frequently exhibit acute (i.e., delirium) and chronic neurological complications. Intensive care unit prevalence of delirium is as high as 80% and has been associated with increased length of hospital stay, mortality, and long-term cognitive impairment. However, the underlying etiology of delirium, and long-term dysfunction, remains unknown but may be associated with cerebral ischemia. A key element of resuscitation during critical illness is guided at assessing proxies of perfusion to maintain adequate oxygen delivery (e.g., renal perfusion is assessed by measuring urine output and serum creatinine). However, there is currently no well-defined surrogate of cerebral perfusion used in routine clinical practice. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique to quantify regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) that has been used for decades in the cardiac operating theatre and resulted in targeted algorithms to optimize rSO2. However, these algorithms do not exist during critical illness. The primary objective of this thesis was to assess if low levels of rSO2 are associated with delirium. The subsequent chapters herein will demonstrate the feasibility of using NIRS to monitor rSO2 (e.g., did not interfere with patient care), which provided the infrastructure to conduct the CONFOCAL pilot that identified low rSO2 as an independent predictor of delirium. Additionally, the physiologic determinants of the rSO2 signal were assessed. This regression analysis accounted for a significant proportion of variance in the rSO2 signal (R2=.54), which was associated with age, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, hemoglobin, and heart rate. At 3- and 12-months, participants were primarily impaired in visuospatial/executive function, immediate, and delayed memory. Therefore, these findings support the hypothesis that low rSO2 is associated with delirium and suggest that optimizing rSO2 may offer promising avenues for future critical care practices to prevent delirium. However, the determinants of long-term impairment will need to be assessed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In real practice, there is a paradox in the management of patients with 'long-term Covid-19.' Indeed, Family physicians (FPs) are on the front line in the management process of these patients. For 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and according to the World Health Organization guideline, the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) should be provided not only at tertiary- or secondary care but mainly at primary care with a real implication of FPs. However, specific guidelines/recommendations were addressed for FPs. Therefore, an alternative including the CPR minimal advice that an FP should provide to 'long-term Covid-19' patients, seems to be necessary to respond to the needs of FPs to face their involvement with 'long-term Covid-19' patients. Thus, this paper aimed to report the CPR 'minimal advice' that should be provided by FPs managing 'long-term Covid-19' patients with incapacity (i.e.; alteration of the cardiorespiratory and muscular chain). According to the authors, FPs should be more cautious in the prescription of exercise and nutrition program and informed about the minimal advices related to nutritional and physical exercise rehabilitation guidelines when taking care of 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and how these guidelines can relieve the mental and physical problems, improve immunity, and accelerate the recovery process of the patients. With the occurrence of new variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the nutritional and exercise rehabilitation guidelines implemented by FPs become indispensable to promote the recovery of Covid-19 patients and support a return to normal life.

AB  - Comments on an article by Tobias Cronberg et al. (see record [rid]2015-52478-007[/rid]). Cronberg et al. report cognitive and health-related quality-of-life assessments performed on survivors 6 months after enrollment in the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) trial. The major findings of the study are as follows. More than 90% of the survivors returned home, and approximately 18% needed help with daily activities; however, less than 50% returned to their previous state of employment. None of the individual measures used in this study is particularly good at assessing cognitive outcome. Of note, the TTM trial was not powered to detect differences in the cognitive and quality-of-life outcomes presented in this study, but Cronberg et al. present the results of post hoc power calculations in the supplemental material. This study does not support the superiority of one target temperature for 6-month cognitive and quality-of-life outcomes. For neurologists who are often called on to render an opinion on the prognosis of unconscious patients after cardiac arrest (CA), an important take-home message from this study is that although cognitive changes are common, the overall long-term outcome of patients with a CA who survive to hospital discharge is quite good.

AB  - Introduction: Motorcycles can be considered a new form of smart vehicle when taking into account their small and modern structure and due to the fact that nowadays, they are used in the new role of ambulance to rapidly reach emergency patients in large cities with traffic congestion. However, there is no study regarding the measuring of access time for motorcycle ambulances (motorlances) in large cities of Thailand. Study Objective: This study aims to compare access times to patients between motorlances and conventional ambulances, including analysis of the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) installed on motorlances to contribute to the sustainable development of public health policies. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on all motorlance operations in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) at Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand from January 2019 through December 2020. Data were recorded using a national standard operation record form for Thailand. Results: Two hundred seventy-one motorlance operations were examined over a two-year period. A total of 52.4% (N = 142) of the patients were male. The average times from dispatch to vehicle (motorlance and traditional ambulance) being en route (activation time) for motorlance and ambulance in afternoon shift were 0.59 minutes and 1.45 minutes, respectively (P = .004). The average motorlance response time in the afternoon shift was 6.12 minutes, and ambulance response time was 9.10 minutes at the same shift. Almost all of the motorlance operations (97.8%) were found to have no access to AED equipment installed in public areas. The average time from dispatch to AED arrival on scene (AED access time) was 5.02 minutes. Conclusion: The response time of motorlances was shorter than a conventional ambulance, and the use of AEDs on a motorlance can increase the chances of survival for patients with cardiac arrest outside the hospital in public places where AEDs are not available.

AB  - Introduction: Medical care for ventilator-dependent children must avoid hospital confinement, which is detrimental to the patient, their family and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Our objective was to assess the role of telemedicine in facilitating early and permanent discharge of such patients to home care. Methods: This was a prospective clinical study (2007–2017) in tracheotomised ventilator-dependent children. We used a Big Data Telemedicine home system (Medlinecare 2.1) from the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Specialised home-nursing services were available. Clinical events were analysed using the Chi-square test (significance <i>p</i> < 0.05). Families subsequently completed a satisfaction survey. The Paediatric Intensive Care Unit management indicators were analysed. Results: All of our ventilator-dependent children were included (<i>n</i> = 12). At time of discharge from the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, they all required continuous mechanical ventilation and met the criteria of groups I–III of the OTA classification. In the first two years there were 141 events; the main cause was respiratory (69.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and telemedicine was the main care approach (86.5%, p < 0.001). Eleven events required hospitalisation (7.8%) but 38 (27.0%) hospitalisations were avoided. The emergency readmission time accounted for 0.99% of the total time. Six patients were decannulated, and one patient died due to primary cardiac arrest. All the families considered that the telemedicine had helped to avoid hospital visits, was not an intrusion into their privacy, and improved the child’s safety and quality of life. An improvement in Paediatric Intensive Care Unit indicators was achieved. Discussion: Telemedicine facilitated early and permanent discharge of our ventilator-dependent children to home care without affecting their quality of care.

AB  - Introduction: Normal body temperature is considered to be between 36 and 38°C. Temperatures that are too low may negatively affect physiological functions. In trauma cases, factors that promote the development of hypothermia include concomitant hypoxia, hypotension, decreased levels of consciousness, contact with cold surfaces, exposure to low ambient temperatures and the administration of cold fluids. Studies on emergency department related hypothermia in Africa are sparse. This study investigated instances of hypothermia in a sample of trauma cases arriving by ambulance to an emergency department in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: Core body temperatures of 140 trauma cases were measured upon arrival and 30 minutes later. Ambient temperatures outside the hospital, inside the ED and in the resuscitation areas were also recorded. Additional information was gathered describing the equipment available to the ambulance crews for temperature, control and rewarming. Results: Seventy-two (51%) of the cases were found to have core body temperatures less than 36°C upon arrival. Twenty-nine (21%) the cases were considered clinically hypothermic (core temperatures of less than <35°C). After 30 minutes, 79 (56%) of the participants had core body temperatures of less than 36°C and 39 (28%) remained lower than 35°C. Patients were not warming up in the ED as expected. Rather, some had become colder. The study also found that the ambient temperature in the triage area fluctuated and was recorded as less than the recommended 21°C in 95 (68%) of the cases. In addition, the majority of ambulances that transported these cases lacked appropriate equipment on board to properly facilitate temperature control and rewarming. Conclusion: Fifty-one percent of the trauma cases arriving by ambulance had core temperature <36°C. Many became even colder in the ED. Attention needs to be given to the early identification of hypothermia, the regulation of ambient temperatures inside the ED including the provision of appropriate heating and rewarming devices on ambulances.

AB  - Despite its importance to care, clinicians and researchers often discount patient-reported outcomes in favor of proxy reports, in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The rationale relates to concerns about lack of awareness of patients regarding their functioning. However, although lack of awareness occurs in some patients with severe TBI, or in TBI involving certain lesion locations, or very soon after injury, this conclusion has been overgeneralized. The objective of this study is to determine the validity of patient-reported health-related quality of life by evaluating its relationship to injury severity and more objective indices of outcome, in a representative series of adults with TBI. A consecutive sample of 374 persons with TBI at least 14 years old, and having a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 12, an acute seizure, or a CT scan showing TBI- related findings. Seventy-six percent (374/491) of the eligible survivors were assessed at 6 months post-injury on the Life Satisfaction Survey. The greatest decrease in satisfaction was in the ability to think and remember, work, receive adequate income, and participate in leisure and recreational activities. Dissatisfaction significantly related to the functional limitation in that area as judged by the patients themselves (<i>p</i> < 0.001) or by someone who knew them well (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). The most severely injured group reported the most dissatisfaction for 13 out of 17 areas assessed. Patients with TBI, in general, do not need a proxy to report on their behalf regarding their functional limitations or health-related quality of life.

AB  - The start-up of a stable mainstream deammonification requires sufficient anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). This study used a plug-flow fixed-bed reactor (PFBR) to verify the feasibility of establishing the mainstream deammonification system by inoculating the sidestream sludge after long-term refrigeration. A rapid resuscitation of the mainstream deammonification system was accomplished by controlling the front-end aeration rate of the PFBR. Results showed that the system was rapidly resuscitated in 44 days eventually with the nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen removal efficiency of 0.1 kg N.(m3.d)-1 and 79.1%, respectively. Also, the efficient performance was secured by the proportionate approaching equilibrium of AnAOB and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity of 2.35 ± 0.40 and 2.60 ± 0.29 mg N.(g VSS.h)-1, respectively. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that AnAOB abundance (detected Candidatus Kuenenia) negatively correlated with the AOB (mainly Nitrosomonas)/AnAOB abundance ratio, while correlated positively with the residual ammonium concentration of a region. Furthermore, long-term refrigeration probably reduced the cross-feed relationship between AnAOB and other symbiotic organisms (Armatimonadetes and Chloroflexi) to maintain the basic metabolism. Meanwhile, extracellular polymeric substances produced by other genera (order Xanthomonadales and Pseudomonadales) decreased the mass transfer, protecting AnAOB from unfavorable conditions, thereby facilitating high AnAOB abundance during refrigeration. Thus, this study provides a promising perspective towards the practical applications of mainstream process.

AB  - Respiratory therapists (RTs) and registered nurses (RNs) who work at a local hospital in the state of Maryland have expressed difficulty retaining the knowledge required to renew their advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) certification. The retention of skills is very important in responding to a life-threatening event, such as cardiac arrest. The ACLS is a key clinical competency for these clinicians, suggesting a need to understand how their retention and learning can be improved. Accordingly, the purpose of this qualitative study was to better understand the factors that may affect RNs and RTs in learning and retaining the knowledge and skills needed to renew the ACLS recertification. The conceptual framework was based on Kolb's experiential learning and Gurbin's information-processing theory. The research questions focused on the difficulties that RTs and RNs described in retaining the knowledge and skills from the ACLS recertification course and the strategies that RTs and RNs perceive in helping them to retain the knowledge and skills. The study was carried out through in-person, qualitative semistructured interviews with 5 RTs and 5 RNs. Interview data were analyzed through qualitative thematic analysis. As a result, there were themes developed and the outcome was that regular training and recertification in the knowledge and skills required to provide safe, effective care is essential. The study promotes social change by giving an opportunity to healthcare providers to practice and translate evidence-based practice into clinical practice. The results revealed that in order to successfully retain cognitive skills, educational programs need to be improved to enhance patient outcomes from better ACLS retention.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the aetiology and incidence of sudden cardiac arrest and death (SCA/D) in US competitive athletes. Methods: Prospective surveillance was conducted from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2018 through the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research in collaboration with national sports organisations. Autopsy reports, death certificates, and medical records were reviewed by an expert panel to determine aetiology. Athlete participation statistics from the National Federation of State High School Associations and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) were used to calculate incidence rates per athlete-years (AY). Comparisons of incidence rates were calculated using incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs. Results: 331 cases of confirmed SCA/D (158 survivors; 173 fatalities) were identified; 15.4% in middle school, 61.6% in high school and 16.6% in college and professional athletes. Average age was 16.7 (11-29) years, and the majority were in male (83.7%), basketball (28.7%) or American football (25.4%) athletes. Common causes included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (20.6%), idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy (13.4%), coronary artery anomalies (12.0%) and autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death (9.6%). Coronary anomalies were more common in middle school athletes (28%), while cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic, dilated, non-compaction or restricted) accounted for 47% of cases in college and professional athletes. Incidence was higher in male versus female athletes at the high school (1:43 932 AY (95% CI 1:38 101 to 1:50 907) vs 1:203 786 AY (95% CI 1:145 251 to 1:293 794); IRR 4.6 (95% CI 3.1 to 7.2)) and NCAA (1:34 906 AY (95% CI 1:25 385 to 1:49 173) vs 1:123 278 AY (95% CI 1:66 078 to 1:249 853); IRR 3.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 9.5)) levels. African American male NCAA Division I basketball players had the highest annual incidence rate of SCA/D (1:2087 AY (95% CI 1:1073 to 1:4 450)). Conclusions: Cardiomyopathies account for nearly half of SCA/D cases in college and professional athletes, while coronary artery anomalies play a more prominent role than expected in middle school athletes. Over half of SCA cases in athletes result in sudden death, calling for improved prevention strategies.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To explore how change-of-shift handoffs relate to nurses' clinical judgments regarding patient risk of deterioration. Background: The transfer of responsibility for patients' care comes with an exchange of information about their condition during change-of-shift handoff. However, it is unclear how this exchange affects nurses' clinical judgments regarding patient risk of deterioration. Design: A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study reported according to the STROBE and COREQ guidelines. Methods: Over four months, 62 nurses from one surgical and two medical units at a single Canadian hospital recorded their handoffs at change of shift. After each handoff, the two nurses involved each rated the patient's risk of experiencing cardiac arrest or being transferred to an intensive care unit in the next 24 hr separately. The information shared in handoffs was subjected to content analysis; code frequencies were contrasted per nurses' ratings of patient risk to identify characteristics of information that facilitated or hindered nurses' agreement. Results: Out of 444 recorded handoffs, there were 125 in which at least one nurse judged that a patient was at risk of deterioration; nurses agreed in 32 cases (25.6%) and disagreed in 93 (74.4%). These handoffs generally included information on abnormal vital signs, breathing problems, chest pain, alteration of mental status or neurological symptoms. However, the quantity and seriousness of clinical cues, recent transfers from intensive care units, pain without a clear cause, signs of delirium and nurses' knowledge of patient were found to affect nurses' agreement. Conclusions: Nurses exchanged more information regarding known indicators of deterioration in handoffs when they judged that patients were at risk. Disagreements most often involved incoming nurses rating patient risk as higher. Relevance to clinical practice: This study suggests a need to sensitise nurses to the impact of certain cues at report on their colleagues' subsequent clinical judgments. Low levels of agreement between nurses underscore the importance of exchanging impressions regarding the likely evolution of a patient's situation to promote continuity of care.

AB  - Background: Early and effective CPR increases both survival rate and post-arrest quality of life. In limited resource countries like Tanzania, there is scarce data describing the basic knowledge of CPR among Healthcare providers (HCP). This study aimed to determine the current level of knowledge on, and ability to perform, CPR among HCP at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study of a random sample of 350 HCP from all cadres and departments at MNH from October 2015 to March 2016. Each participant completed a with 25 question multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank CPR test and a practical test using a CPR manikin where the participant was videotaped for 1-2 min. Two expert observers independently viewed the videos and rated participant performance on a structured data form. The primary outcome of interest was staff member overall performance on the written and practical CPR testing. Results: We enrolled 350 HCPs from all 12 MNH clinical departments. The median participant age was 35 (IQR 29-43) years, 225 (64%) were female and 138 (39%) had clinical experience of less than 5 years. Only 57 (16%) and 88 (25%) scored above 50% in written and practical tests, respectively according to local minimum passing test score and 13(4%) and 30 (9%) scored above 75% in written and practical tests, respectively according to international minimum passing test score on CPR. The 233(67%) HCP who reported prior experience performing CPR on an adult patient scored higher on testing than those without; 40% (IQR 28-54) versus 26% (IQR 16-42) respectively, but both groups had median scores <50%. Conclusion: The level of CPR knowledge and skills displayed by all cadres and in all departments was poor despite the fact that most providers reported having performed CPR in the past. Since MNH is a tertiary referral hospital, it may reflect the performance of resuscitation status of other local health centers in Tanzania and other low-income countries to employ a formal system of training every HCP in CPR. Staff should be certified and assessed regularly to ensure retention of resuscitation knowledge and skills.

AB  - Aims and Objectives: To examine how clinicians practise the principles of beneficence when deciding to allow or deny family presence during resuscitation. Background: Family presence during resuscitation has important benefits for family and is supported by professional bodies and the public. Yet, many clinicians restrict family access to patients during resuscitation, and rationales for decision-making are unclear. Design: Secondary analysis of an existing qualitative data set using deductive category application of content analysis. Methods: We analysed 20 interview transcripts from 15 registered nurses, two doctors and three paramedics who had experienced family presence during resuscitation in an Australian hospital. The transcripts were analysed for incidents of beneficent decision-making when allowing or denying family presence during resuscitation. Results: Decision-making around family presence during resuscitation occurred in time poor environments and in the absence of local institutional guidelines. Clinicians appeared to be motivated by doing “what’s best” for patients and families when allowing or denying family presence during resuscitation. However, their individual interpretations of “what’s best” was subjective and did not always coincide with family preferences or with current evidence that promotes family presence during resuscitation as beneficial. Conclusions: The decision to allow or deny family presence during resuscitation is complex, and often impacted by personal preferences and beliefs, setting norms and tensions between clinicians and consumers. As a result, many families are missing the chance to be with their loved ones at the end of life. The introduction of institutional guidelines and policies would help to establish what safe and effective practice consists of, reduce value-laden decision-making and guide beneficent decisionmaking. Relevance to Clinical Practice: These findings highlight current deficits in decisionmaking around FPDR and could prompt the introduction of clinical guidelines and policies and in turn promote the equitable provision of safe, effective family-centred care during resuscitation events.

AB  - The occurrence of sepsis in the critically ill population is a dreaded phenomenon when taking into consideration the devastating complications associated with the disease. Despite its high incidence and unacceptably high mortality, this complex syndrome remains poorly understood in terms of defining the disease, detecting the presence or absence of an infection, and therapeutic strategies to optimise immediate and long-term outcomes. Global efforts to address these issues coupled with significant advances in medical technologies and our improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease have led to some exciting developments in the domain of adjunctive therapies for sepsis. In particular, interest has focused around immunomodulation strategies and metabolic resuscitation. Some of these therapies sound particularly promising in terms of the early available evidence. The concept of personalised or individualised medicine takes centre stage when considering such therapies, as it is becoming increasingly evident that in order to achieve benefits, we need to introduce appropriate therapies at the right time, the right dose and for an appropriate duration. This review encapsulates a selection of these new adjunctive therapies.

AB  - Lactated Ringer's (LR) and normal saline (NS) are both used for resuscitation of injured patients. NS has been associated with increased resuscitation volume, blood loss, acidosis, and coagulopathy compared with LR. We sought to determine if pre-hospital LR is associated with improved outcome compared with NS in patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). We included patients receiving pre-hospital LR or NS from the PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study. Patients with TBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] head ≥3) and without TBI (AIS head ≤2) were compared. Cox proportional hazards models including Injury Severity Score (ISS), AIS head, AIS extremity, age, fluids, intubation status, and hospital site were generated for prediction of mortality. Linear regression models were generated for prediction of red blood cell (RBC) and crystalloid requirement, and admission biochemical/physiological parameters. Seven hundred ninety-one patients received either LR (<i>n</i> = 117) or NS (<i>n</i> = 674). Median ISS, AIS head, AIS extremity, and pre-hospital fluid volume were higher in TBI and non-TBI patients receiving LR compared with NS (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In patients with TBI (<i>n</i> = 308), LR was associated with higher adjusted mortality compared with NS (hazard rate [HR] = 1.78, confidence interval [CI] 1.04–3.04, <i>p</i> = 0.035). In patients without TBI (<i>n</i> = 483), no difference in mortality was demonstrated (HR = 1.49, CI 0.757–2.95, <i>p</i> = 0.247). Fluid type had no effect on admission biochemical or physiological parameters, 6-hour RBC, or crystalloid requirement in either group. LR was associated with increased mortality compared with NS in patients with TBI. These results underscore the need for a prospective randomized trial comparing pre-hospital LR with NS in patients with TBI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To describe the functional outcome of canine and feline survivors of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and the clinical characteristics surrounding their resuscitation. Retrospective study. Veterinary teaching hospital. Client-owned dogs (15) and cats (3) with CPA. None. Eighteen animals were identified to have survived to discharge following CPA. Cardiopulmonary arrest was associated with anesthesia with or without pre-existing disease in 10 animals, cardiovascular collapse in 5 animals, and chronic disease with an imposed stress in 3 animals. All CPAs were witnessed in the hospital. The most common initial rhythm at CPA was asystole (72%). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in less than 15 minutes from the onset of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) in all animals. No animals had a recurrence of CPA after the initial CPA. Animals were of a wide range of ages (0.5–16 years) and breeds. Two animals were neurologically abnormal at discharge, one of which was normal at 2 months following CPA. A good functional recovery after CPCR was documented in the small number of CPA survivors presented in this study. This may be due to the reversible nature of their inciting cause of CPA, early detections of CPA (‘witnessed’), and/or the animal's underlying normal health status.

AB  - Introduction: Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) affecting the rectum or sigmoid colon is associated with infertility, severe pain and decreased quality of life. As most women with DIE are young, many have a pregnancy intention. Treatment possibilities of endometriosis-associated infertility are surgery or assisted reproductive technologies (ART). However, no studies have compared the two interventions directly. Therefore, this study aims to determine the cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR) and the live birth rate (LBR) after first-line surgery compared with first-line ART for women with rectosigmoid DIE and a pregnancy intention. Methods and analysis: Multicentre, parallel-group, randomised trial of women with rectosigmoid DIE and a pregnancy intention for at least 6 months in Aarhus, Denmark and Bordeaux, France. 352 women aged 18-38 years are randomised 1:1 to either surgical management (shaving, disc excision or segmental resection) or ART management (at least two in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedures if not pregnant after the first cycle). Women in the surgical intervention group will attempt to get pregnant by either spontaneous conception or ART, depending on the endometriosis fertility index score. Primary outcome measures are CPR and LBR at 18 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes are: Non-viable pregnancies, time to pregnancy, pain score, quality of life, complication rate, bowel and bladder function, endocrine and inflammatory profile, number of oocytes, blastocysts, frozen embryos and blastocyst morphology score within 18 months after either intervention. Ethics and dissemination: Conduct of this study is approved by the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics and Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile de France VIII. Study participants must sign an informed consent form. The results will be presented at national and international conferences and published in international peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - Global health education is offered increasingly during residency training. The University of Minnesota has offered a global pediatrics track to residents since 2005. This study aimed to understand the impacts of a global pediatrics track on graduates' career choices, skills, and current engagement in global health. An electronic survey was sent to 110 track graduates in February to April 2020. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Content analysis of written comments was conducted. The response rate was 62% overall, varying by question. Overall, 75% of responding graduates reported global pediatrics track participation affected their career choices. Eighty-four percent recalled plans to work in global health after graduation and 64% of respondents reported working in global health abroad or at home at the time of the survey. Incorporation of public health and global research represented the greatest percentage change in career plans from the time of enrollment to graduation (24% and 27%, respectively). Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that track participation improved their ability to elicit information about cultural beliefs and practices, and 86% reported improvement in cost-conscious care. An increase in global health knowledge and skills was the most common category of impact cited by respondents. Neonatal resuscitation, bubble continuous positive airway pressure, and homemade spacers for metered-dose inhalers were the most used global health-adapted skills. Our study found that graduates of the global pediatrics track perceive their participation affected their knowledge, skills, and attitudes positively, with the potential to improve clinical care and promote health equity locally and globally.

AB  - Background: Internationally, the COVID-19 pandemic severely curtailed access to hospital facilities for those awaiting elective/semi-elective procedures. For allergic children in Ireland, already waiting up to 4 years for an elective oral food challenge (OFC), the restrictions signified indefinite delay. At the time of the initiative, there were approx 900 children on the Children's Health Ireland (CHI) waiting list. In July 2020, a project was facilitated by short-term (6 weeks) access to an empty COVID stepdown facility built, in a hotel conference centre, commandeered by the Health Service Executive (HSE), Ireland. The aim of this study was to achieve the rapid roll-out of an offsite OFC service, delivering high throughput of long waiting patients, while aligning with existing hospital policies and quality standards, international allergy guidelines and national social distancing standards. Methods: The working group engaged key stakeholders to rapidly develop an offsite OFC facility. Consultant paediatric allergists, consultant paediatricians, trainees and allergy clinical nurse specialists were seconded from other duties. The facility was already equipped with hospital beds, bedside monitors (BP, pulse and oxygen saturation) and bedside oxygen. All medication and supplies had to be brought from the base hospital. Daily onsite consultant anaesthetic cover was resourced and a resuscitation room equipped. Standardized food challenge protocols were created. Access to the onsite hotel chef facilitated food preparation. A risk register was established. Results: After 6 weeks of planning, the remote centre became operational on 7/9/2020, with the capacity of 27 OFC/day. 474 challenges were commenced: 465 (98%) were completed and 9 (2%) were inconclusive. 135 (29%) OFCs were positive, with 25 (5%) causing anaphylaxis. No child required advanced airway intervention. 8 children were transferred to the base hospital. The CHI allergy waiting list was reduced by almost 60% in only 24 days. Conclusions: Oral food challenges remain a vital tool in the care of allergic children, with their cost saving and quality-of-life benefits negatively affected by a delay in their delivery. This project has shown it is possible to have huge impacts on a waiting list efficiently, effectively and safely with good planning and staff buy-in-even in a pandemic. Adoption of new, flexible and efficient models of service delivery will be important for healthcare delivery in the post-COVID-19 era.

AB  - Importance: In the United States, acute pancreatitis is one of the leading causes of hospital admission from gastrointestinal diseases, with approximately 300 000 emergency department visits each year. Outcomes from acute pancreatitis are influenced by risk stratification, fluid and nutritional management, and follow-up care and risk-reduction strategies, which are the subject of this review. Observations: MEDLINE was searched via PubMed as was the Cochrane databases for English-language studies published between January 2009 and August 2020 for current recommendations for predictive scoring tools, fluid management and nutrition, and follow-up and risk-reduction strategies for acute pancreatitis. Several scoring systems, such as the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II tools, have good predictive capabilities for disease severity (mild, moderately severe, and severe per the revised Atlanta classification) and mortality, but no one tool works well for all forms of acute pancreatitis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition are associated with lower rates of mortality and infectious complications, yet the optimal type and rate of fluid resuscitation have yet to be determined. The underlying etiology of acute pancreatitis should be sought in all patients, and risk-reduction strategies, such as cholecystectomy and alcohol cessation counseling, should be used during and after hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. Conclusions and Relevance: Acute pancreatitis is a complex disease that varies in severity and course. Prompt diagnosis and stratification of severity influence proper management. Scoring systems are useful adjuncts but should not supersede clinical judgment. Fluid management and nutrition are very important aspects of care for acute pancreatitis.

AB  - Background: Globally, mobile health (mHealth) applications are known for their potential to improve healthcare providers' access to relevant and reliable health information. Besides, electronic decision support tools, such as the Safe Delivery mHealth Application (SDA), may help to reduce clinical errors and to ensure quality care at the point of service delivery. The current study investigated the use of the SDA and its relationship to basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEmONC) outcomes for the most frequent complications in Rwanda; post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) and newborn asphyxia. Methods: The study adopted a pre-post intervention design. A pre-intervention record review of BEmONC outcomes: Apgar score and PPH progressions, was conducted for 6 months' period (February 2019 - July 2019). The intervention took place in two district hospitals in Rwanda and entails the implementation of the SDA for 6 months (October 2019- March 2020), and included 54 nurses and midwives using the SDA to manage PPH and neonatal resuscitation. Six months' post-SDA intervention, the effect of the SDA on BEmONC outcomes was evaluated. The study included 327 participants (114 cases of PPH and 213 cases of neonatal complications). The analysis compared the outcome variables between the baseline and the endline data. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportions and test between-group differences and significance level set at p < 0.05. Results: Unstable newborn outcomes following neonatal resuscitation were recorded in 62% newborns cases at baseline and 28% newborns cases at endline, P-value = 0.000. Unstable maternal outcomes following PPH management were recorded in 19% maternal cases at baseline and 6% maternal cases at endline, P-value = 0.048. There was a significant association between the SDA intervention and newborns' and maternal' outcomes following neonatal resuscitation and PPH management, 6 months after baseline. Conclusion: The use of the SDA supported nurses and midwives in the management of PPH and neonatal resuscitation which may have contributed to improved maternal and neonatal outcomes during 6 months of the SDA intervention. The findings of this study are promising as they contribute to a broader knowledge about the effectiveness of SDA in low and middle income hospital settings.

AB  - Recovery following an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) impacts both the patient and partner, often in divergent ways. Patients may have had a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmias, whereas partners may have to perform CPR and manage the ongoing challenges of heart disease therapy. Currently, support for post-ICD care focuses primarily on restoring patient functioning with few interventions available to partners who serve as primary support. This descriptive study examined and compared patterns of change for both patients and partners during the first year post-ICD implantation. For this longitudinal study, the sample included 42 of 55 (76.4 %) patient–partner dyads who participated in the ‘usual care’ group of a larger intervention RCT with patients following ICD implant for secondary prevention of cardiac arrest. Measures taken at across five time points (at hospital discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up) tracked physical function (SF-12 PCS, symptoms); psychological adjustment (SF-12 MCS; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; CES-D); relationship impact (Family Functioning, DOII; Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity, MIS); and healthcare utilization (ED visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to characterize and compare outcome trends for patients and partners across the first 12 months of recovery. Patients were 66.5 ± 11.3 (mean + SD) years old, predominately Caucasian male (91 %), with Charlson co-morbidities of 4.4 ± 2.4. Partners were 62.5 ± 11.1 years old, predominantly female (91 %) with Charlson co-morbidities of 2.9 ± 3.0. Patient versus partner differences were observed in the pattern of physical health (<i>F</i> = 10.8, <i>p</i> < 0.0001); patient physical health improved while partner health showed few changes. For partners compared to patients, anxiety, depression, and illness demands on family functioning tended to be higher. Patient mutuality was stable, while partner mutuality increased steadily (<i>F</i> = 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.05). Patient sensitivity was highest at discharge and declined; partner sensitivity increased (F = 10.2, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) across the 12-month recovery. Outpatient visits for patients versus partners differed (<i>F</i> = 5.0, <i>p</i> = 0.008) due most likely to the number of required patient ICD visits. Total hospitalizations and ED visits were higher for patients versus partners, but not significantly. The findings highlight the potential reciprocal influences of patient and partner responses to the ICD experience on health outcomes. Warranted are new, sound and feasible strategies to counterbalance partner needs while simultaneously optimizing patient recovery outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: This systematic review examined available literature on the prognostic accuracy of Doppler ultrasound for adverse perinatal outcomes in low/middle-income countries (LMIC). Design: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to April 2020. Setting: Observational or interventional studies from LMICs. Participants: Singleton pregnancies of any risk profile. Interventions Umbilical artery (UA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), cerebroplacental ratio (CPR), uterine artery (UtA), fetal descending aorta (FDA), ductus venosus, umbilical vein and inferior vena cava. Primary and secondary outcome measures Perinatal death, stillbirth, neonatal death, expedited delivery for fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal acidosis, Apgar scores, preterm birth, fetal anaemia, respiratory distress syndrome, length of hospital stay, birth asphyxia and composite adverse perinatal outcomes (CAPO). Results: We identified 2825 records, and 30 (including 4977 women) from Africa (40.0%, n=12), Asia (56.7%, n=17) and South America (3.3%, n=01) were included. Many individual studies reported associations and promising predictive values of UA Doppler for various adverse perinatal outcomes mostly in high-risk pregnancies, and moderate to high predictive values of MCA, CPR and UtA Dopplers for CAPO. A few studies suggested that the MCA and FDA may be potent predictors of fetal anaemia. No randomised clinical trial (RCT) was found. Most studies were of suboptimal quality, poorly powered and characterised by wide variations in outcome classifications, the timing for the Doppler tests and study populations. Conclusion: Local evidence to guide how antenatal Doppler ultrasound should be used in LMIC is lacking. Well-designed studies, preferably RCTs, are required. Standardisation of practice and classification of perinatal outcomes across countries, following the international standards, is imperative.

AB  - Context: Evidence is mixed regarding the impact of advance directives (ADs) on the utilization of end-of-life treatments. Objectives: This study evaluated the effect of AD on the utilization of end-of-life treatments during the last month of life in older patients. Methods: Taipei City Hospital initiated an advance care planning program to promote AD for admitted patients in 2015. This prospective study recruited deceased older patients who completed advance care planning communication between 2015 and 2016. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of AD completion with utilization of life-sustaining treatments. Results: Of 1307 deceased older patients, overall mean age was 84.1 years and 78.7% of the subjects had AD completion. During the study follow-up period, 31 older patients received life-sustaining treatments during the last month of life, including 17 patients (1.7%) with AD completion and 14 patients (5.0%) without AD completion. After adjusting for the sociodemographic factors and co-morbidities, older patients with AD completion were less likely to receive life-sustaining treatments during the last month of life (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.67). Considering type of life-sustaining treatments, AD completion was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06-0.70) as well as intubation and mechanical ventilation support (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.70) during the last month of life in older patients. Conclusion: AD completion was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving life-sustaining treatments during the last month of life in older patients. These findings support the continued use of AD in older population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional death among children worldwide. Although natural waters pose a risk of drowning in low-income countries, swimming pools are more prevalent in high-income countries. In Saudi Arabia, injuries and drowning are a significant threat to population health. Local data is limited, which affects an understanding of the extent of the burden and the development of prevention strategies. OBJECTIVES: Determine the epidemiological characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of drowning among children. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Patients admitted to the tertiary care unit of a hospital in Riyadh. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data was collected on children who drowned (age 0-14) between January 2015 and August 2020. Cases were identified from the electronic health record system where the diagnosis was drowning. Differences in characteristics and outcomes between nonfatal cases with no neurological damage and fatal cases with neurological damage were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Drowning mortality and morbidity. SAMPLE SIZE: 99. RESULTS: Of the 99 drowning cases, 22 (22.2%) had a fatal outcome or resulted in neurological damage. The most-reported drowning site was private pools (82%). The majority of cases involved children younger than the age of two (54%). Eighty-four cases (84.8%) occurred on holidays. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in 61 (61.6%) of cases. A significant association was found between the delay in initiating resuscitation and an unfavorable outcome (P<.01). A high Glasgow Coma Scale score upon admission was a predictor of normal recovery (P<.01). CONCLUSION: These findings warrant investment to increase public awareness of the risks of leaving children unsupervised in swimming pools. In addition, there is a need to ensure early resuscitation of drowning victims by promoting life support courses in order to facilitate positive outcomes. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in one tertiary center located in a non-coastal city so the results may not be generalizable. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None.

AB  - During inhospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts, a designated family support person (FSP) may provide guidance and support to family members. Research on nurses and chaplains in this role has been published. Social workers also regularly fulfill this service, however, little is known about how they perceive and enact this role. To explore their experiences, qualitative interviews (n = 10) were conducted with FSP social workers. Critical realist thematic analysis identified five themes: walking in cold, promoting family presence, responding to the whole spectrum of grief, going beyond the family support role, and repercussions of bearing witness. Social workers perform a variety of tasks to promote family presence during resuscitation attempts and provide psychosocial support over the continuum of care. The FSP role impacts social workers emotionally and professionally. Implications for hospital policy, staffing, and clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the clinical effect of emergency dermabrasion combined with biological dressing A on wound microcirculation and preventing sepsis in deep degree-II burns. Methods. A total of 90 patients with deep degree-II burns admitted to the hospital were retrospectively enrolled between January 2020 and January 2022. According to different treatment methods, they were divided into the control group (42 cases, biological dressing A) and the observation group (48 cases, emergency dermabrasion combined with biological dressing A). The clinical curative effect in both groups was observed. The wound repair rate and wound healing quality, and changes in levels of wound microcirculation-related indexes (serum epidermal growth factor (EGF), wound blood flow, and partial pressure of transcutaneous oxygen) and inflammatory cytokines (C-reactive protein (CPR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and procalcitonin (PCT)) before treatment, at 3d and 7d after treatment were compared between the two groups. The incidence of wound infection and sepsis in both groups was recorded. Results. The wound healing time in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group, and wound healing quality in the observation group was better than that in the control group (). At 3 d and 7d after treatment, the levels of serum EGF, wound blood flow and partial pressure of transcutaneous oxygen in both groups were all increased (), which were higher in the observation group than those in the control group (). The levels of CRP, IL-6, ESR, and PCT in both groups were all decreased (), which were lower in the observation group than those in the control group (). There was no significant difference in incidence of sepsis between observation group and control group (4.17% (2/48) vs. 7.14% (3/42)) (Fisher = 0.539). Conclusion. Emergency dermabrasion combined with biological dressing A can effectively improve wound microcirculation in patients with deep degree-II burns, promote wound healing, shorten wound healing time, improve wound healing quality, effectively control inflammatory response, and prevent sepsis.

AB  - Objective: To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Methods: We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 3–5 at 6 months. Results: Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median538.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.7–245 ng/l in poor vs median = 1.5, IQR = 0.7–2.4 ng/l in good outcome, for tau at 72 hours, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Tau cutoffs had low false-positive rates (FPRs) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 hours had FPR52% (95% CI51–4%) with sensitivity566% (95% CI561–70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau vs 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, <i>p =</i> 0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy in predicting outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33 8C and 36 8C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest. Interpretation: Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

AB  - Iron deficiency anemia is among the most frequent causes of disability. Intravenous iron is the quickest way to correct iron deficiency, bypassing the bottleneck of iron intestinal absorption, the only true mechanism of iron balance regulation in human body. Intravenous iron administration is suggested in patients who are refractory/intolerant to oral iron sulfate. However, the intravenous way of iron administration requires several precautions; as the in-hospital administration requires a resuscitation service, as imposed in Europe by the European Medicine Agency, it is very expensive and negatively affects patient's perceived quality of life. A new oral iron formulation, Sucrosomial iron, bypassing the normal way of absorption, seems to be cost-effective in correcting iron deficiency anemia at doses higher than those usually effective with other oral iron formulations. In this multicentric randomized study, we analyze the cost-effectiveness of intravenous sodium ferrigluconate vs oral Sucrosomial iron in patients with iron deficiency anemia refractory/intolerant to oral iron sulfate without other interfering factors on iron absorption.

AB  - Rehabilitation psychologists are a critical part of the multidisciplinary burn treatment team across both the inpatient and outpatient settings. In addition to having a unique understanding of the biopsychosocial model of burn recovery and the ability to treat various mental health conditions, rehabilitation psychologists lead the way in research to improve the quality of life of burn survivors. Improvements in burn care, such as the development of comprehensive burn centers, advances in resuscitation, and surgical management of patients with large burns, have resulted in improved survival rates. This chapter addresses the demographics of people with burn injuries and describes the recovery process and long-term outcomes of burn survivors. The American Board of Professional Psychology has developed standard competencies required for board certification in rehabilitation psychology. Burn recovery addresses many of these competencies. The chapter concludes by discussing specific topics relevant to burn care: pain, body image issues, and physical activity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To review the patterns and outcomes of pediatric thoracic penetrating injuries in a level one trauma center. Methods: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who presented to the King Abdulaziz Medical City Emergency Department (KAMC-ED), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with thoracic penetrating injury from 2001 to 2016. Results: Eighty-nine patients had a penetrating injury to the thorax were identified. The mean age was 15.5 ± 3.6 years. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.87 ± 5 days. The most common cause was stabbing followed by gunshot. Isolated injury to the thorax was seen in 58 patients. The most common injuries sustained were pneumothorax and hemothorax. In the ED, tube thoracostomy was required in 65 patients, endotracheal intubation in 12, blood transfusion in 14, massive blood transfusion in one, pericardiocentesis in one, and ED thoracotomy in 2. Only 15 patients required surgical intervention. The overall mortality rate was 3.4%. Death was mainly caused by associated injuries to the heart, aorta and/or inferior vena cava. Conclusion: Thoracic injuries represent 25% of the overall penetrating traumas in pediatric age group. Most sustained injuries can be safely managed non-operatively, with a favorable outcome. Prompt resuscitation and intervention are required to identify and manage life-threatening injuries.

AB  - The strategic location of primary care providers (PCPs) in clinics, private general practices and emergency departments is critical to the detection and appropriate management of patients with suicidal behaviour. Their position within the primary care setting and responsibil ity for preventive and promotive care require PCPs to possess good clinical skills and evidence-based knowledge to assist patients presenting with suicidal ideation and behaviour. The objective of this article is to provide guidelines for the management of suicidal behaviour within the primary care setting, with the goal of reducing deaths from suicide, and the frequency and intensity of suicide attempts. The priority in the management of patients presenting at health facilities following suicide attempts is medical resuscitation and stabilisation. As soon as the patient is medically stable, a thorough suicide risk assessment, which evaluates suicidal ideation/intent, preceding circumstances, predisposing and protective factors, should be conducted. An assessment of current and ongoing suicide risk will assist in determining the safest place to manage the patient. For those with a low level of suicide risk, outpatient management may be considered in the presence of a good social support system at home and a well-documented safety plan. Measures should be put in place to address the modifiable psychosocial risk factors for suicide, whilst appropriate pharmacotherapy is instituted for co-existing mental illness. Post-discharge care such as referral to psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker should be initiated by the primary care practitioner to ensure continuity of care. Support and psycho-education should also be extended to immediate family members of patients with suicidal behaviour for their own well-being and their ability to support the patient.

AB  - Headache is one of the most common manifestations of non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, which is an uncommon, but not rare, cause of cardiac arrest in adults. History of a sudden headache preceding collapse may be a helpful clue to estimate the cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Medical records of witnessed OHCA patients were reviewed to identify those who complained of a sudden headache preceding collapse, and the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage among them as well as their clinical characteristics was investigated retrospectively. During the 12-month period, 124 patients who sustained a witnessed OHCA were treated. Among them, 74 (60%) collapsed without any pain complaint, and only 6 (5%) complained of a sudden headache preceding collapse. All of the six patients were resuscitated: four had a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), while the other two had a massive cerebellar hemorrhage. By contrast, 39 of the 74 patients who collapsed without any pain were resuscitated. Among them, another six patients were found to harbor an SAH. Thus, a total of 12 among the 124 witnessed OHCA (10%) sustained a fatal intracranial hemorrhage. While OHCA patients who collapse complaining of a sudden headache are uncommonly seen in the emergency room, they have a high likelihood of harboring a severe intracranial hemorrhage. It should also be reminded that approximately half of patients whose cardiac arrest is due to an intracranial hemorrhage may collapse without complaining of a headache. The prognosis of those with cerebral origin of OHCA is invariably poor, although they may relatively easily be resuscitated temporarily. Focus needs to be directed to avoid sudden death from a potentially treatable cerebral lesion, and public education to promote the awareness for the symptoms of potentially lethal hemorrhagic stroke is warranted.

AB  - Background Mild to moderate cognitive impairment is common amongst long-term survivors of cardiac arrest. In the Target Temperature Management trial (TTM-trial) comatose survivors were randomized to 33°C or 36°C temperature control for 24 hours after cardiac arrest and the effects on survival and neurological outcome assessed. This protocol describes a sub-study of the TTM-trial investigating cognitive dysfunction and its consequences for patients' and relatives' daily life. Methods/Design Sub-study sites in five European countries included surviving TTM patients 180 days after cardiac arrest. In addition to the instruments for neurological function used in the main trial, sub-study patients were specifically tested for difficulties with memory (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test), attention (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) and executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery). Cognitive impairments will be related to the patients' degree of participation in society (Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4), health related quality of life (Short Form Questionnaire-36v2©), and the caregivers' situation (Zarit Burden Interview©). The two intervention groups (33°C and 36°C) will be compared with a group of myocardial infarction controls. Discussion This large international sub-study of a randomized controlled trial will focus on mild to moderate cognitive impairment and its consequences for cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers. By using an additional battery of tests we may be able to detect more subtle differences in cognitive function between the two intervention groups than identified in the main study. The results of the study could be used to develop a relevant screening model for cognitive dysfunction after cardiac arrest.

AB  - The British Association for Psychopharmacology and the National Association of Psychiatric Intensive Care and Low Secure Units developed this joint evidence-based consensus guideline for the clinical management of acute disturbance. It includes recommendations for clinical practice and an algorithm to guide treatment by healthcare professionals with various options outlined according to their route of administration and category of evidence. Fundamental overarching principles are included and highlight the importance of treating the underlying disorder. There is a focus on three key interventions: de-escalation, pharmacological interventions pre-rapid tranquillisation and rapid tranquillisation (intramuscular and intravenous). Most of the evidence reviewed relates to emergency psychiatric care or acute psychiatric adult inpatient care, although we also sought evidence relevant to other common clinical settings including the general acute hospital and forensic psychiatry. We conclude that the variety of options available for the management of acute disturbance goes beyond the standard choices of lorazepam, haloperidol and promethazine and includes oral-inhaled loxapine, buccal midazolam, as well as a number of oral antipsychotics in addition to parenteral options of intramuscular aripiprazole, intramuscular droperidol and intramuscular olanzapine. Intravenous options, for settings where resuscitation equipment and trained staff are available to manage medical emergencies, are also included.

AB  - Food components with thermogenic properties are promising antiobesity agents. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) bioactive compounds have a capsaicin-like vanillyl portion, which has been attributed to thermogenic effect in previous experimental studies. However, studies conducted in humans have evaluated only the acute thermogenic effect of ginger, and demonstrated contradictory results. We evaluated the effect of long-term consumption of dry ginger extract on the resting energy expenditure (REE) of female adults with high body adiposity. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT02570633). Participants age 18 to 60 y were randomly assigned into two groups: Intervention (600 mg of ginger extract daily) and placebo (cellulose). The intervention lasted 3 mo. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and REE were assessed at each visit. Results: A total of 66 female participants with high body adiposity were included in the analysis (mean age: 29 y [range, 20-55 y]; body mass index: 23.3 ± 2.7), with 30 participants in the ginger group and 36 in the placebo group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. No differences were observed for group × time interaction on REE. Body composition and blood pressure followed the same pattern (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: Ginger extract consumption for 3 mo did not change the REE, anthropometric, and clinical data of female adults with excess adiposity.

AB  - Systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure represent two hallmarks of the Post Cardiac Arrest Syndrome (PCAS), and when present, are associated with severe neurological injury and often mortality. With the return of spontaneous circulation, 'primed,' neurotoxic neutrophils (PMNs) release degradative enzymes, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species that cause blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, tissue injury, and further PMN activation. In our pilot studies, we noted that remote cerebral ischemia-reperfusion triggered the activation and accumulation PMNs in the lung. Evidence from the critical care literature also suggests that interactions with the pulmonary endothelium, among others, may regulate systemic PMN de-priming. These observations led us to propose the existence of immunological coupling between the lung and brain and to investigate whether systemic inflammation impairs this protective influence in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion. To test this, we developed a model of PCAS in mice by pairing transient global cerebral ischemia (achieved by three-vessel occlusion, 3VO) with the exposure to the prototypical endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) upon reperfusion. After establishing an intraperitoneal dose of LPS sufficient to produce serum levels observed in post-arrest patients, we found that combined 3VO/LPS treatment induced PMN activation, blood-brain barrier compromise, microglial activation, and a doubling of PMN accumulation and injury in the cerebral cortex. The 3VO/LPS procedure also promoted PMN accumulation and edema in the lung, as well as the trafficking of PMNs to the non-ischemic kidney and liver. Studies have shown that targeted expression of the antioxidant extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) from type II pneumocytes is sufficient to reduce oxidant-induce lung injury and inflammation in mice. To test whether focal manipulation of lung redox biology could exert similar effects in our model, we examined the effects of 3VO/LPS treatment in the Tg(SOD3) model. Our results indicate that increased SOD3 expression in the lung was protective against 3VO/LPS-induced lung edema, pulmonary PMN accumulation, microglial activation, cortical damage, and hippocampal apoptosis. SOD3 expression reduced the expression of CD11b on the surface of PMNs but had little effect on trafficking to the brain following 3VO/LPS. The protective effects of SOD3 were, however, limited in mice exposed to transient global ischemia alone. Our work highlights the importance of lung-brain coupling in ischemia-reperfusion injury and suggests that interventions targeting both PMN priming and redox changes that occur in the lung after ischemia-reperfusion may be valuable. These findings are particularly salient given the increased risk of stroke in patients with underlying lung disease and endothelial damage caused by smoking and other cardiovascular risk factors. Given its accessibility to pharmacological manipulation, our work suggests that targeting the lung with inhaled pharmacological agents could produce maximal benefit by short-circuiting systemic immune priming in patients following cardiac arrest or focal stroke revascularization.

AB  - Chronic pollution by used lubricant oils (ULOs) poses a serious challenge to the environment. Under stress conditions, microorganisms, including potential degraders, can enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, complicating the bioremediation of ULO-polluted areas. Resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs) can reverse this transition and/or enhance the biodegradation performance of both native and augmented strains. Here, Rpf-containing extracellular organic matter (EOM) from Micrococcus luteus was used to enhance the ex situ ULO removal in biostimulated and bioaugmented (with Rhodococcus qingshengii KAG C, R. erythropolis PR4) soils. ULO bioconversion, microbial activity, and CFUs were significantly higher in EOM-treated soils compared to corresponding control soils. After 60 days, the initial ULO concentration (52,500 mg kg-1) was reduced by 37% and 45% with EOM-supplemented biostimulation and bioaugmentation, respectively. Based on high-throughput 16S rRNA analysis, the enhancement was attributable both to the reactivation of EOM-responsive hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial genera (e.g., Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Stenotrophomonas, Gordonia) and to the long-term positive effect of EOM on the degradative efficacy of the introduced rhodococci. Ecotoxicological responses revealed that reduced ULO concentration did not correlate with decreased soil toxicity. Our findings provide an insight into the applicability of EOM in bioremediation and its effects on the soil microbial activity and community composition.

AB  - Worldwide, neonatal sepsis accounts for an estimated 26% of under-five deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa having the highest mortality rates. Though worldwide neonatal deaths have decreased by over 3.6 million per year since 2000, neonatal sepsis remains a notable hindrance to the progress in the decline of cause-specific mortality rates especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed at examining the risk factors of neonatal sepsis at the Trauma and Specialist Hospital, Winneba. The study was an unmatched case control retrospective study. Cases were neonates who had sepsis with their index mothers and controls were neonates who did not have sepsis with their index mothers. Neonatal and maternal medical records were retrieved from January to December 2017. Data abstraction lasted for one month and 2650 folders for the neonates and their index mothers were retrieved. Nine hundred (900) neonatal folders were considered valid for the study and likewise for the maternal folders. One hundred and three (103) folders were considered cases while 797 were considered as controls. Data were entered using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 22. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk of neonatal sepsis. Maternal factors that predicted the occurrence of sepsis among neonates were parity (p < 0.027), mode of delivery (p < 0.001), bleeding disorder (p < 0.001), and PROM (p < 0.001). Neonatal risk factors which predicted the occurrence of sepsis were APGAR score in the first and fifth minute (p < 0.001), resuscitation at birth (p < 0.004), duration of stay in the facility (p < 0.001), and neonatal age on admission (p < 0.001). The study found both maternal and neonatal factors to have a strong association with the risk of developing neonatal sepsis. Encouraging maternal antenatal care utilization would help identify the risk factors during prenatal and postnatal care and appropriate interventions implemented to reduce the likelihood of the neonate developing sepsis.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To present a concept analysis of clinical deterioration and introduce an operational definition. Background: Hospitalised patients who endure cardiopulmonary arrest and unplanned intensive care unit admissions often exhibit physiological signs preceding these events. Clinical deterioration not promptly recognised can result in increased patient morbidity and mortality. A barrier to recognising and responding to clinical deterioration stems from practice variations among healthcare clinicians. Design: Concept analysis. Methods: Eight-step method of concept analysis proposed by Walker and Avant. Results: Defining attributes include dynamic state, decompensation and objective and subjective determination. Antecedents identified include clinical state, susceptibility, pathogenesis and adverse event. Increased mortality, resuscitation, implementation of higher level of care and prolonged hospital admission were the consequences identified. Defining attributes, antecedents and consequences identified led to an operational definition of clinical deterioration as a dynamic state experienced by a patient compromising hemodynamic stability, marked by physiological decompensation accompanied by subjective or objective findings. Conclusions: Clinical deterioration is a key contributor to inpatient mortality, and its recognition is often underpinned by contextual factors and practice variances. Variation in the uniformity of the concept of clinical deterioration causes a gap in knowledge and necessitated clarification of this phenomenon for nursing research and practice. Relevance to clinical practice: Identifying and intervening on clinical deterioration plays a vital role in the inpatient setting demonstrated by the dynamic nature of a patients’ condition during hospitalisation. It is anticipated that this concept analysis on clinical deterioration will contribute to further identification of clinically modifiable risk factors and accompanying interventions to prevent clinical deterioration in the inpatient setting.

AB  - In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) under statin treatment, the influence of on-treatment level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on cardiovascular (CV) events is controversial. Statin-treated patients were selected from the Taiwanese Secondary Prevention for patients with AtheRosCLErotic disease (T-SPARCLE) Registry, a multicenter, observational study of adult patients with ASCVD in Taiwan. Low HDL-C was defined as < 40 mg/dL for men and < 50 mg/dL for women. The primary outcome was a composite CV events including CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. A total of 3731 patients (mean age 65.6 years, 75.6% men) were included. Patients with on-treatment low HDL-C (44%, mean HDL-C 34.9 ± 6.8 mg/dL) were younger and with more diabetes and higher body weight. The mean follow-up time was 2.7 years. We used restricted cubic spline curves to examine the potential non-linear association between HDL-C and adverse outcomes. Decreased HDL-C levels were associated with a significantly increased risk of CV events in women (< 49 mg/dL in women) but not in men (< 42 mg/dL in men). However, the protective effect of elevated HDL-C levels was more prominent in men than in women. In ASCVD patients with statin therapy, low on-treatment HDL-C was common in Taiwan and associated with an increased risk of CV events in women. Higher HDL-C levels provided more protective effect in men than in women.

AB  - Combined traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS) remains a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have demonstrated promise in small animal models of neurologic injury. To investigate the effects of exosome treatment in a clinically realistic large animal model, Yorkshire swine underwent TBI and HS. Animals were maintained in shock for 2 h before resuscitation with normal saline (NS). Animals were then resuscitated either with NS (3 × volume of shed blood) or with the same volume of NS with delayed exosome administration (1 × 1013 particles/4 mL) (<i>n</i> = 5/cohort). Exosomes were administered 9 h post-injury, and on post-injury days (PID) 1, 5, 9, and 13. Neurologic severity scores (NSS) were assessed for 30 days, and neurocognitive functions were objectively measured. Exosome-treated animals had significantly lower NSS (<i>p</i> < 0.05) during the first five days of recovery. Exosome-treated animals also had a significantly shorter time to complete neurologic recovery (NSS = 0) compared with animals given NS alone (days to recovery: NS = 16.8 ± 10.6; NS + exosomes = 5.6 ± 2.8; <i>p</i> = 0.03). Animals treated with exosomes initiated neurocognitive testing earlier (days to initiation: NS = 9.6 ± 0.5 vs. NS + exosomes = 4.2 ± 0.8; p = 0.008); however, no difference was seen in time to mastery of tasks. In conclusion, treatment with exosomes attenuates the severity of neurologic injury and allows for faster neurologic recovery in a clinically realistic large animal model of TBI and HS.

AB  - Background: Management of Non-Compressible Torso Hemorrhage (NCTH) consists primarily of aortic occlusion which has significant adverse outcomes, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, in prolonged field care paradigms. One promising avenue for treatment is through use of RevMedx XSTAT 30™ (an FDA approved sponge-based dressing utilized for extremity wounds). We hypothesized that XSTAT 30™ would effectively mitigate NCTH during a prolonged pre-hospital period with correctable metabolic and physiologic derangements. Methods and findings: Twenty-four male swine (53±2 kg) were anesthetized, underwent line placement, and splenectomy. Animals then underwent laparoscopic transection of 70% of the left lobe of the liver with hemorrhage for a period of 10 min. They were randomized into three groups: No intevention (CON), XSTAT 30™-Free Pellets (FP), and XSTAT 30™-Bagged Pellets (BP). Animals were observed for a pre-hospital period of 180 min. At 180 min, animals underwent damage control surgery (DCS), balanced blood product resuscitation and removal of pellets followed by an ICU period of 5 hours. Postoperative fluoroscopy was performed to identify remaining pellets or bags. Baseline physiologic and injury characteristics were similar. Survival rates were significantly higher in FP and BP (p<0.01) vs CON. DCS was significantly longer in FP in comparison to BP (p = 0.001). Two animals in the FP group had pellets discovered on fluoroscopy following DCS. There was no significant difference in blood product or pressor requirements between groups. End-ICU lactates trended to baseline in both FP and BP groups. Conclusions: While these results are promising, further study will be required to better understand the role for XSTAT in the management of NCTH.

AB  - Prospectively evaluated seriously ill patients' characteristics, perceptions, and preferences associated with discussing CPR with their physicians. 1,288 patients hospitalized with a life-threatening illness in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments completed baseline surveys of characteristics, health status, desires for participation in medical decision making, and CPR preferences. 30% of patients communicated their CPR preference to their physician during a 2 mo period following hospital admission. Patients whose preference was to forgo CPR and whose preference had changed from desiring to forgoing CPR were more likely to communicate their preference than patients who continued to prefer CPR. 50% of patients who maintained a preference to forgo CPR communicated this over a 2-mo period. Having an advance directive and remaining in the hospital at 2-mo follow-up were independently associated with communication, but patients' preference for participation in decision-making, health status, and prognostic estimate were not. Communication about CPR preferences occurred infrequently after hospital admission for a serious illness, even among patients wishing to forgo CPR, and was not associated with declining quality of life.

AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients require immediate interventions by bystanders and emergency medical services (EMS). However, in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), bystanders witnessing a cardiac arrest rarely perform chest compressions and contact EMS. This paper attempts to draw lessons from a case of a patient with a cardiac arrest who could have survived with immediate interventions. A 40 year old man collapsed following electrocution at a construction site. His colleagues immediately transferred him to hospital via taxi, without performing chest compressions. At the hospital he showed ventricular fibrillation; resuscitation attempts failed and he died. Ventricular fibrillation due to electrocution is a benign type of cardiac arrest. The chance of survival increases with immediate chest compressions and prompt defibrillation. We discuss the reasons why the bystanders did not perform resuscitation or contact EMS and identify approaches for the improvement of pre-hospital care in LMICs.

AB  - Background: The Indian railway system is the fourth largest in the world and causes about 15 deaths every day, due to intentional or unintentional reasons. This study presents a 5-year retrospective analysis of patients injured due to train-associated events, managed at a level-1 trauma center in India. Materials and methods: Hospital-based trauma registry data of train-associated injuries presenting between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Data from 726 patients were analyzed for demographics, injury events, injury regions, their management and outcomes. ISS and NISS were used to quantify the injury severity. Results: Mean age was 33 years, with male-to-female ratio 86 to 14%. The majority of patients (62%) were between 20-40 years. The median ISS was 9 (IQR 4-16), median hospital stays 11 days (IQR6-23), with in-hospital mortality of 17.4%. Presence of head injury; ISS[9 and CPR in ED were independent risk factors of mortality. Trespassers on the rail track had significantly more severe injuries compared to passengers (Median ISS 13 vs. 9, p = 0.012; Median NISS 22 vs.17, p = 0.015); however, mortality and hospital length of stay were not significantly different. Location of injury event (on platform or tracks) showed no difference between the severity of injuries, mortality and hospital length of stay. Conclusions: Current study reports comprehensive injury patterns and outcomes of train-associated injuries from a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). Apart from the mortality, there is a high incidence of permanent disabilities from extremity amputations. No significant difference was noted in the severity and outcomes among patients injured on or off train platforms, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety measures including enforcement and promoting safe behavior not only on locations like train tracks but equally at platforms.

AB  - Introduction: Because of population ageing and sociocultural changes related to death, increasing the numbers of patients are dying in hospitals. Objectives: To analyze patient characteristics and end-of-life care in the final week of life in patients dying in an acute-care hospital. Material and methods: all patients older than 18 years old who died in the hospital over a 1-year period were analyzed. Patients dying in intensive care and emergency units were excluded. The following variables were evaluated: demographic data, main illness, cause of admission, comorbidity, terminal illness, medication, delay in beginning palliative sedation, use of devices, adverse events, and "do not attempt resuscitation orders". Results: A total of 401 patients (mean age: 78 ± 11 years) with numerous comorbidities were evaluated. Of these, 348 patients (87%) were considered to be terminal. The reason for admission was related to the main disease in 207 patients (52%). Terminal sedation was applied in 311 patients (78%), and informed consent from the relatives was documented in 294 patients (73%). Intervention by on-call physician was required to control symptom aggravation in 214 patients (55%). Active medication was maintained in addition to sedation in 145 patients (36%). Complementary examinations were performed in 109 patients (40%), but did not modify prognosis. Conclusions: Reasonable therapeutics objectives relating to the patient's situation and guidelines to improve quality of life at the end of life should be established.

AB  - Aim: To assess the incidence of perinatal asphyxia, its risk factors and outcome at a single tertiary referral center in Cameroon. Methods: This was a hospital-based prospective case-control study on term neonates delivered at tertiary referral center over three months. Cases were defined as neonates with an Apgar score less than 7 at the 5th minute. Controls were neonates with an Apgar score greater than or equal to 7 at the 5th minute, matched to cases for gestational age and sex. Maternal socio-demographic, antenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal variables including delivery outcome, Sarnat's score, time of death if it occurred, and duration of admission were noted. Risk factors for perinatal asphyxia were determined. Results: Of 740 live births during the study period, 72 (9.7%) neonates had perinatal asphyxia and most of the asphyxiated neonates were males (sex ratio 1.4), 86.1% weighed between 2500-3999g, and 42 (58.3%) mothers were in the age group between 18-29 years. Following multivariate analysis, risk factors for birth asphyxia included: were single mothers [(AOR=3.9993;95% CI: 1.1176-14.3110) p=0.0331], mothers who had urinary tract infection in pregnancy [(AOR=15.6325;95% CI: 2.3083-105.8688) p=0.0048], prolonged rupture of membranes [(AOR=6.2537;95% CI: 1.1744-33.3013) p=0.0317], prolonged labor [(AOR=3.6521;95% CI: 1.0940-12.1918) p=0.0352] and mothers who delivered by emergency caesarian section [(OR=8.0169;95% CI: 2.3669-27.1537), p=0.0008]. Among the asphyxiated neonates, 15 died with a case fatality of 20.8%. Fourteen (93.3%) of those who died had severe asphyxia. Eighty-eight percent of asphyxiated neonates developed hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, of which, 54.7% were Sarnat's stage I, 15.6% stage II and 29.7% stage III. Conclusion: The incidence and case fatality of perinatal asphyxia are high. Early diagnosis, prompt management of pathological disorders during pregnancy and labor, and neonatal resuscitation could largely prevent perinatal asphyxia.

AB  - Aim: Although researchers in several countries have investigated patients’ points of view regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there has been no research investigating this issue in Greece. The present study aimed at identifying the attitude of older Greek patients regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: One basic questionnaire consisting of 34 questions was used in order to identify patients’ opinions regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation in five different hospitals from June to November 2011. Results: In total, 300 questionnaires were collected. Although patients’ knowledge regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation was poor, most of them would like to be resuscitated in case they suffered an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Also, they believe that they should have the right to accept or refuse treatment. However, the legal and sociocultural norms in Greece do not support patients’ choice for the decision to refuse resuscitation. The influence of several factors, such as their general health status or the underlying pathology, could lead patients to give a “do not attempt resuscitation” order. Conclusions: The attitudes of older Greek patients regarding resuscitation are not different from others’, whereas the legal and sociocultural norms in Greece do not support patient choice in end-of-life decisions, namely the decision to refuse resuscitation. We advocate the introduction of advanced directives, as well as the establishment and implementation of specific legislation regarding the ethics of resuscitation in Greece.

AB  - In 2010, prompted by compelling evidence that demonstrated better patient outcomes in hospitals with higher percentages of nurses with a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), the Institute of Medicine recommended that 80 percent of the nurse workforce be qualified at that level or higher by 2020. Using data from the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines-Resuscitation registry (for 2013-18), RN4CAST-US hospital nurse surveys (2015-16), and the American Hospital Association (2015), we found that each 10-percentage-point increase in the hospital share of nurses with a BSN was associated with 24 percent greater odds of surviving to discharge with good cerebral performance among patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest. Lower patient-to-nurse ratios on general medical and surgical units were also associated with significantly greater odds of surviving with good cerebral performance. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports policies to increase access to baccalaureate-level education and improve hospital nurse staffing.

AB  - Context: Clinical trials are a common therapeutic option for patients with advanced incurable cancer. Objectives: To examine the associations between trial participation and end-of-life (EOL) outcomes, including aggressive care and quality of life (QOL). Methods: Coping with Cancer, a multicenter prospective cohort study of patients with metastatic cancer, progressed after at least first-line chemotherapy. Baseline chart review documented clinical trial participation. Baseline interviews assessed psychosocial characteristics and EOL preferences. Caregiver interview and chart review assessed medical care and QOL near death. The primary outcome was aggressive EOL care (ventilation, resuscitation, or intensive care unit admission in last week of life). Propensity score weighting balanced patient characteristics that differed by trial participation, including care preferences and EOL discussion. Propensity score–weighted regression models estimated the effect of trial participation on outcomes. Results: Of 352 patients followed to death, 37 were enrolled in a clinical trial at baseline. In propensity score–weighted analyses, trial participation was significantly associated with aggressive EOL care (21.6% vs. 12.0%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–4.15), late hospice enrollment (51.4% vs. 42.2%, AOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.10–3.50), hospital death (48.6% vs. 25.7%, AOR 2.74, 95% CI 1.37–5.47), intensive care unit death (16.2% vs. 6.3%, AOR 3.53, 95% CI 1.29–9.65), and inferior QOL near death (least squares mean 5.93 vs. 7.69, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Controlling for EOL care, trial enrollment was no longer associated with QOL near death (<i>P</i> = 0.342). Conclusion: Clinical trial participation is associated with aggressive EOL care. Aggressive EOL care appears to explain the association between trial participation and QOL near death. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) is prone to photoinhibition under intense sunlight. Excessive light can be dissipated by the xanthophyll cycle, where violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) plays a critical role in protecting the photosynthesis apparatus from the damage of excessive light. We isolated ∼2.0 kb of ginger VDE (GVDE) gene promoter, which contained the circadian box, I-box, G-box and GT-1 motif. Histochemical staining of Arabidopsis indicated the GVDE promoter was active in almost all organs, especially green tissues. β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity driven by GVDE promoter was repressed rather than activated by high light. GUS activity was altered by hormones, growth regulators and abiotic stresses, which increased with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and decreased with abscisic acid, salicylic acid, zeatin, salt (sodium chloride) and polyethylene glycol. Interestingly, GUS activities with gibberellin or indole-3-acetic acid increased in the short-term (24 h) and decreased in the long-term (48 and 72 h). Analysis of 5′ flank deletion found two crucial functional regions residing in -679 to -833 and -63 to -210. Northern blotting analysis found transcription to be regulated by the endogenous circadian clock. Finally, we found a region necessary for regulating the circadian rhythm and another for the basic promoter activity.

AB  - Context: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating and incurable neuro-oncologic disease, and issues related to the end of life are almost invariably a matter of ‘‘when,’’ not a matter of ‘‘if.’’ Optimizing symptom management and quality of life in later stages of disease is of the utmost priority. Objectives: To examine the frequency of and factors associated with late acute hospital admission before death in patients with GBM. Methods: Case-control study comparing patients with GBM admitted to the hospital within one month of death to those without late hospital admission. Results: Of 385 GBM patients followed to death at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 164 (42.6%) were admitted within a month of death, most frequently (140, or 85%) to manage neurologic decline. Of these, 56 (34%) had intensive care unit care during this admission and 22 (13%), 18 (11%), and 2 (1%) received mechanical ventilation, enteral feeding tubes, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, respectively. In multivariable analysis, in-hospital chaplaincy consultation, and participation in a therapeutic clinical trial, both at any time in the GBM disease course, were significantly associated with late hospital admission. Conclusions: Late hospitalization is frequent in GBM and often involves intensive care unit care in the management of clinical events that are part of the GBM dying process. Patients with a tendency to use religious support and those enrolled in clinical trials may be at greater risk for late hospitalization. Dedicated prospective study is needed to determine predictors of late hospitalization and to examine the impact of late acute medical care on quality of life in GBM.

AB  - Background: Risk stratification of the early repolarization pattern (ERP) is needed to identify malignant early repolarization. J-point elevation with a horizontal ST segment was recently suggested as a malignant feature of the ERP. In this study, the prevalence of the ERP with a horizontal ST segment was examined among survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) without structural heart disease to evaluate the value of ST-segment morphology in risk stratification of the ERP. Methods: We reviewed the data of 83 survivors of SCA who were admitted from August 2005 to August 2010. Among them, 25 subjects without structural heart disease were included. The control group comprised 60 healthy subjects who visited our health promotion center; all control subjects were matched for age, sex, and underlying disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension). Early repolarization was defined as an elevation of the J point of at least 0.1 mV above the baseline in at least two continuous inferior or lateral leads that manifested as QRS slurring or notching. An ST-segment pattern of <0.1 mV within 100 ms after the J point was defined as a horizontal ST segment. Results: The SCA group included 17 men (64%) with a mean age of 49.7 ± 14.5 years. The corrected QTc was not significantly different between the SCA and control groups (432.7 ± 37.96 vs. 420.4 ± 26.3, respectively; p = 0.089). The prevalence of ERP was not statistically different between the SCA and control groups (5/25, 20% vs. 4/60, 6.7%, respectively; p = 0.116). The prevalence of early repolarization with a horizontal ST segment was more frequent in the SCA than in the control group (20% vs. 3.3%, respectively; p = 0.021). Four SCA subjects (16%) and one control subject (1.7%) had a J-point elevation of >2 mm (p = 0.025). Four SCA subjects (16%) and one (1.7%) control subject had an ERP in the inferior lead (p = 0.025). Conclusion: The prevalence of ERP with a horizontal ST segment was higher in patients with aborted SCA than in matched controls. This result suggests that ST morphology has value in the recognition of malignant early repolarization.

AB  - Background: Vasopressin is an efficient remedy for septic shock patients as its great capacity in promoting hemodynamic stabilization. The aim of current systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the clinical efficiency of vasopressin or its analogs with sole catecholamines on patients with septic shock.; Methods: A systematic search of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed online databases was performed up to 30 Oct 2019 to identify randomized controlled trials comparing use of vasopressin or its analogs (e.g., terlipressin, selepressin) with administration of catecholamines alone.; Results: We included 23 RCTs with 4,225 patients in the current study. Compared with solely use of catecholamines, administration of vasopressin or its analogs was not associated with reduced 28-day or 30-day mortality among patients with septic shock [RR=0.94 (95% CI, 0.87-1.01), P=0.08, I2 = 0%]. The result of primary endpoint remained unchanged after conducting sensitivity analysis. Despite a significantly higher risk of digital ischemia in patients receiving vasopressin or its analogs [RR=2.65 (95% CI, 1.26-5.56), P < 0.01, I2 = 48%], there was no statistical significance in the pooled estimate for other secondary outcomes, including total adverse events, arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiac arrest, acute mesenteric ischemia, ICU/hospital length of stay, and mechanical ventilation (MV) duration.; Conclusions: The administration of vasopressin or its analogs was not associated with reduced 28-day or 30-day mortality among patients with septic shock, while an increased incidence of digital ischemia should be noted in patients receiving agonists for vasopressin receptors.

AB  - Aim: This paper reports a literature review to examine the effectiveness of inducing hypothermia to decrease neurological deficit after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Background: After cardiac arrest, severe neurological impairment is a major problem. Outcome after anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest varies from normal function to brain death. However, a large proportion of these patients are left with severe disability and completely dependent on others for basic needs. Since the 1950s, several studies have shown how hypothermia can be neuroprotective. Recently, these studies have been taken to human trials in populations experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the Ovid and MDConsult databases for the years 1966-2004 and the keywords included hypothermia, therapeutic hypothermia, and cardiac arrest. Only English language papers were retrieved. Six human trials were found. Results: All six studies showed improved neurological outcomes and four of these showed a decrease in mortality. Minimal complications exist from inducing mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest, and include decreased heart rate, increased systemic vascular resistance, transient electrolyte abnormalities (increased serum potassium and glucose), possible increase in pneumonia or other infectious processes, possible rebound hyperthermia, possible hypotension, and possible arrhythmias. Conclusions: Based on the review of these studies and the recommendations from the Advanced Life Support Task Force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, advanced practice nurses should promote this practice, but look for further research on specific treatment recommendations.

AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest survivors may experience hypoxic brain injury that results in cognitive impairments which frequently remain unrecognised. This may lead to limitations in daily activities and participation in society, a decreased quality of life for the patient, and a high strain for the caregiver. Publications about interventions directed at improving quality of life after survival of a cardiac arrest are scarce. Therefore, evidence about effective rehabilitation programmes for cardiac arrest survivors is urgently needed. This paper presents the design of the ALASCA (Activity and Life After Survival of a Cardiac Arrest) trial, a randomised, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of a new early intervention service for survivors of a cardiac arrest and their caregivers. Methods/design: The study population comprises all people who survive two weeks after a cardiac arrest and are admitted to one of the participating hospitals in the Southern part of the Netherlands. In a two-group randomised, controlled clinical trial, half of the participants will receive an early intervention service. The early intervention service consists of several consultations with a specialised nurse for the patient and their caregiver during the first three months after the cardiac arrest. The intervention is directed at screening for cognitive problems, provision of informational, emotional and practical support, and stimulating self-management. If necessary, referral to specialised care can take place. Persons in the control group will receive the care as usual. The primary outcome measures are the extent of participation in society and quality of life of the patient one year after a cardiac arrest. Secondary outcome measures are the level of cognitive, emotional and cardiovascular impairment and daily functioning of the patient, as well as the strain for and quality of life of the caregiver. Participants and their caregivers will be followed for twelve months after the cardiac arrest. A process evaluation will be performed to gain insight into factors that might have contributed to the effectiveness of the intervention and to gather information about the feasibility of the programme. Furthermore, an economic evaluation will be carried out to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the intervention. Discussion: The results of this study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of this early intervention service, as well as the cost-effectiveness and its feasibility.

AB  - As one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability, stroke brings detrimental burden to its patients and the society. The most common subtype of stroke is ischemic stroke. Current treatment for ischemic stroke is limited. The only FDA approved drug is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The application of tPA is restricted within 4.5 hours of stroke onset, due to its severe side effects and broad contraindications. The lethal side effect of tPA is hemorrhage. The usage of tPA and its therapeutic effect has to be compromised to avoid hemorrhage. Studies have been proposing that Zn 2+ accumulation has deleterious effect in ischemic neuronal damage, and reducing intracellular Zn2+ overload by Zn2+ chelation improve neuronal survival from cerebral ischemia. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Zn2+ chelation is investigated not only in mice, but also in a newly developed zebrafish model. Severe hypoxia was performed to induce a hypoxic-ischemic brain injury on zebrafish, to mimic the global cerebral stroke in a cardiac arrest. A self-designed chamber was used to perform stable and effective hypoxia. The brain injury was quantified by histological staining of the brain, and the overall survival and behavioral changes of zebrafish after hypoxia. Photothrombotic method was adopted and modified to develop adult zebrafish as a model for focal thrombotic stroke. Rose Bengal was intraperitoneally injected to the zebrafish and a light probe was placed on the optic tectum of the brain. Brain damage was quantified by 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and overall recovery. Treatment of tPA was used to confirm thrombosis-induced brain injuries and the feasibility of using zebrafish model to screen thrombolytic candidates. In vitro experiment, spectrophotometry was used to quantify blood clot-lysis (thrombolysis). Thrombosis model in vivo was achieved by photothrombotic method on the mouse femoral artery. The artery reperfusion induced by tPA was monitored under microscope and quantified by ImagePro. Results of this study show that adult zebrafish are sensitive to hypoxia. Detectable brain injury can be achieved by 8 minutes of severe hypoxia. Longer time of hypoxic treatment leads to moving disability and mortality of zebrafish. Zn2+ chelation improves neuronal viability under oxygen deprivation, and therefore increases the behavioral recovery and overall survival rate. During thrombolysis, the blood clot releases high concentration of Zn 2+. Data suggest that increase of Zn2+ around the thrombosis reduces tPA-induced thrombolysis. Zn2+ chelation, when combined with tPA, increase the overall thrombolysis in vitro and the rate of successful reperfusion in vivo. Moreover, the application of Zn 2+ chelation improves efficacy and potency of tPA-induced thrombolysis. In conclusion, Zn2+ chelation has shown promoting effect in neuronal rescue, and also in assisting thrombolysis during thrombotic stroke. It can be a treatment combining with tPA to improve successful reperfusion and reduces tPA-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, Zn2+ chelation is promising to be used to improve outcomes of stroke and cardiovascular occlusion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Simple cryopreservation of anaerobic ammonium-oxidation (anammox) consortia has become a promising preservation technology for the fast start-up of the anammox process. Here, we use genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to understand of the microbial interaction in a simple and effective resuscitation process for long-term cryopreserved anammox consortia by sequential addition of anammox SBR supernatant. Performance results showed that sequential addition of anammox supernatant significantly reduced the resuscitation time of the granule-based anammox process from 40 to 20 days. Genome-centric metagenomics were used to recover 19 high-quality draft genomes of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria. Comparative metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression of Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, the dominant anammox bacterium, and heterotrophic bacteria to better understand their potential interactions. Proteobacteria-affiliated bacteria found in the supernatant were highly active in producing the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate which are needed for growth of the auxotrophic anammox bacteria. In addition, the significantly higher expression levels of hzsA and CO2-fixtion genes in the Candidatus Kuenenia genome indicated the anammox bacteria were likely more active and growing faster after sequential anammox supernatant addition during the resuscitation process. The resuscitation treatment pulse assays confirmed that sequential addition of supernatant was an effective way for the rapid resuscitation of anammox consortia. Our findings offer the first evidence of cross-feeding during the rapid resuscitation of cryopreserved anammox consortia.

AB  - Family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) involves offering family members the option to remain with their loved one who is undergoing life-saving measures. FPDR has been shown to enhance comfort and facilitate grieving, and 90% to 100% of patients and family members support it as an option. However, critical care nurses are not fully supportive of FPDR and approximately only one-third implement it in their care of patients. The perceived risks of FPDR are cited as a primary reason for lack of support and implementation. Yet, the perceived risks have not been proven, while the benefits have been established in research. This demonstrates the importance of education to improve critical care nurses' perception of FPDR. Few studies have investigated FPDR education with nurses. The few that exist have shown promise in improving perception, and also self-confidence which has been shown to influences nurses' FPDR implementation. Several gaps in the FPDR educational research have been identified; including use of measurement scales without established validity or reliability, restricted sample recruitment focused primarily on emergency department nurses despite the fact 45% of in-hospital resuscitation events occur in critical care settings, and methodological limitations such as the absence of a control group. Additionally, no research has yet evaluated the potential impact of online learning despite its capability of reaching larger numbers of nurses. Therefore, the purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to evaluate the impact of an online learning module on critical care nurses' perception and self-confidence for FPDR of adult patients. The frameworks utilized were Change Theory and Social Cognitive Theory to explain the choice of dependent variables and aid in the design of the FPDR online learning module as the independent variable. A two-group, quasi-experimental, pre- and post-test design was used. The sample consisted of critical care nurses (N = 74) recruited through online study advertisements facilitated by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN). Subjects were randomly assigned to either the intervention group who received the FPDR online learning module or to the control group who received online learning about recent changes in resuscitative care. Established measurement scales were used to evaluate perception and self-confidence in this repeated-measures study. Data was collected online for four weeks and the two-factor, mixed-model factorial ANOVA was used for data analysis. Major findings demonstrated the FPDR online learning module was effective at improving critical care nurses' perception and self-confidence for FPDR. Mean scores in the intervention group increased significantly for both perception and self-confidence (p < .0005), while scores did not change significantly for the control group. Study results indicate online learning can improve critical care nurses' perception and self-confidence for FPDR and further strengthen the body of scientific evidence on FPDR education.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of interventional mode of intervention in emergency intensive care unit(EICU)and prevention of infection in patients with large area myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. METHODS: The clinical data of 112 patients with large area myocardial infarction complicated with cardiac arrest treated in hospital from Feb.2016 to May 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, and were divided into study group and control group according to different nursing methods, with 56 cases in each group. Patients in control group were given routine nursing intervention, and in study group were given targeted nursing intervention. The resuscitation success rate, infection rate, respiration and heartbeat recovery time, quality of life and complications between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The resuscitation success rate in study group was 92.86%, which was higher than 76.79% in control group, and there were no infected patients in study group, and 6 cases of infected patients in control group (P<0.05). The recovery time of respiration and heartbeat in study group were (4.52±0.83) min and (15.62±2.28) min, which were shorter than (7.63±1.24) min and (22.18±3.80) min in control group (P<0.001). After intervention, scores of SF-36 in both groups were increased, and the scores of study group were better than those of control group (P<0.05). There were 3 cases of complications in study group, which were less than 10 cases in control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The implementation of EICU targeted intervention in patients with large area myocardial infarction complicated with cardiac arrest can effectively improve the success rate of rescue, reduce the infection rate, promote respiration and heartbeat recovery, reduce the incidence of complications and improve the quality of life.

AB  - In this study we tested the hypothesis that long-term neuropathological outcome is worsened by hyperoxic compared to normoxic reperfusion in a rat global cerebral ischemia model. Adult male rats were anesthetized and subjected to bilateral carotid arterial occlusion plus bleeding hypotension for 10 min. The rats were randomized to one of four protocols: ischemia/normoxia (21% oxygen for 1 h), ischemia/hyperoxia (100% oxygen for 1 h), sham/normoxia, and sham/hyperoxia. Hippocampal CA1 neuronal survival and activation of microglia and astrocytes were measured in the hippocampi of the animals at 7 and 30 days post-ischemia. Morris water maze testing of memory was performed on days 23–30. Compared to normoxic reperfusion, hyperoxic ventilation resulted in a significant decrease in normal-appearing neurons at 7 and 30 days, and increased activation of microglia and astrocytes at 7, but not at 30, days of reperfusion. Behavioral deficits were also observed following hyperoxic, but not normoxic, reperfusion. We conclude that early post-ischemic hyperoxic reperfusion is followed by greater hippocampal neuronal death and cellular inflammatory reactions compared to normoxic reperfusion. The results of these long-term outcome studies, taken together with previously published results from short-term experiments performed with large animals, support the hypothesis that neurological outcome can be improved by avoiding hyperoxic resuscitation after global cerebral ischemia such as that which accompanies cardiac arrest.

AB  - Objective - To determine the association among signalment, health status, other clinical variables, and treatments and events during cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) with the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for animals with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) in a veterinary teaching hospital. Design - Cross-sectional study. Animals - 161 dogs and 43 cats with CPA. Procedures - Data were gathered during a 60-month period on animals that had CPA and underwent CPCR. Logistic regression was used to evaluate effects of multiple predictors for ROSC. Results - 56 (35%) dogs and 19 (44%) cats had successful CPCR. Twelve (6%) animals (9 dogs and 3 cats) were discharged from the hospital. Successfully resuscitated dogs were significantly more likely to have been treated with mannitol, lidocaine, fluids, dopamine, corticosteroids, or vasopressin; had CPA while anesthetized; received chest compressions while positioned in lateral recumbency; and had a suspected cause of CPA other than hemorrhage or anemia, shock, hypoxemia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cerebral trauma, malignant arrhythmia, or an anaphylactoid reaction and were less likely to have been treated with multiple doses of epinephrine, had a longer duration of CPA, or had multiple disease conditions, compared with findings in dogs that were not successfully resuscitated. Successfully resuscitated cats were significantly more likely to have had more people participate in CPCR and less likely to have had shock as the suspected cause of CPA, compared with findings in cats that were not successfully resuscitated. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - The prognosis was grave for animals with CPA, except for those that had CPA while anesthetized.

AB  - Purpose: This study explores the experiences and needs of bereaved family and friends following an epilepsy-related death in Australia. Method: An online survey was used to collect demographic details of the person with epilepsy, epilepsy status, time since the death, satisfaction with service providers at the time of death, follow-up support, perceptions on how well the death was explained, and gaps in support or services. Results: The survey was completed by 101 respondents describing 90 deceased individuals. Mean age at death was 32.1 years, with causes of death including SUDEP, epilepsy, drowning, cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, and motor vehicle accidents. Over half of the respondents indicated that they did not know, prior to the death, people could die of epilepsy. In addition, 38% indicated the death had not been adequately explained to them. Comments revealed services and supports which should be available following a death, and recommendations for existing epilepsy support services which might help to prevent future deaths. Conclusion: Findings highlight the need to improve community understanding and support for those affected by epilepsy and to promote informed risk assessment and communication amongst patients, families and health professionals. People bereaved by epilepsy require both immediate and long-term epilepsy-specific information and support from professionals, informal communities and peer supporters.

AB  - Objective: To document the clinical practice of cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) among academic veterinarians. Design: Survey. Setting: Eight colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States. Subjects: Two hundred and one academic veterinarians. Interventions: The survey was distributed by hand by the authors into the mailboxes of small animal faculty, residents, and interns. Demographic variables, questions regarding number of cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) supervised and number successful, do not attempt resuscitation discussions, and Likert-style questions about client presence during CPCR, appropriateness of CPCR, and CPCR decision-making were included. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to determine the effect of multiple questions on different target variables of interest. Measurements and main results: Numerous differences were noted based on institution, gender, specialty, and position. Most institutions did not have a standard resuscitation consent form. Most respondents believed the client, house officer, and senior clinician should determine whether to perform resuscitation or not. Quality of life was the most significant determinant of whether to resuscitate or not, followed by long-term prognosis, then short-term prognosis. Conclusions: Veterinarians differ in many aspects of their approach to CPA and resuscitation. Creating consensus within the veterinary profession would benefit client service and patient care.

AB  - The contracting, prompting and reinforcing (CPR) aftercare intervention has improved treatment adherence and outcomes in a number of clinical trials. In multisite randomized clinical trial 92 graduates of two intensive substance use disorder programs who received CPR were compared to 91 who received standard treatment (STX). The CPR group evidenced increased frequency of aftercare group therapy attendance and near significant findings suggested that more CPR than STX participants completed 3months (76 vs. 64%), 6months (48 vs. 35%), and 9months (35 vs. 22%) of aftercare. However, the groups did not differ on the majority of attendance measures and had similar abstinence rates at the 3-month (67% CPR vs. 71% STX), 6-month (52% CPR vs. 51% STX), and 12-month (the primary outcome measure; 48% CPR vs. 49% STX) follow-up points. Exploratory analyses suggest that CPR might be more effective among participants not required to attend aftercare. The incremental capital and labor cost of CPR compared to STX was $98.25 per participant. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To study the intervention effect of nutritional intervention under multi-disciplinary team(MDT) mode on elderly patients with fracture in perioperative period. Methods: A total of 85 perioperative patients who underwent orthopedic surgery in the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from September 2018 to September 2019 were enrolled. MDT group(43 cases) were given nutritional intervention under MDT, while non-MDT group(42 cases) were given the conventional intervention. The basic condition, postoperative complications and recovery of patients were compared between groups. Results: The total levels of protein and albumin in the MDT group were higher than those in the non-MDT group, while the NRS2002 score, CPR and IL-6 were lower than those in the non-MDT group; the differences were statistically significant(t=-3.679 6,-4.138 8, 9.073 3,-6.669 5,-4.500 2; P=0.000 4, 0.000 1, < 0.000 1, < 0.000 1, < 0.000 1). The length of hospital stay in the MDT group was shorter than that in the non-MDT group, with statistically significant difference(hip replacement: t=2.154 8, P=0.034 1; knee arthroplasty: t=2.491 9, P=0.018 9). The recovery of intestinal function in the MDT group was significantly better than that in the non-MDT group(χ2=10.512 1, P=0.001 2). Conclusion: Nutritional intervention under MDT mode can effectively promote postoperative rehabilitation of elderly patients with fracture, reduce the incidence of infection and length of hospital stay, and prevent the occurrence of complications.

AB  - Background/objective: Almost two-thirds of the coronary death rate decrease in the northern Italian Brianza MONICA male population, between 1993-4 and 1997-8, are attributable to a reduction in 28-day myocardial infarction (Ml) case-fatality. The present paper investigates the factors associated with Ml case-fatality decrease and in particular the role of socio-occupational classes (SOCs). Methods: Standardised information on acute coronary care and intervention before and during the hospitalisation was collected for all coronary events (n = 1817) registered in 1993-4 and in 1997-8 among 35-64-yearold male residents in Brianza. Deaths within 28 days after Ml were carefully investigated. Five SOCs were defined adopting the Eril<son-Goldthorpe-Portocarero method. Differences in 28-day Ml case-fatality and in acute phase intervention and treatment over time and among SOCs in each period were assessed. Results: 28-day Ml case-fatality reduction (27.2%) can be mainly attributed to a decreased proportion of Ml events that were fatal before reaching the hospital. In the lower SOCs significant changes in Ml case-fatality were detected between 1993-4 and 1997-8. Differences in acute phase intervention and treatment between the periods were observed. SOC differences both in prevalence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in the prehospital qualified intervention score were detected in the first period only. Conclusions: In the study population Ml case-fatality reduction can be mainly attributed to a more effective and prompt management before hospitalisation and to an improvement in acute treatment during hospitalisation. This enhancement is made available to the whole population overtaking social differences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Veterinary practitioners have obligations to inform owners of the potential risks their animal might encounter during a surgery. A third of veterinarians believe that the majority of their clients are particularly concerned about their animal being anesthetized. The lack of a clear definition of anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity makes it difficult to specify the real anesthetic risk to the animals' owners. The timing a complication occurs, intra-or postoperatively, can also impose uncertainty in defining whether incidents are associated with the anesthetic procedure. Large veterinary multicenter studies defined anesthesia-related death as those occurring within 48 hours (small animals) or 7 days (horses) of termination of the procedure, where anesthesia could not be excluded as being one of the contributory factors. Based on this definition, the authors identified an overall 0.17% anesthetic-related risk of death in dogs, 0.24% in cats, and 1.9% in horses. Such high rates compared with human patients warned clinicians and researchers on the need of improvements. Since then, several efforts have been made to increase the safety of animals undergoing anesthesia. This Research Topic was part of these efforts by creating an opportunity for the contribution of 35 researchers through 12 publications on the subject. They share, among others, the challenges found on the attempts to prevent the occurrence of deaths and complications. They also describe clinical complications and the successful management that was applied. Since 2002, when it was announced that horses have a high mortality rate associated with anesthesia, new equipment was developed to improve safety in this animal species. In 2008, Tafonius, the large animal anesthesia machine, was released with integrated monitoring and ventilator systems. The emerging technology allowed, among other features, to control the fresh gas flow into the breathing system either by a manually-or computer-driven flowmeter. The convenience of having a machine adjusting the flow of different gases to pre-determined concentrations is an attractive feature and its accuracy was, therefore, tested by Raillard et al.. In this original article, the authors describe that the prediction of the isoflurane fraction course in the breathing system was challenging when using the computer-driven flowmeter. This was especially true at low inspired fractions of oxygen. The discrepancies between flows set on the controlled-driven flowmeter and actual lower delivered flows should be taken into consideration. Insufficient concentrations of inhalant anesthetics might lead to serious safety concerns, including both awaking of horses during anesthesia or unwarranted high concentrations of anesthetics that might result in cardiovascular and respiratory complications.An excessive delivery of inhalant anesthetics can significantly decrease systemic vascular resistance and cause relative hypovolemia. This is of particular concern in equine patients since 20-50% of all anesthesia-related deaths in this animal species are associated with cardiovascular complications. The exact mechanisms are explained by Noel-Morgan & Muir who also provide further considerations on the monitoring and treatment of anesthesiaassociated relative hypovolemia. Such perspective is especially important in life-threatening situations, which become evident in three of the clinical cases reported in the present Research Topic. Tong et al. describe the management of recurrent hyperkalemia during general anesthesia in a dog. Marolf et al. describe the development of an advanced atrioventricular block unresponsive to antimuscarinic drugs in an anesthetized foal. Conde-Ruiz & Junot share the case of a horse suffering a cardiac arrest at the arrival of the recovery room. In all three cases, the authors discuss the potential causes, the preventive measures and the successful treatments applied. They demonstrate how the close monitoring proved to be decisive for early recognition and prompt management of the cardiovascular complications, which were crucial for the good outcome.A less closely monitoring may be responsible for the increased risk of anesthetic-related morbidity and mortality associated with the recovery period. In dogs, cats, and rabbits, nearly 50% of the postoperative deaths occurs within 3 hours of the end of anesthesia. In horses, Laurenza et al. found that 92% of complications occurred during recovery. Most of these complications were neuromuscular and respiratory. The pathogenesis of certain conditions is still unclear, which makes it difficult not only to provide adequate care but also to prevent complications in future cases. This was the key point of discussion in the case reported by Mirra et al.. The authors describe an unusual presentation of a potential post-anesthetic neuropathy in the nondependent limb of a horse. In another case report, Dupont et al. discuss the role of hypoxemia as the potential cause of the delayed recovery from anesthesia in a draft horse. In both occasions, despite of the unknown mechanisms for the clinical alterations, the horses were successfully managed. In some situations, it is possible to anticipate the development of potential postoperative complications and apply preventive measures. This was addressed in the case report by Ida et al. who shared the ventilatory support that prevented respiratory complications during recovery from anesthesia of two ponies with tracheal collapse. Preventive measures may play an important role to avoid further complications. The reduction of mortality and morbidity risks has been suggested with the use of safety checklists. The implementation of checklists may have some challenges that are revealed in the original research from Menoud et al.. The authors described numerous methods used to create and implement a safety checklist in a veterinary university teaching hospital. Morbidity and mortality conferences also seem to have an impact on patient care. In the mini review by Pang et al., the authors illustrated the measurable improvements in patient care generated by these conferences, which may also represent a powerful educational tool. Another preventive tool is the ASA PS classification and its ability to identify animals at a greater risk of anesthesia-related death was questioned in the systemic review by Portier & Ida. The authors assessed a total of 258,298 dogs, cats, rabbits, and pigs. The results showed evidences to justify the use of the ASA PS as a prognostic tool to identify the odds of death related to anesthesia in these species. In fact, Laurenza et al. identified that a high ASA PS score represents, among other factors, a major risk for mortality and complications in horses. In this original research article, the authors describe a 1.4% overall mortality associated with anesthesia on horses in a French university teaching hospital. It corresponds to a reduction from the 1.9% anesthesia-related equine deaths announced in 2002. Now, 18 years later, the effects of several efforts to improve case management and decrease the morbidity and mortality seem to have had a positive impact.We believe that this Research Topic adds to the clinical practice of veterinary doctors, contributing to reduce the anesthetic risk and complications in animals. We also expect that this Research Topic motivates readers to share their experience with anesthetic complications and to produce further studies in this field. This, combined with the implementation of expert recommendations, could contribute to the continuing improvement of the quality of anesthesia and, therefore, to decrease the complications and the mortality rate of veterinary patients undergoing anesthesia.KP and KKI co-edited the research topic and wrote this editorial.

AB  - Discusses the difficulties encountered in an attempt to conduct near-death veridicality research in the hospital setting. The design involved structured interviews, multiple-choice questionnaires, and discrete placement of visual stimuli in the hospital rooms in which near-death experiences were most likely to occur. Problems included finding a participating hospital, obtaining sufficient Ss, and producing the materials. The apparent rarity with which in-hospital resuscitations occur portends a protracted study; this may be shortened by conducting the research concurrently at several hospitals, and by better assessing the rooms in which resuscitation for near-death episodes most frequently occur. Also, research stimuli should take some form that does not attract attention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Acute mediastinitis is a serious medical condition with a mortality rate of 30 to 40% or even higher. Early diagnosis with prompt and aggressive treatment is essential to prevent its rapid progression. We evaluated acute mediastinitis cases and analyzed the outcomes. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients diagnosed with acute mediastinitis who were admitted to Mofid Children's Hospital from January 2001 to January 2010. Results: Seventeen patients aged 1 to 10 yrs. (mean =3.8 yrs) were evaluated including 12 (70%) boys and 5 (30%) girls. The most common symptoms were fever, dyspnea, cyanosis, tachycardia and tachypnea. The etiology of mediastinitis was iatrogenic esophageal perforation (EP), and related to manipulation in 13(77%), and leakage of esophageal anastomosis in 4 cases (33%). The underlying diseases were esophageal atresia in 2(12%), corrosive injury of the esophagus in 13(76%), congenital esophageal stenosis in one (6%), and gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis also in one (6%) patient. Patients with clinical symptoms were evaluated by immediate chest radiography, and gastrografin swallow. After early diagnosis, the patients received wide spectrum antibiotics and immediate mediastinal or thoracic drainage, followed by esophagostomy and gastrostomy. Only one case of endoscopic perforation was managed by NG tube. Fifteen patients (88%) survived successfully. We had 2(12%) cases of mortality in our study (one patient after esophageal substitution, mediastinal abscess and septicemia, and the other one developed esophageal perforation 6 months after early management and died of cardiac arrest during endoscopic dilation). Conclusion: Prevention of acute mediastinitis is still a difficult challenge. As the prognosis is not good and patients have high mortality, rapid management is mandatory.

AB  - Cardiac arrest survivors are commonly admitted to an intensive care unit. Neurologic complications of cardiac arrest lead to significant morbidity in survivors. Advances in resuscitative efforts have led to an increase in the number of people who survive cardiac arrest, with a resultant increase in survivors suffering from postanoxic encephalopathy. The focus of resuscitation has shifted to emphasize interventions that restore adequate systemic circulation and those that will ameliorate brain injury after cardiac arrest resuscitation. Recent data about therapeutic hypothermia and other interventions have led to a shift in the role of the neurologist caring for these patients to promote more aggressive management of neurologic complications, including coma, encephalopathy, seizures and myoclonus, elevated intracranial pressure, and metabolic derangements. This chapter will review the neurologic complications of cardiac arrest and focus on the role of the neurologist in the management of such complications.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) is the cessation of spontaneous ventilation and systemic perfusion, which, if not rapidly detected and treated, leads to hypoxia and death. Cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) is a technique employed to reverse CPA. The goal of CPCR is not only to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) but to ensure survival following discharge from hospital with a good quality of life. This article provides a review of how to provide effective advanced life support after basic life support has been initiated, while highlighting the importance of post-resuscitation care in order to optimize the chance of the patient being discharged from hospital. This review of veterinary and human literature aims to suggest some guidelines for nurses to follow.

AB  - Background: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign promotes the use of norepinephrine as the first-line inotropic support for patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock in cases of persistent hypotension, despite adequate fluid resuscitation. However, there is little published evidence on how much noradrenaline is administered to such patients when admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The authors report the clinical management of this group of patients, with a special focus on the total amount and duration of norepinephrine infusion required. Methods: A chart review of the admission records of an ICU in Hong Kong was carried out in 2013. A total of 5000 patients were screened by their diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock (in the admissions book) between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013. A total of 150 of these were identified and 100 included in the study after simultaneous in-depth reviews of their case notes by two of the investigators. The analysis covers those with severe sepsis or septic shock who required ICU admission for further care. Clinical management and outcomes were analysed. Results: 100 patients (median age 61.6; M/F ratio 2:1) met the inclusion criteria. The mean ICU stay was 13.4 days (range = 1−371). 14 patients (14%) died in the ICU, with a 28-day mortality rate of 22%. The mean period of mechanical ventilation was 6.1 days (range = 0−137). 91.5% (<i>n</i> = 43) of patients had been operated on immediately before admission to the ICU, and the majority of these operations had been of the emergency type (97.7%,<i> n</i> = 43). The mean total volumes of crystalloid and colloid administered were 3420 ml and 478 ml, respectively. The mean wean-off period for norepinephrine infusion was 4234 minutes (70.5 hours). All patients were prescribed norepinephrine for persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, and the mean total amount administered was 87,211 mg. Final multiple linear and logistic regression analysis showed different clinical outcomes associated with different covariates, which included: (1) total amount of crystalloid given, positively associated with the total amount and duration of norepinephrine infusion; (2) duration of mechanical ventilation, positively associated with the type of operation the patient had undergone; (3) 28-day mortality rate, positively associated with the INR. Conclusions: What this study adds to knowledge about patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock: (1) the mean duration of norepinephrine infusion for septic shock patients in an ICU is almost three days; (2) the more crystalloid is required to correct hypoperfusion, the higher the dosage and longer the duration of norepinephrine infusion will be necessary; (3) the longer the patient’s INR, the higher the chances of death within 28 days. Since not all patients have their body weight measured on or after admission to the ICU, we suggest further research into indirect estimation of body weight by other means, such as anthropometric measures, to guide the use of drugs and nutritional support in the ICU. In addition, APACHE scores should be included in further studies to compare the severity of the patient’s condition in other research. Furthermore, since this study does not cover university hospital ICUs, we suggest that further research concerning such patients should compare and reflect similarities and differences between public and university hospitals in the territory.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate whether a multifaceted, centrally coordinated quality improvement program in a network of hospitals can increase compliance with the resuscitation bundle and improve clinical and economic outcomes in an emerging country setting. Methods: This was a pre- and post-intervention study in ten private hospitals (1,650 beds) in Brazil (from May 2010 to January 2012), enrolling 2,120 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. The program used a multifaceted approach: screening strategies, multidisciplinary educational sessions, case management, and continuous performance assessment. The network administration and an external consultant provided performance feedback and benchmarking within the network. The primary outcome was compliance with the resuscitation bundle. The secondary outcomes were hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain, and cost-effectiveness. Results: The proportion of patients who received all the required items for the resuscitation bundle improved from 13% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8-18%] at baseline to 62% (95% CI 54-69%) in the last trimester (p<0.001). Hospital mortality decreased from 55% (95% CI 48-62%) to 26% (95% CI 19-32%, p<0.001). Full compliance with the resuscitation bundle was associated with lower risk of hospital mortality (propensity weighted corrected risk ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.56-0.94, p=0.02). There was a reduction in the total cost per patient from 29.3 (95% CI 23.9-35.4) to 17.5 (95% CI 14.3-21.1) thousand US dollars from baseline to the last 3 months (mean difference -11,815; 95% CI -18,604 to -5,338). The mean QALY increased from 2.63 (95% CI 2.15-3.14) to 4.06 (95% CI 3.58-4.57). For each QALY, the full compliance saves US$5,383. Conclusions: A multifaceted approach to severe sepsis and septic shock patients in an emerging country setting led to high compliance with the resuscitation bundle. The intervention was cost-effective and associated with a reduction in mortality.

AB  - Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is recognized as an important research approach for reducing disparities and improving health status within communities of color (communities of color refers to communities of people who are not White) and other communities of social identity that have faced histories and patterns of discrimination or stigmatization. Key elements of CBPR include (a) community ownership, (b) coalition building with internal and external partners, (c) capacity building, (d) promotion of interdependence that facilitates colearning, (e) application of research findings to action, and (f) long-term commitment to communities. American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, in particular, have increasingly expected and demanded the use of CBPR strategies because of historic genocide and federal institutional policies, such as assimilation through boarding schools. Research abuses, even recently, have led tribes to reject being “surveyed to death,” without the return of data or receiving benefits of the research. The term tribal participatory research has grown in use, acknowledging the importance of tribal governance in oversight of research and growing numbers of tribal institutional review boards. AI/AN communities are particularly at risk for health disparities, facing high rates of historical and intergenerational trauma as well as structural inequities, such as high unemployment. These social and health disparities, along with the strengths of their cultural and language continuity, provide an optimal environment for engaging in participatory research with New Mexican tribal communities, based on authentic partnership and tribal oversight of research processes. This chapter provides an overview of principles and strategies for engaging in CBPR with AI/AN communities. To illustrate these strategies, we provide an example of a 13-year tribal–academic partnership between the University of New Mexico Center for Participatory Research (UNM CPR) and the Pueblo of Jemez (POJ). We showcase our processes for codeveloping a culturally centered prevention and intervention program with a tribal community partner, with a focus on strengthening families, language, and culture. We describe how we blended indigenous/Western theory to cocreate and implement a culturally centered prevention curriculum, the Family Listening Program (FLP), rather than a tailored or adapted program. By illustrating the importance of grounding methodologies in culturally centered principles that resonate with the community’s values, we hope to directly address historical wrongs and explicitly acknowledge and positively engage conflict to produce growth for all collaborators in the research process. We discuss some of the challenges in engaging in CBPR with tribes and the implications for incorporating CBPR principles into psychological research and practice. In closing, we present lessons learned for extending translational culturally centered research into other communities of color and having an impact on reducing health inequities within diverse ethnocultural populations.

AB  - The sepsis order set at our institution was created with the intent to facilitate the prompt initiation of appropriate sepsis care. Once clinical features meeting criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are identified and an infectious source is considered, a "sepsis huddle" is concomitantly initiated. The sepsis huddle was implemented in March of 2016 in order to increase compliance with the sepsis bundles. The sepsis huddle is called via overhead paging system in the emergency department (ED) to notify all staff that there is a patient present who meets SIRS criteria with concern for sepsis requiring immediate attention. The sepsis order set is utilized for these patients and includes laboratory testing, treatment, and monitoring items to meet sepsis "bundle" compliance. In addition, it suggests antibiotic options to be administered based on the presumed source of infection. Each team member responding to a sepsis huddle has a pre-established role outlined to facilitate timely treatment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, (CMS), is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CMS sepsis guidelines call for periodic patient reassessment, including repeat vital signs, pertinent physical examination findings, and timed lactic acid measurement to determine a patient's response to resuscitation efforts. Our established order set has automated some of these reassessment features to facilitate compliance. Sepsis huddle initiation also triggers a department staff member to track the timing and completion of serial blood draws. Utilizing and adhering to the guidelines of this methodology in the management of these patients has enabled our hospital to improve benchmarking compliance from previously underperforming at the 31st and 49th percentiles in 2015, prior to initiation of the huddle, to a peak compliance at the 81st and 91st percentiles in 2016 and 65th and 83rd percentiles in 2017 for the 3-hour and 6-hour bundles respectively.

In the original article, incorrect unadjusted data appeared in the abstract and Table 3. The corrections are present in the erratum.] Context: Anxiety and depression are associated with mechanisms that promote atherosclerosis. Most recent studies of emotional disturbances in coronary artery disease (CAD) have focused on depression only. Objective: To assess the 2-year cardiac prognostic importance of the <i>DSM-IV</i>-based diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and self-report measures of anxiety and depression and their co-occurrence. Design, Setting, and Patients: Two-year follow-up of 804 patients with stable CAD (649 men) assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and the Structured Clinical Interview for <i>DSM-IV</i> (masked to self-reports) 2 months after acute coronary syndromes. Main Outcome Measures: Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or nonelective revascularization) in the 2 years after baseline. Results: Of the 804 patients, 57 (7.1%) met the criteria for MDD and 43 (5.3%) for GAD (11 [1.4%] had comorbidity); 220 (27.4%) had elevated BDI-II scores (≥14), and 333 (41.4%) had elevated HADS-A scores (≥8), with 21.1% overlap. MDD (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-5.01), GAD (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.08-4.05), elevated BDI-II (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.21-2.54), elevated HADS-A score (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18-2.37), and continuous standardized scores on the BDI-II (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62) and the HADS-A (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.63) all predicted MACEs. After covariate control, only the P value associated with the continuous BDI-II score increased to above .10. Most of the risk associated with elevated symptoms was in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, patients with comorbid MDD and GAD or elevated anxiety and depression symptoms were not at greater MACE risk than those with only 1 factor. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression predict greater MACE risk in patients with stable CAD, supporting future research into common genetic, environmental, and pathophysiologic pathways and treatments.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated the analgesic effects of ginger in different conditions, but evidence about its efficacy in migraine treatment is scarce. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the potential of ginger to improve acute migraine as an add-on strategy to standard treatment. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in the emergency room of a general hospital was conducted. Patients who sought medical care at the time of migraine attack were enrolled in this study. Only adults with episodic migraine (one to six migraine attacks per month) with or without aura were included. Sixty participants were randomized into two groups in which they received 400 mg of ginger extract (5% active ingredient) or placebo (cellulose), in addition to an intravenous drug (100 mg of ketoprofen) to treat the migraine attack. Patients filled a headache diary before, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h and 2h after the medication. Pain severity, functional status, migraine symptoms and treatment satisfaction were also recorded. Results: Patients treated with ginger showed significantly better clinical response after 1h (p=0.04), 1.5h (p=0.01) and 2h (p=0.04). Furthermore, ginger treatment promoted reduction in pain and improvement on functional status at all times assessed. Conclusions: The addition of ginger to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may contribute to the treatment of migraine attack.

AB  - Aim: The study examines the experience of intensive care nurses in caring for patients in cardiac arrest, and their perceptions of introducing nurse-led defibrillation. Method: This was a descriptive, exploratory and qualitative study at an intensive care unit (ICU) of an acute regional hospital in Hong Kong. Twelve registered nurses were purposefully selected for interview. Results: Although all the participants were trained in basic life support, only 50% were trained in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), and those trained in ACLS described having limited opportunities to apply their defibrillation knowledge. Whilst participants believed that they were theoretically prepared to influence the patient’s resuscitation outcomes, newly qualified nurses were reluctant to be accountable for defibrillation. In contrast, experienced nurses were more willing to perform nurse-led defibrillation. Support from management, cooperation between nurses and doctors, regular in-hospital ‘real-drill’ programmes, sponsorship for training, and the use of alternative defibrillation equipment should be considered to encourage nurse-led defibrillation in ICU settings. Conclusion: Nurse-led defibrillation is an approach of delivering prompt care to critically ill patients, and a way ahead for intensive care nursing in Hong Kong. Emphasis on a consistent policy to promote nurse-led defibrillation practice is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous analysis of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) long-term data set for the presence of 'coelenterate' tissue revealed changes in the frequency of jellyfish occurrence in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea; however, the identities of the jellyfish were unknown, causing uncertainty in interpreting these findings. To improve the utility of the 'coelenterate' data from the CPR, 62 CPR samples were selected for re-analysis from an area where the widespread occurrence of the holoplanktonic scyphomedusan, Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskål, 1775), was previously documented from net tows to test if the CPR sampled P. noctiluca. Examination of the samples revealed smears (<1 mm) of golden gelatinous tissue on the sampling mesh. Subsequent microscopic examination and measurement of nematocysts identified most of the smears as P. noctiluca. Indeed, P. noctiluca was identified on 53% of the CPR samples from the area that best coincided with the documented bloom area. Although hydrozoans were also identified in the samples, the characteristic golden colour of P. noctiluca and its distinct suite of nematocysts allowed identification to species level. The identification of other jellyfish may be more complicated due to the labour-intensive examination of samples and unclear delineation of nematocyst types when multiple similar species are present. Nevertheless, re-analysis of CPR samples holds great promise for identifying the underlying reason for increases in jellyfish occurrence in the CPR records.

AB  - Background: Incidence estimates of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are unknown. Method: Over 12 months, the household administrative office and health community committee within neighbourhoods in two health areas of Douala, Cameroon, registered all deaths among 86188 inhabitants aged >18 years. As part of an extended multi-source surveillance system, the Emergency Medical Service (EMS), local medical examiners and district hospital mortuaries were also surveyed. Whereas two physicians investigated every natural death, two cardiologists reviewed all unexpected natural deaths. Results: There were 288 all-cause deaths and 27 (9.4%) were SCD. The crude incidence rate was 31.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.3-40.6]/100 000 person-years. The age-standardized rate by the African standard population was 33.6 (95% CI: 22.4-44.9)/100000 person-years. Death occurred at night in 37% of cases, including 11% of patients who died while asleep. Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest occurred in 63% of cases, 55.5% of which occurred at home. Of the 88.9% cases of witnessed cardiac arrest, 63% occurred in the presence of a family member and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted only in 3.7%. Conclusion: The burden of SCD in this African population is heavy with distinct characteristics, whereas awareness of SCD and prompt resuscitation efforts appear suboptimal. Larger epidemiological studies are required in SSA in order to implement preventive measures, especially in women and young people.

AB  - Background: Issues around the deterioration of hospitalised children are known: the failure to observe and monitor patients adequately, a failure to recognise the deteriorating patient, a failure to communicative effectively within the healthcare team and a failure to respond appropriately or in a timely manner (Pearson, 2008; NPSA, 2009). In response to this, a new 1-day course called RESPOND (Recognising Signs of Paediatric hOspital iNpatients Deterioration) was developed. Objectives: To describe the development of the RESPOND course and present a preliminary evaluation of the first four courses. Methods: A written postcourse survey was completed by participants (junior doctors, medical students, nurses and health care assistants) immediately after the course and an electronic survey completed three months later in a large children’s hospital in the North West of England. Data were analysed descriptively and by simple thematic analysis of free text responses. Results: Sixty-five participants undertook the RESPOND course over four separate days. Overwhelmingly participants found the course positive, with the most frequently cited benefit being improved multidisciplinary communication. Despite a poor response to the second survey, 18% (12 of 65) of respondents remained positive about the impact of the course. Conclusions and relevance to practice: This preliminary evaluation combined with a reduction in hospital cardiac arrest rates suggest that the multiprofessional RESPOND course (in conjunction with an early warning tool and response system) is successful as part of a targeted strategy to promote patient safety within a children’s hospital.

AB  - Background: Global cerebral ischemia occurs due to reduced blood supply to the brain. This is commonly caused by a cessation of myocardial activity associated with cardiac arrest and cardiac surgery. Survival is not the only important outcome because neurological dysfunction impacts on quality of life, reducing independent living. Magnesium has been identified as a potential neuroprotective agent; however, its role in this context is not yet clear. Objectives: The objective of this review was to present the best currently available evidence related to the neuroprotective effects of magnesium during a period of global cerebral ischemia in adults with cardiac arrest or cardiac surgery. Inclusion criteria Types of participants: The current review considered adults aged over 18 years who were at risk of global cerebral ischemia associated with cardiac arrest or cardiac surgery. Studies of patients with existing neurological deficits or under the age of 18 years were excluded from the review. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest: The intervention of interest was magnesium administered in doses of at least of 2 g compared to placebo to adult patients within 24 hours of cardiac arrest or cardiac surgery. Types of studies: The current review considered experimental designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs. Outcomes: The outcome of interest were neurological recovery post-cardiac arrest or cardiac surgery, as measured by objective scales, such as but not limited to, cerebral performance category, brain stem reflexes, Glasgow Coma Score and independent living or dependent living status. To enable assessment of the available data, neuroprotection was examined by breaking down neurological outcomes into three domains - functional neurological outcomes, neurophysiological outcomes and neuropsychological outcomes. Search strategy: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies between January 1980 and August 2014, utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) three-step search strategy. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Australian Clinical Trials Register, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, Clinical Trials, European Clinical Trials Register and ISRCTN Registry. Methodological quality: The studies included in this review were of moderate-to-good-quality randomized controlled trials. Studies included measured neurological outcome using functional neurological assessment, neuropsychiatric assessment or neurophysiological assessment. Data extraction: Data were extracted using standardized templates provided by the JBI Meta-analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument software. Data synthesis: Quantitative data were, where possible, pooled in statistical meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane; Copenhagen, Denmark). Where statistical pooling was not possible, the findings were presented in narrative form, including tables and figures, to aid in data presentation, where appropriate. Results: Seven studies with a total of 1164 participants were included in this review. Neurological outcome was categorized into three domains: functional neurological, neurophysiological and neuropsychological outcomes. Meta-analysis of three studies assessing the neuroprotective properties of magnesium administration post cardiac arrest found improved functional neurological outcome (odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.81). Conclusion: Magnesium may improve functional neurological outcome in patients who suffer global cerebral ischemia associated with cardiac surgery and cardiac arrest. Magnesium does not decrease neuropsychological decline.

AB  - Patients who suffer an adverse event (AE) are more likely to die or suffer permanent disability. Many AEs are preventable. Nurses have long played a pivotal role in the prevention of AEs. Much of the literature to date pertains to the role of nurses in the prevention of AEs such as falls, pressure areas and deep vein thrombosis. Prominent risk factors for AEs are the presence of physiological abnormality, failure to recognize or correct physiological abnormality, advanced patient age and location of patient room. Ongoing physiological assessment of patients is a nursing responsibility and the assessment findings of nurses underpin many patient care decisions. The early recognition and correction of physiological abnormality can improve patient outcomes by reducing the incidence of AEs, making nurses' ability to identify, interpret and act on physiological abnormality a fundamental factor in AE prediction and prevention. This paper will examine the role of nurses in AE prevention, using cardiac arrest as an example, from the perspective of physiological safety; that is, accurate physiological assessment and the early correction of physiological abnormality.

AB  - Chronically elevated cytokines from un-abating low-grade inflammation in heart failure (HF) results in Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM). However, the impact of PEM on clinical outcomes of admissions for HF exacerbations has not been evaluated in a national data. From the 2012 to 2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) patient's discharge records for primary HF admissions, we identified patients with concomitant PEM, and their demographic and comorbid factors. We propensity-matched PEM cohorts (32,771) to no-PEM controls (1:1) using a greedy algorithm-based methodology and estimated the effect of different clinical outcomes (SAS 9.4). There were 32,771 (∼163,885) cases of PEM among the 541,679 (∼2,708,395) primary admissions for HF between 2012 and 2014 in the US. PEM cases were older (PEM:76 vs no-PEM:72 years), Whites (70.75% vs 67.30%), and had higher comorbid burden, with Deyo-comorbidity index >3 (31.61% vs 26.30%). However, PEM cases had lower rates of obesity, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. After propensity-matching, PEM was associated with higher mortality (AOR:2.48 [2.31 to 2.66]), cardiogenic shock (3.11[2.79 to 3.46]), cardiac arrest (2.30[1.96 to 2.70]), acute kidney failure (1.49[1.44 to 1.54]), acute respiratory failure (1.57[1.51 to 1.64]), mechanical ventilation (2.72[2.50 to 2.97]). PEM also resulted in higher non-routine discharges (2.24[2.17 to 2.31]), hospital cost ($80,534[78,496 to 82,625] vs $43,226[42,376 to 44,093]) and longer duration of admission (8.6[8.5 to 8.7] vs 5.3[5.2 to 5.3] days). In conclusion, PEM is a prevailing comorbidity among hospitalized HF subjects, and results in devastating health outcomes. Early identification and prevention of PEM in HF subjects during clinic visits and prompt treatment of PEM both in the clinic and during hospitalization are essential to decrease the excess burden of PEM.

AB  - Neurologic trauma, which consists of acute spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury, is a leading cause of death and disability. In recent years, there have been improvements in the early recognition and prompt resuscitation of patients with neurologic trauma. However, there remain few pharmacologic treatments to reduce its secondary complications. Corticosteroids have been used in patients with neurologic trauma for more than 5 decades. Traditionally, their use has been to improve motor and sensory recovery. However, recently their utility to prevent and manage trauma-related pneumonia has been investigated. Given these new investigations, the purpose of this review article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the history and available scientific evidence surrounding the use of corticosteroids in neurologic trauma and caution against the use of these agents to prevent hospital-acquired pneumonia in this patient population.

AB  - A total of 5 cases of plague, 2 of which were fatal, were reported in the USA during 1996. This report summarizes the investigation of the 2 fatal cases. An 18-year-old man in Flagstaff, Arizona, presented at an outpatient clinic on 2 August 1996 with a 2-day history of fever, pain in his left groin, and diarrhoea. A diagnosis of groin muscle strain was made and he was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and released. On 3 August the patient reported feeling weak, had difficulty breathing and collapsed; he experienced cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital. Cultures of blood samples were positive for Yersinia pestis by fluorescent antibody staining, confirmed by specific bacteriophage lysis. Additional isolates from postmortem brain, liver, lung and vitreous fluid cultures were also positive for Y. pestis. The patient was thought to have become infected on 27 July as the result of bites by Y. pestis-infected fleas while walking through a prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni) colony in Navajo County; high antibody titres to the fraction 1 (F1) antigen of Y. pestis were detected in 2 of 4 pet dogs living in houses near the prairie dog colony. The second fatal case occurred in a 16-year-old girl in western Colorado who presented on 19 August 1996 with pain followed by numbness in her left arm and left axillary pain, chills, fever and vomiting. Initial diagnosis was of possible brachial plexus injury, but on 21 August the patient was found at home to be semiconscious, confused and complaining of generalized soreness and neck pain. Respiratory arrest within 1 h of arrival at hospital led to rapid deterioration and death. Blood and spinal fluid cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae and cultures of respiratory aspirate and blood yielded Y. pestis. Investigation revealed high antibody titres to the F1 antigen of Y. pestis in serum specimens from 4 of 5 family dogs and 1 of 3 family cats; evidence of an earlier extensive prairie dog die-off adjacent to the patients residence was found.

AB  - Comments on an article by Areej El-Jawahri et al. (see record [rid]2015-33887-013[/rid]). Jawahri et al. report the results of a randomized trial of a simple and practical video education intervention to inform patients about resuscitation and intubation. This research team, part of the Video Images of Disease for Ethical Outcomes (VIDEO) consortium, used rigorous methods to develop and evaluate this decision support tool. In this study, they extend their previous research in the outpatient setting to the hospital in a randomized trial of 150 older patients with limited prognoses. The intervention included the video decision support tool and feedback about the patient’s preferences to at least one physician on the patient’s medical team. It remains to be seen which outcomes should be measured to assess palliative care interventions and who should be engaged in defining and measuring them. Simply measuring rates of resuscitation and intubation will not be enough to change practice: we need to demonstrate how more and better decision-making improves outcomes, such as reducing suffering and improving dignity and quality of life, that matter for patients and their caregivers.

AB  - The Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine is the only tuberculosis (TB) vaccine available, yet it provides limited protection against pulmonary TB in adults and fails to protect against TB reactivation. We hypothesized that immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis "resuscitation-promoting factors" (Rpfs), which are small bacterial proteins that promote proliferation of dormant mycobacteria, may be relevant in the human immune response to M. tuberculosis. In previous unpublished work, we found that Rpfs Rv0867c and Rv2389c induced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production in the blood of TB patients' healthy household contacts in several different African populations. Here we examine these two dominant Rpf antigens in more detail and define the nature of the responding T-cell subsets. Multiparameter cytokine profiling showed that Rv2389c and, to a lesser extent, Rv0867c were recognized by mycobacterium-responsive healthy Dutch individuals; peptide-scanning revealed several epitopes, including a single immunodominant epitope in Rv2389c. Rv0867c and, to a lesser extent, Rv2389c Rpf-specific T-cell responses were maintained for decades in long-term M. tuberculosis nonprogressors. Prominent Rv0867c-specific double- and single-cytokine-producing CD8+ T-cell subset responses were found, including a large population of CD8+ effector memory and effector T-cell subsets. We conclude that M. tuberculosis Rpf antigens are important targets in the human immune response to M. tuberculosis and represent interesting TB vaccine candidate antigens.

AB  - Presents the case report of TD, who is a 48-year-old female with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and MS-related cognitive impairment. She is wheelchair bound and chronically disoriented and is cared for in an "adult family home". Five years ago, TD appointed her mother as durable power of attorney for health care (DPOA-HC). Today TD is admitted to the hospital for recurrent aspiration pneumonia. On presentation, she is found to be cachectic, poorly responsive, and has a stage III ulcer near the left ischial tuberosity. Arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis and hypoxia. There is no Physician’s Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form and no advance directive, and the default hospital status is "Full Code". The hospitalist feels that TD would not survive ‘‘Code Blue’’ due to her multiple comorbidities and is concerned that intubating her would result in a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) course with a poor quality of life. On further investigation, it was found that TD's mother died 3 years ago, and her only family is an alcoholic and schizophrenic aunt who rarely visits TD. The hospitalist calls for an ethics consult to solve the issue of decision making and to determine whether it is ethical to change TD’s code status to "do not attempt resuscitation" (DNAR).

AB  - Objective: To retrospectively analyze the epidemiological characteristics of pre-hospital emergency care for a community-based population in the urban areas of Fuzhou city and to propose strategies for improving pre-hospital emergency care and the prevention and treatment of common emergency conditions. Methods: Data of different sorts of diseases, age, gender, monthly variation in number of cases, time required to response the emergency call and outcome of care were retrospectively analyzed in patients who received pre-hospital emergency care in the urban areas of Fuzhou city in 2010. Results: A total of 2130 subjects had pre-hospital emergency care in the urban areas of Fuzhou city. Among them, trauma was the major cause, and was found mainly in youths and adults aged 31-40 years. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were the second most common causes and were found mainly in patients aged > 50 years (especially in those >70) accounting for 50.57% in patients of that age cohort. More males than females received pre-hospital emergency care (1.57:1). A total of 190 patients died during pre-hospital emergency care with trauma (n=69, 36.32%), the leading cause of death. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were the second leading cause of death and found mainly in patients aged >50 (n=53) accounting for 81. 54% of deaths in patients of this age cohort. Among patients with sudden death before admission, there was no one had cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed by witness before the emergency care given. Pre-hospital emergency care and pre-hospital deaths were more often occurred in the winter and spring seasons. The time required to response emergency call and the time elapsed to on-site emergency care were (10.0±6.1) min and (11.8±5.9) min, respectively, for patients receiving pre-hospital emergency care; and the time required to response the emergency call and the time elapsed to on-site emergency care were (11.2±6.2) min and (29.0±21.1) min, respectively, for patients who died during the pre-hospital emergency care. Conclusions: (1) It is imperative to provide healthcare education to the community and to improve community awareness of the importance of the disease prevention, especially cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, whereby this would effectively reduce the incidence of emergency care and sudden death. (2) It is also necessary to promote pre-hospital emergency care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques, which are important for improving pre-hospital emergency care and reducing mortality. (3) Strengthening network integration and enforcing the "principle of proximity" are also important. Coordination between pre-hospital emergency care workers and other relevant departments may improve the efficiency of the Emergency Medical Service System.

AB  - Background: The reported decline in elderly suicide rates in England may have been, in part, due to prompt and successful resuscitation of those who attempt suicide. This study examines the impact of prompt and successful resuscitation of those who attempt suicide on elderly suicide rates in England. Methods: Possible changes in rates of attempted suicides in elderly age-bands over a nine-year period and the correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in elderly age-bands in England were examined using nationally collected data. Results: There was a significant increase in the rates of attempted suicide over the study period in the age-band 60-74 years, but not in the age-band 75+ years. There was a positive correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in the age-band 75+ years, but not in the age-band 60-74 years. Conclusions: The findings of this study were unable to confirm conclusively that prompt and successful medical resuscitation of those who attempt suicide makes a contribution to the decline in elderly suicide rates and requires further study. Public health initiatives should be designed to reduce not only suicide rates but also rates of attempted suicide; otherwise they are failing in the prevention of mental illness and suicidal behavior, early identification and treatment of those with mental illness and those at risk of suicide, and systematic follow-up of those recovering and recovered from mental illness.

AB  - Background: Fournier's gangrene is rare and rapidly spreading aggressive and progressive infection of the perineum in which fascial necrosis is more extensive than the visible gangrene. Early surgical debridement prompt antibiotic administration, are essential for a better prognosis. Delay in diagnosis or treatment increase the mortality rate. This could be because of the multi factorial and poly microbial association of the disease. Aim: We attempt to describe the importance of early radical debridement and its effect on the outcome of the disease. Methodology: We conducted an analytical study on 26 patients of Fournier gangrene admitted in the rural hospital from July 2011 to July 2014. On admission, their Fournier gangrene severity index was calculated. The broad spectrum antibiotics were started and radical debridement was done in all patients on the same day within 6 hours of admission. Daily dressing was done till the wound showed healthy granulation tissue. The scrotal skin was mobilized and suturing was done. Result: In our studies there was no mortality. This indicates that early aggressive resuscitation to correct the dehydration and early radical debridement improves the outcome in this rare and fatal disease.

AB  - Background: The majority of patients who die in hospital have a “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) order in place at the time of their death, yet we know very little about why some patients request or agree to a DNR order, why others don’t, and how they view discussions of resuscitation status. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews of English-speaking medical inpatients who had clearly requested a DNR or full code (FC) order after a discussion with their admitting team, and analyzed the transcripts using a modified grounded-theory approach. Results: We achieved conceptual saturation after conducting 44 interviews (27 DNR, 17 FC) over a 4- month period. Patients in the DNR group were much older than those in the FC group, but they had broadly similar admission diagnoses and comorbidities. DNR patients reported much greater familiarity with the subject and described a more positive experience than FC patients with their resuscitation discussions. Participants typically requested FC or DNR orders based on personal, relational or philosophical considerations, but these considerations manifested differently depending on the participant’s preference for resuscitation. Most FC patients stated that would not want a prolonged period of life support, and they would not want resuscitation in the event of a poor quality of life. FC and DNR patients understood resuscitation and DNR orders differently. DNR patients described resuscitation in graphic, concrete terms that emphasized suffering and futility, and DNR orders in terms of comfort or natural processes. FC patients understood resuscitation in an abstract sense as something that restores life, while DNR orders were associated with substandard care or even euthanasia. Conclusion: Our study identified important differences and commonalities between the perspectives of DNR and FC patients. We hope that this information can be used to help physicians better understand the needs of their patients when discussing resuscitation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To describe the functional outcome of canine and feline survivors of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and the clinical characteristics surrounding their resuscitation. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Veterinary teaching hospital. Animals: Client-owned dogs (15) and cats (3) with CPA. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Eighteen animals were identified to have survived to discharge following CPA. Cardiopulmonary arrest was associated with anaesthesia with or without preexisting disease in 10 animals, cardiovascular collapse in 5 animals, and chronic disease with an imposed stress in 3 animals. All CPAs were witnessed in the hospital. The most common initial rhythm at CPA was asystole (72%). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in less than 15 minutes from the onset of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) in all animals. No animals had a recurrence of CPA after the initial CPA. Animals were of a wide range of ages (0.5-16 years) and breeds. Two animals were neurologically abnormal at discharge, one of which was normal at 2 months following CPA. Conclusions: A good functional recovery after CPCR was documented in the small number of CPA survivors presented in this study. This may be due to the reversible nature of their inciting cause of CPA, early detections of CPA ('witnessed'), and/or the animal's underlying normal health status.

AB  - Context: Talking about death can be difficult. Without evidence that end-of-life discussions improve patient outcomes, physicians must balance their desire to honor patient autonomy against a concern of inflicting psychological harm. Objective: To determine whether end-of-life discussions with physicians are associated with fewer aggressive interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants: A US multisite, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 332 dyads), September 2002-February 2008. Patients were followed up from enrollment to death, a median of 4.4 months later. Bereaved caregivers' psychiatric illness and quality of life was assessed a median of 6.5 months later. Main Outcome Measures: Aggressive medical care (eg, ventilation, resuscitation) and hospice in the final week of life. Secondary outcomes included patients' mental health and caregivers' bereavement adjustment. Results: One hundred twenty-three of 332 (37.0%) patients reported having end-of-life discussions before baseline. Such discussions were not associated with higher rates of major depressive disorder (8.3% vs 5.8%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-3.32), or more worry (mean McGill score, 6.5 vs 7.0; P = .19). After propensity-score weighted adjustment, end-of-life discussions were associated with lower rates of ventilation (1.6% vs 11.0%; adjusted OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.83), resuscitation (0.8% vs 6.7%; adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.80), ICU admission (4.1% vs 12.4%; adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.90), and earlier hospice enrollment (65.6% vs 44.5%; adjusted OR, 1.65;95% CI, 1.04-2.63). In adjusted analyses, more aggressive medical care was associated with worse patient quality of life (6.4 vs 4.6; F = 3.61, P = .01) and higher risk of major depressive disorder in bereaved caregivers (adjusted OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.12-10.13), whereas longer hospice stays were associated with better patient quality of life (mean score, 5.6 vs 6.9; F = 3.70, P = .01). Better patient quality of life was associated with better caregiver quality of life at follow-up (β = .20; P = .001). Conclusions: End-of-life discussions are associated with less aggressive medical care near death and earlier hospice referrals. Aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse bereavement adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report describes a series of ten cases of fulminant pulmonary haemorrhage in dogs following envenomation by the eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) in south eastern Queensland, Australia. All cases were presented for veterinary treatment during 2011-2018 at a specialist veterinary emergency centre. Each case received prompt antivenom treatment and supportive care. Pulmonary haemorrhage was diagnosed based on clinical examination; overt haemoptysis; thoracic radiographic demonstration of a diffuse alveolar pattern; and, the presence of venom induced consumptive coagulopathy. The median elapsed time from hospital admission to onset of haemoptysis was 2 h (range 0-18 h). In 80% (8/10) of cases endotracheal intubation was required, whilst 20% (2/10) were successfully treated with mask oxygen supplementation alone, and 40% (4/10) received mechanical ventilation; but only 25% (1/4) of these survived to hospital discharge. Fresh frozen canine plasma was administered to 70% (7/10) of cases and 43% (3/7) of these survived. Of the total number of cases presented for treatment, 30% (3/10) survived to hospital discharge, 60% (6/10) were euthanised due to poor prognosis and 10% (1/10) died from cardiac arrest. Initial serum brown snake venom antigen levels were retrospectively measured from frozen serum samples by venom specific sandwich ELISA in two dogs at 154 ng/mL (survived) and 3607 ng/mL (euthanised); no free venom was detected post-antivenom. Dogs that survived were discharged from hospital without apparent complications. Pulmonary haemorrhage is an uncommon event following envenomation by P. textilis in dogs and has not been described in similarly envenomed humans. This case series highlights the potential for fulminant and fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in dogs following eastern brown snake envenomation.

Treatment consisted of a 1-mo short-term phase followed by a 6-mo long-term phase. At the end of the long-term phase, drug was discontinued, and the need for further drug treatment and the occurrence of withdrawal dyskinesias were assessed. Measures included the Clinical Glob Impressions (CGI), Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. The mean risperidone dosage was 1.2 mg/day. Overall, the children had significant clinical improvement as assessed by the CPRS and CGI. Untoward effects included sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain. Two of 13 (15.4%) children treat long-term developed mild, reversible withdrawal dyskinesias when risperidone was discontinued. No child developed dyskinesias on risperidone. Risperidone shows promise as a treatment in autism. However, withdrawal dysknesias were noted. Further assessment of the risk of risperidone-related dyskinesias is indicated.

AB  - Background: Injuries are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Developing countries account for 90% of injury-related deaths globally. Trauma audit filters can facilitate trauma quality improvement initiatives and reduce the injury burden. Little is known about context-appropriate trauma audit filters for developing countries such as Cameroon. This study aimed to (1) develop context-appropriate trauma audit filters for the setting of a regional referral hospital in Cameroon and (2) to assess the barriers and facilitators to their implementation. Methods: Feasible audit filters were identified by a panel of Cameroonian surgeons using the Delphi technique. A Likert scale (1 to 5, with 5 as "Most Useful") was used to rank the filters for utility in a regional referral hospital setting, analyzed using the median and interquartile range. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 health care providers from three hospital facilities to explore their perceptions of supervision and support they receive from hospital administration, availability of resources, their work environment, and potential concerns and impacts of trauma audit filters. Interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Results: Within a panel of seven surgeons, 23 of 40 trauma audit filter variables met majority consensus criteria. Twenty-one of these, comprising mostly of primary survey and basic resuscitation techniques, had a median score of ≥4. Filters meeting consensus include, but are not limited to, vitals obtained, breathing assessment made, and two large bore intravenous established within 15 min of arrival; patient with open fracture receives intravenous antimicrobials within 1 h of arrival; patients with suspected spine injury are immobilized and given X-ray. The provider interviews revealed that the barriers to providing quality care were limited human and material resources and patients' inability to pay. Regular staff training in trauma care and the belief that trauma audit filters would potentially streamline work practices and improve the quality of care were cited as promoters of successful implementation. Conclusions: Primary survey and basic resuscitative techniques are key elements of context-appropriate audit filters in Cameroon. Such audit filters may not be costly, require complex infrastructure, or equipment that exceed the site's capabilities. Proper staff orientation and participation in the use of trauma audit filters, as quality improvement tools, are key to local buy-in and implementation success.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of a video decision support tool on the preferences for future medical care in older people if they develop advanced dementia, and the stability of those preferences after six weeks. Design: Randomised controlled trial conducted between 1 September 2007 and 30 May 2008. Setting: Four primary care clinics (two geriatric and two adult medicine) affiliated with three academic medical centres in Boston. Participants: Convenience sample of 200 older people ( 65 years) living in the community with previously scheduled appointments at one of the clinics. Mean age was 75 and 58% were women. Intervention: Verbal narrative alone (n=106) or with a video decision support tool (n=94). Main outcome measures: Preferred goal of care: life prolonging care (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation), limited care (admission to hospital, antibiotics, but not cardiopulmonary resuscitation), or comfort care (treatment only to relieve symptoms). Preferences after six weeks. The principal category for analysis was the difference in proportions of participants in each group who preferred comfort care. Results: Among participants receiving the verbal narrative alone, 68 (64%) chose comfort care, 20 (19%) chose limited care, 15 (14%) chose life prolonging care, and three (3%) were uncertain. In the video group, 81 (86%) chose comfort care, eight (9%) chose limited care, four (4%) chose life prolonging care, and one (1%) was uncertain ( χ²=13.0, df=3, P=0.003). Among all participants the factors associated with a greater likelihood of opting for comfort care were being a college graduate or higher, good or better health status, greater health literacy, white race, and randomisation to the video arm. In multivariable analysis, participants in the video group were more likely to prefer comfort care than those in the verbal group (adjusted odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 8.6). Participants were re-interviewed after six weeks. Among the 94/106 (89%) participants re-interviewed in the verbal group, 27 (29%) changed their preferences ( κ=0.35). Among the 84/94 (89%) participants re-interviewed in the video group, five (6%) changed their preferences ( κ=0.79) (P<0.001 for difference). Conclusion: Older people who view a video depiction of a patient with advanced dementia after hearing a verbal description of the condition are more likely to opt for comfort as their goal of care compared with those who solely listen to a verbal description. They also have more stable preferences over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Clinicians who rarely perform neonatal resuscitation exhibit skill deterioration. Telehealth addresses this challenge by facilitating video connections between neonatologists at tertiary care centers and providers at smaller hospitals. However, there is little empirical evidence about the benefits of telehealth programs for neonatal resuscitation. Thus, we conducted a multiple-baseline study to evaluate the effect of video-assisted resuscitation on the transfer of newborns from eight community hospitals that implemented neonatal telehealth in the period November 2014-December 2015 to level 3 newborn intensive care units. The intervention was associated with a reduction of 0.70 transfers per facility-month and a 29.4 percent reduction in a newborn's odds of being transferred. Annually, this corresponds to 67.2 fewer transfers and an estimated savings of $1,220,352 per year. Avoiding transfers keeps families closer to home, increases community hospital revenue, and eliminates transfer-associated risk. Yet lack of reimbursement for telehealth limits its adoption. Policy changes are necessary to align payment incentives and promote the use of telehealth services.

AB  - Purpose: Cognitive impairment may occur in 42–50% of cardiac arrest survivors. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) has recently been shown to have neurotherapeutic effects in patients suffering from chronic cognitive impairments (CCI) consequent to stroke and mild traumatic brain injury. The objective of this study was to assess the neurotherapeutic effect of HBO2 in patients suffering from CCI due to cardiac arrest. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with CCI caused by cardiac arrest, treated with 60 daily sessions of HBO2. Evaluation included objective computerized cognitive tests (NeuroTrax), Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of life questionnaires. The results of these tests were compared with changes in brain activity as assessed by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging. Results: The study included 11 cases of CCI patients. Patients were treated with HBO2, 0.5–7.5 years (mean 2.6±0.6 years) after the cardiac arrest. HBO2 was found to induce modest, but statistically significant improvement in memory, attention and executive function (mean scores) of 12%, 20% and 24% respectively. The clinical improvements were found to be well correlated with increased brain activity in relevant brain areas as assessed by computerized analysis of the SPECT imaging. Conclusions: Although further research is needed, the results demonstrate the beneficial effects of HBO2 on CCI in patients after cardiac arrest, even months to years after the acute event.

AB  - Background: Improving the delivery of emergency obstetric care (EmNOC) remains critical in addressing direct causes of maternal mortality. United Nations (UN) agencies have promoted standard methods for evaluating the availability of EmNOC facilities although modifications have been proposed by others. This study presents an assessment of the preparedness of public health facilities to provide EmNOC using these methods in one South African district with a persistently high maternal mortality ratio. Methods: Data collection took place in the final quarter of 2014. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to classify the 7 hospitals and 8 community health centres (CHCs) in the district as either basic EmNOC (BEmNOC) or comprehensive EmNOC (CEmNOC) facilities using UN EmNOC signal functions. The required density of EmNOC facilities was calculated using UN norms. We also assessed the availability of EmNOC personnel, resuscitation equipment, drugs, fluids, and protocols at each facility. The workload of skilled EmNOC providers at hospitals and CHCs was compared. Results: All 7 hospitals in the district were classified as CEmNOC facilities, but none of the 8 CHCs performed all required signal functions to be classified as BEmNOC facilities. UN norms indicated that 25 EmNOC facilities were required for the district population, 5 of which should be CEmNOCs. None of the facilities had 100% of items on the EmNOC checklists. Hospital midwives delivered an average of 36.4±14.3 deliveries each per month compared to only 7.9±3.2 for CHC midwives (p<0.001). Conclusions: The analysis indicated a shortfall of EmNOC facilities in the district. Full EmNOC services were centralised to hospitals to assure patient safety even though national policy guidelines sanction more decentralisation to CHCs. Studies measuring EmNOC availability need to consider facility opening hours, capacity and staffing in addition to the demonstrated performance of signal functions.

AB  - Objective: Outcome prediction is challenging in comatose postcardiac arrest survivors. We assessed the feasibility and prognostic utility of brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) during the first week. Methods: Consecutive comatose postcardiac arrest patients were prospectively enrolled. AWI data of patients who met predefined specific prognostic criteria were used to determine distinguishing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds. Group 1 criteria were death at 6 months <i>and</i> absent motor response or absent pupillary reflexes <i>or</i> bilateral absent cortical responses at 72 hours or vegetative at 1 month. Group 2 criterion was survival at 6 months with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4 or 5 (group 2A) or 3 (group 2B). The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated at 50 X 1<sup>-6</sup> mm2/sec intervals. Results: Overall, 86% of patients underwent DWI. Fifty-one patients with 62 brain DWTs were included. Forty patients met the specific prognostic criteria. The percentage of brain volume with an ADC value less than 650 to 700 X 10<sup>-6</sup>mm2/sec best differentiated between Group 1 and Groups 2A and 2B combined (<i>p</i> < 0.001), whereas the 400 to 450 X 10<sup>-6</sup>mm2/sec threshold best differentiated between Groups 2A and 2B (<i>p</i> = 0.003). The ideal time window for prognostication using DWI was between 49 and 108 hours after the arrest. When comparing DWI in this time window with the 72-hour neurological examination, DWI improved the sensitivity for predicting poor outcome by 38% while maintaining 100% specificity (<i>p</i> = 0.021). Interpretation: Quantitative DWI in comatose postcardiac arrest survivors holds promise as a prognostic adjunct. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Without doubt, in medicine as in life, one size does not fit all. We do not administer the same drug or dose to every patient at all times, so why then would we live under the illusion that we should give the same nutrition at all times in the continuum of critical illness? We have long lived under the assumption that critical illness and trauma lead to a consistent early increase in metabolic/caloric need, the so-called "hypermetabolism" of critical illness. What if this is incorrect? Recent data indicate that early underfeeding of calories (trophic feeding) may have benefits and may require consideration in well-nourished patients. However, we must confront the reality that currently ICU nutrition delivery worldwide is actually leading to "starvation" of our patients and is likely a major contributor to poor long-term quality of life outcomes. To begin to ascertain the actual calorie and protein delivery required for optimal ICU recovery, an understanding of "starvation" and recovery from starvation and lean body mass (LBM) loss is needed. To begin to answer this question, we must look to the landmark Minnesota Starvation Study from 1945. This trial defines much of the world's knowledge about starvation, and most importantly what is required for recovery from starvation and massive LBM loss as occurs in the ICU. Recent and historic data indicate that critical illness is characterized by early massive catabolism, LBM loss, and escalating hypermetabolism that can persist for months or years. Early enteral nutrition during the acute phase should attempt to correct micronutrient/vitamin deficiencies, deliver adequate protein, and moderate nonprotein calories in well-nourished patients, as in the acute phase they are capable of generating significant endogenous energy. Post resuscitation, increasing protein (1.5-2.0 g/kg/day) and calories are needed to attenuate LBM loss and promote recovery. Malnutrition screening is essential and parenteral nutrition can be safely added following resuscitation when enteral nutrition is failing based on pre-illness malnutrition and LBM status. Following the ICU stay, significant protein/calorie delivery for months or years is required to facilitate functional and LBM recovery, with high-protein oral supplements being essential to achieve adequate nutrition.

AB  - Cerebral dysfunction and injury in the ICU presents as focal neurologic deficits, seizures, coma, and delirium. These syndromes may result from a primary brain insult, such as stroke or trauma, but commonly are a complication of a systemic insult, such as cardiac arrest, hypoxemia, sepsis, metabolic derangements, and pharmacologic exposures. Many survivors of critical illness have cognitive impairment, which is believed to underlie the poor long-term functional status and quality of life observed in many critical illness survivors. Although progress has been made in characterizing the epidemiology of cerebral dysfunction in the ICU, more research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms that might represent targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Studies show that erythropoietin, besides its critical role in hematopoiesis, provides neuroprotection in hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury. Antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, angiogenetic, and neurotrophic properties of erythropoietin could increase indications, currently restricted to anemia in chronic renal failure and cancer, to hypoxic-ischemic cerebral insult. In the adult and neonatal animal model of hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury, erythropoietin significantly reduces infarct size with attenuation of brain damage, and preservation of cortical integrity. The first human study on the impact of erythropoietin in stroke victims showed that erythropoietin is safe and well tolerated at high doses, and associated with improved neurological outcome. Even with intravenous application, concentrations of erythropoietin in cerebrospinal fluid of these patients were many-fold higher than in non-treated patients. In successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest victims overall neurological recovery remains poor despite improved cardiopulmonary resuscitation strategies. Post-resuscitation care needs further advances in order to improve final outcome. Through promotion of neuroangiogenesis, inhibition of hypoxia-induced apoptosis in neurons, and thus support of the survival of neurons in the ischemic brain, erythropoietin could be used to improve functional recovery of these patients. Nevertheless, optimal molecular forms of EPO, therapeutic doses, and treatment time window have to be determined in order to lower the incidence of adverse effects and still preserve neuroprotective properties.

AB  - Prior studies have revealed deficiencies in the care provided to patients dying from advanced medical illnesses in acute care hospitals. These deficiencies are best addressed through system change, which may include the development of clinical pathways and quality improvement models. The Palliative Care for Advanced Disease (PCAD) pathway was developed by an interdisciplinary team and includes a carepath, a daily flowsheet, and a physician order sheet with standard orders for symptom control. To evaluate the utility of PCAD, the clinical pathway was introduced on three hospital units (Oncology, Geriatrics, and an inpatient palliative care/hospice unit) as part of a quality improvement initiative and outcomes were compared to two general medical units receiving usual care. A chart audit tool (CAT) was used to review medical records of 101 patients who died on one of these five units during the year prior to implementation (baseline) and 156 who died during the nine months of the PCAD intervention. Four indices from CAT evaluated change over time: the mean number of 1) symptoms assessed, 2) problematic symptoms, 3) interventions consistent with PCAD, and 4) consultations requested. Nine of 27 (33%) patients on the Oncology/Geriatrics units and all 50 patients who died on the palliative care/hospice unit were placed on PCAD. During the PCAD intervention, dying patients who resided on Geriatrics, Oncology and palliative care/hospice units were more likely to have DNR orders than the comparison units, whereas the comparison units were more likely to use "morphine infusions" and cardiopulmonary resuscitation than the units that received the PCAD intervention. The mean number of symptoms assessed increased significantly in all units (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The number of problematic symptoms identified (P=0.014) and the number of interventions consistent with PCAD increased only on the palliative care/hospice unit (P=0.021). The number of medical consultations declined on all units and reached significance on the Geriatrics and Oncology units (P=0.037). Although these results reflect less than one year of the PCAD intervention and must be considered preliminary, they suggest that 1) a clinical pathway such as PCAD can serve as a managerial and educational tool to improve the care of the imminently dying inpatient; 2) a PCAD clinical pathway can be implemented on hospital units as a quality improvement initiative--a "PCAD intervention;" 3) a PCAD intervention can change outcomes in a positive direction, as measured using a chart audit tool; 4) a PCAD intervention can promote aggressive symptom assessment and treatment when goals of care are aimed at comfort; and 5) changes may occur in units that do not directly receive the intervention, a phenomenon that suggests the possibility of diffusion. Further study of this systems-oriented approach to change is warranted and should include direct assessment of patient and family outcomes, as well as measures of process.

AB  - Background: Health system strengthening is crucial to improving infant and child health outcomes in low-resource countries. While the knowledge related to improving newborn and child survival has advanced remarkably over the past few decades, many healthcare systems in such settings remain unable to effectively deliver pediatric advance life support management. With the introduction of the Emergency Triage, Assessment and Treatment plus Admission care (ETAT+)-a locally adapted pediatric advanced life support management program-in Rwandan district hospitals, we undertook this study to assess the extent to which these hospitals are prepared to provide this pediatric advanced life support management. The results of the study will shed light on the resources and support that are currently available to implement ETAT+, which aims to improve care for severely ill infants and children. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in eight district hospitals across Rwanda focusing on the availability of physical and human resources, as well as hospital services organizations to provide emergency triage, assessment and treatment plus admission care for severely ill infants and children. Results: Many of essential resources deemed necessary for the provision of emergency care for severely ill infants and children were readily available (e.g. drugs and laboratory services). However, only 4/8 hospitals had BVM for newborns; while nebulizer and MDI were not available in 2/8 hospitals. Only 3/8 hospitals had F-75 and ReSoMal. Moreover, there was no adequate triage system across any of the hospitals evaluated. Further, guidelines for neonatal resuscitation and management of malaria were available in 5/8 and in 7/8 hospitals, respectively; while those for child resuscitation and management of sepsis, pneumonia, dehydration and severe malnutrition were available in less than half of the hospitals evaluated. Conclusions: Our assessment provides evidence to inform new strategies to enhance the capacity of Rwandan district hospitals to provide pediatric advanced life support management. Identifying key gaps in the health care system is required in order to facilitate the implementation and scale up of ETAT+ in Rwanda. These findings also highlight a need to establish an outreach/mentoring program, embedded within the ongoing ETAT+ program, to promote cross-hospital learning exchanges.

AB  - The Consortium for Psychoanalytic Research, Inc. (CPR), an association of 16 organizations in the National Capital Area who seek to promote research in psychoanalytically based psychotherapy, held its annual conference on January 28, 2007, at Sibley Memorial Hospital. The conference began with introductory remarks from the chairpersons of the Consortium for Psychoanalytic Research. First article explained the conference's research project, which was to compare the audience's use of dreams in their own psychotherapy practices to practitioners that were previously surveyed. The next article expressed the view that dreams can be approached as a series of photographs, each taken from a different angle. The third discussant said that working with dreams is the mainstay of Jungian analysis. Only the use of dreams in therapy can bring insight. The final panelist focused on three ideas. First, she wanted to add one thought about how therapists work with and study dreams. Her second one was that for many clients, dreams are an easier way for clients to express a secret about themselves. For her third point, she relied on Freud's idea of overdetermination. The final presentation summarized factors that were found to be important for insight to occur in work with dreams. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cut throat injuries are one of the emergency conditions managed by ENT specialists. If not treated in time, they may lead to death. Prevention of these complications depends on immediate resuscitation by securing the airway by tracheostomy or intubation, prompt control of hemorrhage and blood replacement. The present study was conducted to study the sociodemographic profile of patients of cut throat injury, motives behind cut throat injury, site and depth of the injury, treatment given at our hospital and outcome. A prospective study was done in the department of ENT in a tertiary care hospital of rural West Bengal between January 2014 and December 2015. Patients who were brought dead and minor neck injury were excluded from the study. Endotracheal intubation where possible, or emergency tracheostomy was done below the level of injury. Ryle's tube was inserted where necessary. Injured structures were repaired in layers. Among 22 patients there were 18 male and 4 female. The peak age of incidence was in the 4th decade of life. Suicidal cut throat injury was the most common mode of injury. Most of the injuries were in the zone II (72.73%). Three patients died due to severe haemorrhage and/or aspiration. Decannulation was possible in 9 out of 12 patients. Cut throat injuries have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our society. Patients with injury of larynx or upper trachea need preliminary tracheostomy. Post-operative endoscopy identifies nerve injuries and stenosis problems.

AB  - Recent data suggest the quality of resuscitation delivered to adults during in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) is low and contributes to poor outcomes, but little data regarding pediatric events exists. This thesis characterizes the quality of resuscitation delivered during simulated CPAs and the resuscitation experiences of pediatric residents. The objectives of the first manuscript were to measure the median elapsed time to initiate important resuscitation maneuvers by multidisciplinary teams during simulated pediatric medical emergencies (i.e. "mock codes"). We conducted a prospective, observational study of 34 consecutive, hospital based mock codes. We found mistakes are ubiquitous and include problems with adherence to AHA guidelines for Pediatric Basic and Advanced Life Support, communication and leadership. In the second manuscript our objectives were to characterize the resuscitation training and experience of residents. We conducted a cross-sectional survey and discovered that despite program requirements, 8% of pediatric residents had never had training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Despite the perception that residents are rarely exposed to actual pediatric CPAs, 75% of our third year residents had attended ge; 12 and as many as 20 CPAs. The only variable independently associated with having actually discharged a defibrillator on either a human or a mannequin was exposure to a new institutional code team-training curriculum. In the third manuscript our objectives were to measure the proportion of residents who complied with AHA guidelines for management of pulseless ventricular tachycardia during a prospective, observational study of pediatric residents leading simulated CPAs. Unfortunately, we observed no clear improvements with increased level of training. The only variable independently associated with time to defibrillation was previous experience with discharging a defibrillator on a human and/or a mannequin. Almost every pediatric resident will be involved in attempting to resuscitate a child suffering a CPA, yet many are inadequately trained to respond. Future interventions should focus on improving the quality of care delivered during the first 5 minutes of in-hospital resuscitation in order to optimize outcomes. Formal mechanisms are needed to guarantee adequate resuscitation training for pediatric residents, especially the delivery of high quality basic life support and hands-on experience with discharging the defibrillator.

AB  - In this study, high-efficient phenol-degrading bacterium Bacillus sp. SAS19 which was isolated from activated sludge by resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) addition, were immobilized on porous carbonaceous gels (CGs) for phenol degradation. The phenol-degrading capabilities of free and immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19 were evaluated under various initial phenol concentrations. The obtained results showed that phenol could be removed effectively by both free and immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19. Furthermore, for degradation of phenol at high concentrations, long-term utilization and recycling were more readily achieved for immobilized bacteria as compared to free bacteria. Immobilized bacteria exhibited significant increase in phenol-degrading capabilities in the third cycle of recycling and reuse, which demonstrated 87.2% and 100% of phenol (1600 mg/L) degradation efficiency at 12 and 24 h, respectively. The present study revealed that immobilized Bacillus sp. SAS19 can be potentially used for enhanced treatment of synthetic phenol-laden wastewater.

AB  - Presents a case report of a 13-year-old male with undiagnosed anorexia nervosa (AN) of the purging type who presented in cardiac arrest. This case serves as a reminder that the first presenting sign of AN may be a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia and that AN poses a continual threat for arrhythmias. His recent medical history was significant for a 20% weight loss over a 2-month period. His body mass index was 16 kg/m². He was also involved in strenuous physical activities and was taking 3 dietary supplements: Met-Rx Protein Blend, 3-Day Nitro-Tech, and Cell-Tech. Anorexia nervosa is the most common and potentially lifethreatening eating disorder. The lifetime prevalence of AN in North America is 0.5% and increasing. It is 10 times more common in females than in males. Our patient presented with ventricular fibrillation, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and the clinical features of AN of the purging type. Unfortunately, his eating disorder was not diagnosed before his near life-threatening event. He serves as a reminder that AN is a serious disorder and should prompt physicians to obtain an EKG and electrolytes routinely when caring for adolescents with AN. Any patient with AN of the purging type and electrolyte abnormalities should warrant a low threshold for hospital admission and cardiac monitoring.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are xenobiotic compounds that persists in the environment for long-term, though its productivity is banned. Abatement of the pollutants have become laborious due to it's recalcitrant nature in the environment leading to toxic effects in humans and other living beings. Biphenyl degrading bacteria co-metabolically degrade low chlorinated PCBs using the active metabolic pathway. bph operon possess different genetic arrangements in gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The binding ability of the genes and the active sites were determined by PCB docking studies. The active site of bphA gene with conserved amino acid residues determines the substrate specificity and biodegradability. Accumulation of toxic intermediates alters cellular behaviour, biomass production and downturn the metabolic activity. Several bacteria in the environment attain unculturable state which is viable and metabolically active but not cultivable (VBNC). Resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) and Rpf homologous protein retrieve the culturability of the so far uncultured bacteria. Recovery of this adaptive mechanism against various physical and chemical stressors make a headway in understanding the functionality of both environmental and medically important unculturable bacteria. Thus, this paper review about the general aspects of PCBs, cellular toxicity exerted by PCBs, role of unculturable bacterial strains in biodegradation, genes involved and degradation pathways. It is suggested to extrapolate the research findings on extracellular organic matters produced in culture supernatant of VBNC thus transforming VBNC to culturable state.

AB  - Objectives: To pilot-test a visual aid developed to help counsel pregnant women. Methods: After agreeing to participate, pregnant women at >28 weeks of gestation were assigned randomly to counseling with or without a visual aid. The visual aid contained pictures, graphics, and short messages about delivery room resuscitation, chances of survival, anticipated neonatal course, and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities. A neonatal fellow performed counseling with a standardized script for an anticipated delivery at 23 weeks of gestation. In precounseling and postcounseling sessions, women were given a structured interview to assess their knowledge of chances of survival and disability and attitudes toward resuscitation. Results: Of the 89 women who participated, 76% were black and 59% read below a 9th-grade level. Compared with the no–visual aid group, women in the visual aid group recalled more disabilities and predicted longer neonatal stays (<i>P</i> = .01). For both groups, mothers' perceptions of the chances of survival were lower after counseling; the decrease was greater in the visual aid group (<i>P</i> = .03). The majority of women in each group opted for resuscitation, which was not affected by counseling. In multivariate analyses, use of the visual aid was a significant independent factor in explaining before/after differences in survival chances and recall of a long NICU stay and number of disabilities; higher literacy levels also were significant for recalling the number of disabilities. Conclusions: Use of a visual aid improved mothers' knowledge and showed promise as a decision aid for counseling at the threshold of viability.

AB  - Rationale: Microbial infection should be regarded in the differential diagnosis of neurosurgical complications after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery, albeit cryptococcal meningitis is rare. This article will discuss the risk factors of cryptococcal meningitis in patients underwent transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery, and summary the potential origins of infection. Patient concerns and diagnosis: Here, we report a case of 37-year-old male who had cryptococcal meningitis after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery of a relapsing ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. Intervention: Standard therapy for Cryptococcus neoformans (fluconazole [400 mg per day] and flucytosine) was administered and followed by maintenance dose. Outcomes: The patient had been on treatment for one and a half years during follow-up and reported neurologically well with repeated negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture until sudden death of heart arrest. Main lessons to learn: C neoformans can be a possible cause of meningitis in immunocompetent patients after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery. Risk factors, such as pre-existed pulmonary infection and Cushing-associated hypercortisolemia, should be stressed. Promising preventive measures may include preoperative routine sputum smear and India-ink stain for screening, preoperative treatment of cryptococcal pneumonia, postoperative antibiotic management, and a more secure skull base reconstruction. Radiation and pharmaceutical treatment may be alternative for recurrent Cushing disease.

AB  - Comments on an article by Samuel DeMaria Jr. et al. (see record [rid]2012-22053-011[/rid]). This paper argues that we should deliberately use stressors as part of teaching in order to promote long-term learning outcome. It is pertinent for medical educators at all levels to consider the learning environment for their medical students and junior doctors at all times. DeMaria et al. demonstrate that emotional stress applied in controlled simulations in a context relevant to and congruent with the subject of the simulation has the effect of enhancing resuscitation skills learning. An assessment of long-term learning outcome 6 months after the course showed that results in the intervention group were significantly better. This paper represents an important contribution to a growing body of evidence on how to optimize long-term learning outcome and educators need to be increasingly aware of the factors cited in such evidence in order to optimize their courses. Emotional stressors should be used with caution, like the carefully scripted stressors used by DeMaria et al., as there are ethical implications to be considered. Moreover, it should be noted that, because the exact mechanism behind the effect of emotional stressors is hard to pinpoint, it is possible that emotional stress is not the central factor in the enhancement of learning outcome.

AB  - Background. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is a severe manifestation of dengue virus infection that particularly affects children and young adults. Despite its increasing global importance, there are no prospective studies describing the clinical characteristics, management, or outcomes of DSS. Methods. We describe the findings at onset of shock and the clinical evolution until discharge or death, from a comprehensive prospective dataset of 1719 Vietnamese children with laboratory-confirmed DSS managed on a single intensive care unit between 1999 and 2009. Results. The median age of patients was 10 years. Most cases had secondary immune responses, with only 6 clear primary infections, and all 4 dengue virus serotypes were represented during the 10-year study. Shock occurred commonly between days 4 and 6 of illness. Clinical signs and symptoms were generally consistent with empirical descriptions of DSS, although at presentation 153 (9%) were still febrile and almost one-third had no bleeding. Overall, 31 (2%) patients developed severe bleeding, primarily from the gastrointestinal tract, 26 of whom required blood transfusion. Only 8 patients died, although 123 of 1719 (7%) patients had unrecordable blood pressure at presentation and 417 of the remaining 1596 (26%) were hypotensive for age. The majority recovered well with standard crystalloid resuscitation or following a single colloid infusion. All cases were classified as severe dengue, while only 70% eventually fulfilled all 4 criteria for the 1997 World Health Organization classification of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Conclusions. With prompt intervention and assiduous clinical care by experienced staff, the outcome of this potentially fatal condition can be excellent.

AB  - A 72-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of watery diarrhoea, which was associated with intermittent fevers, abdominal pain, and weight loss of 15 lbs. The patient was originally from the Philippines and had immigrated to Canada 8 years earlier. His symptoms had begun 6 months after his return to Canada. On examination, the patient was afebrile. The abdominal examination was benign. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist and underwent panendoscopy. Upper endoscopy revealed mild gastritis and normal-appearing small-bowel mucosa. Colonoscopy revealed patchy areas of mild inflammation and bowel-wall oedema consistent with resolving infectious colitis. Specimens from random colonic biopsies were consistent with nonspecific chronic inflammation with marked eosinophilia. A biopsy of the terminal ileum captured fragments of an adult helminth embedded within the mucosa. The pathology report stated the fragment had features suggestive of a cestode scolex, but the exact species could not be determined. Serological testing for strongyloidiasis was ordered. Three faecal samples collected on different days were negative for ova and parasites. A month later, the patient's symptoms had improved without any therapy. Four weeks after the follow-up visit at which the patient reported improvement, his diarrhoea worsened with associated episodes of presyncope, for which he was admitted to the hospital. On examination, the patient was cachectic. Bilateral oedema was present in the lower limbs. The patient was started on intravenous hydration with 2 litres of normal saline, and a single 600-mg dose of oral praziquantel was given for presumed cestode infection. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation with more than 4 litres of crystalloid, the patient continued to have significant hypotension and was transferred to the intensive care unit. Faecal cultures were positive for campylobacter. After initiation of antibiotics, hypotension improved and was weaned off norepinephrine. However, he continued to have diarrhoea. The patient underwent upper and lower endoscopy, which revealed evidence of small, nonbleeding pyloric channel ulcers but no colonic pseudomembranes. A random duodenal biopsy revealed a possible helminth ovum in a single gland. During the next 72 h, the patient continued to have worsening watery diarrhoea. The faecal sample sent for ova and parasites at the time of hospital admission came back positive for Capillaria philippinensis. Albendazole was administered orally twice daily. Ten hours later, the patient had cardiac arrest and died.

AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) patients exhibit learning and memory disabilities. These deficits suggest that synaptic dysfunction may underlie such disabilities. The hypothesis of the present study was that synaptic dysfunction occurs following CA and that this precedes cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used histopathological and electrophysiological markers in the hippocampus of rats subjected to CA. Evoked potentials (EP) were determined in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices harvested from animals subjected to CA or sham-operated rats by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals and recording in the CA1 pyramidal region. EP amplitudes were significantly attenuated by approximately 60% in hippocampal slices harvested from animals subjected to CA. Hippocampal slices harvested from sham rats exhibited normal long-term potentiation (LTP). In contrast, hippocampal slices harvested 24 h after CA exhibited no LTP response, even when no histopathological abnormalities were observed. These data suggest that synaptic dysfunction occurs before and without overt histopathology. We suggest that the synaptic dysfunction precedes and may be an early marker for delayed neuronal cell death in the hippocampus after CA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Emergency general surgery (EGS) has emerged as an important component of frontline operative care. Efforts in high-income settings have described its burden but have yet to consider low- and middle-income health care settings in which emergent conditions represent a high proportion of operative need. The objective of this study was to describe the disease spectrum of EGS conditions and associated factors among patients presenting in a low-middle income context. Methods: March 2009-April 2014 discharge data from a university teaching hospital in South Asia were obtained for patients (≥16 years) with primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes consistent with an EGS condition as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality and occurrence of ≥1 major complication(s). Multivariable analyses were performed, adjusting for differences in demographic and case-mix factors. Results: A total of 13,893 discharge records corresponded to EGS conditions. Average age was 47.2 years (±16.8, standard deviation), with a male preponderance (59.9%). The majority presented with admitting diagnoses of biliary disease (20.2%), followed by soft-tissue disorders (15.7%), hernias (14.9%), and colorectal disease (14.3%). Rates of death and complications were 2.7% and 6.6%, respectively; increasing age was an independent predictor of both. Patients in need of resuscitation (n=225) had the greatest rates of mortality (72.9%) and complications (94.2%). Conclusion: This study takes an important step toward quantifying outcomes and complications of EGS, providing one of the first assessments of EGS conditions using American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definitions in a low-middle income health care setting. Further efforts in varied settings are needed to promote representative benchmarking worldwide.

AB  - Premature birth incidence and survival rates are increasing steadily due to advances in obstetric and neonatal intensive care. Those born at the limits of viability are highly at-risk of adverse neurocognitive function over their lifespan, leading to current controversy regarding aggressive resuscitation efforts for these extremely preterm children. However, data from earlier generation cohorts who were born in substantially different eras of neonatal intensive care cannot be relied on to predict outcome of today’s newborn. Our review by the crucial variable of birth cohort year shows a changing developmental trajectory in which today’s extremely preterm survivor is likely to have fewer severe medical complications, better neurological outcomes, and fewer adverse cognitive late effects. Such data further underscore the importance of concurrently considering medical, familial, socio environmental, and neurobiological factors in combination with individual neonatal intensive care center protocols when studying outcomes of the preterm child. This complex, interrelated range of factors directly affects the immature, rapidly developing premature brain. However, ongoing surveillance to detect subsequent delay or impairment and to apply interventional strategies early in the developmental course holds promise for further enhancement of functional outcome.

AB  - Context: Characterization of heat stroke cases on arrival to hospital may lead to early recognition and improved management. Delay in treatment leading to high rate of mortality and poor outcomes so a high index of clinical suspicion in appropriate setting is warranted. Aims: Recurring seasonal(summer) outbreak of heat stroke among children from Muzaffarpur district, Bihar was investigated to describe clinico-epidemiological features. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study involving 50 patients of classic heat stroke admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) Muzaffarpur in June 2005 and June 2011 were carried out. These patients had presented with a rectal temperature of more than 40°C and central nervous system disturbance. The patients were treated with standard regimen of management of heat stroke and sponging in ICU after emergency resuscitation. Results: A total of 50 case records were studied of children below12 years of age. Case fatality ratio was 60%. The disease had peak incidence in June. Previously healthy, rural children (mean age-3.78 yr) of very low socio-economic background were found most vulnerable. The main presenting feature ware high fever (100%), convulsion (100%), unconsciousness (100%), decebrate rigidity (50%), tachycardia (80%), and tachypnea (80%). No one had splenomegaly. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was under high pressure but normal otherwise in all cases. Biochemical investigation reveled hyponatremia (50%), hypokalemia (5%), mild raised SGPT (30%), blood urea (40-50 mg/dl) (40%) with normal creatinine. Smear for malarial parasites were negative. CT scan of head done in 20 cases; 10-showed feature of generalized cerebral edema while rest was normal. ECG showed non-specific ST-T changes and tachyarrhythmia. Moderate to severe residual neurologic deficit was observed in 20% of survivors. Male to female ratio was 1.5:1. No infective organism or its antigen or antibody was found in the any of the samples tested locally or at various apex virological centers of India. Conclusions: Heat stroke is a medical emergency with serious complication and requires prompt treatment. It is associated with multi-organ dysfunction with high mortality and substantial neurological squeals.

AB  - To characterize chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over 416 patients' last 6 mo of life, a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort from the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments was conducted. Outcome measures were days in hospital, prognosis, illness severity, function, symptoms, patients' preferences, and impacts on families. One-yr survival was 59%, 39% had />3 comorbidities, and 15–25% of the patients' last 6 mo were in hospitals. Better quality of life predicted longer survival as did heart failure etiology of exacerbation. Estimates of survival by physicians and by a prognostic model were well calibrated, although patients with the worst prognoses survived longer than predicted. Patients' estimates of prognosis were poorly calibrated. One-quarter of patients had serious pain throughout, and two-thirds had serious dyspnea. Patients' illnesses had a major impact on over 25% of families. Preferences for do-not-resuscitate orders increased from 40% at 3–6 mo before death to 77% within 1 mo of death; their decisions not to use mechanical ventilation increased from 12 to 31%, and their resuscitation preferences decreased from 52 to 23%.

AB  - Background and purpose: There are some debates with decision making for withdrawal/withholding of life sustaining treatment in infants with adverse prognoses and incurable conditions. This study is conducted to review attitudes and practice of pediatrics and gynecology physicians in this field. Materials and methods: This survey was conducted during 2009 in Sari and Babol. A total of 140 pediatricians, gynecologists and residents/fellows in these fields were recruited by census; 106 doctors completed an anonymous questionnaire (response rate 75.7%). Results: More than 70 percent of respondents disagreed and less than a quarter of them agreed with euthanasia. Thus far, none of the doctors prescribed drugs to expedite neonatal death. Withdrawal of life sustaining treatment in infants with adverse prognoses and incurable conditions was uncommon, and reported by one fifth of physicians in their diagnosis of infants with multiple congenital anomalies. Influential factors in their decision to withdraw life sustaining treatment in these infants were: the number of children, the insistence of hospital staff, the request from parents, the infant's sex, lack of hospital facilities, parental history of infertility and family income, respectively. Religious beliefs were effective for withdrawal/withholding of life sustaining treatment in the decision making process and was led to an agreement more with the approval of the law in the majority of cases. Conclusion: This study revealed that attitude and sanctity of life, overcomes the attitude regarding to quality of life from most of the physicians. Law approval in this field is necessary.

After a premedication of acepromazine and pethidine, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen 50% and nitrous oxide 50%. Increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, end tidal carbon dioxide tension and temperature were observed, occurring sequentially, from 110 to 175 minutes after anaesthetic induction. Despite ceasing all warming measures and attempting to cool the patient, body temperature continued to rapidly rise, reaching 42.5°C and limb rigidity was observed. Isoflurane administration was stopped and esmolol was administered. Cardiac arrest occurred. Cardio-pulmonary cerebral resuscitation was commenced and a lateral thoracotomy was performed to allow cardiac compressions and internal defibrillation. Atropine, adrenaline, glucose and dopamine were administered and cold saline was instilled into the thoracic cavity. Follow-up Resuscitation was unsuccessful and the cat died. Conclusions: A presumptive diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia was made. Malignant hyperthermia should be considered, even if prior exposure to volatile inhalational anaesthesia was uneventful, and prompt and aggressive therapy instituted.

AB  - Compared the clinical usefulness of dimensional and categorical representations of psychotic psychopathology. Psychopathology was measured in 706 16–65 yr olds with chronic psychosis using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Lifetime Research Diagnostic Criteria, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R), and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnoses and ratings of lifetime psychopathology were made. Other clinical measures included: (1) need for care; (2) quality of life; (3) social disability; (4) satisfaction with services; (5) abnormal movements; (6) brief neuropsychological screen; and (7) previous 2-yr illness course, symptom severity, employment, medication use, self-harm, time in hospital and independent living. Factor analysis of the 65 CPRS items on cross-sectional psychopathology yielded 4 dimensions of positive, negative, depressive and manic symptoms. Regression models consistently showed strong and significant effects of psychopathological dimensions over and above any effect of their categorical counterparts, whereas the reverse did not hold. The effect of psychopathological dimensions was mostly cumulative: high ratings on more than one dimension increased the contribution to the clinical measures in a dose-response fashion.

AB  - Background - Although such data are available for young competitive athletes, the prevalence, characteristics, and outcome of sports-related sudden death have not been assessed previously in the general population. Methods and Results - A prospective and comprehensive national survey was performed throughout France from 2005 to 2010, involving subjects 10 to 75 years of age. Case detection for sports-related sudden death, including resuscitated cardiac arrest, was undertaken via national ambulance service reporting and Web-based screening of media releases. The overall burden of sports-related sudden death was 4.6 cases per million population per year, with 6% of cases occurring in young competitive athletes. Sensitivity analyses used to address suspected underreporting demonstrated an incidence ranging from 5 to 17 new cases per million population per year. More than 90% of cases occurred in the context of recreational sports. The age of subjects was relatively young (mean±SD 46±15 years), with a predominance of men (95%). Although most cases were witnessed (93%), bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was only commenced in 30.7% of cases. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 2.19 to 6.39, P<0.0001) and initial use of cardiac defibrillation (odds ratio 3.71, 95% confidence interval 2.07 to 6.64, P<0.0001) were the strongest independent predictors for survival to hospital discharge (15.7%, 95% confidence interval 13.2% to 18.2%). Conclusions - Sports-related sudden death in the general population is considerably more common than previously suspected. Most cases are witnessed, yet bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was only initiated in one third of cases. Given the often predictable setting of sports-related sudden death and that prompt interventions were significantly associated with improved survival, these data have implications for health services planning.

AB  - Reports an error in "Depression and anxiety as predictors of 2-year cardiac events in patients with stable coronary artery disease" by Nancy Frasure-Smith and François Lespérance (<i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i>, 2008[Jan], Vol 65[1], 62-71). In the original article, incorrect unadjusted data appeared in the abstract and Table 3. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-00546-009[/rid]). Context: Anxiety and depression are associated with mechanisms that promote atherosclerosis. Most recent studies of emotional disturbances in coronary artery disease (CAD) have focused on depression only. Objective: To assess the 2-year cardiac prognostic importance of the <i>DSM-IV</i>-based diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and self-report measures of anxiety and depression and their co-occurrence. Design, Setting, and Patients: Two-year follow-up of 804 patients with stable CAD (649 men) assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and the Structured Clinical Interview for <i>DSM-IV</i> (masked to self-reports) 2 months after acute coronary syndromes. Main Outcome Measures: Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or nonelective revascularization) in the 2 years after baseline. Results: Of the 804 patients, 57 (7.1%) met the criteria for MDD and 43 (5.3%) for GAD (11 [1.4%] had comorbidity); 220 (27.4%) had elevated BDI-II scores (≥14), and 333 (41.4%) had elevated HADS-A scores (≥8), with 21.1% overlap. MDD (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-5.01), GAD (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.08-4.05), elevated BDI-II (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.21-2.54), elevated HADS-A score (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18-2.37), and continuous standardized scores on the BDI-II (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62) and the HADS-A (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.63) all predicted MACEs. After covariate control, only the P value associated with the continuous BDI-II score increased to above .10. Most of the risk associated with elevated symptoms was in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, patients with comorbid MDD and GAD or elevated anxiety and depression symptoms were not at greater MACE risk than those with only 1 factor. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression predict greater MACE risk in patients with stable CAD, supporting future research into common genetic, environmental, and pathophysiologic pathways and treatments.

AB  - Objectives: Outcomes of surgical emergencies are associated with promptness of the appropriate surgical intervention. However, delayed presentation of surgical patients is common in most developing countries. Delays commonly occur due to transfer of patients between facilities. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of delays in treatment caused by inter-facility transfers of patients presenting with surgical emergencies as measured by objective and subjective parameters. Methods: We prospectively collected data on all patients presenting with an acute surgical emergency at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). Information regarding demographics, social class, reason and number of transfers, and distance traveled were collected. Patients were categorized into two groups, those transferred to AKUH from another facility (transferred) and direct arrivals (non-transfers). Differences between presenting physiological parameters, vital statistics, and management were tested between the two groups by the chi square and t tests. Results: Ninety-nine patients were included, 49 (49.5%) patients having been transferred from another facility. The most common reason for transfer was "lack of satisfactory surgical care." There were significant differences in presenting pulse, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, fluid for resuscitation, glasgow coma scale, and revised trauma score (all p values <0.001) between transferred and non-transferred patients. In 56 patients there was a further delay in admission, and the most common reason was bed availability, followed by financial constraints. Three patients were shifted out of the hospital due to lack of ventilator, and 14 patients left against medical advice due to financial limitations. One patient died. Conclusions: Inter-facility transfer of patients with surgical emergencies is common. These patients arrive with deranged physiology which requires complex and prolonged hospital care. Patients who cannot afford treatment are most vulnerable to transfers and delays.

AB  - This editorial discusses the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), which was launched by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine in collaboration with the Society of Critical Care Medicine. The aim of the campaign was to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis. The SSC has identified that early recognition and early goal-directed therapy are crucial steps to ensuring improved outcome in the context of sepsis. The SSC describes two care bundles of particular significance, shown to reduce mortality from sepsis. The first bundle is termed either 'the six hour' or 'resuscitation' bundle. The aim of this care package is to limit tissue hypoxia and hypoperfusion, whilst at the same time instituting early antimicrobial therapy. The SSC should involve nurses in all areas of the hospital. Nurses from A&E are well placed to give prompt antibiotics as recommended by the SSC within the first hour of diagnosis of severe sepsis and early goal-directed therapy. However, for nurses to recognize sepsis they first need to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of sepsis and therefore a targeted educational campaign will be required for both pre- and post registration nurses to achieve this. The SSC and the guidance produced offer a sound framework for managing sepsis, empowering nurses to make a difference to patient care. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Ineffective management of obstetric emergencies contributes significantly to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in Mexico. PRONTO (Programa de Rescate Obstétrico y Neonatal: Tratamiento Óptimo y Oportuno) is a highly-realistic, low-tech simulation-based obstetric and neonatal emergency training program. A pair-matched hospital-based controlled implementation trial was undertaken in three states in Mexico, with pre/post measurement of process indicators at intervention hospitals. This report assesses the impact of PRONTO simulation training on process indicators from the pre/post study design for process indicators. Methods: Data was collected in twelve intervention facilities on process indicators, including pre/post changes in knowledge and self-efficacy of obstetric emergencies and neonatal resuscitation, achievement of strategic planning goals established during training and changes in teamwork scores. Authors performed a longitudinal fixed-effects linear regression model to estimate changes in knowledge and self-efficacy and logistic regression to assess goal achievement. Results: A total of 450 professionals in interprofessional teams were trained. Significant increases in knowledge and self-efficacy were noted for both physicians and nurses (p<0.001-0.009) in all domains. Teamwork scores improved and were maintained over a three month period. A mean of 58.8% strategic planning goals per team in each hospital were achieved. There was no association between high goal achievement and knowledge, self-efficacy, proportion of doctors or nurses in training, state, or teamwork score. Conclusions: These results suggest that PRONTO's highly realistic, locally appropriate simulation and team training in maternal and neonatal emergency care may be a promising avenue for optimizing emergency response and improving quality of facility-based obstetric and neonatal care in resource-limited settings.

AB  - <i>Background.</i> Patients with primary reports of neck pain often present with impairments of mobility, proprioception and motor control within the cervical spine, and these impairments can negatively impact patient outcomes. Cervical spine manipulation (CSM), which involves the use of thrust techniques, has been shown to be effective for <i>some</i> patients presenting with a primary report of neck pain. It would be useful for clinicians to have a decision making tool, such as a clinical prediction rule (CPR), that could accurately identify that subgroup of patients that would respond dramatically to CSM. The purpose of this project was to develop that CPR. <i> Research Design and Methods.</i> A prospective, cohort study of consecutive patients referred to physical therapy with a primary complaint of neck pain. Eligible patients who consented to participate completed a series of self-report measures, and then received a detailed standardized history and physical examination consisting of a variety of factors commonly used to assess patients with neck pain. Regardless of the results of the clinical examination, all patients received a standardized treatment regimen consisting of CSM and exercise. Depending on response to treatment, patients were treated for one to two treatment sessions over approximately 1 week. At the end of their participation in the study, patients were classified as having experienced a successful outcome or not based on a well-accepted patient-reported reference standard of success, the Global Rating of Change Scale. <i>Analysis.</i> Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated for all potential predictor variables. Univariate techniques and stepwise logistic regression were used to determine the most parsimonious set of variables for prediction of treatment success. Variables retained in the regression model were used to develop a multivariate CPR to identify patients with neck pain likely to benefit from CSM. <i>Results.</i> Eighty-two patients were included in data analysis of which 32 (39%) had achieved a successful outcome. A CPR with 4 variables (symptom duration < 38 days, positive expectation that manipulation will help, difference in cervical rotation range of motion to either side ≥ 10 degrees, and pain with spring (PA) testing of the middle cervical spine) was identified. If 3 of the 4 variables (+LR 13.5) were present the chance of experiencing a successful outcome improved from 39% to 90%. <i>Discussion.</i> The CPR should improve decision-making for patients with neck pain by providing the ability to <i>a priori</i> identify patients with neck pain who are likely to benefit from CSM and exercise. However, this is only the first step in the process of developing and testing a CPR as future studies will be necessary to validate the results and should also include long-term follow-up and a comparison group to further examine the predictive value of the variables identified in the CPR.

AB  - Objective: To discuss the curative effect and mechanism of treating moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) with Huishen Granule. Methods: 36 TBI patients treatment in Wuqing Hospital of TCM were included and randomly divided into a treatment group (18 cases) and a control group (18 cases). All the TBI patients in the two groups were treated with basic treatment of western medicine, and patients in the treatment group were treated with Huishen Granule based on the above treatment. Vital signs, imageology diversity, glosgow coma score (GCS), simplified acute physiology score (SAPS), disability rating scale (DRS) and glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of patients in the two groups were observed. Results: Compared with the control group, the total effective rate, GCS, SAPS, DRS and GOS of patients in treatment group were improved significantly. Conclusion: The treatment mechanisms of Huishen Granule were as follows: benefiting qi and strengthening resistance to improve the body's stress state, promoting blood circulation for removing blood stasis to reduce the microcirculation disorder state, resuscitation to improve cognitive function in the body.

AB  - Reports an error in "The Triple P-Positive Parenting Program: A systematic review and meta-analysis of a multi-level system of parenting support" by Matthew R. Sanders, James N. Kirby, Cassandra L. Tellegen and Jamin J. Day (<i>Clinical Psychology Review</i>, 2014[Jun], Vol 34[4], 337-357). The publisher regrets that the printed version of the above article did not include the disclosure statement originally provided by the authors. The publisher would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused. The correct and final version is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-24350-007[/rid].) This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effects of the multilevel Triple P-Positive Parenting Program system on a broad range of child, parent and family outcomes. Multiple search strategies identified 116 eligible studies conducted over a 33-year period, with 101 studies comprising 16,099 families analyzed quantitatively. Moderator analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed. Significant short-term effects were found for: children's social, emotional and behavioral outcomes (<i>d</i> =0.473); parenting practices (<i>d</i> =0.578); parenting satisfaction and efficacy (<i>d</i> =0.519); parental adjustment (<i>d</i> =0.340); parental relationship (<i>d</i> =0.225) and child observational data (<i>d</i> =0.501). Significant effects were found for all outcomes at long-term including parent observational data (<i>d</i> =0.249). Moderator analyses found that study approach, study power, Triple P level, and severity of initial child problems produced significant effects in multiple moderator models when controlling for other significant moderators. Several putative moderators did not have significant effects after controlling for other significant moderators. The positive results for each level of the Triple P system provide empirical support for a blending of universal and targeted parenting interventions to promote child, parent and family wellbeing.

AB  - Background: This study was planned to determine the rate, the predisposing factors, and the outcome of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Tehran. Methods: All VLBW neonates admitted to the NICU, from April 2007 through March 2010 were enrolled. All relevant perinatal data, including the hospital course up to the time of discharge were documented. Repeated ophthalmologic examinations were done by a single ophthalmologist to observe the progression and subsequent resolution of ROP. Results: Out of 414 infants undergoing ophthalmologic examination, ROP was detected in 71 infants (17.14%); 3.4% stage I, 8.7% stage II, and 5.1% stage III. ROP stages IV or V were not detected. After adjustment for different variables, the following independent risk factors were identified: VLBW (P=0.002, OR=4.89), multiple gestation (P=0.001, R=3.51), resuscitation at birth (P=0.003, OR=3), blood transfusion more than 45 mL/kg (P=0.02, OR=4.91), oxygen therapy for more than five days (P=0.009, OR=3.11), and age more than 10 days to regain birth weight (P=0.008, OR=1.06). Thirty-three patients with stages II and III ROP were treated with laser therapy, all of them improved and none progressed to blindness. Conclusion: Our findings identify the major risk factors for ROP; skillful management of high-risk pregnancies, prevention of preterm births, appropriate neonatal care, high index of suspicion, routine screening, and prompt treatment are crucial to prevent the development and progression of ROP.

AB  - Probably the most common and important decision to be made at the end of life is the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision. Most older adults have DNR orders, prohibiting cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest, written for them by physicians in the hospital. Others write their own DNR prior to anticipated incompetence in the form of an advance directive. Research has found family members faced with making DNR decisions often turn to religion. Only two studies have considered the religious coping (RC), methods or patterns of religious behaviors and cognitions that individual use to cope in difficult situations, and mental health (MH) of family members making DNR decisions. The purpose of the current study was to promote an understanding of the RC and MH of such family members. Participants (N = 80) were recruited through the internal medicine inpatient services of Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers of New York, Saint Vincent's Hospital Manhattan. The average age of participants was 53. They were primarily female (73%), white (56%), and the child or spouse of the patient (60%). Family members participated in a 45-minute interview within 24 days of having made a DNR decision. Participants who used a positive RC pattern experienced higher levels of well-being (r = .36, p < .01), while participants who used a negative RC pattern experienced higher levels of stress on two indicators, t(75) = -2.44, p = .02; t(75) = -3.48, p = .001. Furthermore, family members whose loved ones had advance directives experienced more well being, t(75) = -2.34, p = .02. Many of the expectations of the current study did not find support. An explanation for this lack of support could be that sometimes the situation itself takes precedent, family members were in a state of crisis. Another could be the relative heterogeneity of the current study sample in comparison to past study samples. Still, the current study contributes to the understanding of the role of RC for family members under the emotionally challenging circumstance of having to make DNR decisions for loved ones in the hospital.

AB  - A 30-year-old Asian woman presented at a hospital in the UK, following a grand mal seizure in the street. No other history was available. On arrival she was unresponsive with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6, constricted but reacting pupils, minimal respiratory effort, a heart rate of 50 and a blood pressure of 95/70 mmHg. Immediate standard resuscitation was instigated; the patient was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and an electrocardiogram performed which showed a sinus bradycardia with QRS interval of 0.16 seconds. Naloxone and atropine were given, resulting in an initial improvement in heart rate, but subsequently she had an asystolic cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated with external cardiac compression and intravenous adrenaline one mg which established a regular rhythm with a rate of 60/minute and a blood pressure of 70/50 mmHg. Supportive therapy with a dopamine infusion (5-20 µg/kg/minute) was started. All routine blood results were normal, with the exception of the potassium level which was 1.4 mmol/litre (normal range 3.5-5.0 mmol/litre). Potassium supplementation was added. A toxicology screen was requested and revealed a plasma chloroquine level of 47 µmol/litre. A continuous diazepam infusion (2 mg/kg/24 h) was instituted. Over the next 24 h the patient had episodes of ventricular tachycardia which were treated with cardioversion. On the 3rd day the infusions of dopamine and diazepam were gradually stopped. The patient was extubated 66 h after admission, at which time her plasma chloroquine level was 2.4 µmol/litre. Although unwilling to discuss the circumstances and amount of her overdose, the patient made an uneventful medical recovery.<new para>ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:<new para>Large doses of chloroquine are usually fatal and death occurs rapidly from a direct effect on the myocardium. Patients with overdoses may present with nausea, diplopia, convulsions and respiratory or cardiac arrest. A 30-year-old Asian woman was admitted to hospital after a grand mal seizure in the street. She had a heart rate of 50 and a blood pressure of 96/70 mm Hg. She was mechanically ventilated and given infusions of inotropic drugs, and when a toxicology screen revealed a plasma chloroquine level of 47 µmol/l, she was given a continuous intravenous infusion of diazepam (2 mg/kg/24 h) for 3 days. She made an uneventful recovery. (The patient was unwilling to discuss the circumstances or the amount of the overdose. The Paris Society, which promotes voluntary suicide, recommends chloroquine as a toxic drug, easily obtainable over the counter; doctors should be aware of the potentially fatal effects of large doses and the appropriate treatment.)newline˜L.G.

AB  - Background: More recent studies indicated that elective cesarean section has negative effects on the physiologic responses of newborn, increases the risk of resuscitation need and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and prolongs hospital stay. Previous data and primary evaluations indicated that the cesarean rate in Malayer was very higher than the province's mean. So, it was necessary to carry out a training intervention to decrease cesarean rate in this city. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 453 healthcare workers participated. These individuals were taught and their knowledge was evaluated by a pre-test and post-test. Then, they began to train pregnant women, individually or in groups, referred to healthcare centers for receiving primary health care (PHC). Findings: During 9 month from the beginning of our study, 2726 mothers were taught and 1896 of them reached to the end of pregnancy term and delivered. The study showed that there was a significant association between decreasing cesarean rate and training (OR=0.46 99% CI [0.38, 0.56]). On the other hand, total cesarean rate of Malayer city decreased in the year 1383 compared with that in the year 1382, and the association between decreasing cesarean rate and training intervention was statistically significant (OR=0.76 99% CI [0.68, 0.85]). Conclusion: Thus, it seems that intervention can decrease cesarean rate effectively and is estimated that if this intervention is carried out in health centers all over the country, its effectiveness would be considerable.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains five genes, rpfA through rpfE, that bear significant homology to the resuscitation-promoting factor (rpf) gene of Micrococcus luteus, whose product is required to resuscitate the growth of dormant cultures of M. luteus and is essential for the growth of this organism. Previous studies have shown that deletion of any one of the five rpf-like genes did not affect the growth or survival of M. tuberculosis in vitro. In conjunction with the results of whole-genome expression profiling, this finding was indicative of their functional redundancy. In this study, we demonstrate that the single deletion mutants are phenotypically similar to wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vivo. The deletion of individual rpf-like genes had no discernible effect on the growth or long-term survival of M. tuberculosis in liquid culture, and the ability to resuscitate spontaneously from a nonculturable state in a most probable number assay was also unaffected for the three strains tested (the ΔrpfB, ΔrpfD, and ΔrpfE strains). In contrast, two multiple strains, KDT8 (ΔrpfA-mutation ΔrpfC ΔrpfB) and KDT9 (ΔrpfA ΔrpfC ΔrpfD), which lack three of the five rpf-like genes, were significantly yet differentially attenuated in a mouse infection model. These mutants were also unable to resuscitate spontaneously in vitro, demonstrating the importance of the Rpf-like proteins of M. tuberculosis in resuscitation from the nonculturable state. These results strongly suggest that the biological functions of the five rpf-like genes of M. tuberculosis are not wholly redundant and underscore the potential utility of these proteins as targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Background: In September 2010, 9 months after empowerment of caring for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock and implementation of a cooperative sepsis management protocol between community hospitals and tertiary referral hospital in Phitsanulok, the Phitsanulok Co-operative Sepsis Management (PCSM) team announced the Saving 500 Lives Campaign. This campaign aimed to encourage the unity and importance of caring for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: From October 2010 to September 2011, eight community hospitals and one tertiary referral hospital in Phitsanulok established and promoted a set of achievable goals and interventions for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. These interventions included: establishing sepsis team in all hospitals to coordinate and monitor the achievement goals; using a search out severity (SOS) score and a sepsis screening tool to help early and more accurate diagnosis; providing early resuscitation protocol and other measures as indicated by implementing a checklist for sepsis management (sepsis six bundles, rule of three, early goal-directed therapy); communication and providing important information during transportation using a protocol; and early intensivist involvement and rapid transfer to the ICU from the emergency department using a sepsis fast-track protocol. Physician and nurse leadership actively engaged in the data review and shared ideas in every hospital for improvement and closely tracked progress against those goals and interventions. The mortality rate of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock was used to measure the success of the campaign. Results: The Saving 500 Lives Campaign succeeded in efforts to saved 660 patients from 1,048 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in Phitsanulok, Thailand. The total mortality rate was 37% (decreased from 47% in the past year). The group of patients from community hospitals that can be admitted directly to the ICU from the emergency department using a sepsis fast-track protocol had the lowest mortality rate (19%). Conclusion: Setting a numeric goal using the 500 Lives Campaign was another way to support and empower the cooperation of sepsis care in Phitsanulok, Thailand.

AB  - The medical records of 20 cats with post-anesthetic cortical blindness were reviewed. Information collected included signalment and health status, reason for anesthesia, anesthetic protocols and adverse events, post-anesthetic visual and neurological abnormalities, clinical outcome, and risk factors. The vascular anatomy of the cat brain was reviewed by cadaver dissections. Thirteen cats were anaesthetised for dentistry, four for endoscopy, two for neutering procedures and one for urethral obstruction. A mouth gag was used in 16/20 cats. Three cats had had cardiac arrest, whereas in the remaining 17 cases, no specific cause of blindness was identified. Seventeen cats (85%) had neurological deficits in addition to blindness. Fourteen of 20 cats (70%) had documented recovery of vision, whereas four (20%) remained blind. Two cats (10%) were lost to follow up while still blind. Ten of 17 cats (59%) with neurological deficits had full recovery from neurological disease, two (12%) had mild persistent deficits and one (6%) was euthanased as it failed to recover. Four cats (23%) without documented resolution of neurological signs were lost to follow up. Mouth gags were identified as a potential risk factor for cerebral ischemia and blindness in cats.

AB  - A national survey was conducted by the German Allergy and Asthma Association to determine the patients' point of view about the triggering factors, circumstances of occurrence, treatment and prevention of anaphylaxis. Questionnaire-based telephone interviews were performed. 265 patients were interviewed, including 73 women and 192 men with an average age of 37.9 years. Anaphylactic reactions (AR) occurred predominantly in non-hospital settings (88%). 70% of the patients encountered more than one episode of anaphylaxis. Severe anaphylactic reactions with cardiac arrest were reported by 8%, and reactions showing either dyspnoea or loss of consciousness were reported by 64%. Comorbidities were involved in 53% of the patients, mostly infections (21%) and physical distress (14%). The majority of patients reacted to foods (63%), followed by drugs (18%) and insect stings (13%). Groundnuts, milk and nuts were the most common foods that triggered anaphylaxis. 31% of the patients were referred to an allergy specialist after emergency treatment, while 69% received medication from an emergency kit with inconsistent composition. Only one-half of the patients carried an epinephrine autoinjector, but only one-third were instructed on how to use it. Four patients received an autoinjector-trainer. Education on treatment and preventive measures was poor. Only 39% of the patients with Hymenoptera venom allergies were offered SIT. 60% of the food allergic patients did not receive advice about dietetic measures. Half of the patients reported a considerable reduction in quality of life due to AR. It is suggested that awareness on anaphylaxis is a key issue to the general public, health professionals, politicians, food industry and patient's direct social environment. Potential improvements can be seen in: (1) referral to an allergist after emergency treatment; (2) consistent patient-guidelines for emergency medication and its application; and (3) patient's education regarding adequate emergency behaviour and allergen avoidance in every day life. The major issues that should be addressed by the government and industry are improvement in food labelling, allergen management and situation of anaphylactic children in child care and schools. The measures should aim at reduction of multiple AR in non-hospital settings and enhancement of the quality of life of affected patients and their families.

AB  - A 12-year-old girl presented with history of intermittent fever (10 days), vomiting (7 days), shortness of breath (4 days) and watery diarrhoea (2 days) [Chandigarh, India]. In the emergency room, her clinical examination showed a heart rate of 136 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 56 breaths/min, a temperature of 37.8°C, a blood pressure of 60/30 mmHg, and a capillary filling time of 5-6 seconds. Shock resuscitation measures were initiated with intravenous normal saline (20 ml/kg bolus) and dopamine (5µg/kg per minute). She had cardiac arrest and started bleeding 2 h later. Chest radiography suggested intraparenchymal bleeding. Other significant clinical findings were icterus, cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, soft tender hepatomegaly, moderate splenomegaly and absence of focal neurological deficits and meningeal signs. In the intensive care unit, her haemodynamics improved with fluid resuscitation, central venous pressure and inotropic support. She also received frozen plasma and platelet concentrates. She was unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. Her pupils were bilaterally dilated 5 mm and sluggishly reacted to light. Urinalysis confirmed haematuria without proteinuria or casts. Ultrasound confirmed hepatosplenomegaly with moderate ascites. On day 3, serial microscopic blood smears showed Plasmodium falciparum. Intravenous quinine (20 mg/kg loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg every 8 h) was started. Over the next 12 h, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy resolved. Her general condition started improving. All laboratory investigations normalized within the next 48 h except for haemoglobin, which prompted for blood transfusion. She was also given mannitol and furosemide to reduce cerebral oedema. Over the next 24 h, her neurological status improved. She was discharged from the hospital after 7 days of quinine therapy.

AB  - Objective: This observational study examined the outcome of Taiwanese pediatric patients with paraquat poisoning and compared these data with the published data on paraquat poisonings from other international poisoning centers. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on children with acute paraquat poisoning that were admitted to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital during a period of 10 years (2000-2010). Of the 193 paraquat poisoning patients, only 6 were children. Results: The mean age was 8.85±5.55 (1-15.6) years. Younger patients had accidentally swallowed paraquat, whereas older patients had intentionally ingested paraquat. Most patients were referred within a relatively short period (0.5-2.0 hours). Paraquat poisoning was associated with high morbidity and often resulted in severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure. The complications included shock (50.0%), hypoxemia (33.3%), respiratory failure (33.3%), nausea/vomiting (16.7%), abdominal pain (33.3%), hepatitis (66.7%), gastrointestinal tract bleeding (33.3%), acute renal failure (33.3%), and seizures (16.7%). Patients were treated aggressively with a standard detoxification protocol consisting of gastric lavage, active charcoal, charcoal hemoperfusion, and cyclophosphamide and steroid pulse therapies. Secondary bacterial infections were common after hospitalization and included sepsis (33.3%), pneumonia (33.3%), and urinary tract infection (50.0%). In the end, 2 patients (33.3%) died from multiple-organ failure, despite intensive resuscitation. Conclusions: Our data (mortality rate, 33.3%) are comparable to the data of other published reports from other international poison centers. Evidently, a prompt diagnosis of paraquat poisoning and an immediate institution of a detoxification protocol is a prerequisite for a favorable outcome.

AB  - Introduction: Organophosphates (OP) are commonly used pesticides in rural agricultural regions of Nepal and carbamates are popular household insecticides. Because of poor legislation these poisons are easily accessible and are the most popular suicidal poisons. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study done in poisoning cases admitted in PICU of Manipal Teaching Hospital (MTH) over a seven year period. Results: Out of 187 cases of poisoning, 30 (16.04%) were OPs and 4 (2.13%) were Carbamates. The male to female ratio was 56:44 and these poisonings were more common in rural areas (56%). Accidental poisoning (82.4%) was more common but suicidal attempts (17.6%) were also observed. Atropine and pralidoxime were used in 82.4% of the cases. The total atropinizing dose was 0.77±0.6 mg/kg and patients required 56.6±23.7 hours of atropinization. In our study 94.1% of the patients survived and none of them developed any sequel. Children developed muscarinic, nicotinic and CNS symptoms similar to adults. Complications were seen in 41.1% of the children and most common being seizure (85.7%). The most common OP observed in childhood poisoning was Metacid (methyl parathion) seen in 26.4% of the cases. Conclusion: OP and Carbamate poisonings are common in children. Possibility of self-harm poisoning in adolescent females cannot be ignored. Atropine is the mainstay of therapy after initial resuscitation and complications are common in children. With prompt treatment the outcome is good even with complications. The case fatality rate is much less as compared to adults.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that long-term dietary nitrate supplementation protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by improving ventricular function and reducing mitochondrial respiratory chain damage. Background: Doxorubicin is a powerful anthracycline antibiotic used to treat divergent human neoplasms. Its clinical use is limited because of severe cardiotoxic side effects. Dietary nitrate and nitrite are essential nutrients for maintenance of steady-state tissue levels of nitric oxide and may play a therapeutic role in diseases associated with nitric oxide insufficiency or dysregulation. Dietary nitrate and nitrite supplementation alleviates myocardial injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion and cardiac arrest-resuscitation. Methods: Adult male CF-1 mice were given a single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and left ventricular contractile function was assessed 5 days later using both echocardiography and pressure-volume Millar catheterization. A nitrate supplementation regimen (1 g/l sodium nitrate in drinking water) was started 7 days before doxorubicin injection and continued thereafter. Cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis, tissue lipid peroxidation, and plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were assessed. In addition, mitochondrial complex I activity, oxidative phosphorylation capacity, and hydrogen peroxide generation were determined in parallel experiments. Results: Doxorubicin caused impairment of ventricular contractility and cell death, which were significantly reduced by nitrate supplementation (p<0.05). These cardioprotective effects were associated with a significant decrease in tissue lipid peroxidation. Nitrate supplementation significantly preserved mitochondrial complex I activity and oxidative phosphorylation and attenuated hydrogen peroxide generation after doxorubicin treatment. Conclusions: Long-term oral intake of inorganic nitrate attenuates doxorubicin-induced ventricular dysfunction, cell death, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial respiratory chain damage. Nitrate could be a promising therapeutic agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Stem cells have been repeatedly suggested for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the low retention rate of single cell suspensions limits the efficacy of current therapy concepts so far. Taking advantage of three dimensional (3D) cellular self-assembly prior to transplantation may be beneficial to overcome these limitations. In this pilot study we investigate the principal feasibility of intramyocardial delivery of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D microtissues (3D-MTs) in a porcine model. 3D-MTs were generated from iron-oxide (MPIO) labeled human adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) using a modified hanging-drop method. Nine pigs (33±2 kg) comprising seven healthy ones and two with chronic MI in the left ventricle (LV) anterior wall were included. The pigs underwent intramyocardial transplantation of 16×103 3D-MTs (1250 cells/MT; accounting for 2×107 single ATMSCs) into the anterior wall of the healthy pigs (n=7)/the MI border zone of the infarcted (n=2) of the LV using a 3D NOGA electromechanical mapping guided, transcatheter based approach. Clinical follow-up (FU) was performed for up to five weeks and in-vivo cell-tracking was performed using serial magnet resonance imaging (MRI). Thereafter, the hearts were harvested and assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Intramyocardial transplantation of human ATMSC based 3D-MTs was successful in eight animals (88.8%) while one pig (without MI) died during the electromechanical mapping due to sudden cardiac-arrest. During FU, no arrhythmogenic, embolic or neurological events occurred in the treated pigs. Serial MRI confirmed the intramyocardial presence of the 3D-MTs by detection of the intracellular iron-oxide MPIOs during FU. Intramyocardial retention of 3D-MTs was confirmed by PCR analysis and was further verified on histology and immunohistochemical analysis. The 3D-MTs appeared to be viable, integrated and showed an intact micro architecture. We demonstrate the principal feasibility and safety of intramyocardial transplantation of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D-MTs. Multimodal cell-tracking strategies comprising advanced imaging and in-vitro tools allow for in-vivo monitoring and post-mortem analysis of transplanted 3D-MTs. The concept of 3D cellular self-assembly represents a promising application format as a next generation technology for cell-based myocardial regeneration.

AB  - A 78-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who had a history of alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis presented with a 5-week history of diarrhoea and mild right upper quadrant fullness [District of Columbia, USA]. In 1998, he had undergone a lateral side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy because of pancreatic pseudocyst. Over the 6 months preceding the current admission to the hospital, the patient had experienced an unintentional weight loss of 15 kg. At the time of hospital admission, he was afebrile and severely cachectic and he was noted to have advanced periodontal disease on physical examination. A computed tomography study of the abdomen revealed multiple liver masses measuring 1.5-5.0 cm in diameter, the largest of which was in the right lobe of the liver. A fine needle aspiration of this lesion was performed. Two days later, the patient suddenly became unresponsive and hypotensive, and resuscitation measures were unsuccessful. An anaerobic blood culture specimen collected during hospitalization was positive for Bacteroides species. The patient was diagnosed to have primary hepatic actinomycosis with Bacteroides coinfection. The diagnosis was established after aspiration of the hepatic mass. Although treatment with intravenous ampicillin was promptly initiated, this severely debilitated individual did not survive. At postmortem examination, multiple circumscribed masses that measured 1-6.5 cm in diameter, as well as smaller purulent collections, were evident. A large paracholedichal abscess was also present. On microscopic examination, filamentous Gram positive bacteria were present in the abscess tissue, consistent with Actinomyces infection.

AB  - Objective: To analyze whether the use of a hyaluronan-enriched transfer medium (HETM) increases rates of implantation (IRs) and clinical pregnancy (CPRs), compared with the use of a conventional transfer medium after day 3 and day 5 embryo transfers. Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial. Setting: An assisted reproduction program in a private tertiary-care hospital in Turkey. Patient(s): A total of 1,282 consecutive fresh embryo transfer cycles (825 day 3 and 457 day 5) were randomly allocated into two groups. In 639 women, ET was effected with HETM, and in 643, it was effected with a conventional embryo transfer medium. Intervention(s): Embryo transfer using HETM or conventional embryo transfer medium. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical pregnancy rates and IRs were compared with regard to day of embryo transfer, women's age, quality of the transferred embryos, and presence of previous implantation failures. Result(s): Overall CPRs and IRs significantly increased with the use of HETM (CPR: 54.6% vs. 48.5%, odds ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.59; IR: 32% vs. 25%, odds ratio: 1.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.66, for HETM and control groups, respectively). The number needed to treat (NNT) for one additional pregnancy with routine use of HETM was 17. The beneficial effect was more prominent in women who were >35 years of age (NNT=7), in women who had previous failed cycles (NNT=7), and in women who had poor-quality embryos (NNT=8). Conclusion(s): The enrichment of transfer medium with hyaluronan increases CPRs and IRs, both for day 3 and day 5 embryo transfers. The beneficial effect was most evident in women who were >35 years of age, in women who had only poor-quality embryos available for transfer, and in women who had previous implantation failures.

AB  - Background: Failure to use the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in patients with acute pancreatitis may exacerbate the stress response and disease severity, leading to greater incidence of complications and prolonged hospitalization. The objectives of this study were to determine the optimum route for nutrition support, whether nutrition therapy is better than no artificial nutrition support, whether specific additives to enteral or parenteral therapy can further enhance their efficacy, and whether methodologic differences in delivery of enteral nutrition (EN) influence tolerance. Methods: A computerized search was performed of MEDLINE, Cochrane database, EMBASE, and reference lists of pertinent review articles for prospective randomized trials in adult patients with acute pancreatitis that evaluated interventions with nutrition therapy. Primary outcome data and surrogate endpoint parameters (for nutrition indices, stress markers, and measures of the inflammatory/immune response) were extracted in duplicate independently. Where appropriate, meta-analysis was performed by random-effects model. Results: From 119 articles screened, 27 randomized controlled trials were included and analyzed. In patients admitted for acute pancreatitis, meta-analysis of 7 trials showed that use of EN was associated with a significant reduction in infectious morbidity (risk ratio [RR]=0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.74; p=.001) and hospital length of stay (LOS; weighted mean difference [WMD]=-3.94; 95% CI, -5.86 to -2.02; p<.0001), a trend toward reduced organ failure (RR=0.59; 95% CI, 0.28-1.27; p=.18), with no effect on mortality (RR=0.88; 95% CI, 0.43-1.79; p=.72) when compared with use of parenteral nutrition (PN). Results from individual studies suggest that EN in comparison to PN reduces oxidative stress, hastens resolution of the disease process, and costs less. Insufficient data exist to determine whether EN improves outcome over standard therapy (no artificial nutrition support) in patients admitted for acute pancreatitis. However, in those patients requiring surgery for complications of acute pancreatitis, meta-analysis of 2 trials indicates that provision of EN postoperatively may reduce mortality (RR=0.26; 95% CI, 0.06-1.09; p=.06) compared with standard therapy. PN provided early within 24 hours of admission was shown to worsen outcome, whereas PN provided later after full-volume resuscitation appeared to improve outcome when compared with standard therapy. In early individual studies, specific supplements added to EN, such as arginine, glutamine, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and probiotics, may be associated with a positive impact on patient outcome in acute pancreatitis, compared with EN alone without the supplements, but studies are too few to make strong treatment recommendations. Supplementation of PN with parenteral glutamine was shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve patient outcome (reduced duration of nutrition therapy and decreased hospital LOS) compared with PN alone in patients with acute pancreatitis. A wide range of tolerance to EN exists, irrespective of known influences such as mode (continuous vs bolus) and level of infusion within the GI tract (gastric vs postpyloric). Conclusions: Patients with acute severe pancreatitis should begin EN early because such therapy modulates the stress response, promotes more rapid resolution of the disease process, and results in better outcome. In this sense, EN is the preferred route and has eclipsed PN as the new "gold standard" of nutrition therapy. When PN is used, it should be initiated after 5 days. The favorable effect of both EN and PN on patient outcome may be further enhanced by supplementation with modulators of inflammation and systemic immunity. Individual variability allows for a wide range of tolerance to EN, even in severe pancreatitis.

AB  - A field study on fever of unknown origin in horses was undertaken. Routine laboratory parameters were analysed concerning their usefulness in aetiolological diagnosis. The C-reactive protein (CPR), neopterin and anti-endotoxin antibodies were included in the diagnostic profile. These investigations were based on the hypothesis that endotoxins might be of aetiological relevance due to their fever-evoking potential. Within 3 years, a total of 383 horses with fever were investigated and categorized into 4 different types of fever. Group I (fever of unknown origin) included all horses for which no reason for the fever could be identified during the initial and follow up examinations. A blood sample was taken during the initial examination. An ELISA was used to determine the CRP, neopterin and anti-endotoxin antibodies. The results were investigated for correlations with other clinico-chemical parameters. Fever of unknown origin was diagnosed in 195 horses (50.9%), and thus was the most frequently diagnosed fever type. The mean of CRP was within the reference range (8.08 µg/litre), whereas the mean of neopterin increased (7.29 mmol/litre). A pathological increase was observed for IgM antibodies (anti-lipid A-IgM: 1.18 OD and anti-endotoxin-IgM: 1.5 OD). The pyrogenic potential of endotoxins should be considered for the differential diagnosis in horses with fever of unknown origin. An extended clinico-chemical profile might be useful following the exclusion of other aetiological reasons. CRP and neopterin were unspecific parameters, which in conjunction with other findings might be of benefit for the evaluation of the health status in horses.

AB  - This document contains six chapters. The first chapter contains the executive summary of the document. The second chapter introduces the concept and development of the Essential Trauma Care Project and outlines the current disparities in outcome between persons injured in high-income countries and those injured in low- and middle-income countries. It reviews some of the difficulties facing trauma care in developing countries and the foundations on which to build efforts to improve trauma treatment services. It summarizes the process by which this document was developed and written and addresses the overlap between the EsTC Project and other international health activities, including WHO activities. The third chapter contains a list of those services which the authors feel are essential for the prevention of death and disability in injured patients. The fourth chapter outlines the resources that are essential to the provision of essential trauma services. The fifth chapter provides a summary resource matrix for each of the 14 categories of trauma care (management of respiratory distress, management of shock, management of head injury, management of neck injury, management of chest injury, management of abdominal injury, management of extremity injury, management of spinal injury, management of burns and wounds, rehabilitation, pain control and medicines, diagnosis and monitoring, safety for health care personnel and special considerations for the care of injured children). The last chapter reviews some of the methods that could be utilized to promote the implementation of services for essential trauma care (training for trauma care, performance improvement, organization of the initial resuscitation, hospital inspection, integration of systems for trauma management, and interaction and coordination of stakeholders).

AB  - Organophosphate poisoning is associated with a high mortality rate due to respiratory failure, dysrhythmias, and multi-organ failure. We report two cases of survival after "in-the field" antidote treatment of very severe organophosphate poisonings. Two patients orally ingested large amounts of the organophosphorous agent oxydemeton-methyl in suicide attempts, resulting in the hypercholinergic syndrome in both. Resuscitation included early administration of antidote by emergency medical personnel as well as high-dose atropine. Plasma levels of pseudo cholinesterase were initially very low in both patients. Long-term mechanical ventilation was necessary, and both patients developed aspiration pneumonia. At discharge, no major neurological deficits were present. Prompt antidote treatment and aggressive supportive emergency and intensive care unit therapy contribute to improved survival after acute organophosphate poisoning. We believe that in cases of mass poisonings - for example, terrorist activity - therapy must be available on the scene as soon as possible. This also may require decentralized antidote storage.

AB  - The provision of adequate nutrition support for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a clinical challenge for decades. The primary and secondary injuries create unique metabolic derangements along with accompanying issues such as optimal timing and route of nutrition, appropriate fluid and electrolytes, drug administration, rehabilitation, and dysphagia. Enteral nutrition is clearly established as the preferential route of nutrition support for this population vs parenteral nutrition. There appears to be a consensus on early initiation of enteral nutrition, but less definitive are recommendations on advancement timing and formula components. Nutrition therapies should include exact fluid resuscitation goals specific for TBI and strict electrolyte monitoring to avoid extreme fluid, electrolyte, or glucose shifts that could be detrimental to the patient. While the critical care patient often tolerates small bowel feeding, the long-term rehabilitation patient should transition to and tolerate gastric feeding. Drug-nutrient and adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea should be routinely evaluated in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Monitoring for dysphagia is critical to avoid the costly negative aspects associated with aspiration and to capitalize on quality of life and appropriate oral nutrition. Emphasizing the priority of early nutrition support within a multi-disciplinary team may be the critical key for successful provision and tolerance of nutrition support in the TBI population.

AB  - A fatal case of imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria is reported in a 57-year-old man from Germany who had recently travelled to Kenya on vacation. Due to concern about side effects, the patient had not taken any malaria prophylaxis. Ten days before admission he developed a low grade temperature and suffered from pain in the limbs, nausea and vomiting. An episode of tachyarrhythmia was diagnosed 2 days before admission and was treated by his general practitioner. He was admitted to hospital with a high temperature, chills and progressive clinical deterioration. P. falciparum was identified in blood smears and confirmed immunologically; parasitaemia was ∼30%. Due to fulminant clinical and neurological deterioration with progressive hypoxaemia, the patient required ventilator therapy 1 h after admission. Quinine and doxycycline therapy was initiated and exchange transfusion was considered. However, due to hyperkalaemia and cardiac arrest, the patient died 4 h after admission. Autopsy revealed prominent congestion of liver, spleen and cerebral vessels as well as subdural and subarachnoidal haemorrhage.

AB  - An observational study was carried out at Kuala Lumpur Maternity Hospital in Malaysia during 1 May-31 July 1996 and 10 August-24 November 1997 to determine the risk factors associated with feed intolerance in very low birthweight (VLBW, <1501 g) infants given intermittent 3-hourly enteral feeds within 72 h after birth. Feed intolerance developed in 85 (64.4%) of 132 infants. Logistic regression analysis showed that the only significant risk factor associated with feed intolerance was the age when the first feed was commenced. For each hour delay in the age of the infants when the first feed was given, the adjusted odds ratios of feed intolerance was 1.03 (95% confidence intervals: 1.01-1.05; P=0.01). Other factors (modes of delivery, Apgar score at 1 min, sex, ethnicity, history of resuscitation at birth, birthweight, gestation, multiple pregnancy, perinatal asphyxia, types of milk, hypothermia before first feed, hypotension before first feed, respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, septicaemia, theophylline therapy, indomethacin therapy, ventilatory support, continuous positive airway pressure, umbilical catheterization, and surfactant therapy) were not significantly associated with feed intolerance. Our study suggests that to promote tolerance of enteral feeds in VLBW infants, intermittent orogastric feeds should be commenced as soon as possible during the first 72 h of life.

AB  - Intestinal obstruction due to heavy infestation with Ascaris lumbricoides is reviewed, based on 92 patients (76 children and 16 adults) from Maharashtra State, India. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those with subacute intestinal obstruction (68) who were treated conservatively with resuscitation, antibiotics and anthelmintics; and patients with acute obstruction (24) who were treated surgically. Abdominal radiography was carried out on all the patients and abdominal ultrasonography was performed on 22 of them. There were no deaths in the first group and the length of stay in hospital ranged from 4 to 7 days. Five of the 24 patients in the second group died during resuscitation. After resuscitation, 19 had a laparotomy: 6 needed resection of gangrenous bowel with primary anastomosis; in 11 an enterotomy was used to remove obstructing worms; and in 2 patients obstructing worms were "milked" into the colon. Seven patients died after the operation and the overall mortality rate in this group of patients with acute obstruction was 50% (12 of 24). Using ultrasound, diagnostic features of ascariasis were the "railway track" and "bull's eye" signs, and ultrasonography recognized strangulation in 5 patients. Early diagnosis supported by ultrasonography, together with prompt surgery when necessary, might reduce the mortality rate of this condition.

She went into spontaneous labour and delivered a deeply asphyxiated 3 kg baby. The infant showed signs of both nicotinic and muscarinic poisoning, probably the combined effects of carbamate and atropine received through the placenta. Attempts at resuscitation looked promising at first but the baby never became conscious and died, in spite of assisted respiration, 64 hours after birth. newline˜L.G. Goodwin.

AB  - Neonatal mortality was reviewed in the special-care baby unit of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital from January 1984 to December 1987. During this 4-year period 1509 singleton neonates were admitted and 161 multiple births. The singleton neonates only were reviewed for weight-specific mortality ratio by year and by specific morbidity. There was a significant reduction in mortality over the 4-year period in the birthweight groups 1000-1499 g and 1500-2499 g thought to be due to the more prompt and effective treatment of infections particularly septicaemia. There was an unacceptably high mortality in the birthweight group ≥2500 g (between 4% and 7%) which the authors thought was due to the high rate of asphyxia among these infants admitted to the Unit as compared to other centres in Nigeria. The dominant problems identified were low birthweight and asphyxia. The authors conclude that in the prevailing economic situation in Nigeria efforts to reduce the number of low birthweight infants, better supervision of mothers in labour, more prompt resuscitation of the newborn, prevention of infection, and improvement in the quality of nursing care would pay the greatest dividends and were aims within reach of the Unit and other special care baby units in Third-World countries. [The mortality rate of very low birthweight infants (<1500 g; 54.1% of 61 admissions in 1986 and 1987) compares very favourably with that reported by N.Y. Boo from Malaysia (see the abstract below): 59.6% of 329 admissions.].newline˜J.P. Stanfield

AB  - This report by the Deputy Minister of Health of the [former] USSR outlines some of the the difficulties facing the government in its attempts to develop public health and reconstruct health services in the period up to the year 2000. The report stresses difficulties in ensuring priority to paediatric and obstetric care in the allocation of funds, and particularly the difficulty of directing resources towards specific needs such as family planning and antenatal care. The objective of realizing a unified, geographically organized health service, not divided along departmental lines, is being delayed, so that there is a good deal of overlap and duplication of the existing adult health services. He also refers to a lack of modern maternity hospital facilities and a shortage of drugs.<br />Measures being taken include the reform of financing of maternity and neonatal care, increased funding of food in maternity hospitals, some expansion of the list of diseases which qualify for free drugs, construction of more laboratory facilities for medical tests, and more investment in resuscitation equipment, incubators and rehydration equipment for obstetric and paediatric services.<br />In terms of outcome indicators for child health, the paper notes a reduction in the infant mortality between 1988 and 1989 from 24.7 first year deaths per 1000 live births to 22.3. Maternal mortality is high at 43/100 000 newborn and underregistration of maternal deaths probably means that this is an underestimate of the true rate. The perinatal motality rate is also high at 17.3/1000 live and still births in 1988. Over half of perinatal losses are of full-term neonates. There are high rates of unplanned pregnancy and induced abortions. Only 13.5% of women use effective modern contraceptive methods. The paper records over 2000 abortion-related deaths of which over three quarters were due to complications of abortions performed outside hospitals.<br />The paper concludes by commenting on the need to address the lack of family planning services, the need to create a contraceptive industry in the USSR, and the problem of tackling the considerable geographical inequalities in child health in the USSR, especially the poorer health status of rural populations.newline˜Sarah Curtis

AB  - Common property resources (CPRs) still contribute greatly to the natural resources of villages throughout the developing world. Unfortunately, rural development programmes have ignored CPRs and aided their decline. This paper argues that policy makers should make CPRs an important component of rural development, especially in such areas as India's dry region. It shows that CPRs contribute to people's sustenance, stabilize the environment, and strengthen private farming systems. It explains why relatively poor households rely on CPRs, which provide essential fuel supplies and fodder. It also sees how CPRs aid product collection and provide employment and income, especially when other opportunities are not available. Despite these contributions, CPRs have undergone serious decline. The study examines the state policies, rural development practices, and other factors that have hampered CPRs. It describes the long-term implications of the decline for the environment and for private farming. The paper highlights the contributions CPRs have made and provides a policy framework for promoting them. This framework calls for public policies to protect CPR areas, better management of CPRs based on successful cases, and technological support and sufficient investment to raise CPR productivity.
