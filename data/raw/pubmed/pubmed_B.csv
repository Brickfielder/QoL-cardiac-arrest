41696527,10.1016/j.resplu.2025.101200,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Qatar: epidemiology, management, and outcomes from a national registry study.","BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a major global health challenge with persistently low survival rates despite advances in resuscitation science. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of OHCA in Qatar using a national registry aligned with Utstein reporting standards.
METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted across Qatar, enrolling all adult patients (≥18 years) with non-traumatic OHCA in whom resuscitation was attempted by the national EMS provider. Data were collected from EMS records, hospital EMRs, and mortuary databases. Survivors were followed up at 30 days and 12 months for neurological and quality-of-life outcomes. The primary outcome was 30-day survival with a favourable neurological status (CPC 1-2).
RESULTS: Among 1238 OHCA cases, the median age was 52 years, and 80.5 % were male. Arrests occurred predominantly at home (64.0 %), with 61.8 % witnessed and 42.4 % receiving bystander CPR. Initial shockable rhythms were present in 29.7 %. ROSC was achieved in 44.8 %, survival to discharge was 17.8 %, and a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days was 13.5 %. Multivariable analysis identified witnessed arrest, prehospital defibrillation, and coronary reperfusion within 24 h as independent predictors of survival. The Utstein comparator group demonstrated a survival rate of 38.2 % and CPC 1-2 outcome in 32.8 % of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: OHCA outcomes in Qatar have improved markedly, with survival and CPC 1-2 rates more than doubling compared with prior national estimates. Survival now approaches levels seen in high-performing international systems, although within a younger patient population. Consistent predictors of outcome-including witnessed arrest, early defibrillation, and timely coronary reperfusion-emphasise the critical targets for strengthening OHCA systems of care.",Resuscitation plus,2026,Yigit Y | Cameron PA | Al Suwaidi J | Al Shaikh L | Hassan IF | Asaad N | Castle N | Howard IL | Arabi A | Jabeen A | Edmund Harris TR,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,false,true
41674709,10.1016/j.resplu.2026.101235,CARDIS (Cardiac ARrest DIgital Support): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a web-based support intervention for cardiac arrest survivors.,"BACKGROUND: Surviving sudden cardiac arrest often lead to long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. Although clinical guidelines recommend structured post-cardiac arrest follow-up, such follow-up is often lacking or inconsistent. Tailored digital interventions are scarce but may help address gaps in follow-up resources. The CARDIS trial evaluates the effects on patient-reported outcome measures of a co-created, web-based support programme designed to improve wellbeing, self management, and reintegration into everyday life for cardiac arrest survivors.
METHODS: CARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling cardiac arrest survivors aged >18 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard post-cardiac arrest care, including a routine followup visit with screening and management of cognitive, physical and emotional health, as well as a printed booklet. The intervention group will additionally receive access to a webbased selfguided support programme for 3 months. After study completion, control participants will be offered the programme.
OUTCOMES: Primary outcome is overall wellbeing and health (QWB) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported cognitive problems, HRQoL, life satisfaction, symptoms of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. A process evaluation will evaluate social selection bias, adherence and participants experiences.
DISCUSSION: The CARDIS trial will investigate the use of more accessible and standardised follow-up pathways by complementing existing care structures, thereby enhancing equity in long-term recovery and quality-of-life without requiring additional healthcare resources. The process evaluation will provide data on adherence, social selection, and engagement, essential for future implementation.Trial registration: The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07240714).",Resuscitation plus,2026,Waldemar A | Israelsson J | Heimburg K | Blennow Nordström E | Nordberg P | Bremer A | Årestedt K | Thylén I,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
41552630,10.1016/j.resplu.2025.101209,Assessing adult attachment after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an exploratory analysis and construct validation of the ECR-RS.,"AIM: To explore the construct validity of the 'Experience in Close Relationships - Relationship Structures'-questionnaire (ECR-RS) in a population of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Objectives were to (i) describe item- and scale-level response patterns, and (ii) evaluate the preliminary construct validity of the ECR-RS, including its dimensional (structural), known-groups, and convergent validity.
METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional validation study, with OHCA survivors completing the ECR-RS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the mental health component from the Short Form-12 (SF-12 MCS) three months post- arrest. Descriptive statistics and floor/ceiling analyses were performed. Dimensional validity was assessed using response distribution patterns and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by reliability using Cronbach's άs. Known-group validity was tested using a priori hypotheses, Spearman's correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Convergent validity was evaluated by correlating ECR-RS total scores with HADS and SF-12 MCS.
RESULTS: Among 123 survivors (median age 59.9 years, 84 % male), ECR-RS total scores were low on both subscales and floor effects were observed at scale level (31 % for avoidant and 72 % for anxious attachment). EFA supported the expected two-factor structure, though item 4-6 showed poor loadings/cross-loadings. Internal consistency was acceptable (total scale Cronbach's α = 0.88) and improved when problematic items were excluded. Known-group hypotheses were not supported. Anxious attachment correlated moderately with symptoms of anxiety and depression and was inversely correlated with mental health scores.
CONCLUSION: The ECR-RS demonstrated partial construct validity among OHCA survivors, but item-level inconsistencies and pronounced floor effects limit its utility. Findings highlight the need for a revised instrument better suited to post-cardiac arrest relational and psychological dynamics.",Resuscitation plus,2026,Hansen N | von Tangen Gehrt Sivertsen C | Stenbæk DS | Blakoe M | Dichman C | Winkel BG | Wieghorst A | Borregaard B | Wagner MK,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,false,true
41499113,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.52832,Health-Related Quality of Life and Long-Term Survival After Cardiac Arrest.,"IMPORTANCE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) follow-up can increase knowledge of cardiac arrest outcomes from the patient's perspective. Whether HRQOL affects long-term survival is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether HRQOL 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is associated with long-term survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study linked 5 national registers with nationwide coverage in Sweden across a 7-year period and included survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, with follow-up through June 30, 2021. Participants were adults surviving at least 90 days after IHCA or OHCA who completed follow-up EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaires. Analyses were performed December 2 to 20, 2024.
EXPOSURES: EQ-5D-5L level sum score (LSS; sum of EQ-5D-5L dimensions, ranging from 5 [no problems] to 25 [extreme problems in all dimensions]), and the visual analog scale EQ VAS, 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Long-term survival up to a maximum of 7 years among patients surviving IHCA and OHCA.
RESULTS: In total, 2000 survivors of IHCA (median [IQR] age, 73 [65-80] years, 66% male) and 1108 survivors of OHCA (median [IQR] age, 69 [59-75] years, 77% male) were included. There were 475 deaths among patients with IHCA and 132 deaths among patients with OHCA. For patients with IHCA, the LSS distribution was 394 (20%) for LSS 5, 1034 (52%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 572 (29%) for LSS 11 to 25. For patients with OHCA, the LSS distribution was 299 (27%) for LSS 5, 637 (58%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 168 (15%) for LSS 11 to 25. In the IHCA population, LSS 11 to 25 had higher hazard of death compared with LSS 5 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.50 [95% CI, 1.82-3.43]), whereas LSS 6 to 10 did not (AHR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.88-1.65]). In OHCA, no associations were found between LSS categories and long-term survival (LSS 11-25 vs LSS 5: AHR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.83-2.42]; LSS 6-10 vs LSS 5: AHR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.56-1.39]). In both IHCA and OHCA, spline modeling using LSS and EQ VAS as continuous variables showed significant increases in hazards of death with poorer HRQOL, although the estimates in the OHCA population showed greater uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients who survived beyond 90 days after IHCA or OHCA, poorer HRQOL reported with EQ-5D-5L scores 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest was associated with reduced long-term survival in both groups, with greater uncertainty for OHCA estimates.

There is limited understanding of OHCA-related sequelae and their impact on co-survivors. This study describes the 3-month post-discharge health outcomes among OHCA survivors and co-survivors in the Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS).
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study, enrolling subjects from 1 February 2023 to 30 November 2024. Physical, psychological, cognitive, and social health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and caregiver burden were described separately for survivors and co-survivors. HRQoL of survivors and co-survivors was compared against age-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted Singapore population norm for EQ-5D-5L.
RESULTS: 62 survivors and 36 co-survivors completed 3-month assessments. 9.7 %, 6.5 %, 3.6 % of survivors screened positive for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Survivors experienced mild cognitive impairment (43.1 %), impaired mobility (41.1 %), and weak muscle strength (39.7 %). Functional independence was high, and 73.9 % of survivors returned to employment. Survivors' HRQoL was lower compared to the general population (0.90 vs. 0.96). Co-survivors reported experiencing caregiving burden (41.7 %), with 22.2 %, 11.1 % and 6.1 % screening positive for anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. Co-survivors' HRQoL was comparable to the general population (0.94 vs. 0.94).
CONCLUSION: A significant subset of OHCA survivors experienced limitations in physical and cognitive functioning and return to work, and lower HRQoL. Psychological distress and caregiving burden were high among co-survivors. Our findings underscore the importance of systematic assessments of multi-dimensional aspects of health and referral to multi-component rehabilitation for both survivors and co-survivors.",Resuscitation plus,2026,Pek PP | Fang K | Lim SL | Rubillar Uy FM | Ho VK | Chia YW | Chua JM | Goh EL | Liew LX | Chen C | Luo N | Lee KY | Gan HN | Leong BS | Mao DR | Doctor NE | Ng WM | Oh YZ | Peck KH | Chia MY | Tay WL | Low SY | Ong MEH | Ho AF,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

This research aims to examine both the short- and long-term results of all adult ECMO-cases at our centre, including health-related quality of life (HrQoL), return to work status and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
METHODS: A retrospective study including all adult patients treated with ECMO in a single university cardiothoracic centre in Iceland between 2002 and 2022. Five-year survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier estimates, HrQoL with the EQ-5D-5 L instrument and PTSD with the LEC and PLC-5 check lists assessing traumatic life events and PTSD symptoms, respectively. Median follow-up time was 6.5 yrs.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients received ECMO during the study period, an average of 5.2 patients per year since 2006. Sixty-six patients received venoarterial (VA) ECMO, of whom 28 (42%) could be weaned and 21 (32%) survived to discharge. Twenty-seven patients received venovenous (VV) ECMO, with 18 (67%) surviving to discharge. Twenty-four out of 30 living patients completed follow-up questionnaires. No problems with an EQ-5D-5L domain was reported 21 times in the VA ECMO group and 33 times in the VV ECMO group. Three out of four patients reported problems with anxiety or depression. Six patients (25%) met screening criteria for PTSD. At the end of follow-up, 2/12 VA ECMO and 8/12 VV ECMO patients had returned to work .
CONCLUSIONS: ECMO treatment can be provided with acceptable short- and long-term mortality in a low-volume centre. Nonetheless, opportunities for improvement could be identified, particularly regarding VA ECMO in cardiac arrest. At long-term follow-up, problems with anxiety and/or depression were most commonly observed and 25% met screening criteria for PTSD.

41243837,10.1111/nicc.70224,Iranian Critical Care Nurses' Experiences With Slow Codes in the Absence of Formal 'Do-Not-Resuscitate' Orders: A Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death remains a critical global health issue, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation serving as a vital life-saving intervention. However, ethical dilemmas emerge when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely to benefit the patient, particularly in settings lacking formal Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. This situation often leads to ambiguous practices such as 'slow codes', raising complex challenges for critical care nurses involved in end-of-life decision-making.
AIM: This study aims to explore the experiences of Iranian critical care nurses with slow code practices in the absence of formal Do-Not-Resuscitate orders.
STUDY DESIGN: This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled nurses from diverse intensive care units (medical, pulmonary, poisoning, surgical and cardiac) across three teaching hospitals. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework.
RESULTS: Sixteen participants took part in the study. They had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD = 5.9) and professional experience ranging from 6 to 23 years (M = 13 years), with 2-15 years in intensive care (M = 8.5 years). Most were female (75%), married (75%) and held a bachelor's degree (68.8%). Six key themes emerged influencing slow code practices: fear of litigation and criticism, stretching and buying time, post-resuscitation care and quality of life, opportunities for gaining resuscitation expertise, emotional struggles and moral disengagement. These findings highlight the complex ethical and practical dilemmas nurses face, where legal ambiguities and resource constraints significantly affect end-of-life care decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurses often initiate slow codes due to fear of litigation and the desire to support families, while confronting moral dilemmas and concerns about patient outcomes. These findings highlight the urgent need for formal legal frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders and enhanced nurse training to effectively address the ethical complexities of end-of-life care.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Resuscitation decisions must align with updated clinical guidelines, underscoring the need for formal national and local frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders in Iran. Legislation that reduces nurses' fear of litigation is essential to promote confident, ethically grounded decision-making. Furthermore, enhancing healthcare professionals' communication skills is critical to improving patients' and families' understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",Nursing in critical care,2025,Moghbeli G | Roshangar F | Soheili A | Ahmadi F | Feizollahzadeh H | Hassankhani H,Journal Article,"Humans | Qualitative Research | Resuscitation Orders | Female | Iran | Male | Adult | Critical Care Nursing | Attitude of Health Personnel | Decision Making | Nursing Staff, Hospital | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Middle Aged | Interviews as Topic",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
41231072,10.1097/ccm.0000000000006933,Association of Sepsis Survivor Subtypes With Long-Term Mortality and Disability After Discharge: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVES: Determine if previously described sepsis survivor subtypes can be applied outside of their derivation cohort using a parsimonious algorithm. Test the association between subtype and the primary outcome of 3-month mortality, and secondary outcomes of readmission, physical function, and health-related quality of life through 1 year of follow-up.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Participants enrolled in the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial, a multisite trial in the United States that enrolled patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.
PATIENTS: All participants who were alive on day 28 after enrollment and had nonmissing data for outcome and subtype-defining variables (Charlson Comorbidity Index, length of stay, discharge destination). Participants were retrospectively assigned at time of discharge to one of five previously derived survivor subtypes: low risk, healthy with severe disease, multimorbidity, low functional status, and unhealthy baseline with severe disease.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1563 participants, 1368 were eligible and assigned a subtype. Three-month mortality was 13.1% and varied significantly between subtypes (5.1-45.5%; p < 0.001). In age-adjusted logistic regression, odds ratios for 3-month mortality were 11.1 in the low functional status and 9.7 in the unhealthy baseline with severe illness subtypes, compared with the low-risk subtype ( p < 0.001). Participant subtype was a significant predictor of 6- and 12-month EuroQol 5D five level score and limitations in activities of daily living, but not readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis survivor subtypes that are readily identifiable at hospital discharge are significantly associated with mortality at 3 months, and patient-important outcomes through 12 months.

41212202,10.1007/s00134-025-08185-5,"Impact of frailty on mortality, functional outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: insights from the TTM2-trial.","PURPOSE: To explore the association of frailty with mortality, functional outcome, and health status after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: This is a cohort-based secondary analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial, an international, prospective, multicentre study. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (1-9): fit (1-3), prefrail (4), frail (5), and severely frail (6-9). Main outcomes were mortality and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 6 and 24 months. Additional outcomes included neuroprognostication, withdrawal-of-life-sustaining-therapies (WLST), functional decline (retrospectively reported pre-arrest versus 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score), health status (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and life satisfaction at 6 and 24 months.
RESULTS: Of 1861 participants, 240 (13%) were prefrail, and 188 (10%) were frail or severely frail. Mortality and poor functional outcome increased significantly with greater frailty. Compared to fit participants, adjusted ORs (95% CI) for 6 month mortality were: prefrail 2.7 (1.8-3.8), frail 3.7 (1.9-7.1), and severely frail 8.9 (4.2-18.7); and poor functional outcome: prefrail 2.9 (1.9-4.2), frail 3.9 (1.9-8.1), and severely frail 35.4 (8.4-148.8). Severely frail participants underwent neuroprognostication less often (p < 0.001), while WLST was more common in the prefrail, frail and severely frail (p < 0.001). Prefrail and frail survivors tended to report more frequent functional decline and lower health status, though with individual variation.
CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Findings suggest more frequent functional decline and lower overall health status in frail survivors.

Our objective was to assess the association of neurologic complications with death and new disability at 6 months.
DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, observational study.
SETTING: Thirty ECMO centers in Australia and New Zealand between February 2019 and December 2022.
SUBJECTS: seven hundred four adult patients admitted to the ICU on venoarterial ECMO other than for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were divided according to whether they experienced neurologic complications. Neurologic complications include diffuse cerebral ischemia, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain death. The primary outcome was a composite of death or new disability at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included disability measured by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule and quality of life measured with EuroQoL 5D five levels. The median age of patients was 54.5 years (42-64 yr) and 259 (36.8%) were female. The primary outcome was available for 613 of 706 patients (86.2%). Of these, 425 patients (69.3%) had either died or had new disability at 6 months. Neurologic events occurred in 85 patients (12%). Patients who experienced neurologic complications were at increased risk of death or new disability (risk difference [RD], 17.28% [6.44-25.92%]). This was primarily due to an increased risk of mortality RD, 23.75 (12.06-34.75) rather than new disability (RD, -11.90% [-30.58% to 13.56%]). These findings were consistent across types of complications and after adjustment for confounders. Patients with neurologic complications more commonly had ECMO discontinued due to a perceived poor prognosis (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.35-24.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications during ECMO increased the risk of death and disability at 6 months, primarily driven by increased death at 6 months. Prevention of these complications and development of better prognostic tools for functional outcomes should be prioritized.",Critical care medicine,2026,Brown A | Dennis M | Rattan N | Nanjayya V | Burrell A | Serpa Neto A | Hodgson C | EXCEL (a Comprehensive Binational Registry on the Treatment and Outcomes of Patients Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation [ECMO]) Study Investigators and the International ECMO Network,Journal Article | Observational Study | Multicenter Study,Humans | Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Female | Male | Middle Aged | Adult | Prospective Studies | Nervous System Diseases | Australia | Quality of Life | Intensive Care Units,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
41141170,10.7759/cureus.92913,Management of Chronic Uncontrolled Diabetes With Ketoacidosis and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to pose a significant global health burden. Acute complications of diabetes are life-threatening conditions: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). DKA predominantly affects young and type 1 diabetic patients. It is characterized by metabolic acidosis and ketonemia. Older patients with type 2 diabetes are at a greater risk of developing HHS, which is marked by profound hyperglycaemia and hyperosmolarity without significant ketoacidosis. This review highlights the integrative approach needed for effective management. Since both conditions share certain common features, it is important to distinguish between them and initiate appropriate treatment, including prompt fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte correction. Identification and treatment of precipitating factors is vital. Post-acute care strategies include medical stabilization as well as long-term behavioral modifications, like structured diabetes education, psychosocial support, and implementation of technology-driven interventions (continuous glucose monitoring and telemedicine) to reduce recurrence. HHS has up to 20% higher mortality due to delayed diagnosis and comorbidities, while DKA's acute fatality remains comparatively lower at 1-5%. Therefore, early identification, aggressive management, and coordinated long-term follow-up are essential.

DESIGN: A prospective multicenter observational cohort follow-up study.
SETTING: ICUs of ten ECMO centers in the Netherlands, representing more than 90% of all patients supported with ECMO in the Netherlands.
PATIENTS: Patients supported with ECMO between August 2017 and July 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survival was assessed by consulting the Dutch municipal records database. All 5-year survivors received a questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the standardized EuroQol 5D Five Levels instrument, and occupational status was assessed using the standardized Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Productivity Cost Questionnaire. Of the initial 428 participants, 230 (54%) survived the hospital admission, 213 (50%) survived the first year, and 155 (36%) survived 5 years. Five-year survival rates were 42% for patients receiving ECMO for respiratory support, 39% for cardiac support, and 25% for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The response rate to the questionnaire was 72%. HRQoL was rated satisfactory at 5 years, with a median EuroQol index of 0.82 (interquartile range, 0.73-0.98). Five-year survivors reported slight-to-moderate impairment of mobility (39%), impairment of usual activities (44%), and pain or discomfort (60%). After 5 years, the majority of patients were either employed (41%), retired (31%), or permanently declared unfit for work (26%).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcome in patients supported with ECMO is good.

Achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) represents merely the initial step in the extensive rehabilitation journey. This review highlights the critical role of structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation following ROSC, emphasizing the necessity of integrated physiotherapy, neurocognitive therapy, and psychosocial support to enhance quality of life and societal reintegration in survivors. Methods: This narrative review analyzed peer-reviewed literature from 2020-2025, sourced from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Emphasis was on clinical trials, expert guidelines (e.g., European Resuscitation Council 2021, American Heart Association 2020), and high-impact journals, with systematic thematic analysis across rehabilitation phases. Results: The review confirms rehabilitation as essential in addressing Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness, cognitive impairment, and post-intensive care syndrome. Early rehabilitation (0-7 days post-ROSC), focusing on parameter-guided mobilization and cognitive stimulation, significantly improves functional outcomes. Structured interdisciplinary interventions encompassing cardiopulmonary, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains effectively mitigate long-term disability, facilitating return to daily activities and employment. However, access disparities and insufficient randomized controlled trials limit evidence-based standardization. Discussion: Optimal recovery after SCA necessitates early and continuous interdisciplinary engagement, tailored to individual physiological and cognitive profiles. Persistent cognitive fatigue, executive dysfunction, and emotional instability remain significant barriers, underscoring the need for holistic and sustained rehabilitative approaches. Conclusions: Comprehensive, individualized rehabilitation following cardiac arrest is not supplementary but fundamental to meaningful recovery. Emphasizing early mobilization, neurocognitive therapy, family involvement, and structured social reintegration pathways is crucial. Addressing healthcare disparities and investing in rigorous randomized trials are imperative to achieving standardized, equitable, and outcome-oriented rehabilitation services globally.","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Salwa K | Kaziród-Wolski K | Rębak D | Sielski J,Journal Article | Review,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
40753420,10.1186/s13063-025-08971-y,Trauma resuscitation with Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood Or Products: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial (the TROOP trial).,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is the most common cause of potentially preventable death after injury. Balanced transfusion with red blood cells, plasma, and platelets (component therapy, CT) has been shown to reduce mortality, and is the standard of care. Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) is an attractive alternative to CT, but existing evidence comprises observational studies, and a small single center pilot randomized controlled trial, which evaluated a type of whole blood that is no longer in use. The aim of the ""Trauma Resuscitation with Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood Or Products"" (TROOP) trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of LTOWB and CT in critically injured patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.
METHODS: This is a pragmatic, multicenter, Bayesian, sequential non-inferiority/superiority, randomized clinical trial, performed within 15 level I trauma centers in the United States. We aim to randomize 1,100 injured patients to resuscitation with either CT or LTOWB. The primary outcome is 6-h mortality. Secondary outcomes include 24-h and 30-day or hospital mortality (whichever is earlier); prespecified complications; adjudicated cause of death; time to death; length of stay (ICU and hospital); and hospital-, ventilator- and ICU-free days; the incidence of major surgical procedures; time to hemostasis in those undergoing procedures with a hemostatic component; number and type of blood products used until hemostasis is achieved (and randomized products are discontinued), as well as after hemostasis has been achieved, to 24 h post-admission; discharge destination and functional status and quality of life at hospital discharge or 30 days, as measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and EuroQol (EQ-5D) quality of life measurement.
DISCUSSION: This large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.

40671283,10.1111/aas.70095,Protocolized REDUction of Non-Resuscitation Fluids in SEptic Shock Patients. A Protocol for the REDUSE Randomized Clinical Trial.,"In septic shock, administration of large fluid volumes is associated with poor outcomes. Recent evidence shows that non-resuscitation fluids are the major modifiable source of fluids for patients with septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs). This clinical trial is designed to test the hypothesis that restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids improves outcomes compared to usual care. Adult patients admitted to ICUs with septic shock will be randomly assigned within 12 h of admission to receive protocolized restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids or usual care. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes are complications during ICU stay up to 90 days (defined as any acute kidney injury or cerebral, coronary, intestinal, or limb ischemia), mechanical ventilation free days within 90 days, and for survivors cognitive function (by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA-BLIND]) and Health-Related Quality of Life (by the EQ Visual Analogue Scale [EQ-VAS]), both at 6 months. In addition, the climate impact of the interventions will be assessed. To detect an absolute reduction in mortality of 7.5%, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 90%, we aim to include 1850 patients. The trial is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Results of primary and secondary clinical outcomes and the environmental outcome will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Early prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical measures predict long-term outcomes.
METHODS: In a longitudinal multicenter cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26).
RESULTS: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive relation with twelve-month MoCA (β = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94). Early HADS was associated with twelve-month HADS (β = 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.60, p < 0.001), with age negatively associated (β = -0.10, 95 % CI: -0.18 to -0.02, p = 0.019). No other significant relations were found.
CONCLUSION: MoCA and HADS scores during hospitalization relate to long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes after cardiac arrest.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess HRQoL among adult OHCA survivors in Denmark between 2001 and 2019 who were alive as of 1 October 2020. Survivors were grouped by time since cardiac arrest: 0-4, >4-8, >8-12, and >12 years post-arrest. Among 2552 respondents (56.1% response rate), 2075 were men (81.3%) and 477 were women (18.7%). The mean survey age was 60.2 years (SD 14.7) for women and 66.0 years (SD 11.8) for men. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and EuroQol Health Questionnaire index scores were both lower for women than for men [69 vs. 75 and 0.76 (SD 0.21) vs. 0.84 (SD 0.17), respectively; P < 0.001]. The SF-12 physical and mental health scores were also lower for women [40.3 (SD 12.9) and 50.9 (SD 8.8)] compared with men [44.0 (SD 12.1) and 53.3 (SD 8.1); P < 0.001]. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for anxiety (5.4 vs. 3.5; P < 0.001) and for depression (4.0 vs. 3.2; P < 0.001) were higher among women. In multivariable logistic regression, female sex remained significantly associated with poorer long-term HRQoL outcomes. Trends remained consistent regardless of time since cardiac arrest.

40557995,10.1093/ehjacc/zuaf093,Quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a TOMAHAWK sub-study.,"AIMS: The TOMAHAWK trial compared immediate coronary angiography with a delayed/selective strategy in 554 resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevations. Mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. In addition to survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key outcome parameter for OHCA patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis included 169 survivors from the TOMAHAWK trial who completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up (6M-FU/12M-FU). HRQoL was assessed using a questionnaire based on the EuroQoL-5D-3L. This tool includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best imaginable subjective health) and a descriptive system with five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No relevant differences were found between patients in the immediate angiography group and those in the delayed/selective angiography group regarding EQ-VAS scores at 6M-FU (70 ± 21 vs. 74 ± 18) and 12M-FU (72 ± 19 vs. 74 ± 17). Patients reported the most problems with usual activities (33% and 38%, respectively), and the fewest limitations in self-care (18% and 17%, respectively) at 6M-FU. Women reported more problems than men in all five dimensions. Elderly patients (≥65 years) were more likely than younger OHCA survivors to indicate limitations in mobility, self-care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort.
CONCLUSION: OHCA survivors of the TOMAHAWK trial rated their HRQoL 6 and 12 months after the event as relatively good, but there were notable differences between women and men and between younger and elderly patients. The angiography strategy did not affect HRQoL.

METHODS: We included survivors from the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial, who completed EQ-5D-5L at 6 months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the hypothesised unidimensional latent structure of EQ level sum score (EQ LSS), summarizing scores across Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/depression. Differential item functioning was evaluated for age. We examined internal consistency and precision for the EQ LSS. We evaluated construct validity of EQ LSS, EQ value and EQ VAS, using the modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, representing functional outcome and cognitive function-two common health challenges experienced by OHCA survivors.
RESULTS: 783 of 939 (84%) eligible survivors were included. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit and strong factor loadings for all dimensions (0.61-0.90). We observed a significant but negligible effect of age on Mobility (β = 0.29, p < 0.001, ΔR2 = 0.019). Internal consistency was 0.88. The floor effect was 35%. Survivors with more functional dependency and/or cognitive problems reported significantly worse health by EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS (all, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The psychometric properties of EQ LSS support its use to measure health status in OHCA research.

40433366,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1480025,Immunoinformatic-driven design and evaluation of multi-epitope mRNA vaccine targeting HIV-1 gp120.,"HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) presents a global health crisis, causing significant AIDS-related deaths and over one million new infections annually. The curbing of HIV is an intricate and continuously evolving domain, marked by numerous challenges, including drug resistance and the absence of a significant cure or vaccine because of its mutating ability and diverse antigens in its envelope, prompting research for functional cures and long-term remission strategies. The endeavor to devise an HIV vaccine capable of eliciting robust and broadly cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses is a formidable undertaking, primarily due to the pronounced genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1, the variances observed in virus subtypes (clades) across distinct geographic regions, and the polymorphic nature of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The viral envelope protein (gp120) selectively interacts with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the surface of target cells. It serves as the key initiator in the intricate viral entry into host cells, rendering it a compelling candidate for vaccine development. This study used bioinformatic tools to design a safe, hypoallergenic, and non-toxic mRNA HIV-1 vaccine by assembling immunogenic B- and T-cell epitopes from the gp120 protein. We identified antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergic B-cell epitopes (IEPLGIAPTRAKRRVVER) and T-cell epitopes (QQKVHALFY, ITIGPGQVF, WQGVGQAMY, APTRAKRRV, KQQKVHALFYRLDIV, QQKVHALFYRLDIVQ, QKVHALFYRLDIVQI, SLAEEEIIIRSENLT, and IRSENLTNNVKTIIV). For designing the mRNA vaccine against HIV-1 gp120, we assembled the epitopes with 5' m7G cap, 5' UTR (untranslated region), Kozak sequence, signal peptide (tPA), RpfE (resuscitation-promoting factor E) adjuvant at N-terminal and MITD (MHC class I trafficking domain) adjuvant, stop codon, 3' UTR, and 120-nucleotide long poly(A) tail at the C-terminal with immunogenic robustness linkers. The mRNA vaccine is translated into a protein-based vaccine by the host body's ribosomes. Their comprehensive computational findings, including physicochemical, structural, and 3D refinement analyses, substantiated the stability and quality of the translated vaccine. Molecular docking and simulation revealed a strong and stable binding affinity of vaccine immunization with immune cells' pattern recognition receptors (TLR4). Immune simulations demonstrated a potent primary immune response characterized by a gradual increase in immunoglobulins and a corresponding decline in antigen concentration. This bioinformatics-driven study presents a promising HIV-1 mRNA vaccine candidate, underscoring the need for further experimental validation through preclinical and clinical trials. At the same time, its methodologies hold the potential for addressing other challenging infectious diseases, thereby impacting vaccinology broadly.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Ahmed MZ | Rao T | Mutahir Z | Ahmed S | Ullah N | Ojha SC,Journal Article,"HIV Envelope Protein gp120 | Humans | AIDS Vaccines | HIV-1 | Computational Biology | HIV Infections | Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte | mRNA Vaccines | HIV Antibodies | Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte | Epitopes | RNA, Messenger",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,false,false

Quality of life was then compared with reference values (patients with cardiovascular diseases, patients with ischemic heart disease, ICU-survivor patients at 36 months after discharge, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with V-A ECMO).
RESULTS: Among 45 survivors, 25 patients completed the SF-36 form with a mean time for assessing quality of life of 6.9 ± 2.3 years. Sub-scores were globally comparable with those observed in referent cohorts.
DISCUSSION: Cardiac arrest marks the beginning of a medical journey that includes intensive care management and the onset of cardiac disease, often of ischemic origin. Our data suggest that quality of life of patients treated with V-A ECMO for cardiac arrest is comparable to those reported in referent cohorts (ICU-survivors, patients with cardiovascular diseases of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with mechanical circulatory support).
CONCLUSION: Survivor patients who experienced cardiac arrest and treated with V-A ECMO presented a good long-term quality of life.

METHODS AND SETTINGS: A retrospective cohort study using the Australian and New Zealand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EXCEL) registry for ECPR cases and the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) for CCPR cases. All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12-month EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS).
RESULTS: There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data. The ECPR cohort was younger [mean(SD) 50.4(13.46) vs 60.5(14.01) yrs, p < 0.01] and more likely to have received bystander CPR [19(79%) ECPR vs 397(52%) CCPR, p < 0.001].

Median (IQR) arrest to ROSC/ECMO time was longer in ECPR than CCPR [61(41.5-97) vs 6(2-14) minutes, p < 0.001]. The median (IQR) EQ-5D-5L utility score [0.95 (0.72-1) ECPR vs 0.96 (0.86-1) CCPR, p = 0.64] and median (IQR) EQ-VAS at 12 months [80 (64.5-90) ECPR vs 75 (60-85) CCPR, p = 0.39] were similar. There were no significant differences in the EQ-5D-5L utility scores and EQ-VAS even after adjustment for baseline imbalances.

40082569,10.1038/s41598-025-93182-3,Development and validation of machine learning-based prediction model for outcome of cardiac arrest in intensive care units.,"Cardiac arrest (CA) poses a significant global health challenge and often results in poor prognosis. We developed an interpretable and applicable machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h. A total of 721 patients were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, divided into the training set (n = 576) and the internal validation set (n = 145). The external validation set containing 856 cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang Province. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms were utilized to establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost model exhibited the best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately selected as key features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a compact model. The final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in the internal validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation. SHAP summary plots and force plots visually explained the predicted outcomes. In conclusion, 72-h CatBoost showed promising performance in predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h.

40021268,10.1016/j.jacadv.2024.101573,Gaps in Public Access Defibrillation: Analysis of International Legislation.,"BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health issue, for which rapid public access defibrillation (PAD) increases survival.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate international legislation relating to PAD and develop legal recommendations to improve PAD in OHCA.
METHODS: Searches covering 5 domains (automated external defibrillator [AED] provision, funding, identification, maintenance, lay responder training) were conducted in 99 jurisdictions worldwide: United States (50) and Canada (13) analyzed at state/province level; 36 other countries analyzed at national level. Forty-nine legislation sources were searched from September 27, 2021, to May 5, 2022. Legislative data were classified: Enabling Legislation (facilitating PAD) or Disabling Legislation (hindering PAD). Based on retrieved data, recommendations for international AED laws were developed.
RESULTS: Searches identified 419,248 legal records. Enabling Legislation regarding AED provision in public areas was present in 60% U.S. states, 8% Canadian provinces, and 22% of nations studied from the rest of world. Disabling Legislation regarding registration of AEDs, that could potentially discourage AED ownership, was found in 37 North American jurisdictions. Enabling Legislation regarding AED signage was found in 66% U.S. states and 39% of all jurisdictions worldwide. Overall, 48% of worldwide jurisdictions studied had legislative requirements for AED maintenance, including 80% of all U.S. states. Internationally, 49.5% of jurisdictions studied had Enabling Legislation mandating AED training, and 66% United States had this for schools. Only 4 jurisdictions worldwide gave implicit authorization to laypersons for AED use in emergencies.
CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variability in international legislation relating to PAD. All countries should consider Enabling Legislation that could decrease delays to PAD. Similarly, Disabling Legislation potentially hindering prompt PAD during OHCA should be withdrawn.",JACC.

Therefore, the aim was to describe self-reported cognitive function and its association with health status, psychological distress, and life satisfaction.
METHODS: This study utilised data from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (2018-2021), registered 3-6 months post-CA. Cognitive function was assessed by a single question: ""How do you experience your memory, concentration, and/or planning abilities today compared to before the cardiac arrest?"". Health status was measured using the EQ VAS, psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and overall life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction checklist. Data were analysed using binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 4026 identified survivors, 1254 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.9 years (SD = 13.4) and 31.7% were female. Self-reported cognitive function among survivors was reported as: 'Much worse' by 3.1%, 'Worse' by 23.8%, 'Unchanged' by 68.3%, 'Better' by 3.3%, and 'Much better' by 1.5%. Declined cognitive function was associated with lower health status (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 2.09-3.64), symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.84, 95% CI = 2.80-5.24) and depression (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.22-6.32), and being dissatisfied with overall life (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.11-3.54). These associations remained significant after age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, initial rhythm, initial witnessed status, and cerebral performance were controlled.

The termination of resuscitation (TOR) rule, widely adopted internationally, aims to preserve dignity, optimize resources, and protect healthcare providers. However, prehospital TOR is not implemented in Japan, presenting legal and practical challenges. This study analyzes temporal trends in prehospital and in-hospital interventions for OHCA patients with poor predicted outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (JAAM-OHCA) registry (June 2014-December 2021). Adult OHCA patients with medical causes were included if they fulfilled all the advanced life support (ALS) TOR rule criteria: unwitnessed arrest, no return of spontaneous circulation, no bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and no automated external defibrillator use or defibrillation. Prehospital and in-hospital interventions were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 11,334 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 2,447 received all three ALS interventions (advanced airway management, intravenous access, and epinephrine administration). Over time, in-hospital interventions, including endotracheal intubation (56%) and epinephrine administration (82%), decreased, while advanced therapies, including coronary angiography, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and targeted temperature management, remained rare (<1%). The median time to TOR after hospital arrival shortened to 18 min. In contrast, prehospital epinephrine administration increased, while advanced airway management and intravenous access decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: OHCA patients who met TOR rule showed a decrease in in-hospital interventions.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of EXCEL registry data.
SETTING: EXCEL is a high-quality, prospective, binational registry including adult patients who receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in Australia and New Zealand.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients reported to the EXCEL registry who received ECPR following IHCA and had the six-month outcome data available were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was functional outcome at six months measured using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The secondary outcomes included mortality, disability, health status, and complications.
RESULTS: Between 15th February 2019 and 31st August 2022, 113/1251 (9.0%) patients in the registry received ECPR following IHCA (mean age 50.7 ± 13.7 years; 79/113 (69.9%) male; 74/113 (65.5%) non-shockable rhythm). At 6 months, 37/113 (32.7%) patients were alive, most (27/34 [79.4%]) with a good functional outcome (mRS 0-3).

METHODS: Post-hoc analyses of the international multicentre Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial. At 6 months, survivors at 61 sites in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland were invited to a follow-up. The participants answered two questions on self-reported physical activity. Answers were categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of physical activity and further dichotomized into a low versus moderate/high level of physical activity. Potential risk factors for a low level of physical activity were collected and investigated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: At 6 months, 807 of 939 (86%) OHCA survivors answered the two questions of physical activity; 34% reported a low, 44% moderate and 22% high level of physical activity. Obesity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.77, p = 0.018), mobility problems by EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.06-2.84, p = 0.029), and cognitive impairment by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.82, p = 0.013) were significantly associated with a low level of physical activity in the multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION: One third of the OHCA survivors reported a low level of physical activity. Obesity, mobility problems, and cognitive impairment were associated with a low level of physical activity.

We aimed to determine HRQoL during 1-year after refractory OHCA in patients treated with ECPR and CCPR.
METHODS: We present a secondary analysis of the multicenter INCEPTION-trial, which studied the effectiveness of ECPR versus CCPR in patients with refractory OHCA. HRQoL was prospectively assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Poor HRQoL was pragmatically defined as an EQ-5D-5L health utility index (HUI) > 1 SD below the age-adjusted norm. We used mixed linear models to assess the difference in HRQoL over time and univariable analyses to assess factors potentially associated with poor HRQoL.
RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were enrolled, and hospital survival was 20% (27 patients). EQ-5D-5L data were available for 25 patients (5 ECPR and 20 CCPR). One year after OHCA, the estimated mean HUI was 0.73 (0.05) in all patients, 0.84 (0.12) in ECPR survivors, and 0.71 (0.05) in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.31). Eight (32%) survivors had a poor HRQoL. HRQoL was good in 17 (68%) patients, with 100% in ECPR survivors versus 60% in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.14).
CONCLUSION: One year after refractory OHCA, 68% of the survivors had a good HRQoL.

38871072,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2024.110268,Associations between initial heart rhythm and self-reported health among cardiac arrest survivors - A nationwide registry study.,"BACKGROUND: Non-shockable initial rhythm is a known risk factor for high mortality at cardiac arrest (CA). However, knowledge on its association with self-reported health in CA survivors is still incomplete.
AIM: To examine the associations between initial rhythm and self-reported health in CA survivors.
METHODS: This nationwide study used data from the Swedish Register for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 3-6 months post CA. Health status was measured using EQ-5D-5L and psychological distress by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences in self-reported health between groups of different initial rhythms. To control for potential confounders, age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, witnessed status, time to CPR, time to defibrillation, and neurological function were included as covariates in multiple regression analyses for continuous and categorical outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 1783 adult CA survivors. Overall, the CA survivors reported good health status and symptoms of anxiety or depression were uncommon (13.7% and 13.9% respectively). Survivors with PEA and asystole reported significantly more problems in all dimensions of health status (p = 0.037 to p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.034), and depression (p = 0.017) compared to VT/VF. Overall, these differences did not remain in the adjusted regression analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial rhythm is not associated with self-reported health when potential confounders are controlled. Initial rhythm seems to be an indicator of unfavourable factors causing the arrest, or factors related to characteristics and treatment. Therefore, initial rhythm may be used as a proxy for identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes such as worse health status and psychological distress.",Resuscitation,2024,Årestedt K | Rooth M | Bremer A | Koistinen L | Attin M | Israelsson J,Journal Article,Humans | Male | Female | Registries | Self Report | Sweden | Aged | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Middle Aged | Health Status | Heart Arrest | Depression | Anxiety | Survivors | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Adult | Heart Rate,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,false,true

Given that in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still poorly investigated, data on health-associated quality of life thereafter remains scarce. The available evidence is mostly transferred from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies, but the epidemiology and determinants of success might be different. The aim of the study was to investigate the change in the quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify potential risk factors for a poor outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis of data and prospective evaluation of quality of life included all patients surviving an IHCA and being treated by the emergency medical team between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint of the study was the quality of life after IHCA at the reference date. Secondary endpoints covered determination of risk factors and predictors of poor outcome after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
RESULTS: In total 604 patients were resuscitated within the period of 11 years and 61 (10%) patients survived until the interview took place. Finally, 48 (79%) patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 31 (65%) were included in the study.

CONCLUSION: The quality of life before and after IHCA in survivors was good and comparable. The quality of life was mostly affected by reduced mobility and anxiety/depression.

This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93).

Many studies focus on survival, but few explore the outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyze the survival curve, independence, quality of life, and performance status after CA.
METHODS: This retrospective study included adults admitted to the intensive care unit of Cova da Beira University Hospital Center after CA between 2015 and 2019. We analyzed patient records and applied a questionnaire including EuroQoL's EQ-5D-3L and ECOG performance status.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included (mean age 75.74 years). Thirty-one patients (32.0%) survived to hospital discharge. There was a significant loss of independence for activities of daily living, with 50.0% of those previously independent becoming dependent and 47.5% of those previously at home being institutionalized. Diabetes, female gender, and length of hospital stay were especially impactful on these findings. One year after CA, only 20.6% were alive and only 13.4% (65% of the one-year survivors) were independent. Nine patients answered our questionnaire. Mean EQ-5D quality of life index (0.528±0.297) and the most affected domains ('Pain/discomfort' and 'Anxiety/depression') were similar to the Portuguese population aged >30 years. However, 66.6% reported a decline in their quality of life. Lastly, seven respondents had a good performance status (ECOG 0-1).

However, ECPR requires specific materials and highly skilled personnel, and it is unclear whether increased survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) justify these costs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness study was part of the INCEPTION study, a multi-centre, pragmatic randomized trial comparing hospital-based ECPR to conventional CPR (CCPR) in patients with refractory OHCA in 10 cardiosurgical centres in the Netherlands. We analysed healthcare costs in the first year and measured HRQOL using the EQ-5D-5L at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-effectiveness planes, and acceptability curves were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for per-protocol and as-treated subgroups as well as imputed productivity loss in deceased patients. In total, 132 patients were enrolled: 62 in the CCPR and 70 in the ECPR group. The difference in mean costs after 1 year was €5109 (95% confidence interval -7264 to 15 764). Mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) after 1 year was 0.15 in the ECPR group and 0.11 in the CCPR group, resulting in an ICER of €121 643 per additional QALY gained. The acceptability curve shows that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €80.000, the probability of ECPR being cost-effective compared with CCPR is 36%.

38452994,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2024.110166,"Emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence predict readiness for hospital discharge in a prospective sample of cognitively intact cardiac arrest survivors.","AIM: To inform screening, referral and treatment initiatives, we tested the hypothesis that emotional distress, social support, functional dependence, and cognitive impairment within 72 hours prior to discharge predict readiness for discharge in awake and alert cardiac arrest (CA) survivors.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective single-center cohort of CA survivors enrolled between 4/2021 and 9/2022. We quantified emotional distress using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge.
RESULTS: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard deviation ± 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted β's [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05).

38401709,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2024.110151,Health-related quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; a comparison of prehospital return-of-spontaneous circulation and refractory arrest managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for selected refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is increasingly used. Detailed knowledge of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term cognitive function is limited. HRQoL and cognitive function were assessed in ECPR-survivors and OHCA-survivors with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation after standard advanced cardiac life support (sACLS).
METHODS: Fifteen ECPR-survivors and 22 age-matched sACLS-survivors agreed to participate in this follow-up study. Participants were examined with echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and neuropsychological testing, and answered HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and Short Form 36 (SF-36)), and mental health questionnaires.
RESULTS: Most patients were male (73 % and 82 %) and median age at follow-up was similar between groups (55 years and 60 years). Low flow time was significantly longer for ECPR-survivors (86 min vs. 15 min) and lactate levels were significantly higher (14.1 mmol/l vs. 3.9 mmol/l). No between-group difference was found in physical function nor in cognitive function with scores corresponding to the 23rd worst percentile of the general population. SACLS-survivors had HRQoL on level with the Danish general population while ECPR-survivors scored lower in both EQ-5D-5L (index score 0.73 vs. 0.86, p = 0.03, visual analog scale: 70 vs. 84, p = 0.04) and in multiple SF-36 health domains (role physical, bodily pain, general health, and mental health).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantially longer low flow times with thrice as high lactate levels, ECPR-survivors were similar in cognitive and physical function compared to sACLS-survivors. Nonetheless, ECPR-survivors reported lower HRQoL overall and related to mental health, pain management, and the perception of limitations in physical role.",Resuscitation,2024,Gregers E | Linde L | Kunkel JB | Wiberg S | Møller-Sørensen PH | Smerup M | Borregaard B | Schmidt H | Lassen JF | Møller JE | Hassager C | Søholm H | Kjærgaard J,Journal Article,Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Female | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Follow-Up Studies | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Cognition | Emergency Medical Services | Lactates,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
38292469,10.1016/j.resplu.2023.100549,How do survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest perceive their health compared to the norm population? A nationwide registry study from Norway.,"INTRODUCTION: Self-perceived health status data is usually collected using patient-reported outcome measures. Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D-5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate.
RESULTS: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 ± 0.24 vs 0.82 ± 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 ± 21 vs 79 ± 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian OHCA survivors reported poorer health than the general population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L.

38151437,10.1016/j.injury.2023.111297,Long-term outcome after surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures.,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic chest wall injuries are common however the incidence of non-union rib fractures is unknown. Previous studies have suggested that surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures could be beneficial in selected patients, although many experience persisting pain despite surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term outcome after surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study including adults (≥18 years) managed surgically for symptomatic non-union rib fractures with plate fixation during the period 2010-2020 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Patients operated for acute chest wall injury or injury due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded. Patients answered standardized questionnaires concerning remaining symptoms and satisfaction with surgery, quality of life (QoL, EQ-5D-5 L) and disability (Disability Rating Index, DRI). Lung function, movement of chest wall and thoracic spine, and shoulder function (Boström index) were assessed.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients, 12 men and four women, with mean age 61.6± 11.1 were included in the study. The mechanism of injury was trauma in 10 patients and cough-induced injuries in five patients. Lung disease was significantly more prevalent in cough-induced injuries compared to traumatic injuries, 5 vs 1 (p = 0.008). The mean follow-up time was 3.5 years. Ninety-four percent were satisfied with the surgery and reported that their symptoms had decreased, although 69 % had remaining symptoms, especially pain, from the chest wall. Quality of Life was decreased with EQ-5D-5 L index 0.819 (0.477-0.976) and EQ-VAS 69 (10-100). Disability Rating Index was 31.5 (1.3-76.7) with problems running, lifting heavy objects, and performing heavy work. Predicted lung function was decreased with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) 86.2 ± 14.2 %, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) 79.1 ± 10.7 % and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) 89.7 ± 14.5 %. Patients with cough-induced injuries had full shoulder mobility.
CONCLUSIONS: Chest wall surgery for symptomatic non-union rib fractures results in decreased symptoms and patient satisfaction in most cases despite remaining symptoms, reduced lung function, chest wall movement, and QoL and persistent disability.",Injury,2024,Nilsson J | Caragounis EC,Journal Article,"Adult | Male | Humans | Female | Middle Aged | Aged | Rib Fractures | Flail Chest | Quality of Life | Cross-Sectional Studies | Fracture Fixation, Internal | Thoracic Injuries | Cough | Pain | Retrospective Studies",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

Individuals within this patient cohort grapple with uncertainty regarding the potential advantages of extracorporeal life support (ECMO) cannulation. This study elucidates the neurological outcomes and quality of life of post-cardiac arrest patients who attained spontaneous circulation and underwent ECMO cannulation. This is a retrospective case study within a local context, the research involved 32 patients who received ECMO support following an intrahospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An additional 32 patients experienced cardiac arrest with ROSC before undergoing cannulation. The average age was 41 years, with the primary causes of cardiac arrest identified as acute coronary syndrome (46.8%), pulmonary thromboembolism (21.88%), and hypoxemia (18.7%). The most prevalent arrest rhythm was asystole (37.5%), followed by ventricular fibrillation (34.4%). The mean SOFA score was 7 points (IQR 6.5-9), APACHE II score was 12 (IQR 9-16), RESP score was -1 (IQR -1 to -4) in cases of respiratory ECMO, and SAVE score was -3 (IQR -5 to 2) in cases of cardiac ECMO. Overall survival was 71%, and at 6 months, the Barthel score was 75 points, modified Rankin score was 2, cerebral performance categories score was 1, and the SF-12 had an average score of 30. Notably, there were no significant associations between the time, cause, or rhythm of cardiac arrest and neurological outcomes. Importantly, cardiac arrest is not a contraindication for ECMO cannulation. A meticulous assessment of candidates who have achieved spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, considering the absence of early signs of poor neurological prognosis, is crucial in patient selection. Larger prospective studies are warranted to validate and extend these findings.",Medicine,2023,Poveda-Henao C | Valenzuela-Faccini N | Pérez-Garzón M | Mantilla-Viviescas K | Chavarro-Alfonso O | Robayo-Amortegui H,Journal Article,Humans | Adult | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Return of Spontaneous Circulation | Heart Arrest,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

37881593,10.37616/2212-5043.1353,Evaluation of Telephone Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Performance in Current Practice in Saudi Arabia.,"OBJECTIVES: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global health problem with a low survival rate. Telephone cardiopulmonary resuscitation (T-CPR) guidance by emergency medical services (EMS) dispatchers can improve CPR performance and, consequently, survival rates. Accordingly, the American Heart Association (AHA) has released performance standards for T-CPR in current practice to improve its quality. However, no study has examined T-CPR performance in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate T-CPR performance in the Saudi Arabian EMS system.
METHODS: A retrospective observation of OHCA calls in current practice was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OHCA calls were reviewed to identify those that met the selection criteria. Variables collected included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), OHCA recognition rate, time from EMS call receipt to location acquisition, to OHCA recognition and to commencement of CPR.
RESULTS: A total of 308 OHCA cases were reviewed, and 100 calls were included. ROSC was identified in 10% of the included calls. OHCA was correctly recognized in 62% of the calls. The time to OHCA identification and CPR performance from EMS call receipt were found to be 303 s and 367 s, respectively.
CONCLUSION: T-CPR performance in Saudi Arabia is below AHA standards. However, this is similar to what has been reported in the literature. Avoiding any unnecessary call transfer during OHCA calls and prompt identification of callers' locations could improve T-CPR performance.",Journal of the Saudi Heart Association,2023,Binhotan M | Turnbull J | Petley G | Aljerian N | Altuwaijri M,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,false,false
37818171,10.1016/j.resplu.2023.100478,Health-related quality of life in young Norwegian survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to pre-arrest exercise habits.,"AIM: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in young survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Norway with an age and sex-matched reference population and to assess the associations between exercise volume prior to OHCA and HRQoL after.
METHODS: We present data from survivors aged 18-50 years registered with OHCA in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017. Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise habits prior to OHCA. Respondents were randomly matched 1:1 for age and sex with a reference population (data were available from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data).
RESULTS: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised ≥5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly (p < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical- and mental health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting ≥5 hours of exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less.
CONCLUSION: Poorer HRQoL in survivors compared to the reference population should prompt us to explore how treatment and rehabilitation could be improved and adapted. More exercise before OHCA favoured better HRQoL after, which aligns well with the recognised positive association between HRQoL and physical activity in general.",Resuscitation plus,2023,Isern CB | Nilsson BB | Garratt A | Kramer-Johansen J | Tjelmeland IBM | Berge HM,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
37703007,10.1001/jamacardio.2023.2934,Long-Term Quality of Life After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.,"IMPORTANCE: Allocating resources to increase survival after cardiac arrest requires survivors to have a good quality of life, but long-term data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2019.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the health-related quality of life of all adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry between June 1, 2001, and August 31, 2019, who were alive in October 2020 (follow-up periods, 0-1, >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, >10-15, and >15-20 years since arrest). The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.
EXPOSURE: All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.
RESULTS: Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population.

37662641,10.1016/j.resplu.2023.100455,Is insomnia associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors? A cross-sectional survey.,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia symptoms seem to be common in cardiac arrest survivors but their associations with important outcomes such as self-reported health and life satisfaction have not previously been reported during the early post-event period. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether symptoms of insomnia are associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors six months after the event.
METHODS: This multicentre cross-sectional survey included cardiac arrest survivors ≥18 years. Participants were recruited six months after the event from five hospitals in southern Sweden, and completed a questionnaire including the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale, EQ-5D-5L, Health Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, linear regression, and ordinal logistic regression. The regression analyses were adjusted for demographic and medical factors.
RESULTS: In total, 212 survivors, 76.4% males, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD = 11.9) were included, and of those, 20% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia was significantly associated with all aspects of self-reported health (p < 0.01) and life satisfaction (p < 0.001), except mobility (p = 0.093), self-care (p = 0.676), and usual activities (p = 0.073).
CONCLUSION: Insomnia plays a potentially important role for both health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors.

37523163,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.1586,Smartphone-Based Video Antenatal Preterm Birth Education: The Preemie Prep for Parents Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and child morbidity. Preterm birth is not always unexpected, yet standard prenatal care does not offer anticipatory education to parents at risk of delivering preterm, which leaves parents unprepared to make health care choices during the pregnancy that can improve survival and decrease morbidity in case of preterm birth.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) program on maternal knowledge of preterm birth, preparation for decision-making, and anxiety.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Recruitment for this randomized clinical trial conducted at a US academic medical center took place from February 3, 2020, to April 12, 2021. A total of 120 pregnant persons with a risk factor for preterm birth were enrolled between 16 and 21 weeks' gestational age and followed up through pregnancy completion.
INTERVENTION: Starting at 18 weeks' gestational age, P3 program participants received links delivered via text message to 51 gestational age-specific short animated videos. Control participants received links to patient education webpages from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At 25 weeks' gestation, scores on the Parent Prematurity Knowledge Questionnaire (scored as percent correct), Preparation for Decision Making Scale (scored 0-100), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety computerized adaptive test. Analysis was based on an intention to treat.
RESULTS: A total of 120 pregnant participants (mean [SD] age, 32.5 [4.9] years) were included in the study; 60 participants were randomized to each group. Participants in the P3 group scored higher than those in the control group on knowledge of long-term outcomes at 25 weeks (88.5% vs 73.2%; estimated difference, 15.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.3-22.5 percentage points; P < .001). Participants in the P3 group reported being significantly more prepared than did participants in the control group for neonatal resuscitation decision-making at 25 weeks (Preparation for Decision Making Scale score, 76.0 vs 52.3; difference, 23.7; 95% CI, 14.1-33.2). There was no difference between the P3 group and the control group in anxiety at 25 weeks (mean [SE] PROMIS Anxiety scores, 53.8 [1.1] vs 54.0 [1.1]; difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -3.2 to 2.9).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, pregnant persons randomly assigned to the P3 program had more knowledge of core competencies and were more prepared to make decisions that affect maternal and infant health, without experiencing worse anxiety. Mobile antenatal preterm birth education may provide a unique benefit to parents with preterm birth risk factors.

37454428,10.1016/j.jss.2023.06.005,Preliminary Exploration of Long-Term Patient Outcomes After Tracheostomy in Burns: A Burn Model System Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Upper airway management is crucial to burn care. Endotracheal intubation is often performed in the setting of inhalation injury, burns of the face and neck, or large burns requiring significant resuscitation. Tracheostomy may be necessary in patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support. This study compares long-term, patient-reported outcomes in burn patients with and without tracheostomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Burn Model System Database, collected from 2013 to 2020, were analyzed. Demographic and clinical data were compared between those with and without tracheostomy. The following patient-reported outcomes, collected at 6-, 12-, and 24-mo follow-up, were analyzed: Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure, employment status, and days to return to work. Regression models and propensity-matched analyses were used to assess the associations between tracheostomy and each outcome.
RESULTS: Of 714 patients included in this study, 5.5% received a tracheostomy. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated that only VR-12 Physical Component Summary scores at 24-mo follow-up were significantly worse among those requiring tracheostomy. Tracheostomy was not associated with VR-12 Mental Component Summary, Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, or Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure scores. Likewise, tracheostomy was not found to be independently associated with employment status or days to return to work.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary exploration suggests that physical and psychosocial recovery, as well as the ability to regain employment, are no worse in burn patients requiring tracheostomy. Future investigations of larger scale are still needed to assess center- and provider-level influences, as well as the influences of various hallmarks of injury severity. Nonetheless, this work should better inform goals of care discussions with patients and families regarding the use of tracheostomy in burn injury.",The Journal of surgical research,2023,Galicia KE | Mehta A | Kowalske KJ | Gibran NS | Stewart BT | McMullen K | Wolf SE | Ryan CM | Kubasiak J | Schneider JC,"Journal Article | Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural | Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Humans | Quality of Life | Burns | Employment | Regression Analysis | Personal Satisfaction,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
37207872,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109846,Protective positive psychology factors and emotional distress after cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: There is a critical need to identify factors that can prevent emotional distress post-cardiac arrest (CA). CA survivors have previously described benefitting from utilizing positive psychology constructs (mindfulness, existential well-being, resilient coping, social support) to cope with distress. Here, we explored associations between positive psychology factors and emotional distress post-CA.
METHODS: We recruited CA survivors treated from 4/2021-9/2022 at a single academic medical center. We assessed positive psychology factors (mindfulness [Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised], existential well-being [Meaning in Life Questionnaire Presence of Meaning subscale], resilient coping [Brief Resilient Coping Scale], perceived social support [ENRICHD Social Support Inventory]) and emotional distress (posttraumatic stress [Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-5], anxiety and depression symptoms [PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a]) just before discharge from the index hospitalization. We selected covariates for inclusion in our multivariable models based on an association with any emotional distress factor (p < 0.10). For our final, multivariable regression models, we individually tested the independent association of each positive psychology factor and emotional distress factor.
RESULTS: We included 110 survivors (mean age 59 years, 64% male, 88% non-Hispanic White, 48% low income); 36.4% of survivors scored above the cut-off for at least one measure of emotional distress. In separate adjusted models, each positive psychology factor was independently associated with emotional distress (β: -0.20 to -0.42, all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of mindfulness, existential well-being, resilient coping, and perceived social support were each associated with less emotional distress.

We aimed to provide insight into these outcomes at one-year follow-up.
METHODS: We assessed outcome of surviving comatose patients after cardiac arrest with RPPs included in the 'treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus after cardiopulmonary resuscitation' (TELSTAR) trial at one-year follow-up, including the CPC for functional neurological outcome, a cognitive assessment, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) for emotional outcomes, and the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) for quality of life. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of more than 1.5 SD below the mean on ≥ 2 (sub)tests within a cognitive domain.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included (median age 58 years, 21% female), of whom 13 had a cognitive impairment. Eleven of 14 were impaired in memory, 9/14 in executive functioning, and 7/14 in attention. The median scores on the HADS and SF-36 were all worse than expected. Based on the CPC alone, 8/14 had a good outcome (CPC 1-2).
CONCLUSION: Nearly all cardiac arrest survivors with RPPs during the comatose state have cognitive impairments at one-year follow-up.

37150395,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109822,Associations between comorbidity and health-related quality of life among in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors - A cross-sectional nationwide registry study.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore associations between comorbidities and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors.
METHODS: This registry study is based on data from the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (SRCR) collected during 2014-2017. HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure.
RESULTS: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1-q3) = 70 (50-80). Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 4-8% of the total variance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Since IHCA survivors with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous stroke.",Resuscitation,2023,Israelsson J | Koistinen L | Årestedt K | Rooth M | Bremer A,Journal Article,Humans | Quality of Life | Cross-Sectional Studies | Depression | Heart Arrest | Survivors | Stroke | Registries | Hospitals | Surveys and Questionnaires,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
37059353,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109794,Determinants of health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: With a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors globally, the focus of OHCA management has now broadened to survivorship. An outcome central to survivorship is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to the determinants of HRQoL of OHCA survivors.
METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 15 August 2022 to identify studies investigating the association of at least one determinant and HRQoL in adult OHCA survivors. All articles were independently reviewed by two investigators. We abstracted data pertaining to determinants and classified them using a well-established HRQoL theoretical framework - the Wilson and Cleary (revised) model.
RESULTS: 31 articles assessing a total of 35 determinants were included. Determinants were classified into the five domains in the HRQoL model. 26 studies assessed determinants related to individual characteristics (n = 3), 12 studied biological function (n = 7), nine studied symptoms (n = 3), 16 studied functioning (n = 5), and 35 studied characteristics of the environment (n = 17). In studies that included multivariable analyses, most reported that individual characteristics (older age, female sex), symptoms (anxiety, depression), and functioning (impaired neurocognitive function) were significantly associated with poorer HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual characteristics, symptoms, and functioning played significant roles in explaining the variability in HRQoL. Significant non-modifiable determinants such as age and sex could be used to identify populations at risk of poorer HRQoL, while significant modifiable determinants such as psychological health and neurocognitive functioning could serve as targets for post-discharge screening and rehabilitation plans.

This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS.
METHODS: This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2. Health-related quality of life was measured by questionnaires (Short Form-36 (SF-36)).
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with refractory OHCA were treated with MCS at Aarhus University Hospital between 2015 and 2019. The total low-flow time was median 105 min [IQR, 94-123] minutes. The hospital discharge rate was 27%. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 years ± 1.6 (range 2.8-6.1 years), 21 patients remained alive of whom 15 consented to participate in the present study. Good neurological outcome with CPC 1-2 was found in 93% (14/15) patients. No severe cognitive function was discovered; mean MoCA score of 26.4 ± 3.1. Functional capacity examined by CPX showed acceptable VO2 max values (23.9 ± 6.3 mL/kg/min). Mean SF-36 scores revealed an overall high level of quality of life in long-term survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival with a good neurological outcome with functional recovery was high in patients with refractory OHCA treated with MCS.

36928241,10.1136/heartjnl-2021-320559,One-year quality-of-life outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors by initial defibrillation provider.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term functional and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors stratified by initial defibrillation provider.
METHODS: This retrospective study included adult non-traumatic OHCA with initial shockable rhythms between 2010 and 2019. Survivors at 12 months after arrest were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews. Outcomes were identified using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and living and work status-related questions.
RESULTS: 6050 patients had initial shockable rhythms, 3211 (53.1%) had a pulse on hospital arrival, while 1879 (31.1%) were discharged alive. Bystander defibrillation using the closest automated external defibrillator had the highest survival rate (52.8%), followed by dispatched first responders (36.7%) and paramedics (27.9%). 1802 (29.8%) patients survived to 12-month postarrest; of these 1520 (84.4%) were interviewed. 1088 (71.6%) were initially shocked by paramedics, 271 (17.8%) by first responders and 161 (10.6%) by bystanders. Bystander-shocked survivors reported higher rates of living at home without care (87.5%, 75.2%, 77.0%, p<0.001), upper good recovery (GOS-E=8) (41.7%, 30.4%, 30.6%, p=0.002) and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) ≥80 (64.9%, 55.9%, 52.9%, p=0.003) compared with first responder and paramedics, respectively. After adjustment, initial bystander defibrillation was associated with higher odds of EQ-5D VAS ≥80 (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10; p=0.004), good functional recovery (GOS-E ≥7) (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.11; p=0.009), living at home without care (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.16-2.71; p=0.009) and returning to work (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.81; p=0.031) compared with paramedic defibrillation.

36849984,10.1186/s13054-023-04348-2,Incidence of near-death experiences in patients surviving a prolonged critical illness and their long-term impact: a prospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND: So far, the few prospective studies on near-death experience (NDE) were carried out only in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with homogeneous aetiologies, such as cardiac arrest or trauma survivors. The aims of this 1-year prospective and monocentric study were to investigate the incidence of NDE in ICU survivors (all aetiologies) as well as factors that may affect its frequency, and to assess quality of life up to 1 year after enrolment.
METHODS: We enrolled adults with a prolonged ICU stay (> 7 days). During the first 7 days after discharge, all eligible patients were assessed in a face-to-face interview for NDE using the Greyson NDE scale, dissociative experiences using the Dissociative Experience Scale, and spirituality beliefs using the WHOQOL-SRPB. Medical parameters were prospectively collected. At 1-year after inclusion, patients were contacted by phone to measure quality of life using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire.
RESULTS: Out of the 126 included patients, 19 patients (15%) reported having experienced a NDE as identified by the Greyson NDE scale (i.e. cut-off score ≥ 7/32). In univariate analyses, mechanical ventilation, sedation, analgesia, reason for admission, primary organ dysfunction, dissociative and spiritual propensities were associated with the emergence of NDE. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the dissociative and spiritual propensity strongly predicted the emergence of NDE. One year later (n = 61), the NDE was not significantly associated with quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The recall of NDE is not so rare in the ICU. In our cohort, cognitive and spiritual factors outweighed medical parameters as predictors of the emergence of NDE.

Recent studies showed promising results after osteosynthesis of rib fractures in trauma patients with flail segments or multiple rib fractures. However, there is a paucity of data on rib fixation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study evaluated the outcomes of patients who received rib fixation after CPR.
METHODS: Adult patients who received surgical fixation of rib fractures sustained during CPR between 2010 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. Outcome measures included complications, quality of life (EQ 5D 5L) and level of dyspnea.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included with a mean age of 66.8 years. The mean number of fractured ribs was ten, seven patients additionally had a sternum fracture. Pneumonia occurred in 15 patients (74%), of which 13 were diagnosed preoperatively and 2 post-operatively. Six patients developed a postoperative pneumothorax, none of which required revision surgery. One patient showed persistent flail chest after rib fixation and required additional fixation of a concomitant sternum fracture. One infection of the surgical site of sternal plate occurred, while no further surgery related complications were reported. Mean EQ-5D-5L was 0.908 and the average EQ VAS was 80. One patient reported persisting dyspnea.
CONCLUSION: To date, this is the largest reported cohort of patients who received rib fixation for fractures sustained during CPR. No complications associated with rib fixation were reported whereas one infection after sternal fixation did occur. Current follow-up demonstrated a good long-term quality of life after fixation, warranting further studies on this topic.

Not much is known about the impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its complications on long-term survival and quality of life.
METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we evaluated the survival and quality of life in patients treated with VA ECMO between May 2009 and July 2019. Follow-up was conducted between November 2019 and January 2020.
RESULTS: Overall, 118 patients were evaluated in this study. Of the 37 patients who were alive at hospital discharge, 32 answered the EuroQol-5 dimensional-5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). For patients discharged alive from the hospital, mean survival was 8.1 years, 8.4 years for cardiogenic shock, and 5.0 years for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. EQ-5D-5L index value of ECMO survivors was not significantly different from the general age-matched population. Neurologic complications and major bleeding during index hospitalization limit long-term quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with VA ECMO have high in-hospital mortality, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cardio-pulmonary resuscitation patients being at higher risk of early death.

It is unknown how HRQoL evolves over time, and assessments at different time points may lead to different results.
METHODS: In a NORCAST sub study, OHCA survivors eligible for health status (EQ-5D-3L) and HRQoL (SF-36) assessments were examinated six months and five years after OHCA. At five-year follow-up, survivors also retrospectively assessed their health status for each consecutive year following OHCA. The next of kin independently assessed health status and HRQoL of their respective OHCA survivors.
RESULTS: Among 138 survivors alive after six months and 117 after five years, 80 (88% male) completed both follow-ups. Health status and HRQoL remained stable over time, except for increasing SF-36 mental summary score and decreasing physical functioning and physical component score. Anxiety and depression levels were generally low, although younger survivors stated more anxiety than older survivors. Retrospective assessment showed reduced health status for the first two years, which increased only from the third year. Explorative analyses revealed that younger age, longer time to return of spontaneous circulation (tROSC) and late awakening affected health status, particularly in the first two years post-arrest.
CONCLUSIONS: OHCA survivors showed stable health status and HRQoL with only minor differences between six months and five years. Younger survivors with long tROSC, late awakening, and more anxiety and depression symptoms at six months, had reduced health status the first two years with significant improvements towards the fourth year.",Resuscitation,2022,Wimmer H | Benth JŠ | Lundqvist C | Andersen GØ | Henriksen J | Drægni T | Solberg P | Stær-Jensen H | Sunde K | Nakstad ER,Journal Article,"Male | Humans | Child, Preschool | Female | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Recovery of Function | Survivors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

The purpose of the study was to compare recovery across the first year between SCA survivors and other arrhythmia patients who received a first-time implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention, participating in a social cognitive theory (SCT) intervention.
METHODS: 168 (129 males, 39 females) who received an ICD for secondary prevention (SCA N = 65; other arrhythmia N = 103) were randomized to one of two study conditions: SCT intervention (N = 85) or usual care (N = 83). Outcomes were measured at baseline hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, & 12 months: (1) Physical Function: Patient Concerns Assessment (PCA), SF-36 (PCS); (2) Psychological Adjustment: State Trait Anxiety (STAI), CES-D depression, SF-36 (MCS); (3) Self-Efficacy: Self-Efficacy (SCA-SE), Self-management Behaviors (SMB), Outcome Expectations (OE).

The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52).

A systematic review.,"AIM: Our aim was to determine the association of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) with quality of life after discharge.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review using available databases for studies that measured any quality-of-life or functional outcome both before and after CPR for IHCA. All screening and data abstraction was performed in duplicate.
RESULTS: We screened 10,927 records and included 24 papers representing 20 unique studies. Fifteen studies measured Cerebral Performance Category. Survival ranged from 11.8% to 39.5%. The risk of impaired cerebral function after discharged ranged from -16.1% (lower risk) to 44.7% increased risk of poor cerebral function after surviving to discharge. Four studies measured discharge to an institutional environment finding that the risk was increased by 18.2-72.2% among survivors. One study measured EQ-5D and found no difference pre and post CPR. One study measured performance of activities of daily living finding that survivors needed assistance with more activities after discharge.

The aim of this study was to assess neurological outcomes at one year after resuscitated cardiac arrest; (2) Methods: This prospective, observational, and multicentre study included patients >18 yo admitted in the catheterisation laboratory for coronary angiography after aborted SCD between 1 May 2018 and 31 May 2020. Only patients who were discharged alive from hospital were evaluated. The primary endpoint was survival without neurological sequelae at one-year follow-up defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) of one or two. Secondary end points included all-cause mortality, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, neurologic evaluation at discharge, three-month and one-year follow-up using the CPC scale, and quality of life at 1 year using the Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) questionnaire; (3) Results: Among 143 patients admitted for SCD within the study period, 61 (42.7%) were discharged alive from hospital, among whom 55 (90.1%) completed the one-year follow-up. No flow and low flow times were 1.9 ± 2.4 min and 16.5 ± 10.4 min, respectively. For 93.4% of the surviving patients, an initial shockable rhythm (n = 57) was observed and acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed in 75.4% of them (n = 46). At 1 year, survival rate without neurologic sequelae was 87.2% (n = 48). Patients with poor outcome were older (69.3 vs. 57.4 yo; p = 0.04) and had lower body mass index (22.4 vs. 26.7; p = 0.013) and a lower initial Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) (32.1% vs. 40.3%; p = 0.046).

35426781,10.3310/vhoh9034,Supraglottic airway device versus tracheal intubation in the initial airway management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the AIRWAYS-2 cluster RCT.,"BACKGROUND: When a cardiac arrest occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be started immediately. However, there is limited evidence about the best approach to airway management during cardiac arrest.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether or not the i-gel® (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, UK) supraglottic airway is superior to tracheal intubation as the initial advanced airway management strategy in adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, open, parallel, two-group, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial. A cost-effectiveness analysis accompanied the trial.
SETTING: The setting was four ambulance services in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years who had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were attended by a participating paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent between June 2015 and August 2017. Follow-up ended in February 2018.
INTERVENTION: Paramedics were randomised 1 : 1 to use tracheal intubation (764 paramedics) or i-gel (759 paramedics) for their initial advanced airway management and were unblinded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge or 30 days after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whichever occurred earlier, collected by assessors blinded to allocation. The modified Rankin Scale, a measure of neurological disability, was dichotomised: a score of 0-3 (good outcome) or 4-6 (poor outcome/death). The primary outcome for the economic evaluation was quality-adjusted life-years, estimated using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version.
RESULTS: A total of 9296 patients (supraglottic airway group, 4886; tracheal intubation group, 4410) were enrolled [median age 73 years; 3373 (36.3%) women]; modified Rankin Scale score was known for 9289 patients. Characteristics were similar between groups. A total of 6.4% (311/4882) of patients in the supraglottic airway group and 6.8% (300/4407) of patients in the tracheal intubation group had a good outcome (adjusted difference in proportions of patients experiencing a good outcome: -0.6%, 95% confidence interval -1.6% to 0.4%). The supraglottic airway group had a higher initial ventilation success rate than the tracheal intubation group [87.4% (4255/4868) vs. 79.0% (3473/4397), respectively; adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 8.3%, 95% confidence interval 6.3% to 10.2%]; however, patients in the tracheal intubation group were less likely to receive advanced airway management than patients in the supraglottic airway group [77.6% (3419/4404) vs. 85.2% (4161/4883), respectively]. Regurgitation rate was similar between the groups [supraglottic airway group, 26.1% (1268/4865); tracheal intubation group, 24.5% (1072/4372); adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 1.4%, 95% confidence interval -0.6% to 3.4%], as was aspiration rate [supraglottic airway group, 15.1% (729/4824); tracheal intubation group, 14.9% (647/4337); adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 0.1%, 95% confidence interval -1.5% to 1.8%]. The longer-term outcomes were also similar between the groups (modified Rankin Scale: at 3 months, odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.14; at 6 months, odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.16). Sensitivity analyses did not alter the overall findings. There were no unexpected serious adverse events. Mean quality-adjusted life-years to 6 months were 0.03 in both groups (supraglottic airway group minus tracheal intubation group difference -0.0015, 95% confidence interval -0.0059 to 0.0028), and total costs were £157 (95% confidence interval -£270 to £583) lower in the tracheal intubation group. Although the point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio suggested that tracheal intubation may be cost-effective, the huge uncertainty around this result indicates no evidence of a difference between groups.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations included imbalance in the number of patients in each group, caused by unequal distribution of high-enrolling paramedics; crossover between groups; and the fact that participating paramedics, who were volunteers, might not be representative of all paramedics in the UK. Findings may not be applicable to other countries.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, randomisation to the supraglottic airway group compared with the tracheal intubation group did not result in a difference in outcome at 30 days. There were no notable differences in costs, outcomes and overall cost-effectiveness between the groups.
FUTURE WORK: Future work could compare alternative supraglottic airway types with tracheal intubation; include a randomised trial of bag mask ventilation versus supraglottic airways; and involve other patient populations, including children, people with trauma and people in hospital.

35195012,10.1161/jaha.121.022238,Cost Analysis From a Randomized Comparison of Immediate Versus Delayed Angiography After Cardiac Arrest.,"Background In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation, immediate coronary angiography did not improve clinical outcomes when compared with delayed angiography in the COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) trial. Whether 1 of the 2 strategies has benefits in terms of health care resource use and costs is currently unknown. We assess the health care resource use and costs in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods and Results A total of 538 patients were randomly assigned to a strategy of either immediate or delayed coronary angiography. Detailed health care resource use and cost-prices were collected from the initial hospital episode. A generalized linear model and a gamma distribution were performed. Generic quality of life was measured with the RAND-36 and collected at 12-month follow-up. Overall total mean costs were similar between both groups (EUR 33 575±19 612 versus EUR 33 880±21 044; P=0.86). Generalized linear model: (β, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.894-1.099; P=0.86). Mean procedural costs (coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft) were higher in the immediate angiography group (EUR 4384±3447 versus EUR 3028±4220; P<0.001). Costs concerning intensive care unit and ward stay did not show any significant difference. The RAND-36 questionnaire did not differ between both groups. Conclusions The mean total costs between patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest randomly assigned to an immediate angiography or a delayed invasive strategy were similar during the initial hospital stay. With respect to the higher invasive procedure costs in the immediate group, a strategy awaiting neurological recovery followed by coronary angiography and planned revascularization may be considered.

The University of Minnesota has offered a global pediatrics track to residents since 2005. This study aimed to understand the impacts of a global pediatrics track on graduates' career choices, skills, and current engagement in global health. An electronic survey was sent to 110 track graduates in February to April 2020. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Content analysis of written comments was conducted. The response rate was 62% overall, varying by question. Overall, 75% of responding graduates reported global pediatrics track participation affected their career choices. Eighty-four percent recalled plans to work in global health after graduation and 64% of respondents reported working in global health abroad or at home at the time of the survey. Incorporation of public health and global research represented the greatest percentage change in career plans from the time of enrollment to graduation (24% and 27%, respectively). Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that track participation improved their ability to elicit information about cultural beliefs and practices, and 86% reported improvement in cost-conscious care. An increase in global health knowledge and skills was the most common category of impact cited by respondents. Neonatal resuscitation, bubble continuous positive airway pressure, and homemade spacers for metered-dose inhalers were the most used global health-adapted skills. Our study found that graduates of the global pediatrics track perceive their participation affected their knowledge, skills, and attitudes positively, with the potential to improve clinical care and promote health equity locally and globally.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2022,Ojo I | Wu A | Lauden S | Slusher T | Gladding S | Danich E | Howard C,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,false,false
35111807,10.3389/fsurg.2021.830571,Clinical Effectiveness of Pre-hospital and In-hospital Optimized Emergency Care Procedures for Patients With Acute Craniocerebral Trauma.,"Acute craniocerebral injury is a common traumatic disease in clinical practice, characterized by rapid changes in condition and a high rate of death and disability. Early and effective emergency care throughout the pre-hospital and in-hospital period is the key to reducing the rate of death and disability and promoting the recovery of patients. In this study, we conducted an observational study of 130 patients with acute craniocerebral injury admitted between May 2020 and May 2021. Patients were randomly divided into a regular group and an optimization group of 65 patients each, with patients in the regular group receiving the conventional emergency care model and patients in the optimization group receiving the pre-hospital and in-hospital optimal emergency care process for intervention. In this study, we observed and compared the time taken to arrive at the scene, assess the condition, attend to the patient and provide emergency care, the success rate of emergency care within 48 h, the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) after admission and 1 day before discharge, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) after resuscitation and 1 day before discharge, and the complications of infection, brain herniation, central hyperthermia, and electrolyte disturbances in both groups. We collected and statistically analyzed the recorded data. The results showed that the time taken to arrive at the consultation site, assess the condition, receive the consultation, provide first aid was significantly lower in the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the success rate of treatment was significantly higher in the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05). In both groups, IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 decreased on the day before discharge compared with the day of rescue, with the levels of each index lower in the optimization group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the NIHSS scores decreased and the SF-36 scores increased on the day before discharge compared with the successful rescue in both groups, with the NIHSS scores in the optimization group lower than in the regular group and the SF-36 scores higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall complication rate in the optimization group was significantly lower than that in the regular group (P < 0.05). This shows that optimizing pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency care procedures can significantly shorten the time to emergency care for patients with acute craniocerebral injury, increase the success rate, reduce inflammation, improve neurological function and quality of life, reduce the occurrence of complications, and improve patient prognosis.",Frontiers in surgery,2021,Wang L | Wu R,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
34951692,10.1186/s13613-021-00975-6,Long-term follow-up and quality of life in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2019, European guidelines recommend considering extracorporeal life support as salvage strategy for the treatment of acute high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest. However, data on long-term survival, quality of life (QoL) and cardiopulmonary function after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking.
METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients with acute PE and severe cardiogenic shock or in need of mechanical resuscitation (CPR) received venoarterial or venovenous ECMO from 2007 to 2020. Long-term data were obtained from survivors by phone contact and personal interviews. Follow-up included a QoL analysis using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
RESULTS: The majority of patients (n = 80, 67%) were placed on ECMO during or after CPR with returned spontaneous circulation. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 45.4% (54/119). Nine patients died during follow-up. At a median follow-up of 54.5 months (25-73; 56 ± 38 months), 34 patients answered the QoL questionnaire. QoL differed largely and was slightly reduced compared to a German reference population (EQ5D5L index 0.7 ± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.04; p  < 0.01). 25 patients (73.5%) had no mobility limitations, 22 patients (65%) could handle their activities, while anxiety and depression were expressed by 10 patients (29.4%). Return-to-work status was 33.3% (average working hours: 36.2 ± 12.5 h/per week), 15 (45.4%) had retired from work early. 12 patients (35.3%) expressed limited exercise tolerance and dyspnea. 59% (20/34) received echocardiography and pulmonary function testing, 50% (17/34) cardiopulmonary exercise testing. No relevant impairment of right ventricular function and an only slightly reduced mean peak oxygen uptake (76.3% predicted) were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors from severe intractable PE in cardiogenic shock or even under CPR with ECMO seem to recover well with acceptable QoL and only minor cardiopulmonary limitations in the long term. To underline these results, further research with larger study cohorts must be obtained.",Annals of intensive care,2021,Stadlbauer A | Philipp A | Blecha S | Lubnow M | Lunz D | Li J | Terrazas A | Schmid C | Lange TJ | Camboni D,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
34856490,10.1016/j.jcrc.2021.11.008,In-depth assessment of health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence on physical and psychological well-being of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors is scarce. The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.
METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.
RESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5).
DISCUSSION: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL.",Journal of critical care,2022,Schluep M | Endeman H | Gravesteijn BY | Kuijs C | Blans MJ | van den Bogaard B | Van Gemert AWMMK | Hukshorn CJ | van der Meer BJM | Knook AHM | van Melsen T | Peters R | Simons KS | Spijkers G | Vermeijden JW | Wils EJ | Stolker RJ | Hoeks SE,"Journal Article | Multicenter Study | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult | Heart Arrest | Hospitals | Humans | Male | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survivors,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
34693481,10.1186/s13613-021-00939-w,Health-related quality of life in critically ill survivors: specific impact of cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm.,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care has a strong impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The specific impact of cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm is poorly known.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We gathered patients included in two randomized controlled trials (AWARE and HYPERION). The HYPERION trial included ICU-treated non-shockable cardiac arrest patients. The AWARE study included ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We compared the 3-months HRQOL of these patients to those of a large sample of the French general population. Physical and mental dimension were compared. Multivariable linear regression was used to pick up factors associated with HRQOL.
RESULTS: 72 and 307 patients of the HYPERION and the AWARE studies were compared to 20,574 French controls. ICU patients evidenced lower scores in all the SF-36 dimensions compared to the controls. Similar scores were observed in both HYPERION and AWARe trials. The physical component score was lower in patients from the HYPERION trial compared to those from the AWARE trials and to controls (38.6 [29.6-47.8], 35.4 [27.5-46.4] vs. 53.0 [46.0-56.7], [Formula: see text]). After adjustment for age and gender, HYPERION and AWARE trial status were associated wit lower physical component score.
CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of life of unshockable cardiac arrest survivors evaluated at 3 months was similar to ICU survivors and significantly lower than in individuals from general population, especially in the physical dimensions.",Annals of intensive care,2021,Geri G | Aissaoui N | Colin G | Cariou A | Lascarrou JB,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
34440953,10.3390/medicina57080747,Quality of Life Following Urgent LVAD Implantation for ECMO Therapy in Cardiogenic Shock: A Long-Term Follow-Up.,"Background and Objectives: Over the past decade, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has developed into a mainstream treatment for refractory cardiogenic shock (CS) to maximal conservative management. Successful weaning of VA-ECMO may not be possible, and bridging with further mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as urgent implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), may represent the only means to sustain the patient haemodynamically. In the recovery phase, many survivors are not suitably prepared physically or psychologically for the novel issues encountered during daily life with an LVAD. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of our institutional database between 2012 and 2019 was performed to identify patients treated with VA-ECMO for CS who underwent urgent LVAD implantation whilst on MCS. Post-cardiotomy cases were excluded. QoL was assessed prospectively during a routine follow-up visit using the EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 level (EQ-5D-5L) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys. Results: Among 126 in-hospital survivors of VA-ECMO therapy due to cardiogenic shock without prior cardiac surgery, 31 (24.6%) urgent LVAD recipients were identified. In 11 (36.7%) cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed (median 10, range 1-60 min) before initiation of VA-ECMO, and in 5 (16.7%) cases, MCS was established under CPR. Mean age at LVAD implantation was 51.7 (+/-14) years and surgery was performed after a mean 12.1 (+/-8) days of VA-ECMO support. During follow-up of 46.9 (+/-25.5) months, there were 10 deaths after 20.4 (+/-12.1) months of LVAD support. Analysis of QoL questionnaires returned a mean EQ-5D-5L score of 66% (+/-21) of societal valuation for Germany and a mean PHQ-9 score of 5.7 (+/-5) corresponding to mild depression severity. When compared with 49 elective LVAD recipients without prior VA-ECMO therapy, there was no significant difference in QoL results. Conclusions: Patients requiring urgent LVAD implantation under VA-ECMO support due to CS are associated with comparable quality of life without a significant difference from elective LVAD recipients. Close follow-up is required to oversee patient rehabilitation after successful initial treatment.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2021,Berger R | Hamdoun H | Sandoval Boburg R | Radwan M | Acharya M | Waeschle RM | Schlensak C | Popov AF | Risteski P,Journal Article,"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Follow-Up Studies | Humans | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Shock, Cardiogenic",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
34419126,10.1186/s13049-021-00928-9,A comprehensive description of self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors.,"BACKGROUND: Self-reported health and life satisfaction are considered important outcomes in people surviving cardiac arrest. However, most previous studies have reported limited aspects on health, often based on composite scores, and few studies have focused on life satisfaction. Investigating health aspects with a broad and detailed perspective is important to increase the knowledge of life after cardiac arrest from the perspective of survivors. In addition, the knowledge of potential differences in health among survivors related to place of arrest (in-hospital cardiac arrest; IHCA or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; OHCA) is scarce. The aim was to describe and compare self-reported health and life satisfaction in IHCA and OHCA survivors.  METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study included adult cardiac arrest survivors six months after resuscitation, treated at five Swedish hospitals between 2013 and 2018. Participants received a study specific questionnaire including Health Index (HI), EQ-5D 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Minimal Insomnia Sleeping Scale (MISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). In order to present characteristics descriptive statistics were applied. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fishers' exact test were used to compare differences in self-reported health and life satisfaction between in-hospital- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors RESULTS: In total, 212 survivors participated. Based on scale scores and general measures, the median scores of health and life satisfaction among survivors were high: HI total = 29, EQ VAS = 80, and SWLS = 20. According to HI, most problems were reported for tiredness (37.3 %) and strength (26.4 %), while pain/discomfort (57.5 %) and anxiety/depression (42.5 %) where most common according to EQ-5D-5L. Except for EQ-5D-5L mobility (p = 0.023), MSPSS significant other (p = 0.036), and MSPSS family (p = 0.043), no health differences in relation to place of arrest were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Although general health and life satisfaction were good among cardiac arrest survivors, several prevalent health problems were reported regardless of place of arrest. To achieve an improved understanding of health in cardiac arrest survivors, it is important to assess specific symptoms as a complement to composite scores of general, physical, emotional, and social health.","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",2021,Hellström P | Årestedt K | Israelsson J,Journal Article | Observational Study,Adult | Humans | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Personal Satisfaction | Quality of Life | Self Report | Survivors,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,false,false
34271127,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2021.07.006,Long-term survival and health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest.,"INTRODUCTION: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is an adverse event associated with high mortality. Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors.
METHODS: A multicentre prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. Patients ≥ 18 years receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by pre-arrest Modified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year.
RESULTS: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 69.7% was functionally independent.
CONCLUSION: One-year survival after IHCA in this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies. Survival is associated with a patient's pre-arrest functional status and morbidity. HRQoL appears acceptable, however functional rehabilitation warrants attention.

METHODS: We distributed an online survey to survivor and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. Participants provided demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models.
RESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (β: -0.35 to -0.53, p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in survivors and informal caregivers.

34223329,10.1016/j.resplu.2020.100057,"Subjective factors of depressive symptoms, ambulation, pain, and fatigue are associated with physical activity participation in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.","AIM: This study aimed to examine the associations between participation in physical activities and objective and subjective factors modifiable by rehabilitation in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.
METHODS: Participants in a clinical feasibility study (N = 19) completed several subjective (patient-reported) and objective outcome measures on one occasion only. The associations between an individual's level of participation in physical activities (Participation Objective Participation Subjective) and their levels of cognition (Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment), body movement (Keitel Functional Test), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), ambulation and pain (Health Utilities Index Mark 3), and fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were explored. Pearson's correlation coefficientr was calculated for all associations, except for body movement (Spearman's correlation coefficient rs ).
RESULTS: As hypothesized, we found weak-to-moderate, positive associations between participation in physical activities and objective factors of cognition (r = 0.370) and body movement (rs  = 0.414) and a subjective factor of ambulation ability (r = 0.501). We found moderate, negative associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors of depressive symptoms (r=-0.590), pain (r=-0.495), physical fatigue impact (r=-0.629), cognitive fatigue impact (r=-0.591), and psychosocial fatigue impact (r=-0.557).
CONCLUSION: The moderate, negative and positive associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors suggest that subjective complaints of depressive symptoms, ambulation ability, pain, and fatigue impact may be important factors when seeking to improve participation in physical activities. In particular, addressing physical and cognitive endurance as well as perceptions of fatigue may hold the key to increasing physical activity in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.",Resuscitation plus,2021,Kim YJ | Joshi V | Wu Q,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,false

Survivors completed the Questionnaire for the Quality of Provider-Patient Interactions (QQPPI), Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). When completing the QQPPI and RHDS, survivors were asked to think back to their hospitalization and discharge. QoL domains (physical, psychological, social) were measured via the WHO-QOL BREF. Three multiple regression models examined associations between QQPPI, RHDS, and B-IPQ scores with QoL domains, adjusted for age, sex, months since arrest, self-reported understanding of cardiac arrest and potential post-arrest symptoms at discharge, self-reported memory at discharge, and functional status as defined by the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.
RESULTS: A total of 163 survivors (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean time since arrest: 63.9 months) provided complete survey data. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.45, p ​< ​0.001) and lower readiness for discharge (β: 0.21, p ​= ​0.01) were associated with worse physical QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.47, p ​< ​0.001) was associated with worse psychological QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.28, p ​= ​0.001) and poor provider-patient communication (β: 0.35, p ​< ​0.001) were associated with worse social QoL.

We assessed long-term HRQoL in OHCA survivors and how known outcome predictors impact HRQoL.
METHODS: In adult OHCA survivors, HRQoL was assessed five years post arrest using Short-form 36 (SF-36), EQ-5D-3 L (EQ-5D) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) among others. Results were compared to the next of kins' estimates and to a Norwegian reference population.
RESULTS: Altogether 96 survivors were included mean 5.3 (range 3.6-7.2) years after OHCA. HRQoL compared well to the reference population, except for lower score for general health with 67.2 (95%CI (62.1; 72.3) vs. 72.9 (71.9; 74.0)), p = 0.03. Younger (≤58 years) vs. older survivors scored lower for general health with mean (SD) of 62.1 (27.5) vs. 73.0 (19.5), p = 0.03, vitality (55.2 (20.5) vs. 64.6 (17.3), p = 0.02, social functioning (75.3 (28.7) vs. 94.1 (13.5), p < 0.001 and mental component summary (49.0 (9.9) vs. 55.8 (6.7), p < 0.001. They scored higher for HADS-anxiety (4.8 (3.6 vs. 2.7 (2.5), p = 0.001, and had lower EQ-5D index (0.72 (0.34) vs. 0.84 (0.19), p = 0.04. Early vs. late awakeners had higher EQ-5D index (0.82 (0.23) vs. 0.71 (0.35), p = 0.04 and lower HADS-depression scores (2.5 (2.9) vs. 3.8 (2.3), p = 0.04.

33524488,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2021.01.019,Long term outcomes of participants in the PARAMEDIC2 randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"AIMS: We recently reported early outcomes in patients enrolled in a randomised trial of adrenaline in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the PARAMEDIC2 (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) trial. The purpose of the present paper is to report long-term survival, quality of life, functional and cognitive outcomes at 3, 6 and 12-months.
METHODS: PARAMEDIC2 was a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with an economic evaluation. Patients were randomised to either adrenaline or placebo. This paper reports results on the modified Rankin Scale scores at 6-months, survival at 6 and 12-months, as well as other cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes collected at 3 and 6 months (Two Simple Questions, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline Evaluation for Cardiac Arrest, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, Short-Form 12-item Health Survey and the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L).
RESULTS: 8014 patients were randomised with confirmed trial drug administration. At 6-months, 78 (2.0%) of the patients in the adrenaline group and 58 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo group had a favourable neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.97]). 117 (2.9%) patients were alive at 6-months in the adrenaline group compared with 86 (2.2%) in the placebo group (1.43 [1.05, 1.96], reducing to 107 (2.7%) and 80 (2.0%) respectively at 12-months (1.38 [1.00, 1.92]). Measures of 3 and 6-month cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes were reduced, but there was no strong evidence of differences between groups.

40969403,10.1016/j.jadr.2020.100046,Associations between depression and anxiety symptoms with quality of life in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery and informal caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors.,"BACKGROUND: Surviving cardiac arrest is characterized by cognitive, psychological, and functional impairments and apprehension over long-term prognosis. We first estimated the proportion of clinically significant depression and anxiety in cardiac arrest survivors and their informal caregivers, then examined the association between depression and anxiety with worse quality of life (QoL).
METHODS: In an online survey, cardiac arrest survivors and caregivers reported demographic and arrest characteristics, the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and the WHOQOL-BREF physical, psychological, and social QoL subscales. Six multiple regression models (three for survivors and three for caregivers) tested associations between PHQ-4 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for the following: for survivors - functional dependence, self-reported memory problems, sex, income, months since arrest, and age; for caregivers - months since arrest, age, and income.
RESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean age: 50.8 years, 49.7% women, positive depression screen: 21.3%, anxiety: 29.6%) and 52 caregivers (mean age: 48.7 years, 86.5% women, positive depression screen: 21.2%, anxiety: 36.5%). In adjusted models, depression and anxiety were associated with worse QoL on each subscale (β: -0.39-0.7, p < .01).
LIMITATIONS: We assessed depression and anxiety and QoL cross-sectionally, which cannot exclude bi-directionality. Further, there was a selection bias in our survey, as the majority of survivors were of good neurologic recovery.
CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety were moderately associated with worse QoL over functional dependence and memory problems in survivors, and worse QoL in caregivers. Future study should explore the feasibility of dyadic interventions in cardiac arrest survivors and informal caregivers.",Journal of affective disorders reports,2020,Presciutti A | Newman MM | Vranceanu AM | Shaffer JA | Perman SM,Journal Article,,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

It showed no difference between the two groups in the primary outcome of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 30 days/hospital discharge. This paper reports outcomes to 6 months.
METHODS: Paramedics from four ambulance services in England were randomised 1:1 to use an i-gel SGA (759 paramedics) or TI (764 paramedics) as their initial approach to AAM. Adults who had a non-traumatic OHCA and were attended by a participating paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent. Survivors were invited to complete questionnaires at three and six months after OHCA. Outcomes were analysed using regression methods.
RESULTS: 767/9296 (8.3%) enrolled patients survived to 30 days/hospital discharge and 317/767 survivors (41.3%) consented and were followed-up to six months. No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups in the primary outcome measure (mRS score: 3 months: odds ratio (OR) for good recovery (i-gel/TI, OR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.69-1.14; 6 months OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71-1.16). EQ-5D-5L scores were also similar between groups and sensitivity analyses did not alter the findings.
CONCLUSION: There were no statistically significant differences between the TI and i-gel groups at three and six months. We therefore conclude that the initially reported finding of no significant difference between groups at 30 days/hospital discharge was sustained when the period of follow-up was extended to six months.",Resuscitation,2020,Benger JR | Lazaroo MJ | Clout M | Voss S | Black S | Brett SJ | Kirby K | Nolan JP | Reeves BC | Robinson M | Scott LJ | Smartt H | South A | Taylor J | Thomas M | Wordsworth S | Rogers CA,"Journal Article | Randomized Controlled Trial | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult | Airway Management | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Emergency Medical Services | England | Humans | Intubation, Intratracheal | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,false,true

The aim of this study is therefore to describe and compare HRQoL in patients surviving OHCA and IHCA.
METHODS: Patients ≥18 years with Cerebral Performance Category 1-3 included in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2014 and 2017 were included. A telephone interview was performed based on a questionnaire sent 3-6 months post cardiac arrest, including EQ-5D-5L and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear- and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to describe and compare HRQoL in OHCA and IHCA survivors. Adjustments were made for sex, age and initial rhythm.
RESULTS: In all, 1369 IHCA and 772 OHCA survivors were included. Most OHCA and IHCA survivors reported no symptoms of with anxiety (88% and 84%) or depression (87% and 85%). IHCA survivors reported significantly more problems in the health domains mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain/discomfort (p < 0.001 for all) and scored lower general health measured by EQ-VAS (median 70 vs. 80 respectively, p < 0.001) compared with the OHCA survivors.

This paper presents the design and rationale of the TTM2-trial follow-up, where information on secondary and exploratory outcomes will be collected. We also present the explorative outcome analyses which will focus on neurocognitive function and societal participation in OHCA-survivors.
METHODS: Blinded outcome-assessors will perform follow-up at 30-days after the OHCA with a telephone interview, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). Face-to-face meetings will be performed at 6 and 24-months, and include reports on outcome from several sources of information: clinician-reported: mRS, GOSE; patient-reported: EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level responses version (EQ-5D-5L), Life satisfaction, Two Simple Questions; observer-reported: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA) and neurocognitive performance measures: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Exploratory analyses will be performed with an emphasis on brain injury in the survivors, where the two intervention groups will be compared for potential differences in neuro-cognitive function (MoCA, SDMT) and societal participation (GOSE).

31678408,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.10.021,One-year outcome of patients admitted after cardiac arrest compared to other causes of ICU admission. An ancillary analysis of the observational prospective and multicentric FROG-ICU study.,"OBJECTIVE: While cardiac arrest (CA) patients discharged alive from intensive care unit (ICU) are considered to have good one-year survival but potential neurological impairment, comparisons with other ICU sub-populations non-admitted for CA purpose are still lacking. This study aimed to compare long-term outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between CA patients and patients admitted to ICU for all other causes.
METHODS: In 1635 patients discharged alive from 21 European ICUs in an ancillary analysis of a prospective multicentric cohort, we compared CA causes of ICU admission to all other causes of ICU admissions (named non-CAs). The primary endpoint was one-year survival rate after ICU discharge. Secondary endpoints included HRQOL at 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge using the outcome survey short form-36 (SF36). Propensity score matching was used to consider the probability of having CA.
RESULTS: Of the 1635 patients, 1561 were included in this study comprised of 1447 non-CAs and 114 CAs. At one-year in the non-matched population, survival rate was greater in the CA group 89% versus the non-CA group 78% (log rank p = 0.0056). In the matched population, this difference persisted between CAs and non-CAs (log rank p = 0.049). The physical component summary of the SF36 scale was higher in the CA group than in the non-CA group at all time points in both non-matched and matched populations.
CONCLUSIONS: CA patients discharged alive from ICU have a better one-year survival and a better HRQOL specifically on physical functions than patients admitted to ICU for other causes.

31663077,10.5606/tftrd.2019.2758,"Effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on pulmonary arterial hypertension: A prospective, randomized study.","OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) on cardiopulmonary function, quality of life, depression, and hemodynamic parameters in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and to compare the efficacy of hospital- and home-based exercise programs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2014 to May 2016, a total of 30 patients with PAH were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to either a hospital-based (n=15) or home-based exercise program (n=15). The hospital group was assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation (three days/week, 1 hour/week 50 to 70% maximal oxygen uptake [PvO2]) program for eight weeks. The home-based exercise group received home exercises alone. Before and after eight weeks of rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated for their functional status (PvO2), pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1), mL, forced vital capacity (FVC), mL and FEV1/FVC%, quality of life using Short Form-36 (SF-36), depression severity using Beck Depression Inventory, and hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 12 completed the study in each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional status, quality of life, depression severity, and hemodynamic parameters after the rehabilitation compared baseline between the groups.

31594555,10.3310/hta23550,The AMBER care bundle for hospital inpatients with uncertain recovery nearing the end of life: the ImproveCare feasibility cluster RCT.,"BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to hospital with a terminal illness and uncertain recovery often receive inconsistent care and do not have the opportunity to die in their preferred place of death. Previous end-of-life care packages, such as the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient, have sometimes been badly implemented. The AMBER (Assessment; Management; Best practice; Engagement; Recovery uncertain) care bundle was developed to remedy this. It has not been evaluated in a randomised trial, but a definitive trial would face many hurdles.
OBJECTIVE: To optimise the design of and determine the feasibility of a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial of the AMBER care bundle compared with best standard care.
DESIGN: A feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial including semistructured interviews with patients and relatives, focus groups with health-care professionals, non-participant observations of multidisciplinary team meetings, a standard care survey, heat maps and case note reviews. Retrospective data were collected from the family or close friends of deceased patients via a bereavement survey.
SETTING: Four general medical wards at district general hospitals in England.
PARTICIPANTS: There were 65 participants (control, n = 36; intervention, n = 29). There were 24 interviews, four focus groups, 15 non-participant meeting observations, six case note reviews and three heat maps, and 15 of out 23 bereavement, standard care surveys were completed.
INTERVENTION: The AMBER care bundle is implemented by a nurse facilitator. It includes the development and documentation of a medical plan, consideration of outcomes, resuscitation and escalation status and daily plan revisiting. The AMBER care bundle encourages staff, patients and families to talk openly about their preferences and priorities should the worst happen.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two 'candidate' primary outcomes were selected to be evaluated for a future definitive trial: Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale patient/family anxiety and communication subscale and 'howRwe'. The secondary outcome measures were Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale symptoms, Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status scale, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, Client Service Receipt Inventory, recruitment rate, intervention fidelity and intervention acceptability.
RESULTS: Data were collected for 65 patients. This trial was not powered to measure clinical effectiveness, but variance and changes observed in the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale subscale indicated that this measure would probably detect differences within a definitive trial. It was feasible to collect data on health, social and informal care service use and on quality of life at two time points. The AMBER care bundle was broadly acceptable to all stakeholders and was delivered as planned. The emphasis on 'clinical uncertainty' prompted health-care professional awareness of often-overlooked patients. Reviewing patients' AMBER care bundle status was integrated into routine practice. Refinements included simplifying the inclusion criteria and improving health-care professional communication training. Improvements to trial procedures included extending the time devoted to recruitment and simplifying consent procedures. There was also a recommendation to reduce data collected from patients and relatives to minimise burden.
LIMITATIONS: The recruitment rate was lower than anticipated. The inclusion criteria for the trial were difficult to interpret. Information sheets and consent procedures were too detailed and lengthy for the target population. Health-care professionals' enthusiasm and specialty were not considered while picking trial wards. Participant recruitment took place later during hospital admission and the majority of participants were lost to follow-up because they had been discharged. Those who participated may have different characteristics from those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility trial has demonstrated that an evaluation of the AMBER care bundle among an acutely unwell patient population, although technically possible, is not practical or feasible. The intervention requires optimisation.

31539607,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.09.006,Factors associated with return to work among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of global mortality, survival rates have increased over the last decade. As such, there is an increasing need to explore long-term functional outcomes of survivors, such as return to work (RTW).
METHODOLOGY: We analysed baseline and 12-month follow-up data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry for patients that arrested between 2010 and 2016 who were working prior to their arrest. We also conducted more detailed RTW interviews in a subset of OHCA survivors who arrested between July and September 2017. Factors associated with RTW were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 884 previously working survivors were included in the analysis, 650 (73%) of whom RTW. Male sex (AOR 1.80; 95%CI: 1.10-2.94), arrests witnessed by emergency medical services (AOR 2.72; 95%CI: 1.50-9.25), discharge directly home from hospital (AOR 4.13; 95%CI: 2.38-7.18) and favourable 12-month health-related quality of life according to the EQ-5D were associated with RTW. Increasing age (AOR 0.97; 95%CI: 0.95-0.98), traumatic arrest aetiology (AOR 0.18; 95%CI: 0.04-0.77), and labour-intensive occupations (AOR 0.44; 95%CI: 0.29-0.66) were associated with decreased odds of RTW. Of the 23 OHCA survivors that participated in the more detailed RTW telephone-interview, 87% RTW. Flexible work hours or modified duties were offered to 74% of participants. Fatigue was the most frequently reported barrier to RTW.
CONCLUSION: This is the largest study to collectively examine factors associated with RTW among survivors of OHCA. Although larger qualitative studies are needed, our findings highlight which patients are at risk of not RTW and who may benefit from targeted rehabilitation strategies.",Resuscitation,2020,Kearney J | Dyson K | Andrew E | Bernard S | Smith K,Journal Article,Australia | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Emergency Medical Services | Fatigue | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Qualitative Research | Quality of Life | Registries | Return to Work | Survivors | Work Performance,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
31272987,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029756,One-year longitudinal study of psychological distress and self-assessed health in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have investigated the psychological and health-related outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) over time. This longitudinal study aims to evaluate psychological distress in terms of anxiety and depression, self-assessed health and predictors of these outcomes in survivors of OHCA, 3 and 12 months after resuscitation.
METHODS: Recruitment took place from 2008 to 2011 and survivors of OHCA were identified through the national Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, survival ≥12 months and a Cerebral Performance Category score ≤2. Questionnaires containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) were administered at 3 and 12 months after the OHCA. Participants were also asked to report treatment-requiring comorbidities.
RESULTS: Of 298 survivors, 85 (29%) were eligible for this study and 74 (25%) responded. Clinically relevant anxiety was reported by 22 survivors at 3 months and by 17 at 12 months, while clinical depression was reported by 10 at 3 months and 4 at 12 months. The mean EQ-5D-3L index value increased from 0.82 (±0.26) to 0.88 (±0.15) over time. There were significantly less symptoms of psychological distress (p=0.01) and better self-assessed health (p=0.003) at 12 months. Treatment-requiring comorbidity predicted anxiety (OR 4.07, p=0.04), while being female and young age predicted poor health (OR 6.33, p=0.04; OR 0.91, p=0.002) at 3 months. At 12 months, being female was linked to anxiety (OR 9.23, p=0.01) and depression (OR 14.78, p=0.002), while young age predicted poor health (OR 0.93, p=0.003).
CONCLUSION: The level of psychological distress and self-assessed health improves among survivors of OHCA between 3 and 12 months after resuscitation. Higher levels of psychological distress can be expected among female survivors and those with comorbidity, while survivors of young age and who are female are at greater risk of poor health.",BMJ open,2019,Viktorisson A | Sunnerhagen KS | Johansson D | Herlitz J | Axelsson Å,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Anxiety | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Depression | Female | Humans | Logistic Models | Longitudinal Studies | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Patient Discharge | Psychometrics | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Registries | Self-Assessment | Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survivors | Sweden | Time Factors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
31066213,10.1002/ehf2.12433,Health-related quality of life after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a single centre's experience.,"AIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQL) among patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in northern Norway over a period of 27 years (1988-2015) and to identify variables related to HRQL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective inquiry of the ECMO registry at the University Hospital of North Norway identified 74 ECMO-treated patients (mean age 49 years, 65% males). Acute cardiac failure was the dominant indication (58%), and venoarterial ECMO was the dominant mode of treatment (87%). Mortality for discharged patients was recorded on 20 September 2016. Thirty (41%) survivors were identified. Twenty-three survivors were eligible for the survey and received a set of questionnaires at home. The main outcome measure was HRQL as measured with the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36) (RAND Short Form-36 v1.2). Other questionnaires covered demographic information, problems with functioning in usual daily activities (such as hobbies, household chores, family, or work), employment status, and psychological distress. The survey was completed by 20 (87%) survivors (mean age = 49 years, 12 men). Indications for ECMO treatment (VA = 90%) had been respiratory failure (25%), cardiac failure (60%), and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (15%). The average time since ECMO treatment was 6.5 years. Seventy-five percent reported mental HRQL (SF-36 Mental Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 5) or physical HRQL (SF-36 Physical Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 4.5) within the normal range (T = 50 ± 10) in comparison with age-matched population data from national norms. Half of the responders reported problems on the SF-36 subscales general health and role physical. Seventy percent reported problems on the SF-36 subscale role emotional. All but one responder lived independently without any organized care, and 90% reported no problems related to basic self-care. Half of those in working age had returned to work after ECMO treatment. Forty percent of the responders reported some degree of restrictions in usual daily activities, problems with mobility (35%), anxiety/depression (35%), or pain/discomfort (55%). Significant univariate associations were observed for poorer HRQL and higher reports of psychological distress, pain, and experiencing restrictions in usual everyday activities. Improved HRQL was significantly related to an extended time since ECMO treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey indicates an overall positive long-term HRQL outcome for our ECMO survivors. A subset reported problems with functioning and HRQL. Future research should focus on identification of the survivors at risk for poor recovery who may benefit from rehabilitation interventions.",ESC heart failure,2019,Ørbo MC | Karlsen SF | Pedersen EP | Hermansen SE | Rønning PB | Nergaard KA | Naesheim T | Myrmel T,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent | Adult | Aged | Child | Child, Preschool | Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Female | Humans | Infant | Male | Middle Aged | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Self Report | Young Adult",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial.
SETTING: Fifty-one hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Hong Kong, and the Republic of Ireland.
PATIENTS: One-thousand five-hundred ninety-one patients who presented to the emergency department with early septic shock between October 2008 and April 2014, and were enrolled in the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Early goal-directed therapy versus usual care.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Long-term survival was measured up to 12 months postrandomization. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQoL-5D-3L, Short Form 36 and Assessment of Quality of Life 4D at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months following randomization. Mortality data were available for 1,548 patients (97.3%) and 1,515 patients (95.2%) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Health-related quality of life data were available for 85.1% of survivors at 12 months. There were no significant differences in mortality between groups at either 6 months (early goal-directed therapy 21.8% vs usual care 22.6%; p = 0.70) or 12 months (early goal-directed therapy 26.4% vs usual care 27.9%; p = 0.50). There were no group differences in health-related quality of life at either 6 or 12 months (EuroQoL-5D-3L utility scores at 12 mo early goal-directed therapy 0.65 ± 0.33 vs usual care 0.64 ± 0.34; p = 0.50), with the health-related quality of life of both groups being significantly lower than population norms.

In this study, we assess the impact of sex on 12 month functional recovery and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes in OHCA survivors.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, consecutive adult OHCA survivors were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and 12-Item Short Form (SF-12) health survey.
RESULTS: Of the 2300 patients discharged alive, 175 (7.6%) died during the follow-up period with the rate of death at 12 months being higher in women compared to men (10.4% vs. 6.4%; p = 0.002). Of the 2125 12 month survivors, 1752 (82.5%) participated in the interviews. Unadjusted outcomes were consistently poorer for females compared to males, with fewer women reporting good functional recovery (GOSE ≥ 7, 53.5% vs. 64.8%, p < 0.001) and living at home without care (60.7% vs. 76.4%, p < 0.001). After adjustment, female sex reduced the odds of good functional recovery (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88; p = 0.004), living at home without care (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.76; p < 0.001), an EQ-5D index score of 1 (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.75; p < 0.001), an SF-12 mental component summary ≥50 (AOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.78; p = 0.001) and an SF-12 physical component summary ≥50 (AOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71; p < 0.001).

30716427,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.01.027,Cost-utility of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients with cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a resource-intensive tool that provides haemodynamic and respiratory support in patients who have suffered cardiac arrest. In this study, we investigated the cost-utility of ECPR (cost/QALY) in cardiac arrest patients treated at our institution.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who received ECPR following cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2018. All medical care-associated charges with ECPR and subsequent hospital admission were recorded. The quality-of-life of survivors was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark II. The cost-utility of ECPR was calculated with cost and quality-of-life data.
RESULTS: ECPR was used in 32 patients (15/32 in-hospital, 47%) with a median age of 55.0 years (IQR 46.3-63.3 years), 59% male and 66% African American. The median duration of ECPR support was 2.1 days (IQR 0.9-3.8 days). Survival to hospital discharge was 16%. The median score of the Health Utilities Index Mark II at discharge for the survivors was 0.44 (IQR 0.32-0.52). The median operating cost for patients undergoing ECMO was $125,683 per patient (IQR $49,751-$206,341 per patient). The calculated cost-utility for ECPR was $56,156/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The calculated cost-utility is within the threshold considered cost-effective in the United States (<$150,000/QALY gained). These results are comparable to the cost-effectiveness of heart transplantation for end-stage heart failure. Larger studies are needed to assess the cost-utility of ECPR and to identify whether other factors, such as patient characteristics, affect the cost-utility benefit.",Resuscitation,2019,Bharmal MI | Venturini JM | Chua RFM | Sharp WW | Beiser DG | Tabit CE | Hirai T | Rosenberg JR | Friant J | Blair JEA | Paul JD | Nathan S | Shah AP,Journal Article,Adult | Aged | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Cost-Benefit Analysis | Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Female | Hospital Costs | Humans | Length of Stay | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Quality-Adjusted Life Years | Registries | Retrospective Studies,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,false,true
30534984,10.1093/ejcts/ezy374,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory cardiogenic shock: patient survival and health-related quality of life.,"OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study the outcome of patients with cardiogenic shock who were treated with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), including the subsequent long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 133 consecutive patients treated in a single centre from 2007 to 2016. The HRQoL was studied using the EuroQuol-5 dimensions-3 level questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey at a minimum of 1 year after VA ECMO.
RESULTS: Of all patients, 66 (49.6%) were weaned from VA ECMO and 16 (12.0%) patients were bridged directly to a transplant, 15 (11.3%) to a ventricular assist device and 1 (0.8%) to a total artificial heart. Survival to discharge was 63.9% and to 1 year, 60.9%. A higher in-hospital mortality rate was independently associated with lower HCO3 at VA ECMO implantation [odds ratio (OR) 1.2/decrease of 1 mmol/l in HCO3 (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.3, P < 0.001)] and with increased need of red blood cells transfused during intensive care [OR 1.9/unit of red blood cells needed/day (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6, P  < 0.001)]. HRQoL measured with the EuroQuol-5 dimensions-3 level questionnaire was equal to the HRQoL of the general population. In the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire, patients reported better emotional well-being and equal energy, pain and general health perception compared to the general population. Limitations were experienced only in physical health. In total, 56% of the patients ≤ 60 years had returned to work.
CONCLUSIONS: VA ECMO can provide acceptable long-term survival with good HRQoL for selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. Timing of patient assessment and of VA ECMO implantation is essential because deeper acidosis is associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate.",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019,Jäämaa-Holmberg S | Salmela B | Suojaranta R | Jokinen JJ | Lemström KB | Lommi J,Journal Article,"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Shock, Cardiogenic | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survival Analysis",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 990 adults treated with an ICD after suffering CA. All participants received a questionnaire including demographics, comorbidities and instruments to measure HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L and HADS), ICD-related concerns (ICDC), perceived control (CAS), and type D personality (DS-14). HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) was compared to a general Swedish population, matched for age and gender. Linear regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with HRQoL.
RESULTS: The CA survivors reported better HRQoL in EQ index and less pain/discomfort compared to the general population (p < 0.001). In contrast, they reported more problems in mobility and usual activities (p < 0.01). Problems with anxiety and depression were reported by 15.5% and 7.4% respectively. The following factors were independently associated with all aspects of worse HRQoL: being unemployed, suffering more comorbidity, perceiving less control, and having a type D personality. Further, being female and suffering ICD-related concerns were independently associated with worse HRQoL in three of the four final regression models.
CONCLUSIONS: This extensive population-based study showed that most CA survivors living with an ICD rate their HRQoL as acceptable. In addition, their HRQoL is similar to a general population. Women reported worse HRQoL compared to men. Several factors associated with HRQoL were identified, and might be used when screening patients for health problems and when developing health promoting interventions.",Resuscitation,2018,Israelsson J | Thylén I | Strömberg A | Bremer A | Årestedt K,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Activities of Daily Living | Aged | Anxiety | Case-Control Studies | Cross-Sectional Studies | Defibrillators, Implantable | Depression | Female | Heart Arrest | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Quality of Life | Registries | Sex Factors | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survivors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,false

Whether mortality, ICD shock and readmission are predicted by patient-reported outcomes is unknown.
AIM: The aim of this study was to describe patient-reported outcomes among patients with ICDs compared by: ICD indication and generator type (ICD or cardiac resynchronisation therapy ICD), and to determine whether patient-reported outcomes at discharge predict mortality, ICD therapy and readmission.
METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey at hospital discharge ( n=998) with register follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short Form-12, HeartQoL, EQ-5D and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Register data: ICD therapy, readmissions and mortality within one year following discharge.
RESULTS: Patients with primary prevention ICDs had significantly worse patient-reported outcomes at discharge than patients with secondary prevention ICDs. Likewise, patients with cardiac resynchronisation therapy ICDs had significantly worse patient-reported outcomes at discharge than patients without cardiac resynchronisation therapy. One-year mortality was predicted by patient-reported outcomes, with the highest hazard ratio (HR) being anxiety (HR 2.02; 1.06-3.86), but was not predicted by indication or cardiac resynchronisation therapy. ICD therapy and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation were not predicted by patient-reported outcomes, indication or cardiac resynchronisation therapy. Overall, patient-reported outcomes predicted readmissions, e.g. symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted all readmissions within 3 months (HR 1.50; 1.13-1.98) and 1.47 (1.07-2.03), respectively).
CONCLUSION: Patients with primary indication ICDs and cardiac resynchronisation therapy ICDs report worse patient-reported outcomes than patients with secondary indication and no cardiac resynchronisation therapy.

However, the impact of WCD therapy on quality of life (QoL) has not been studied.
METHODS: In our single-centre study, 109 consecutive patients with a prescription of WCD were retrospectively analysed. Quality of life has been assessed by a standardized questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L, modified). Additionally, clinical baseline and follow-up data and recorded arrhythmic episodes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean WCD therapy time was 56.2 (± 42.4) days, with a daily wear time of 19.7 (± 5) hours. A total of 3441 arrhythmia episodes were detected. Of these, 27 (1%) were adequate but did not require shock therapy. Likewise, no inadequate shock therapy occurred. WCD therapy negatively affected quality of life: 43% of patients reported mental health issues. 37% reported pain or discomfort. Self-care, usual activities, and mobility were restricted in 17%, 48%, and 36%, respectively. 29% were afraid of receiving shock therapy, and 48% suffered from sleep disturbance. However, 64% indicated having felt safe during WCD therapy. Accordingly, average quality of life was rated 70/100 points.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, no SCD was prevented by WCD therapy. In contrast, in this preliminary study quality of life was reduced. Thus, careful recommendation of WCD therapy for high risk patients should be considered.",BioMed research international,2018,Lackermair K | Schuhmann CG | Kubieniec M | Riesinger LM | Klier I | Stocker TJ | Kääb S | Estner HL | Fichtner S,Journal Article,"Adult | Aged | Death, Sudden, Cardiac | Defibrillators | Electric Countershock | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Wearable Electronic Devices",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
29880571,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021729,Well-being among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a cross-sectional retrospective study in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVES: The psychological outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been studied more extensively in recent years. Still, not much is known about the well-being among OHCA survivors. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we aim to investigate post-OHCA well-being among patients with a good neurological outcome, 3 months after the cardiac event. To assess well-being, we analyse the frequency of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and health within this group. Further, we aim to evaluate the importance of five prognostic factors for post-OHCA well-being.
METHODS: Data collection took place between 2008 and 2012, and every OHCA survivor within one region of Sweden, with a cerebral performance category (CPC) score of ≤2 at discharge, was asked to participate. Survivors were identified through the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry, and postal questionnaires were sent out 3 months after the OHCA. The survey included Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), PTSD Checklist Civilian version (PCL-C) and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 level (EQ-5D-3L).
RESULTS: Of 298 survivors, 150 were eligible for this study and 94 responded. The mean time from OHCA to follow-up was 88 days. There was no significant difference between respondents and non-respondents in terms of sex, age, cardiac arrest circumstances or in-hospital interventions. 48 participants reported reduced well-being, and young age was the only factor significantly correlated to this outcome (p=0.02). Women reported significantly higher scores in HADS (p=0.001) and PCL-C (p<0.001). Women also reported significantly lower EQ-5D index values (p=0.002) and EQ-visual analogue scale scores (p=0.002) compared with men.
CONCLUSION: Reduced well-being is experienced by half of OHCA survivors with a CPC score ≤2, and young age is negatively correlated to this outcome.

We assessed long-term functional outcome and health-related QoL of OHCA survivors regardless of arrest aetiology.
METHODS: All adult unconscious OHCA patients treated in 21 Finnish ICUs between March 2010 and February 2011 were followed. Barthel Index (BI), activities of daily living (ADL), accommodation, help needed and received, working status, car driving and self-experienced cognitive deficits were assessed in 1-year survivors (N = 206, 40.9% of the original FINNRESUSCI cohort) with a structured telephone interview. Health-related QoL and more complex ADL-functions were evaluated by EQ-5D and instrumental ADL questionnaires.
RESULTS: Good outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 1 or 2, had been reached by 90.3% of survivors. The median BI score was 100, and 91.3% of survivors were independent in basic ADL-functions. The great majority of survivors were living at home, only 8.7% lived in a sheltered home or needed institutionalized care. Of home-living survivors 71.4% scored high in instrumental ADL assessment. The majority (72.6%) of survivors who were working previously had returned to work. Health-related QoL was similar as in age- and gender-adjusted Finnish population.

29750022,10.2147/cia.s158344,Longer-term quality of life following major trauma: age only significantly affects outcome after the age of 80 years.,"AIM: Against the background of conflicting data on the topic, this study aimed to determine the differences in longer-term patient outcomes following major trauma with regard to age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective trauma center survey of survivors of trauma (≥16 years) was carried out employing a New Injury Severity Score (NISS) ≥8 to investigate the influence of age on working capacity and several outcome scores, such as the trauma medical outcomes study Short Form-36 (physical component [PCS] and mental component [MCS]), the Euro Quality of Life (EuroQoL), or the Trauma Outcome Profile (TOP) at least 1 year following injury. Chi square tests, t-tests, and Pearson correlations were used as univariate; stepwise regression as multivariate analysis. Significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS: In all, 718 major trauma patients (53.4±19.4 years; NISS 18.4±9.2) participated in the study. Multivariate analysis showed only low associations of patient or trauma characteristics with longer-term outcome scores, highest for the Injury Severity Score of the extremities with the PCS (R2=0.08) or the working capacity of employed patients (n=383; R2=0.04). For age, overall associations were even lower (best with the PCS, R2=0.04) or could not be revealed at all (TOP or MCS). Subgroup analysis with regard to decennia revealed the age effect to be mainly attributable to patients aged ≥80, who presented with a significantly worse outcome compared to younger people in all overall and physical component scores (p<0.001). In patients under 80 years an association of age was only found for EuroQoL (R2=0.01) and the PCS (R2=0.03).
CONCLUSION: Given the small impact of age on the longer-term outcomes of major trauma patients, at least up to the age of 80 years, resuscitation as well as rehabilitation strategies should be adapted accordingly.",Clinical interventions in aging,2018,Gross T | Morell S | Amsler F,Journal Article,"Adolescent | Adult | Age Factors | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Employee Performance Appraisal | Female | Humans | Injury Severity Score | Long Term Adverse Effects | Male | Multiple Trauma | Outcome Assessment, Health Care | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survivors | Switzerland",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
29706235,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.03.022,COSCA (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Adults: An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation.,"Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomised clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritised through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterised relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both.

29700122,10.1161/cir.0000000000000562,COSCA (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Adults: An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation.,"Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomized clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritized through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterized relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with ≥1 tools from Health Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources allow.",Circulation,2018,Haywood K | Whitehead L | Nadkarni VM | Achana F | Beesems S | Böttiger BW | Brooks A | Castrén M | Ong ME | Hazinski MF | Koster RW | Lilja G | Long J | Monsieurs KG | Morley PT | Morrison L | Nichol G | Oriolo V | Saposnik G | Smyth M | Spearpoint K | Williams B | Perkins GD | COSCA Collaborators,Consensus Statement | Journal Article,Adult | Humans | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Disease-Free Survival | Heart Arrest | Neurons | Quality of Life | Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
29626610,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.03.036,Health related quality of life after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in refractory cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: Recent data identifies extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) as a potential addendum of conventional cardiopulmonary-resuscitation (cCPR) in highly specified circumstances and selected patients. However, consented criteria indicating eCPR are lacking. Therefore we provide first insights into the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes of patients treated with eCPR in a real world setting.
METHODS: Retrospective single-center experience of 60 consecutive patients treated with eCPR between 01/2014 and 06/2016 providing 1-year survival- and HRQoL data obtained through the Short-Form 36 Survey (SF-36) after refractory out-of-hospital- (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) of presumed cardiac etiology.
RESULTS: Resuscitation efforts until initiation of eCPR averaged 66 ± 35 min and 63.3% of the patients suffered from OHCA. Fifty-five (91.7%) of the overall events were witnessed and bystander-CPR was performed in 73.3% (n = 44) of cases. Cause of arrest was dominated by acute myocardial infarction (AMI, 66.7%) and initial rhythm slightly outbalanced by ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT 53.3%). 12-month survival was 31%. Survivors experienced more often bystander-CPR (p = .001) and a shorter duration of cCPR (p = .002). While mid-term survivors' perceived HRQoL was compromised compared to controls (p ≦ .0001 for PF, RP, RE and BP; p = .007 for GH; p = .016 for SF; p = .030 for MH; p = .108 for VT), scores however resembled HRQoL of subjects on hemodialysis, following cardiogenic shock or pulmonary failure treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
CONCLUSIONS: While HRQoL scores of our survivors ranged markedly below controls, compared to patients on chronic hemodialysis, following ECMO for cardiogenic shock or pulmonary failure most of the discrepancies ameliorated. Thus, successfull eCPR in properly selected patients does translate into an encouraging HRQoL approximating chronic renal failure.",Resuscitation,2018,Spangenberg T | Schewel J | Dreher A | Meincke F | Bahlmann E | van der Schalk H | Kreidel F | Frerker C | Stoeck M | Bein B | Kuck KH | Ghanem A,Journal Article,"Aged | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Retrospective Studies | Statistics, Nonparametric | Surveys and Questionnaires | Time Factors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,false
29567463,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.03.016,Long-term quality of life of caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and the impact of witnessing a cardiac event of a close relative.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiac arrest is high, with a poor survival rate of 8-14%. Currently, only limited evidence is available about long-term consequences of cardiac arrest on quality of life of caregivers.
AIMS: First, to determine the level of daily functioning and quality of life in caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors two years after the cardiac arrest. Second, to study the long-term impact of witnessing the event of a cardiac arrest.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study including caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors. Participants received a questionnaire at home. Outcome variables were instrumental daily activities(FAI), emotional functioning(HADS), fatigue(FSS), caregiver strain(CSI), impact of event(IES), and quality of life(SF36).
RESULTS: 57 caregivers (89% female, age 56,9 ± 12 years) participated. Two years after the cardiac arrest, quality of life of caregivers equals that of the general population, although almost 30% still scored high on the Impact of Events Scale. Mean IES-, FSS-, CSI and FAI-scores were increased as compared to the general population (P < 0.001). Two years after the cardiac arrest, caregivers that witnessed the resuscitation (IES = 23.6 ± 14.9) still experienced significantly more trauma related stress than caregivers that did not witness the resuscitation (11.9 ± 12.5; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Two years after the cardiac arrest, quality of life of caregivers is quite good, but almost one third of the caregivers still experience a high level of trauma-related stress, especially in those that witnessed the resuscitation.

29374288,10.1007/s00063-018-0403-4,[Quality of life and posttraumatic stress disorder after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest].,"BACKGROUND: Survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is increasing. However, there is a lack of data concerning long-term quality of life of affected patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the psychological effects of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
METHODS: All patients who were admitted to our hospital after OHCA between 01 January 2008 and 30 June 2015 and could be discharged in good neurological condition were asked to fill out the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). For statistical analysis, the mean, standard deviation and student's t‑test were used (level of significance p < 0.05).
RESULTS: Of 280 OHCA survivors, 56 patients (20.0%) were discharged from the hospital in good neurological condition. Of those, 20 patients (35.7%) were willing to participate in this study, among them 11 women and 9 men. Compared to the cohort of the German normative data, the results of the SF-36 questionnaire of OHCA survivors showed significantly lower values in all SF-36 subscales and also for the summary scores. There was no significant difference compared to patients with myocardial infarction. Average values of the IES-R subscales for intrusion and avoidance were 9.9 ± 9.3 and 9.7 ± 7.7, respectively, and 11.3 ± 7.4 for hyperarousal. Calculations indicated the suspected diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder in 2 of the 20 patients (10%).
DISCUSSION: Even in patients who could be discharged from the hospital after OHCA in good neurological condition, the quality of life is significantly lower compared to the standard population but not compared to patients with myocardial infarction. The data also suggest that a relevant number of patients after OHCA is affected by posttraumatic stress disorder. Further research efforts on optimization of post-resuscitation care should not only focus on survival rates but also on improving quality of life.","Medizinische Klinik, Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin",2019,von Auenmüller I | Christ M | Brand M | Dierschke W | Trappe HJ,Journal Article,"Aged | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Quality of Life | Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic | Survivors | Treatment Outcome",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,false

Our aim was to compare the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest and analyse the factors associated with outcome.
METHODS: All adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to the Tampere University Hospital intensive care unit between 2009 and 2011 were included in a retrospective follow-up study if surviving to discharge and were asked to return a questionnaire after 6 months. Data on patient demographics and pre-arrest quality of life were retrieved from medical records. Data are given as means (SD) or medians [Q1 , Q3 ]. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with better quality of life after cardiac arrest.
RESULTS: Six months after cardiac arrest, 36% (79/222) were alive and 70% (55/79) of those patients completed the follow-up EuroQoL (EQ-5D) quality of life questionnaire. Median values for the EQ-5D before and after cardiac arrest were 0.89 [0.63, 1] and 0.89 [0.62, 1], respectively (P = 0.75). Only the EQ-5D prior to cardiac arrest was associated with better quality of life afterwards (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.3; P = 0.02).

The aim of this study was to critically appraise the evidence of psychometric quality and acceptability of measures used in the assessment of HRQoL in cardiac arrest survivors.
METHODS: Systematic literature searches (2004-2017) and named author searches to identify articles pertaining to the measurement of HRQoL. Data on study quality, measurement and practical properties were extracted and assessed against international standards.
RESULTS: From 356 reviewed abstracts, 69 articles were assessed in full. 25 provided evidence for 10 measures of HRQoL: one condition-specific; three generic profile measures; two generic index; and four utility measures. Although limited, evidence for measurement validity was strongest for the HUI3 and SF-36. However, evidence for reliability, content validity, responsiveness and interpretability and acceptability was generally limited or not available in the CA population for all measures.
CONCLUSIONS: This review has demonstrated that a measure of quality of life specific to OHCA survivors is not available. Limited evidence of validity exists for one utility measure - the HUI3 - and a generic profile - the SF-36. Robust evidence of the quality and acceptability of HRQoL measures in OHCA was limited or not available.

This paper reports patient outcomes from admission to hospital to 12 months after randomisation.
METHODS: Information about hospital length of stay and intensive care management was obtained through linkage with Hospital Episode Statistics and the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre. Patients surviving to hospital discharge were approached to complete questionnaires (SF-12v2, EQ-5D, MMSE, HADS and PTSD-CL) at 90days and 12 months. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN08233942.
RESULTS: 377 patients in the LUCAS arm and 658 patients in the manual chest compression were admitted to hospital. Hospital and intensive care length of stay were similar. Long term follow-up assessments were limited by poor response rates (53.7% at 3 months and 55.6% at 12 months). Follow-up rates were lower in those with worse neurological function. Among respondents, long term health related quality of life outcomes and emotional well-being was similar between groups.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate 1-year outcome and the pattern of recovery after surviving a cardiac arrest.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective longitudinal cohort study with 1 year of follow-up (measurements 2 weeks, 3 months, 1 year). On function level, physical/cardiac function (New York Heart Association Classification), cognition (Cognitive Log [Cog-log], Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), emotional functioning (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) were assessed. In addition, level of activities (Frenchay Activities Index, FAI), participation (Community Integration Questionnaire [CIQ] and return to work), and quality of life (EuroQol 5D, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36, Quality of Life after Brain Injury) were measured.
RESULTS: In this cohort, 141 cardiac arrest survivors were included. At 1 year, 14 (13%) survivors scored below cutoff on the Cog-log. Both anxiety and depression were present in 16 (15%) survivors, 29 (28%) experienced posttraumatic stress symptoms and 55 (52%), severe fatigue. Scores on the FAI and the CIQ were, on average, respectively 96% and 92% of the prearrest scores. Of those previously working, 41 (72%) had returned to work. Most recovery of cognitive function and quality of life occurred within the first 3 months, with further improvement on some domains of quality of life up to 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term outcome in terms of activities, participation, and quality of life after cardiac arrest is reassuring.

METHODS: We analysed patient-level data from a large, pragmatic, multi-centre trial linked to administrative secondary care data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to measure healthcare resource use, costs and outcomes in both arms. A within-trial analysis using quality adjusted life years derived from the EQ-5D-3L was conducted at 12-month follow-up and results were extrapolated to the lifetime horizon using a decision-analytic model.
RESULTS: 4471 patients were enrolled in the trial (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 group, 2819 assigned to the control group). At 12 months, 89 (5%) patients survived in the LUCAS-2 group and 175 (6%) survived in the manual CPR group. In the vast majority of analyses conducted, both within-trial and by extrapolation of the results over a lifetime horizon, manual CPR dominates LUCAS-2. In other words, patients in the LUCAS-2 group had poorer health outcomes (i.e. lower QALYs) and incurred higher health and social care costs.

METHODS: This national register study consists of data from follow-up registration of IHCA survivors 3-6 months post cardiac arrest (CA) in Sweden. A questionnaire was sent to the survivors, including measurements of health status (EQ-5D-5L) and psychological distress (HADS).
RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, 594 IHCA survivors were included in the study. The median values for EQ-5D-5L index and EQ VAS among survivors were 0.78 (q1-q3=0.67-0.86) and 70 (q1-q3=50-80) respectively. The values were significantly lower (p<0.001) in women compared to men. In addition, women reported more problems than men in all dimensions of EQ-5D-5L, except self-care. A majority of the respondents reported no problems with anxiety (85.4%) and/or symptoms of depression (87.0%). Women reported significantly more problems with anxiety (p<0.001) and symptoms of depression (p<0.001) compared to men. Gender was significantly associated with poorer health status and more psychological distress. No interaction effects for gender and age were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of survivors reported acceptable health status and no psychological distress, a substantial proportion reported severe problems. Women reported worse health status and more psychological distress compared to men. Therefore, a higher proportion of women may be in need of support.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: HRQOL was evaluated by telephone interview using SF-36 questionnaire. Each OHCA case was age and gender-matched with 4 controls from the French general population. Association between current condition of the survivors with the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire was investigated using MANCOVA. Cluster analysis was performed to identify patterns of HRQOL among CPC1 survivors.
RESULTS: 255 patients discharged alive from our referral centre between 2000 and 2013 (median age of 55y [45,64], 73.7% males) were interviewed. Global physical and mental components did not differ between CPC 1 survivors and controls (47.0 vs. 47.1, p=0.88 and 46.4 vs. 46.9, p=0.45) but substantially differed between CPC2, CPC3 and the corresponding controls. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy at telephone interview were significantly associated with better scores in each SF-36 dimensions. Cluster analysis individualized 4 distinct subgroups of CPC1 patients characterised by progressively increased score of SF-36. Return to work and daily-life autonomy were differently distributed across these 4 groups while pre-hospital Utstein variables were not.
CONCLUSION: HRQOL of CPC1 OHCA survivors appeared similar to that of the general population, but patients with CPC2 or 3 had altered HRQOL. Younger age, male gender, good neurological recovery and daily-life autonomy were independently associated with a better HRQOL.",Resuscitation,2017,Geri G | Dumas F | Bonnetain F | Bougouin W | Champigneulle B | Arnaout M | Carli P | Marijon E | Varenne O | Mira JP | Empana JP | Cariou A,Journal Article,Adult | Age Factors | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Cluster Analysis | Female | France | Health Status Disparities | Humans | Interviews as Topic | Long Term Adverse Effects | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Sex Factors | Survivors,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,false

Data regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in iVF patients are lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the HRQoL of iVF patients and to compare it to patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) diagnosed with an underlying disease and healthy subjects.
METHODS: In 61 iVF patients with an ICD (iVF-ICD) and 59 ICD patients with a diagnosis (diagnosis-ICD), HRQoL was assessed using the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the ICD Patient Concerns (ICDC) Questionnaire. In addition, 860 healthy subjects completed the SF-12.
RESULTS: IVF-ICD showed similar SF-12 physical summary scores compared with diagnosis-ICD patients (50.8 [interquartile range (IQR) = 42.1-53.9] vs 54.1 [IQR = 46.5-58.3]; P = 0.080) and healthy subjects (51.8 [IQR = 45.9-54.1]; P = 0.691). The mental summary score was impaired in iVF-ICD patients compared with diagnosis-ICD patients (45.9 [IQR = 40.7-49.4] vs 54.6 [IQR = 46.0-57.9]; P < 0.001) and healthy subjects (47.7 [IQR = 43.0-50.4]; P = 0.027). Scores on all five EQ-5D domains were similar between iVF-ICD patients and diagnosis-ICD patients, as well as symptoms of severe depression (19% vs 12%; P = 0.101). ICD concerns were similar between iVF-ICD and diagnosis-ICD patients (ICDC-scores 2 vs 2; P = 0.494).

Secondly, the course of the wellbeing of the caregivers during the first year was studied. Finally, factors that are associated with a higher care burden at 12 months after the cardiac arrest were investigated.
SUBJECTS: A total of 195 family caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors were included.
MAIN MEASURES: Quality of life (SF-36, EuroQol-VAS), caregiver strain (CSI) and emotional functioning (HADS, IES) were measured at two weeks, three months and one year after the cardiac arrest. Thereby, the caregiver was asked to fill out the cognitive failure questionnaire (CFQ) to evaluate their view on the cognitive status of the patient.
RESULTS: Caregiver strain was high in 16 (15%) of the caregivers at 12 months. Anxiety was present in 33 (25%) caregivers and depression in 18 (14%) caregivers at 12 months. The repeated measures MANOVA showed that during the first year the following variables improved significantly: SF-36 domains social and mental health, role physical, role emotional and vitality, caregiver strain, HADS and IES ( P<0.001). At 12 months caregiver strain correlated significantly (explained variance 63%, P=0.03) with caregiver HADS ( P=0.01), EuroQol-VAS ( P=0.02), and the CFQ ( P<0.001), all measured at 12 months after the cardiac arrest.

METHODS: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry invited 12-month OHCA survivors to participate in telephone follow-up between January 2011 and December 2015. Responders provided answers to the 12 Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Three-Level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). The SF-12 was also used to derive the SF-6D. Responses were used to assess the interpretability and construct validity of the instruments.
RESULTS: A total of 1188 patients and proxies responded. Large ceiling effects were observed for the EQ-5D-3L (patients=46%, proxies=23%). Substantial variability was also observed in SF-6D responses for patients who reported full health according to the EQ-5D-3L. For patient responders, the strongest correlations were observed between the EQ-5D-3L index score and SF-6D (ρ=0.65, p<0.001), and between the SF-6D and SF-12 physical component (ρ=0.69, p<0.001). The distribution of the SF-6D and EQ-5D-3L differed significantly for patients reporting a lower or upper moderate GOSE outcome and lower or upper good recovery (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D-3L demonstrated limited interpretability due to the presence of ceiling effects. However, the measurement properties of the SF-12, SF-6D and GOSE suggest that these may be useful measures of HR-QOL and functional recovery in OHCA survivors.",Resuscitation,2016,Andrew E | Nehme Z | Bernard S | Smith K,Journal Article,"Adult | Aged | Australia | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Female | Health Status Disparities | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Outcome Assessment, Health Care | Psychometrics | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Reproducibility of Results | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survivors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
27350371,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.06.015,Early neurologically focused follow-up after cardiac arrest is cost-effective: A trial-based economic evaluation.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention service for cardiac arrest survivors called 'Stand still …, and move on' from a societal perspective.
INTERVENTION: This concise nursing intervention consists of screening for cognitive and emotional problems, information provision and support, self-management promotion, and further referral if necessary. Earlier research confirmed the feasibility of the intervention and its effectiveness in improving emotional functioning and quality of life.
METHODS: In this multicentre randomized controlled trial with one year follow-up 185 patients were included between April 2007 and December 2010. The experimental group received the intervention, the control group received care-as-usual. Intervention costs, other direct healthcare costs (e.g. hospital care, rehabilitation, medication, home care) and indirect costs (productivity loss) were measured during ten months using monthly cost-diaries. The economic evaluation comprised a cost-utility analysis (SF-36) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (QOLIBRI) using bootstrapping (5000 replications) to quantify uncertainty concerning the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was estimated. To check the robustness of the findings, two sensitivity analyses were performed using the EQ-5D and the complete cases respectively.
RESULTS: Of 136 (74%) participants sufficient data concerning costs were collected to be included in this economic evaluation. Intervention costs were on average €127 (SD 85). No significant differences between groups were found with regard to overall costs. The ICERs of the cost-utility and the cost-effectiveness analyses supported the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 54-76% for the SF-36 and 94% for the QOLIBRI. Findings were robust.
CONCLUSION: The intervention 'Stand still …, and move on' has positive societal economic effects and has a high probability to be cost-effective. Implementation in regular healthcare is recommended.

However, its effect on longer term health economic outcomes has not been reported.
METHODS: We did a prespecified cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort of patients from New South Wales enrolled in the Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST), who were randomised to treatment with either 6% hydroxyethyl starch with a molecular weight of 130 kD and a molar substitution ratio of 0·4 or 0·9% sodium chloride (saline) for fluid resuscitation. Clinical outcomes were mortality and life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months, health-related quality of life at 6 months, and quality-adjusted life-years gained at 6 months. Health economic outcomes were hospital and intensive-care unit (ICU) resource use and costs at 24 months and cost-effectiveness, which we defined as the probability of reaching a willingness-to-pay threshold of less than A$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 6 months and $100 000 per life-year gained at 24 months. CHEST is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00935168.
FINDINGS: 3537 (51%) of 7000 patients were enrolled into CHEST from New South Wales, of whom 3450 (98%) were included in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Mortality at both 6 months and 24 months did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 397/1684 [24%] vs 382/1706 [22%]; relative risk [RR] 1·05, 95% CI 0·93-1·19; p=0·41; 24 months: 586/1687 [35%] vs 594/1708 [35%]; RR 1·00, 95% CI 0·91-1·10; p=0·89). The mean number of life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months was similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 0·41 days [SD 0·18] vs 0·41 days [0·17]; p=0·25; 24 months: 1·46 years [SD 0·80] vs 1·47 years [0·79]; p=0·72). At 6 months, the mean health-related quality of life score was 0·67 (SD 0·34) with hydroxyethyl starch versus 0·69 (0·35) with saline (p=0·33). The mean number of quality-adjusted life-years gained did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups at 6 months (0·26 days [SD 0·18] vs 0·26 days [0·18]; p=0·33). Total hospital costs (including ICU costs) at 24 months were similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (A$62 196 [55 935] vs $62 617 [56 452]; p=0·83). The probability that hydroxyethyl starch was cost effective was 11% at 6 months and 29% at 24 months.
INTERPRETATION: Although longer term clinical outcomes did not differ between patients resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch or saline in the ICU, from a health-care payer's perspective, the probability that hydroxyethyl starch is cost effective in these patients is low.

27255953,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.05.017,Alterations in cognitive outcome between 3 and 12 months in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"OBJECTIVES: To prospectively investigate cognitive recovery from 3 to 12 months after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and the associations between cognitive performance at 3 months and health-related quality of life (HRQL), psychological distress and work status after 12 months.
METHODS: At both assessments, neuropsychological tests were used to measure aspects of general mental ability, verbal and visual memory, psychomotor speed and executive function. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to measure mental and physical HRQL, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess psychological distress.
RESULTS: 33 survivors completed both exams (31 males, mean age 58.6 years, SD=13). The OHCAs were witnessed and due to cardiac origins. Nine patients were awake at admission to the hospital. Longer coma duration was associated with poorer cognitive results. Memory impairments were the most common symptom. The mean changes and effect sizes indicated minor improvements in cognitive performance from 3 to 12 months (Hedges g≤.26). Reliable change indices for an individual's results further confirmed the stability of the group statistics. The HADS scores showed increased depressive symptoms, and mental HRQL was reduced from 3 to 12 months. Higher reports of psychological distress were related to worse HRQL. Work participation increased. Better cognitive results at 3 months were correlated with better HRQL and return to work at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The current data describe stability in results from 3 to 12 months. A worse cognitive performance at 3 months and higher reports of psychological distress were associated with lower HRQL.",Resuscitation,2016,Ørbo M | Aslaksen PM | Larsby K | Schäfer C | Tande PM | Anke A,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Aged | Analysis of Variance | Cognitive Dysfunction | Executive Function | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Neuropsychological Tests | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Self Report | Survivors | Time Factors,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
26868077,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.01.027,Representativity and co-morbidity: Two factors of importance when reporting health status among survivors of cardiac arrest.,"AIM: Reports on differences between respondents and non-respondents of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors are sparse. This study compares respondents with non-respondents in a follow-up study of a consecutive sample of OHCA survivors and describes the relation between respondents' self-reported morbidity and health.
METHODS/DESIGN: Questionnaires were administered within 12 months after the OHCA. The study population was adult patients who had survived an OHCA during 2008 to 2011, with a cerebral performance score of ≤2 at discharge. The patients were identified through the Swedish registry of OHCA. The Self-administered comorbidity questionnaire and EQ VAS (Euroqol questionnaire visual analogue scale) was used to measure morbidity and health status.
RESULTS: Of 298 survivors, 224 were eligible for the study and 127 responded. Mean time from cardiac arrest (CA) to follow up was 178 days. Comparing the 127 respondents with the 97 lost to follow-up and non-respondents, no significant differences were found in terms of age, sex, factors at resuscitation and in-hospital interventions. The EQ VAS median was 75 (25th,75th percentile 60,80)). Self-rated health differed between respondents reporting 0-2 conditions (n=68) and respondents reporting more than two (n=43), median EQ VAS 78 (68,90) and 65 (50,80)), respectively; p-value 0.0001.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a limited response rate, representativeness in terms of patient characteristics among survivors of OHCA with an acceptable cerebral function is achievable.

26744101,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.12.005,Measuring outcome after cardiac arrest: construct validity of Cerebral Performance Category.,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately half of the survivors of cardiac arrest have cognitive impairments due to hypoxic brain injury. To describe the outcome after a cardiac arrest, the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) is frequently used. Although widely used, its validity is still debatable.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the construct validity of the Cerebral Performance Category in survivors of a cardiac arrest. Participants were 18 years and older that survived a cardiac arrest more than six months.
METHODS: Cross-sectional design. A method to administer the CPC in a structured and reproducible manner was developed. This 'Structured CPC' was administered by a structured interview. Construct variables were Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ), Barthel Index (BI), Frenchay Activity Index (FAI), Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and Quality of Life after Brain Injury (Qolibri). Associations were tested based on Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: A total of 62 participants responded. In 58 (94%) patients the CPC was determined, resulting in CPC 1 (48%), CPC 2 (23%) and CPC 3 (23%). The CPC-scoring correlated significantly with the CFQ (r=-0.40); BI (r=-0.57); FAI (r=-0.65), CIQ (r=-0.53) and Qolibri (r=-0.67).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this study we developed the 'Structured CPC' to improve the transparency and reproducibility of the original CPC. A moderate correlation between the 'Structured CPC' and the constructs 'activities', 'participation' and 'quality of life' confirmed the validity of the 'Structured CPC'.

26345262,10.1007/s10865-015-9671-0,Comparison of patient and partner quality of life and health outcomes in the first year after an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).,"Recovery following an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) impacts both the patient and partner, often in divergent ways. Patients may have had a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmias, whereas partners may have to perform CPR and manage the ongoing challenges of heart disease therapy. Currently, support for post-ICD care focuses primarily on restoring patient functioning with few interventions available to partners who serve as primary support. This descriptive study examined and compared patterns of change for both patients and partners during the first year post-ICD implantation. For this longitudinal study, the sample included 42 of 55 (76.4 %) patient-partner dyads who participated in the 'usual care' group of a larger intervention RCT with patients following ICD implant for secondary prevention of cardiac arrest. Measures taken at across five time points (at hospital discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up) tracked physical function (SF-12 PCS, symptoms); psychological adjustment (SF-12 MCS; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; CES-D); relationship impact (Family Functioning, DOII; Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity, MIS); and healthcare utilization (ED visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to characterize and compare outcome trends for patients and partners across the first 12 months of recovery. Patients were 66.5 ± 11.3 (mean + SD) years old, predominately Caucasian male (91 %), with Charlson co-morbidities of 4.4 ± 2.4. Partners were 62.5 ± 11.1 years old, predominantly female (91 %) with Charlson co-morbidities of 2.9 ± 3.0. Patient versus partner differences were observed in the pattern of physical health (F = 10.8, p < 0.0001); patient physical health improved while partner health showed few changes. For partners compared to patients, anxiety, depression, and illness demands on family functioning tended to be higher. Patient mutuality was stable, while partner mutuality increased steadily (F = 2.5, p = 0.05). Patient sensitivity was highest at discharge and declined; partner sensitivity increased (F = 10.2, p < 0.0001) across the 12-month recovery. Outpatient visits for patients versus partners differed (F = 5.0, p = 0.008) due most likely to the number of required patient ICD visits. Total hospitalizations and ED visits were higher for patients versus partners, but not significantly. The findings highlight the potential reciprocal influences of patient and partner responses to the ICD experience on health outcomes.

26189164,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.05.070,Survival and quality of life after extracorporeal life support for refractory cardiac arrest: A case series.,"OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is an emerging option to treat selected patients with cardiac arrest refractory to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Our primary objective was to determine the mortality at 30 days and at hospital discharge among adult patients receiving veno-arterial ECLS for refractory cardiac arrest. Our secondary objectives were to determine the 1-year survival and the health-related quality of life, and to examine factors associated with 30-day mortality.
METHODS: In a retrospective, single-center investigation within a tertiary referral center, we analyzed the prospectively collected data of 49 patients rescued from refractory cardiac arrest through emergent implantation of ECLS (E-CPR) (18.1% of our overall ECLS activity, 2005-2013), implanted in-hospital and during ongoing external cardiac massage in all cases. A prospective follow-up with administration of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire was performed.
RESULTS: The mean age was 47.6 ± 1.6 years; out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurred in 12% of cases; average low-flow time was 47.2 ± 33 minutes; causes of cardiac arrest were heart disease (61.2%), trauma (14.3%), respiratory disease (4.1%), sepsis (2%), and miscellaneous (18.4%).
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Rates of survival at E-CPR explantation and at 30 days were 42.9% and 36.7%, respectively; brain death occurred in 24.5% of cases.
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Increased simplified acute physiology score; higher serum lactate levels and lower body temperature at the time of implantation were associated with 30-day mortality. Bridge to heart transplantation or implantation of a long-term ventricular assist device was performed in 8.2%. No deaths occurred during the follow-up after discharge (36.7% survival; average follow-up was 15.6 ± 19.2 months). The average Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores (SF-36 questionnaire) were, respectively, 45.2 ± 6.8 and 48.3 ± 7.7 among survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a viable treatment for selected patients with cardiac arrest refractory to CPR.

26181779,10.2340/16501977-1998,Relevance of cognition to health-related quality of life in good-outcome survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"OBJECTIVE: For survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with good outcomes, it is not known whether and how health-related quality of life is affected by the cognitive impairments frequently observed in these patients. This study explores how neuropsychological tests of memory, exe-cutive and psychomotor functioning relate to the physical and mental aspects of health-related quality of life in functionally independent and community dwelling OHCA survivors discharged early from hospital.
METHODS: The study included 42 adult survivors (mean age 62 years, 38 males). Health-related quality of life was measured approximately 3 months post-OHCA with the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). Cognition was measured with established neuropsychological tests. Regression analyses were used to examine associations between neuropsychological domains and physical and mental health-related quality of life, respectively, when controlling for age, education and length of coma.
RESULTS: The physical, but not the mental, component of the SF-36 was significantly worse than Norwegian population data. Neuropsychological tests showed frequent impairments most often in the memory domain. Worse psychomotor functioning was associated with worse physical health-related quality of life, whereas worse memory performance was associated with worse mental health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: The cognitive impairments frequently reported in OHCA survivors with good outcomes may compromise health-related quality of life. Cognitive functioning should be addressed even in survivors with rapid recovery.",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,2015,Ørbo M | Aslaksen PM | Larsby K | Schäfer C | Tande PM | Vangberg TR | Anke A,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Cognition | Cognition Disorders | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Neuropsychological Tests | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Psychomotor Performance | Quality of Life | Survivors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

The effort sought to assess the validity of a near-peer, bidirectional, cross-cultural teaching format as both a global health experience for medical students and as an effective component of improving medical education and emergency response infrastructure in developing countries such as Haiti.
METHOD: Medical students and emergency medicine (EM) residents from a North American medical school designed and taught a module on emergency response skills in PAP and certified medical students in basic cardiac life support (BLS) over 2 consecutive years. Five-point Likert scale self-efficacy (SE) surveys and multiple-choice fund of knowledge (FOK) assessments were distributed pre- and postmodule each year and analyzed with paired t tests and longitudinal follow-up of the first cohort. Narrative evaluations from participants were collected to gather feedback for improving the module.
FINDINGS: Challenges included bridging language barriers, maintaining continuity between cohorts, and adapting to unexpected schedule changes. Overall, 115 students were certified in BLS with significant postcurriculum improvements in SE scores (2.75 ± 0.93 in 2013 and 2.82 ± 1.06 in 2014; P < 0.001) and FOK scores (22% ± 15% in 2013 and 41% ± 16% in 2014; P < 0.001). Of 24 Haitian students surveyed at 1-year follow-up from the 2013 cohort, 7 (29.3%) reported using taught skills in real-life situations since completing the module. The US group was invited to repeat the project for a third year.
CONCLUSIONS: Near-peer, cross-cultural academic exchange is an effective method of medical student-centered emergency training in Haiti. Limitations such as successfully implementing sustainability measures, addressing cultural differences, and coordinating between groups persist. This scalable, reproducible, and mutually beneficial collaboration between North American and Haitian medical trainees is a valid conduit for building Haiti's emergency response infrastructure and promoting global health.",Annals of global health,2015,Pean CA | Davis K | Merrill R | Marinelli B | Lockwood A | Mathews Z | Strayer RJ | Poitevien G | Galjour J,Journal Article,"Adult | Clinical Competence | Curriculum | Developing Countries | Education, Medical, Undergraduate | Emergency Medicine | Female | Global Health | Haiti | Humans | Male | Peer Group | Self Efficacy | Students, Medical | Surveys and Questionnaires | Young Adult",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,false,true

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
METHOD/DESIGN: Consecutive OHCA patients. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were administered 4 weeks after the OHCA. Cognitive problems were defined if MMSE <28, CFQ >32 or IQCODE >3.6. The Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ) (participation/autonomy), the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) (quality of life) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety/depression) were administered. Correlations between cognitive problems and participation/autonomy and quality of life were calculated.
RESULTS: 63 of 77 patients were male (82%), median age 59 years (range 15-84). MMSE median 29 (interquartile range 28-30), CFQ mean 20.9 (SD 9.4) and IQCODE mean 3.1 (SD 0.2). Eighteen patients (23%) scored positive for cognitive problems. Significant correlations were found between MMSE and IPAQ: autonomy inside (r = -0.38), family role (r = -0.26), autonomy outside (r = -0.32), social relations (r = -0.38) and social functioning (r = 0.32). MMSE was related to SF-36: social functioning (r = 0.32). The CFQ was related to IPAQ: autonomy outdoors (r = 0.29) and SF-36: bodily pain (r = -0.37), vitality (r = -0.25), mental health (r = -0.35) and role emotional (r = -0.40). The IQCODE was related to IPAQ: autonomy indoors (r = 0.26) and to SF-36: vitality (r = -0.33) and social functioning (r = -0.41).

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated among survivors of OHCA cognition, functional status, health-related quality of life and depression as functions of patient and emergency medical services (EMS) factors.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort sub-study of a randomized trial.
SETTING: The parent trial studied two comparisons in persons with non-traumatic OHCA treated by EMS personnel participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium.
PARTICIPANTS: Consenting survivors to discharge.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Telephone assessments up to 6 months after discharge included neurologic function (modified Rankin score, MRS), cognitive impairment (Adult Lifestyle and Function Mini Mental Status Examination, ALFI-MMSE), health-related quality of life (Health Utilities Index Mark 3, HUI3) and depression (Telephone Geriatric Depression Scale, T-GDS).
RESULTS: Of 15,794 patients enrolled in the parent trial, 729 (56% of survivors) consented. About 644 respondents (88% of consented) completed ≥ 1 assessment. Likelihood of assessment was associated with baseline characteristics and study site. Most respondents had MRS ≤ 3 (82.7%), no cognitive impairment (82.7% ALFI-MMSE ≥ 17), no severe impairment in health (71.6%, HUI3 ≥ 0.7) and no depression (90.1% T-GDS≤10). Outcomes did not differ by trial intervention or time from hospital discharge.

26020858,10.1097/pcc.0000000000000452,Cardiac Arrest in Children: Long-Term Health Status and Health-Related Quality of Life.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term health status and health-related quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest in childhood and their parents. In addition, to identify predictors of health status and health-related quality of life.
DESIGN: This medical follow-up study involved consecutive children surviving cardiac arrest between January 2002 and December 2011, who had been admitted to the ICU. Health status was assessed with a medical interview, physical examination, and the Health Utilities Index. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the Child Health Questionnaires and Short-Form 36.
SETTING: A tertiary care university children's hospital.
PATIENTS: Of the eligible 107 children, 57 (53%) filled out online questionnaires and 47 visited the outpatient clinic (median age, 8.7 yr; median follow-up interval, 5.6 yr).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the participants, 60% had an in-hospital cardiac arrest, 90% a nonshockable rhythm, and 50% a respiratory etiology of arrest. Mortality rate after hospital discharge was 10%. On health status, we found that 13% had long-term neurologic deficits, 34% chronic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache), 19% at least one sign suggestive of chronic kidney injury, and 15% needed special education. Health Utilities Index scores were significantly decreased on most utility scores and the overall Health Utilities Index mark 3 score. Compared with Dutch normative data, parent-reported health-related quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors was significantly worse on general health perception, physical role functioning, parental impact, and overall physical summary. On patient reports, no significant differences with normative data were found. Parents reported better family cohesion and better health-related quality of life for themselves on most scales. Patients' health status, general health perceptions, and physical summary scores were significantly associated with cardiac arrest-related preexisting condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the impact of cardiac arrest, the overall outcome after cardiac arrest in childhood is reasonably good.

26005166,10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.04.229,Early neurologically-focused follow-up after cardiac arrest improves quality of life at one year: A randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Survivors of a cardiac arrest frequently have cognitive and emotional problems and their quality of life is at risk. We developed a brief nursing intervention to detect cognitive and emotional problems, provide information and support, promote self-management, and refer them to specialised care if necessary. This study examined its effectiveness.
METHODS: Multicentre randomised controlled trial with measurements at two weeks, three months and twelve months after cardiac arrest. 185 adult cardiac arrest survivors and 155 caregivers participated. Primary outcome measures were societal participation and quality of life of the survivors at one year. Secondary outcomes were the patient's cognitive functioning, emotional state, extended daily activities and return to work, and the caregiver's well-being. Data were analysed using 'intention to treat' linear mixed model analyses.
RESULTS: After one year, patients in the intervention group had a significantly better quality of life on SF-36 domains Role Emotional (estimated mean differences (EMD)=16.38, p=0.006), Mental Health (EMD=6.87, p=0.003) and General Health (EMD=8.07, p=0.010), but there was no significant difference with regard to societal participation. On the secondary outcome measures, survivors scored significantly better on overall emotional state (HADS total, EMD=-3.25, p=0.002) and anxiety (HADS anxiety, EMD=-1.79, p=0.001) at one year. Furthermore, at three months more people were back at work (50% versus 21%, p=0.006). No significant differences were found for caregiver outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of cardiac arrest survivors can be improved by an intervention focused on detecting and managing the cognitive and emotional consequences of a cardiac arrest.

METHODS: Patients alive at 6 months after being discharged from the hospital underwent clinical neurological and extensive neuropsychological examinations. Functional outcome was evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category scale, the modified Rankin scale and the Barthel Index. Cognitive outcome was evaluated by neuropsychological test battery including two measures of each cognitive function: cognitive speed, execution, memory, verbal skills and visuospatial performance. We also assessed quality of life with a HRQoL 15D questionnaire.
RESULTS: Of 90 OHCA-VF patients included in the original trial, 57 were alive at 6 months. Of these, 52 (91%) were functionally independent and 54 (95%) lived at their previous home. Focal neurological deficits were scarce. Intact cognitive performance was observed in 20 (49%), mild to moderate deficits in 14 (34%) and severe cognitive deficits in 7 (17%) of 41 patients assessed by a neuropsychologist. Cognitive impairments were most frequently detected in executive and memory functions. HRQoL of the CA survivors was comparable to that of age- and gender matched population.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional outcome six months after OHCA and therapeutic hypothermia was good in the great majority of the survivors, and half of them were cognitively intact. Of note, the HRQoL of CA survivors did not differ from that of age- and gender matched population.","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",2015,Tiainen M | Poutiainen E | Oksanen T | Kaukonen KM | Pettilä V | Skrifvars M | Varpula T | Castrén M,Journal Article | Randomized Controlled Trial,"Adult | Aged | Cognition Disorders | Female | Humans | Hypothermia, Induced | Male | Middle Aged | Neuropsychological Tests | Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Survival Analysis | Treatment Outcome",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

METHODS: Individuals with successful resuscitation treated at the Sahlgrenska university hospital during 1995-1999 and presented in former CA publications were studied. Survival time and causes of death data were extracted from the individuals who had died's records. Very long term survivors were offered a follow up visit at home. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) used to describe cognitive abilities and EQ-5D to assess quality of life. The life situation was also explored.
RESULTS: 14 out of 104 possible participants had survived to follow up. The median time to follow up among the 8 who agreed to participation was 17 years. Out of the 8 participants, 4 failed to reach the cut off score of normal cognitive abilities in the MMSE and 7/8 participants did not reach the cut off score for normal cognitive function in the MoCA. Overall the participants were content with their life situation and QoL. However, a tendency towards lower scores on the cognitive testing and a lower self-reported QoL was observed. No depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety disorder were found.
CONCLUSIONS: A CA may lead to permanent cognitive impairments and the risk of dementia may be higher because of the injuries sustained during the collapse. However, further studies with more participants are needed to fully determine the risk of cognitive impairment after a CA. Regarding life situation, there was a tendency of lower QoL with lower scores on the cognitive testing.

We investigated cognitive function and health-related quality of life four years after cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Thirty cardiac arrest survivors over the age of 18 in cerebral performance category 1 or 2 on hospital discharge completed the EQ-5D-5L and HADS questionnaires prior to cognitive testing using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The results were compared with population norms.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine per cent of patients were cognitively impaired. The pattern of cognitive impairment reflects dysfunction in the medial temporal lobe, with impaired short-time memory and executive function slightly but distinctly affected. There was a significant reduction in quality of life on the EQ-VAS, but not on the EQ index.

25496708,10.1186/s13049-014-0076-9,Cardiac arrest survivors treated with or without mild therapeutic hypothermia: performance status and quality of life assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is the main determinant of clinical outcome after cardiac arrest. The study was designed to determine long-term neurological and psychological status in cardiac arrest survivors, as well as to compare neuropsychological outcomes between patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) and patients who did not undergo hypothermia treatment.
METHODS: The article describes a single-center, retrospective, observational study on 28 post-cardiac arrest adult patients treated in the cardiac intensive care unit who qualified for MTH vs. 37 control group patients, hospitalized at the same center following cardiac arrest in the preceding years and fulfilling criteria for induced hypothermia, but who were not treated due to unavailability of the method at that time. Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Barthel Index and RAND-36 were used to assess performance status and quality of life in both study groups after hospital discharge.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in physical functioning found between groups either at the end of hospital treatment or at long-term follow-up (DRS: p = 0.11; Barthel Index: p = 0.83). In long-term follow-up, MTH patients showed higher vitality (p = 0.02) and reported fewer complaints on role limitations due to emotional problems (p = 0.04) compared to the control group. No significant differences were shown between study groups in terms of physical capacity and independent functioning.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, in long-term follow-up, MTH patients showed higher vitality and reported fewer complaints on role limitations due to emotional problems compared to the control group. This suggest that MTH helps to preserve global brain function in cardiac arrest survivors. However, the results can be biased by a small sample size and variable observation periods.","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",2014,Kowalik R | Szczerba E | Kołtowski Ł | Grabowski M | Chojnacka K | Golecki W | Hołubek A | Opolski G,Journal Article | Observational Study,"Adult | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Heart Arrest | Humans | Hypothermia, Induced | Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain | Intensive Care Units | Male | Middle Aged | Motor Activity | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Survivors | Treatment Outcome",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
25355914,10.1161/circulationaha.114.011200,Quality of life and functional outcomes 12 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant global health problem. There has been considerable investment in improving the emergency medical response to OHCA, with associated improvements in survival. However, concern remains that survivors have a poor quality of life. This study describes the quality of life of OHCA survivors at 1-year postarrest in Victoria, Australia.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult OHCA patients who arrested between 2010 and 2012 were identified from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry. Paramedics attended 15 113 OHCA patients of which 46.3% received an attempted resuscitation. Nine hundred and twenty-seven (13.2%) survived to hospital discharge of which 76 (8.2%) died within 12 months. Interviews were conducted with 697 (80.7%) patients or proxies, who were followed-up via telephone interview, including the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, the 12-item short form health survey, and the EuroQol. The majority (55.6%) of respondents had a good recovery via the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended≥7 (41.1% if patients who died postdischarge were included and nonrespondents were assumed to have poor recovery). The mean EuroQol index score for respondents was 0.82 (standard deviation, 0.19), which compared favorably with an adjusted population norm of 0.81 (standard deviation, 0.34). The mean 12-item short form Mental Component Summary score for patients was 53.0 (standard deviation, 10.2), whereas the mean Physical Component Summary score was 46.1 (standard deviation, 11.2).

We studied quality of life, neuro-cognitive functioning and independency in daily life of patients and strain of caregivers 6-12 months after cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty patients (>18 year) who survived 6-12 months after OHCA and relatives were interviewed by telephone with validated questionnaires (Short-form Health Survey) (SF-12), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), telephonic interview cognitive status (TICS) and Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and compared with OPC and CPC at discharge. SF-12 of elderly (≥80 years) was compared to an open Dutch population of ≥80 years.
RESULTS: Of all patients, 45% had normal physical and 90% had normal mental SF-12. Eighty-one percent had a normal MRS (MRS≤2). Eighty-four percent had normal TICS. Compared to the reference population, elderly scored 40.5 on the mental physical [corrected] and 53.2 on the physical mental [corrected] SF-12, while the reference population scored 38.1 (θ=0.20) and 54.4 (θ=-0.15), respectively, (n.s.) Of the patients with OPC≤2 and CPC≤2 at discharge 15% scored MRS 3-5 and 15% abnormal TICS at follow-up, respectively. Ninety-two percent of all patients gave their quality of life a value of ≥6 (maximum 10). Patients treated with hypothermia scored on most health outcomes similar to those who did not need such treatment. Sixteen percent of caregivers experienced strain, correlating significantly with TICS of patients.
CONCLUSION: The great majority of survivors have normal functioning and cognition 6-12 months after OHCA.

BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of the impact of nonfatal CV events on long-term changes in HRQL in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI).
METHODS: The VALIANT (Valsartan In Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial enrolled 14,703 patients post-MI complicated by Killip class II or higher (scale measuring heart failure severity post-MI ranging from class I to IV) and/or reduced ejection fraction. The HRQL substudy included 2,556 (17.4%) patients who completed the EQ-5D with 5 questions, with responses mapped to utility weight on a scale of 0 to 1 and a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) imaginable health state. EQ-5D was administered at baseline and 6, 12, 20, and 24 months. The trajectory of EQ-5D scores was developed by using linear mixed effects regression models with calculation of deviation from this trajectory after nonfatal CV events. Patients who died before the next EQ-5D assessment were excluded.
RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 597 patients experienced a nonfatal CV event and survived to have another EQ-5D assessment. Their baseline EQ-5D scores were lower than patients without a subsequent nonfatal CV event (VAS 61.0 ± 19 vs 68.2 ± 18 [p < 0.001] and US-based utility score 0.76 ± 0.22 vs 0.83 ± 0.17 [p < 0.001]). These patients with CV events experienced a trajectory-adjusted 6.6 point decrease (p < 0.001) in VAS scores and a 0.07 decrease (p < 0.001) in utility score after the nonfatal CV event.
CONCLUSIONS: MI survivors suffering a CV event experienced significantly worse HRQL than their previous trajectory, suggesting that generic instruments can be responsive to nonfatal events. Reduction in nonfatal CV events may affect longitudinal changes in HRQL.",JACC.

We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the occurrence of pruritus in patients with severe sepsis randomized to resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 or Ringer's acetate.
METHODS: We did post hoc analyses of the Danish survivors (n=295) of the 6S trial using mailed questionnaires on self-perceived HRQoL (Short Form (SF) - 36) and pruritus.
RESULTS: Median 14 months (interquartile range 10 to 18) after randomization, 182 (61%) and 185 (62%) completed questionnaires were obtained for the assessment of HRQoL and pruritus, respectively. Responders were older than nonresponders, but characteristics at randomization of the responders in the HES vs. Ringer's groups were comparable. At follow-up, the patients in the HES group had lower mental component summary scores than those in the Ringer's group (median 45 (interquartile range 36 to 55) vs. 53 (39 to 60), P=0.01). The group differences were mainly in the scales of vitality and mental health. There was no difference in the physical component summary scores between groups, but patients in the HES group scored worse in bodily pain. Forty-nine percent of patients allocated to HES had experienced pruritus at any time after ICU discharge compared to 43% of those allocated to Ringer's (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.55, P=0.43).
CONCLUSIONS: At long-term follow-up patients with severe sepsis assigned to resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 had worse self-perceived HRQoL than those assigned to Ringer's acetate whereas there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of pruritus.","Critical care (London, England)",2013,Wittbrodt P | Haase N | Butowska D | Winding R | Poulsen JB | Perner A | 6S trial group | Scandinavian Critical Care Trials Group,"Journal Article | Multicenter Study | Randomized Controlled Trial | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Aged | Female | Fluid Therapy | Follow-Up Studies | Humans | Hydroxyethyl Starch Derivatives | Isotonic Solutions | Male | Middle Aged | Pruritus | Quality of Life | Resuscitation | Sepsis | Single-Blind Method | Time Factors,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true

Massive pulmonary embolism is associated with a high mortality. Surgical embolectomy has traditionally been reserved for cases with haemodynamic collapse or where thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed.
METHODS: Data on 10 patients who underwent surgical embolectomy (40% male, mean age 49 years (range 25-72)) from January 2003 to February 2010 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed.
RESULTS: Diagnosis was made using computed tomography pulmonary angiography in eight patients and echocardiography in two. Syncope was the most common presenting symptom (7 out of 10, 70%) and relative immobilization was the most common risk factor (7 out of 10, 70%). Four patients (40%) suffered preoperative cardiac arrest, with a further two on induction of anaesthesia. Thirty-day mortality was 4 out of 10 (40%), with one late death. Mean follow-up of five survivors was 39 months and included clinic review or telephone interview, SF-36 questionnaire for quality of life, transthoracic echocardiography for right ventricular (RV) function and respiratory function testing. All survivors received an inferior vena cava filter and 6 months of anticoagulation with no cases of recurrent thromboembolism. RV systolic dysfunction was severe in all cases prior to surgery, but improved to near normal at follow-up.

The aim of this study was to assess their functional and quality of life outcomes.
METHODOLOGY: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry records were used to identify survivors of OHCA that occurred between 2003 and 2008 in the 18-39 year-old age group. Survivors were administered a telephone questionnaire using Short Form (SF-12), EQ-5D and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ascertained at hospital discharge from the medical record was recorded for the uncontactable survivors.
RESULTS: Of the 106 young adult survivors, five died in the intervening years and 45 were not contactable or refused. CPC scores were obtained for 37 (74%) of those who did not take part in telephone follow-up, and 7 (19%) of these had a CPC ≥ 3 indicating severe cerebral disability. The median follow-up time was 5 years (range 2.7- 8.6 years) for the 56 (53%) patients included. Of these, 84% were living at home independently, 68% had returned to work, and only 11% reported marked or severe disability. The majority of patients had no problems with mobility (75%), personal care (75%), usual activities (66%) or pain/discomfort (71%). However, 61% of respondents reported either moderate (48%) or severe (13%) anxiety.

Comparison of clinical subgroups].","BACKGROUND: The psychological strain of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is infrequently explored in prospective studies, which have until now generally focused on the dimensions anxiety and depression. Furthermore, vital exhaustion (VE; ICD10 F 48.0) is known as a very good predictor for negative outcome in patients with coronary heart disease. The influence of VE on patients with an ICD is presented and analyzed in a prospective study.
METHODS: A total of 249 patients with an ICD completed a set of questionnaires (HADS, EQ-5D, VE) at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The patients with high levels of depression, anxiety, and VE after ICD implantation did not show spontaneous remission after 1 year.
DISCUSSION: As expected, the implanatation of an ICD is associated with high acceptance and increased life quality in about 3/4 of patients. However, there is a subgroup of patients (20-30%) who have difficulties and the measured dimensions remain at elevated levels after implantation, thus, indicating that these patients probably need competent psychological help.",Herzschrittmachertherapie & Elektrophysiologie,2011,Tavenaux M | Ginzburg DM | Boukacem A | Sperzel J | Hamm C | Jordan J,Comparative Study | English Abstract | Journal Article,"Adaptation, Psychological | Aged | Anxiety Disorders | Attitude to Health | Cohort Studies | Cooperative Behavior | Coronary Disease | Depressive Disorder | Fatigue | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Heart Arrest | Humans | Interdisciplinary Communication | Male | Middle Aged | Patient Care Team | Prognosis | Prospective Studies | Psychotherapy | Qi | Quality of Life | Surveys and Questionnaires",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,false,true

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 64 children admitted to pediatric intensive care (PICU) after successful CPR between 1985 and 2007. Eleven died in the PICU, 9 other within 6 months. In 2009 all long-term survivors, except for two, lived at home. Of the 40 patients eligible for the study, 29 (73%) responded to a questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed with the generic 15D, or its versions for adolescents (16D) or children (17D), and compared to that of general population. These HRQoL scores, age-specific survival probabilities, and HRQoL scores of the general population were used in a Markov model to estimate the number of QALYs gained.
RESULTS: Median age of the respondents was 17.3 (range: 3.0-28.4) years and 62% were male. At the time of drowning their median age had been 3.0 (range: 1.2-15.7) years. The drowning incident was associated with a significant loss in HRQoL in the oldest age group (total HRQoL total score 0.881 compared to 0.971 in the general population, P<0.01) but not in children (HRQoL score 0.944 vs. 0.938). When submersion time exceeded 10min mean HRQoL score was significantly lower than in patients with a shorter submersion (0.844 vs. 0.938, P=0.032). The mean undiscounted and discounted (at 3%) number of QALYs gained by treatment were 40.8 and 17.0, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A good HRQoL will be achieved in the majority of patients surviving long-term after a drowning incident in childhood, although HRQoL is affected by the submersion time.",Resuscitation,2011,Suominen PK | Vähätalo R | Sintonen H | Haverinen A | Roine RP,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent | Adult | Child | Child, Preschool | Female | Humans | Male | Near Drowning | Quality of Life | Quality-Adjusted Life Years | Retrospective Studies | Time Factors | Young Adult",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
21575208,10.1186/1477-7525-9-35,Predictors of mortality and short-term physical and cognitive dependence in critically ill persons 75 years and older: a prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of 3-month mortality in critically ill older persons under medical care and to assess the clinical impact of an ICU stay on physical and cognitive dependence and subjective health status in survivors.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study including all older persons 75 years and older consecutively admitted into ICU during a one-year period, except those admitted after cardiac arrest, All patients were followed for 3 months or until death. Comorbidities were assessed using the Charlson index and physical dependence was evaluated using the Katz index of Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Cognitive dependence was determined by a score based on the individual components of the Lawton index of Daily Living and subjective health status was evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) score.
RESULTS: One hundred patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 79.3 ± 3.4 years. The median Charlson index was 6 [IQR, 4 to 7] and the mean ADL and cognitive scores were 5.4 ± 1.1 and 1.2 ± 1.4, respectively, corresponding to a population with a high level of comorbidities but low physical and cognitive dependence. Mortality was 61/100 (61%) at 3 months. In multivariate analysis only comorbidities assessed by the Charlson index [Adjusted Odds Ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; p < 0.003] and the number of organ failures assessed by the SOFA score [Adjusted Odds Ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2; p < 0.02] were independently associated with 3-month mortality. All 22 patients needing renal support after Day 3 died. Compared with pre-admission, physical (p = 0.04), and cognitive (p = 0.62) dependence in survivors had changed very little at 3 months. In addition, the mean NHP score was 213.1 ± 132.8 at 3 months, suggesting an acceptable perception of their quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: In a selected population of non surgical patients 75 years and older, admission into the ICU is associated with a 3-month survival rate of 38% with little impact on physical and cognitive dependence and subjective health status. Nevertheless, a high comorbidity level (ie, Charlson index), multi-organ failure, and the need for extra-renal support at the early phase of intensive care could be considered as predictors of death.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2011,Daubin C | Chevalier S | Séguin A | Gaillard C | Valette X | Prévost F | Terzi N | Ramakers M | Parienti JJ | du Cheyron D | Charbonneau P,Journal Article,"Activities of Daily Living | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Cognition | Comorbidity | Critical Care | Critical Illness | Dependency, Psychological | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Forecasting | Health Status | Humans | Intensive Care Units | Length of Stay | Male | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Risk Factors | Survivors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
21367511,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.01.018,Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral performance after cardiac arrest--a pilot study.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: Prognostication may be difficult in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is potentially useful in the prediction of neurological outcome, and it may detect acute ischemia at an early stage. In a pilot setting we determined the prevalence and development of cerebral ischemia using serial MRI examinations and neurological assessment.
METHODS: Ten witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were included. MRI was carried out approximately 2h after admission to the hospital, repeated after 24h of therapeutic hypothermia and 96 h after the arrest. The images were assessed for development of acute ischemic lesions. Neurophysiological and cognitive tests as well as a self-reported quality-of-life questionnaire, Short Form-36 (SF-36), were administered minimum 12 months after discharge.
RESULTS: None of the patients had acute cerebral ischemia on MRI at admission. Three patients developed ischemic lesions after therapeutic hypothermia. There was a change in the apparent diffusion coefficient, which significantly correlated with the temperature (p < 0.001). The neurophysiological tests appeared normal. The patients scored significantly better on SF 36 than the controls as regards both bodily pain (p = 0.023) and mental health (p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: MRI performed in an early phase after cardiac arrest has limitations, as MRI performed after 24 and 96 h revealed ischemic lesions not detectable on admission. ADC was related to the core temperature, and not to the volume distributed intravenously.

21168340,10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.10.042,Long-term survival and quality of life after cardiac resuscitation following coronary artery bypass grafting.,"OBJECTIVE: Follow-up studies of patients surviving emergency resternotomy, open cardiac massage, and additional emergency cardiac surgery following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain sparse and studies focusing on health-related quality of life are lacking. Our aim was to elucidate the long-term course of patients experiencing this hazardous complication.
METHODS: Between 1988 and 1999, 76 patients suffered sudden hemodynamic collapse following isolated CABG. All patients underwent emergency resternotomy and open cardiac massage. An emergency cardiac reoperation was performed in the 62 (82%) primary survivors. Additional 76 patients were pair-matched to the study patients on the basis of their preoperative characteristics and served as controls. Of the study patients, 41 (54%), and of the controls, 76, (100%) were discharged. In December 2009, all patients were traced with respect to mortality data and the health-related quality of life of living patients was studied using the RAND-36 Item Health Survey questionnaire.
RESULTS: Altogether 19 (73%) of the 26 study patients, and 38 (84%) of the 45 controls were available. After exclusion of the early deaths, the life expectancy was similar between the groups: neither overall (p = 0.60) nor cardiac (p = 0.64) survival differed significantly after a mean follow-up time of 15.1 ± 3.5 years. In addition, cardiac re-interventions were equally frequently required in both the groups. The RAND-36 scores were congruent (p = ns) between the groups and the age- and sex-matched national reference population in the health-related quality-of-life dimensions describing physical, mental, and social domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have survived severe hemodynamic collapse, open cardiac massage, and emergency cardiac reoperation following CABG achieve similar long-term prognosis in terms of survival and cardiac interventions as the pair-matched control patients. In addition, 15 years postoperatively, they have a good health-related quality of life, similar to that of an age- and sex-matched national reference population.",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2011,Karhunen JP | Jokinen JJ | Raivio PM | Salminen US,Journal Article,Aged | Coronary Artery Bypass | Emergencies | Epidemiologic Methods | Female | Heart Massage | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Prognosis | Psychometrics | Quality of Life | Reoperation | Shock | Sternum | Treatment Outcome,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS: Eighty-eight survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, admitted to a Dutch academic hospital between 2001 and 2006.
METHODS: Patients received a set of questionnaires at home. The main outcome measures were physical and mental quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-36). Potential determinants were cognitive complaints, emotional problems depression/anxiety), post-traumatic stress, fatigue, daily functioning and participation in society. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed with physical and mental quality of life as dependent variables.
RESULTS: Sixty-three (72%) patients responded. Mean time since cardiac arrest was 36 months (standard deviation (SD) 19). Backward regression analyses showed that physical quality of life was significantly (p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.531) related to cognitive complaints (beta = -0.378), instrumental daily life activities (beta = 0.262), post-traumatic stress (beta = -0.246) and fatigue (beta = -0.226). Mental quality of life was significantly (p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.664) explained by anxiety/depression (beta = -0.609), fatigue (beta = -0.177) and cognitive complaints (beta = -0.175).
CONCLUSION: Quality of life is related to cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety/depression, post-traumatic stress and difficulties in daily activities in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Could they be similarly applied to patients with cardiac arrest?
METHODS: As part of a randomized trial, study personnel interviewed by telephone survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to assess their outcomes 3 months after discharge. They asked two simple questions: (1) In the last 2 weeks, did you require help from another person for your everyday activities? and (2) Do you feel that you have made a complete mental recovery form your heart arrest? Next they administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from the Adult Lifestyles and Function Interview (ALFI) to assess cognition on a scale from 0 to 22 and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) to assess quality of life on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).
RESULTS: Based on responses to the two simple questions, 32 survivors were classified as dependent (n=5, 16%), independent (n=3, 9%) and full recovery (n=24, 75%). The mean ALFI-MMSE score was 19.1 (standard deviation 5.1), and the mean HUI3 score was 0.76 (standard deviation 0.28). The classification based on the two simple questions was significantly correlated with ALFI-MMSE (p=0.002) and HUI3 (p=0.001). Scores for the HUI3 were missing in eight survivors.

METHODS: We prospectively included all patients with CA treated with hypothermia at intensive care units (ICU) in two university hospitals and one regional hospital. All adult survivors at 6 months after CA, n=48, were invited for neurological follow-up and 43 accepted. History, clinical status, ability testing and questionnaires were administered to screen for difficulties, including Assessment of Motor and Process Skills, Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination, Frontal Lobe Assessment Battery, EQ-VAS quality of life scale, Skåne Sleep Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale, Self-reported Montgomery and Astrand Depression Rating Scale, Global Deterioration Scale, Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, and the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC).
RESULTS: No patient was found to be in a chronic vegetative state and all patients were living at home, one with extensive help. Thirty-six patients were in CPC1 at follow-up, and some degree of neurological sequelae was found in 40 patients, but was mild in all but 3. Three patients had no subjective complaints, nor could any deficits be detected. Initial defects improved over-time. Short-term memory loss, executive frontal lobe dysfunction along with mild depression and sleep rhythm disturbances were the most common findings.

Because the survival rate is expected to increase, better knowledge of long-term functioning and quality of survival is essential.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the level of functioning of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors 1-6 years later, and to evaluate the predictive value of medical variables on long-term functioning.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study including 63 survivors of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, admitted to a Dutch University hospital between 2001 and 2006. Participants received a questionnaire by post. Primary outcome measures were: participation in society (Community Integration Questionnaire) and quality of life (SF-36). Secondary outcome measures were: physical, cognitive and emotional impairment, daily functioning and caregiver strain. Statistical analyses included multiple regression analyses.
RESULTS: On average 3 years post-cardiac arrest, 74% of the patients experienced a low participation level in society compared with the general population. Over 50% reported severe fatigue, 38% feelings of anxiety and/or depression and 24% a decreased quality of life. Caregivers reported stress related responses, feelings of anxiety and lower quality of life. Seventeen percent of the caregivers reported high caregiver strain, which was associated with the patient's level of functioning. Gender, age, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and therapeutic hypothermia contributed to outcome on at least one domain of long-term functioning.

METHODS: We prospectively studied comatose survivors of OHCA consecutively admitted in a 4-year period. Therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in the last 2-year period, intervention period (n=79), and this group was compared to patients admitted the 2 previous years, control period (n=77). We assessed Cerebral Performance Category (CPC), survival, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and self-rated quality of life (SF-36) 6 months after OHCA in the subgroup with VF/VT as initial rhythm.
RESULTS: CPC in patients alive at hospital discharge was significantly better in the intervention period with a CPC of 1-2 in 97% vs. 71% in the control period, p=0.003, corresponding to an adjusted odds ratio of a favourable cerebral outcome of 17, p=0.01.

METHODS: All resuscitation attempts made from 01.01.1999 to 31.12.2002 in Estonia were retrospectively screened for bystander-witnessed adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of cardiac origin. The patients who survived hospital discharge were included in the study. Their long-term survival data were retrieved from Estonian Population Registry on March 15, 2004. Quality of life was assessed by RAND-36 questionnaire. Comparisons were made with population norms, and patients suffering from myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.
RESULTS: 854 bystander-witnessed resuscitation attempts were made in four years. 91 patients (10.7%) survived to hospital discharge.

18692288,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2008.06.005,Neurological and functional status following cardiac arrest: method and tool utility.,"INTRODUCTION: Assessing the neurological and disability status of cardiac arrest (CA) survivors is important for evaluating the outcomes of resuscitation interventions. The Cerebral Performance Category (CPC)--the standard outcome measurement after CA--has been criticized for its poorly defined, subjective criteria, lack of information regarding its psychometric properties, and poor relationships with long-term measures of disability and quality of life (QOL). This study examined the relationships among the CPC and measures of global disability and QOL at discharge from the hospital and at 1 month after CA.
METHODS: Twenty-one CA survivors participated in the study. A medical chart review was conducted at the time of discharge to determine CPC and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, while 1-month in-person interview was conducted to collect mRS and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) scores. Data collected during the interview were used to determine follow-up CPC scores.
RESULTS: The strength of relationships among measures at discharge and 1 month ranged between fair to good. An examination of scatter plots revealed substantial variability and a wide distribution of chart review and 1-month mRS and HUI3 scores within each CPC category. CPC scores obtained through chart review were significantly better than the CPC 1-month scores, thus overestimating the participants' cognitive and disability status 1 month later.
CONCLUSION: When compared to disability and quality of life measures, it is apparent that the CPC has limited ability to discriminate between mild and moderate brain injury. The validity of using the chart review method for obtaining scores is questionable.",Resuscitation,2008,Raina KD | Callaway C | Rittenberger JC | Holm MB,"Journal Article | Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult | Aged | Disability Evaluation | Female | Health Status Indicators | Heart Arrest | Hospitalization | Humans | Longitudinal Studies | Male | Middle Aged | Neurologic Examination | Outcome Assessment, Health Care | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Reproducibility of Results | Time Factors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
18638367,10.1186/cc6963,"Health care costs, long-term survival, and quality of life following intensive care unit admission after cardiac arrest.","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the costs and health status outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients who present after sudden cardiac arrest with in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
METHODS: Five-year survival, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 questionnaire, SF-36), ICU costs, hospital costs and post-hospital health care costs per survivor, costs per life year gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life year gained of patients admitted to a single ICU were assessed.
RESULTS: One hundred ten of 354 patients (31%) were alive 5 years after hospital discharge. The mean health status index of 5-year survivors was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.85). Women rated their health-related quality of life significantly better than men did (0.87 versus 0.74; P < 0.05). Costs per hospital discharge survivor were 49,952 euro. Including the costs of post-hospital discharge health care incurred during their remaining life span, the total costs per life year gained were 10,107 euro. Considering 5-year survivors only, the costs per life year gained were calculated as 9,816 euro or 14,487 euro per quality-adjusted life year gained. Including seven patients with severe neurological sequelae, costs per life year gained in 5-year survivors increased by 18% to 11,566 euro.
CONCLUSION: Patients who leave the hospital following cardiac arrest without severe neurological disabilities may expect a reasonable quality of life compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Quality-adjusted costs for this patient group appear to be within ranges considered reasonable for other groups of patients.","Critical care (London, England)",2008,Graf J | Mühlhoff C | Doig GS | Reinartz S | Bode K | Dujardin R | Koch KC | Roeb E | Janssens U,Comparative Study | Journal Article,"Adult | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Female | Health Care Costs | Heart Arrest | Humans | Intensive Care Units | Male | Middle Aged | Patient Admission | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Quality-Adjusted Life Years | Survival Rate | Survivors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
18450329,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2008.03.018,Comparison of the Cerebral Performance Category score and the Health Utilities Index for survivors of cardiac arrest.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Cerebral Performance Category score is an easy to use but unvalidated measure of functional outcome after cardiac arrest. We evaluate the comparability of results from the Cerebral Performance Category scale versus those of the validated but more complex Health Utilities Index scale for health-related quality of life.
METHODS: This prospective substudy of the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) Study included adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated in 20 cities. This prospective cohort study included all survivors of out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest enrolled in phase II (rapid basic life support with defibrillation) and phase III (advanced life support) of the OPALS Study, as well as the intervening run-in phase. Survivors were interviewed at 12 months for Cerebral Performance Category Score and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (Health Utilities Index).
RESULTS: Of 8,196 eligible out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 1995 and 2002, 418 (5.1%) survived to discharge, and 305 (3.7%) completed the Health Utilities Index interview and had Cerebral Performance Category scored at 12 months. The 305 patients had the following data: mean age 63.9 years; male 78.0%; paramedic-witnessed arrest 25.6%; bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation 32.1%; initial rhythm ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia 86.9%, Cerebral Performance Category 1 267, Cerebral Performance Category 2 26, Cerebral Performance Category 3 12. Overall, the median scores (interquartile range) were Cerebral Performance Category 1 (1 to 1) and Health Utilities Index 0.84 (0.61 to 0.97). The Cerebral Performance Category score ruled out good quality of life (Health Utilities Index >0.80), with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98% to 100%) and specificity 27.1% (95% CI 20% to 35%); thus, when the Cerebral Performance Category score was 2 or 3, it was unlikely that the Health Utilities Index score would be good. The Cerebral Performance Category score had sensitivity 55.6% (95% CI 42% to 67%) and specificity 96.8% (95% CI 94% to 98%) for predicting poor quality of life (Health Utilities Index >0.40); ie, when Cerebral Performance Category was 1, it was highly unlikely that the Health Utilities Index score would be poor. The weighted kappa was 0.39 and the interclass correlation was 0.51.
CONCLUSION: This represents the largest study yet conducted of the performance of the Cerebral Performance Category score in 1-year survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Overall, the Cerebral Performance Category score classified patients well for their quality of life, ruling out a good Health Utilities Index score with high sensitivity and ruling in poor Health Utilities Index score with high specificity. The Cerebral Performance Category is an important tool in that it indicates broad functional outcome categories that are useful for a number of key clinical and research applications but should not be considered a substitute for the Health Utilities Index.",Annals of emergency medicine,2009,Stiell IG | Nesbitt LP | Nichol G | Maloney J | Dreyer J | Beaudoin T | Blackburn J | Wells GA | OPALS Study Group,"Comparative Study | Journal Article | Multicenter Study | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Activities of Daily Living | Aged | Arrhythmias, Cardiac | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Electric Countershock | Female | Health Status Indicators | Heart Arrest | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
18313592,10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.11.010,Psychosocial status predicts mortality in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.,"BACKGROUND: Quality-of-life (QoL) instruments evaluate various aspects of physical, mental, and emotional health, but how these psychosocial characteristics impact long-term outcome after cardiac arrest and ventricular tachycardia (VT) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of baseline QoL scores with long-term survival of patients enrolled in the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial.
METHODS: Formal QoL measures included SF-36 mental and physical components, Patient Concerns Checklist, and Ferrans and Powers Quality-of-Life Index-Cardiac Version. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess the association of survival and these measures, adjusting for index arrhythmia type, gender, race, age, ejection fraction, history of congestive heart failure, antiarrhythmic therapy, and beta-blocker use.
RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 546 +/- 356 days, 129 deaths occurred among 740 patients. Higher baseline SF-36 physical summary scores (P <.001), higher baseline QoL Index summary scores (P = .015), and lower baseline Patient Concerns Checklist summary scores (P = .047) were associated with longer survival, even after adjustment for clinical variables. When QoL measures were examined simultaneously, only the SF-36 physical summary score remained significant (P = .002).
CONCLUSION: During recovery after sustained VT or cardiac arrest, formal baseline QoL assessment provides important prognostic information independent of traditional clinical data.",Heart rhythm,2008,Steinberg JS | Joshi S | Schron EB | Powell J | Hallstrom A | McBurnie M | AVID Investigators,Journal Article | Multicenter Study | Randomized Controlled Trial,"Aged | Female | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Chi-Square Distribution | Defibrillators, Implantable | Heart Arrest | Predictive Value of Tests | Prognosis | Proportional Hazards Models | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Risk Factors | Tachycardia, Ventricular",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
18052896,,"Mortality and outcomes of elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit at Cairns Base Hospital, Australia.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the survival and outcome of elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit at Cairns Base Hospital.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients aged 60 years or over admitted to the ICU (a Level 2 general unit) at Cairns Base Hospital, a regional hospital in Queensland, during 2003-2005. Mortality was determined by review of hospital records, the Queensland register of deaths, and direct patient or family contact in November 2006. Demographic and clinical details were collected, and the EuroQol-5D questionnaire was used to assess current and pre-ICU quality of life.
RESULTS: 432 patients aged >or= 60 years had 469 admissions to the ICU during 2003-2005. Long-term outcome was determined for 68%: 201 (46%) were confirmed dead, and 94 (22%) were confirmed alive, while the outcome for 137 (32%) remained unknown. Allowing for an estimated mortality of 39% in the unknown group, the overall estimated mortality was 60%. Mean follow-up time was 2.4 (SD, 0.9) years (range, 11-35 months). As age increased, mortality increased: 37% for the 60-70 years age group; 50% for 70-80 years; 61% for 80-90 years, and 83% for > 90 years. The quality of life of survivors was lower on follow-up than on ICU admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients admitted to the ICU have high mortality. As age increases, mortality increases.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: A Dutch rehabilitation centre.
SUBJECTS: Thirty-two patients with hypoxic brain injury caused by a cardiac arrest 2-7 years ago, who were admitted to a brain injury rehabilitation programme.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Quality of Life after Brain Injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI). Data on duration of coma and post-traumatic amnesia were retrieved from medical files.
RESULTS: A significant association was found between duration of coma, complaints of cognitive functioning (r = 0.57, P < 0.05) and quality of life after brain injury (r = -0.70, P < 0.01). Duration of post-traumatic amnesia was associated with both daily functioning (r = -0.70, P < 0.01) and quality of life (r = -0.70, P < 0.01). Furthermore complaints of cognitive functioning were associated with both the level of participation in society (r = 0.76, P < 0.01) and quality of life (r = 0.77, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcome of patients with hypoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest shows that this group is limited in cognitive and daily functioning, participation and quality of life.

Effective primary prevention of sudden cardiac death with implantable cardioverter defibrillators is well demonstrated in patients with coronary disease and depressed ventricular function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 1,232 patients enrolled with prior infarct and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.30, 204 were > or = 75 years old. Of these 204 patients, 121 underwent defibrillator implant. Relative to the younger patients, those > or = 75 years had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), widened QRS, and lower use of beta-blockers and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Relevant clinical covariates were similar in elderly patients randomized to conventional and defibrillator therapy. The hazard ratio for the mortality risk in patients > or = 75 years assigned to defibrillator implant compared with those in conventional therapy was 0.56 (95 confidence interval 0.29-1.08; P = 0.08) after a mean follow-up of 17.2 months. Comparatively, the hazard ratio in patients < 75 years assigned to defibrillator implant was 0.63 (0.45-0.88; P = 0.01) after 20.8 months. Elderly patients had similar reductions in quality of life (QoL) regardless of treatment randomization. Scores through Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI) Questionnaire changes from baseline to 1 year were -0.22 for patients with conventional therapy versus -0.20 for patients with ICD, and -0.36 versus -0.27 at 2 years, respectively (P = NS).

METHODS: From March/1977 to February/2006, 29 patients (15.7+/-5.4 years old) were submitted to ICD implants. Aborted cardiac arrest (41.5%), sustained ventricular tachycardia (27.6%) and primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death (30.9%) indicated device therapy. The number of therapies was evaluated by interviewing patients and by ICD diagnostic data. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure the QoL and the results were compared to healthy population. The expectative of freedom from ICD therapies were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: After 2.6+/-1.8 years follow-up, 8 (27.6%) patients received 141 appropriate ICD shocks due to ventricular tachycardia (6) or ventricular fibrillation (2), and 11 (37.9%) patients received 152 inappropriate ICD shocks due to supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (8) or oversensing (3). Expectative of freedom from appropriate shocks was 74.2+/-9.0% and 66.7+/-10.7% after one and three years, respectively. Compared to healthy population, QoL decreased in physical function (61.7+/-28.7), vitality (64.7+/-19.1), mental health (65.9+/-22.7) and role-emotional domains (66.7+/-38.5).

METHODS: We collected data related to OHCA prospectively during a 2-year period. Long-term survival was determined by cross-referencing our database with two Danish national registries. Patients older than 18 years who had survived for more than 6 months after OHCA were contacted, and after informed written consent was obtained, an interview was conducted in their home and a questionnaire on quality of life (SF-36) and the mini mental state examination (MMSE) were administered.
RESULTS: We had data on 984 cases of OHCA. In 512 cases CPR was attempted and at 6 months, a total of 63 patients were alive corresponding to 12.3% [95% CI: 9.7-15.5%] of all who were treated. Of the 33 patients examined, the median MMSE was 29 (16-30) and two patients, corresponding to 6%, [95% CI: 0.7-20.6%] had an MMSE below 24. Two out of eight aspects of the SF-36 were significantly worse than national norms at the same age, but none of the summary scores differed significantly.
CONCLUSION: Survival beyond 6 months was found in 12.3% OHCA in a physician-based EMS.

16904046,10.3310/hta10270,"A review of the evidence on the effects and costs of implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in different patient groups, and modelling of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility for these groups in a UK context.","OBJECTIVES: To update the systematic review evidence on the effectiveness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); compilation of new data on the service provision in the UK; and on the clinical characteristics, survival, quality of life and costs of ICD patients in the UK, and a new cost-effectiveness model using both international RCT and UK-specific data.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases searched from November 1999 to March 2003, this was supplemented by a systematic review of research published during 2003-5. Survey data.
REVIEW METHODS: Studies were selected and assessed. A survey of ICD centres was carried out. Basic data were obtained from two major implanting centres including 535 patients (approximately 10% of overall UK activity) implanted between 1991 and 2002, and retrieval of fuller data, on patient characteristics, management and resource use, from patient notes for a sample of 426 patients was attempted. A cross-sectional survey collected HRQoL data (using the Nottingham Health Profile, Short Form 36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, EuroQoL 5 Dimensions and disease-specific questions) on a sample of 229 patients. A Markov model combined UK patient data with data from published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to estimate incremental costs per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: None of the economic analyses in the studies found could be directly applied to the UK. The multiple sources of routine data available (including the national ICD database) provide an imperfect picture of the need for and use of ICDs. Implantation rates have been rising to a rate of around 20 per million population. Mean age is increasing and most ICDs are implanted into men aged 45-74 years. There is significant geographical variation. A survey of 41 UK centres provided additional evidence, particularly of variation in level of activity and resourcing. Most detailed data were obtained for 380 patients (89%). The postal survey produced a 73% response rate. Demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to ICD recipients in the UK as a whole and patients included in secondary prevention RCTs. Mean actuarial survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 92%, 86% and 71%, respectively. Patient age at implantation and functional status significantly affected survival. Levels of most of the HRQoL measures were lower than for a UK general population. There was no evidence of a change with time from implantation. Patients who had suffered ICD shocks had significantly poorer HRQoL. Most patients nevertheless expressed a high level of satisfaction with ICD therapy. Mean initial costs of implantation showed little variation between centres (23,300 pounds versus 22,100 pounds) or between earlier and more recent implants. There appeared to be greater variation between patients presenting along different pathways. Postdischarge costs (tests, medications and follow-up consultations) and costs of additional hospitalisations were also calculated. Using the Markov model it was found that over a 20-year horizon, mean discounted incremental costs were 70,900 pounds (35,000-142,400 pounds). Mean discounted gain was 1.24 years (0.29-2.32) or 0.93 QALYs. Cost-effectiveness was most favourable for men aged over 70 years with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 35%. If the treatment effect were to continue, then the cost per life-year over a lifetime might fall to around 32,000 pounds. Five RCTs of ICDs, a meta-analysis and, a cost-effectiveness analysis of ICDs used in primary prevention, and a meta-analysis of ICDs in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy have been published recently. These trials provide confirmation of survival benefit of ICDs used in primary prevention in both ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy patients. Costs per QALY ranged from US$34,000 in older trials to controls being both less expensive and more effective (CABG Patch, DINAMIT). More recent trials estimated cost per QALY between $50,300 and $70,200. The inconsistency in evidence for a HRQoL benefit has not been resolved and further work on risk stratification is necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of short- to medium-term patient benefit from ICDs is strong but cost-effectiveness modelling indicates that the extent of that benefit is probably not sufficient to make the technology cost-effective as used currently in the UK. One reason is the high rates of postimplantation hospitalisation. Better patient targeting and efforts to reduce the need for such hospitalisation may improve cost-effectiveness. Further cost-effectiveness modelling, underpinned by an improved ICD database with reliable long-term follow-up, is required. The absence of a robust measure of the incidence of sudden cardiac death is noted and this may be an area where further organisational changes with improved data collection would help.","Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",2006,Buxton M | Caine N | Chase D | Connelly D | Grace A | Jackson C | Parkes J | Sharples L,Journal Article | Systematic Review,"Aged | Arrhythmias, Cardiac | Cost-Benefit Analysis | Death, Sudden, Cardiac | Defibrillators, Implantable | Female | Hospitalization | Humans | Male | Markov Chains | Patient Selection | Quality of Life | Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic | Survival Analysis | United Kingdom",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
15866401,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2004.10.017,Sex differences in outcome after ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that early defibrillation programs improve survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Reports also suggest that women fare worse than men do after cardiovascular events, but there is no population-based study of sex differences after an OHCA with early defibrillation. We, therefore, compared the short- and long-term survival and quality-of-life (QOL) in women and men after an OHCA.
METHODS: All patients with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) OHCA who received early defibrillation in Olmstead County, Minnesota between November 1990 and December 2000 were included. Using medical records and the cardiac arrest database, the short- and long-term survival and QOL based on a SF-36 survey of each sex were compared. Adjusted QOL scores were obtained by using age- and sex-specific norms from a sample of the general U.S. population; an adjusted score of 50 (normalized mean) was considered normal.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven female and 163 male patients presented with a VF OHCA and early defibrillation. Survival to hospital admission was significantly better for women than men [30 female survivors to admission (81%), 112 male (69%), p = 0.04]. Paradoxically, survival to discharge among those admitted was worse for women [13 female survivors to discharge (43%), 66 male (61%), p = 0.04]. The average length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 years. The 5-year expected survival was 83% in women and 78% in men (p = 0.48). There was no difference in call-to-shock time (6+/-2, 6+/-2 min, p = 0.6) or whether the arrest was witnessed (86, 82%, p = 0.64). There was no statistical difference between women and men in age (64+/-17, 65+/-14 years), ejection fraction (40+/-17, 40+/-18%), diabetes (17, 29%, p = 0.16), hypertension (23, 28%, p = 0.58) or known CAD (27, 48%, p = 0.06). Adjusted QOL scores were similar between women and men in terms of pain (52+/-9, 52+/-10) vitality (47+/-11, 40+/-9), general health (49+/-9, 44+/-7), social function (51+/-10, 51+/-8), and mental health (50+/-10, 49+/-6).
CONCLUSION: Women are more likely to survive to hospital admission following an OHCA. However, admitted women less likely to survive their hospital stay.

15071386,10.1097/01.ccm.0000119421.73520.b6,Impact of age on long-term survival and quality of life following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"OBJECTIVE: Early defibrillation programs have improved long-term outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation. Although long-term collective quality of life and survival are favorable, there are subsets of these patients who may be predisposed to worse outcomes. In particular, elderly patients may present with more comorbid medical conditions affecting their outcome. However, the impact of age on mortality rate and quality of life after rapid defibrillation is unknown.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Hospital.
SUBJECTS: All patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between November 1990 and January 2001 who received rapid defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients received treatment at one hospital.
INTERVENTIONS: Long-term outcome and quality of life were followed. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The quality of life was established by an SF-36 survey.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred patients presented in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; of these, 138 (69%) survived to hospital admission, seven (4%) died in the emergency department, and 79 (39%) were discharged neurologically intact. The average age was 62+/-16 yrs, with 51% (n = 40) of the population > or =65. The average length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 yrs. The 5-yr survival in patients <65 was 94% (confidence interval, 86-100%) and 66% (confidence interval, 52-84%) in patients > or =65 (p <.001). The observed survival in the younger group was not different from that expected in a U.S. age- and gender-matched population. However, in the older group, the expected survival was significantly lower compared with an age- and gender-matched U.S. population (p =.01) but similar to an age-, gender-, and disease-matched cohort of patients from Olmsted County not experiencing an arrest. In both age-dependent cohort populations, the quality of life scores crossed the norm in all categories with exception of vitality in patients >65 yrs old (42.6+/-7.2). In direct comparison between the two patient groups, the older cohort reported lower levels of physical functioning (p =.002), role-emotional score (p =.03), and role-physical score (p =.007). Other SF-36 scores were not different between the groups. Sixty-five percent of patients <65 yrs returned to work compared with 56% of older patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate for ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is significantly improved by the presence of a rapid defibrillation program. In patients <65 yrs old, long-term survival is equal to that of normal individuals and quality of life is similar to the general population. The survival, although high, in older patients is less than that in age-matched healthy controls, and physical and emotional quality of life scores are decreased.",Critical care medicine,2004,Bunch TJ | White RD | Khan AH | Packer DL,Journal Article,Academic Medical Centers | Age Factors | Aged | Cohort Studies | Critical Care | Electric Countershock | Emergency Medical Services | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Heart Arrest | Hospital Mortality | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Minnesota | Patient Discharge | Quality of Life | Reference Values | Risk Factors | Survival Analysis | Ventricular Fibrillation,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
15036737,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2003.09.010,Long-term subjective memory function in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors resuscitated by early defibrillation.,"BACKGROUND: Brain injury after a cardiac arrest remains a major cause of morbidity. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have yielded improved survival of patients after hospital discharge following ventricular fibrillation (VF) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early defibrillation that promptly restores a circulating rhythm should decrease the hypoxic period and subsequent organ injury. Therefore this study was designed to determine if long-term memory complaints persist in VF OHCA survivors resuscitated in an early defibrillation program when compared with a healthy control population not experiencing cardiac arrest.
METHODS: All patients with an OHCA between November 1990 and January 2001 who received defibrillation by emergency medical services personnel in Olmsted County, MN, USA, were included. The memory function questionnaire (MFQ), a 64-item, 7-point Likert-scaled instrument to evaluate the perception of everyday memory functioning was sent to all survivors. The MFQ comprises four scales: general frequency of forgetting (rates general forgetting), retrospective functioning (compares current memory with past ability), seriousness of forgetting (rates how memory impairment impacts daily life), and mnemonics usage (measures adaptation). The MFQ is scaled so that high scores reflect less severe memory complaints. The comparison population comprised members of the Mayo Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) cohort. Quality of life was ascertained with a short form (SF)-36 survey.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine of the 200 VF OHCA patients (40%) were discharged. Twenty-two patients have died since dismissal, with an overall average length of follow-up of 4.9+/-3.0 years. Thirty-eight (67%) of the survivors completed the MFQ. Compared with the normal, there was a significant decrease in the general frequency of forgetting score of 144.2+/-37.4 versus 168.1+/-27.3 ( P<0.001) and the seriousness of forgetting score of 84.8 +/-26.7 versus 95.2+/-19.7 (P=0.004). The retrospective function-scale scores were not significantly different ( 18.4+/-6.8 versus 18.7+/- 5.0 (P=0.74). Younger patients (lesser than 65 years of age) reported an increase in general forgetting and the seriousness of forgetting compared with older survivors. A comparison with SF-36 scores suggested an association between general forgetting and decreased vitality (P=0.03) and the seriousness of forgetting with a decreased general health (P=0.005), mental health (P=0.009), physical functioning ( P=0.02 ), and vitality ( P=0.05).
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of VF OHCA patients, survivors report more memory complaints in comparison with a general healthy older population. There were more long-term-memory complaints in younger patients. Patients with higher long-term quality-of-life score have fewer memory complaints.",Resuscitation,2004,Bunch TJ | White RD | Smith GE | Hodge DO | Gersh BJ | Hammill SC | Shen WK | Packer DL,Comparative Study | Journal Article,"Adult | Age Distribution | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Case-Control Studies | Cognition Disorders | Electric Countershock | Emergency Medical Services | Female | Heart Arrest | Humans | Incidence | Male | Memory Disorders | Mental Recall | Middle Aged | Probability | Prognosis | Quality of Life | Retrospective Studies | Risk Assessment | Sex Distribution | Survivors | Time Factors | Ventricular Fibrillation",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

Posttraumatic stress disorder is a unique symptom configuration after an extreme event consisting of intrusion re-experiencing, avoidance and numbness, and hyperarousal symptoms. We studied a) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in long term survivors of cardiac arrest; b) the role of specific stress factors related to cardiac arrest for the development of PTSD; and c) the influence of sedation and analgesia during or after cardiac arrest on the occurrence of PTSD.
DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study.
SETTING: University teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: Analysis was performed in cardiac arrest survivors who were discharged with favorable neurologic outcome during an 8-yr period (1991-1999).
INTERVENTIONS: All patients received the Davidson Trauma Score for the assessment of PTSD and a modified German version of the EuroQol questionnaire for assessment of quality of life. Cardiac arrest circumstances and administration of sedation and analgesia were assessed.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,630 initially resuscitated patients, 270 patients were discharged with good neurologic outcome. A total of 226 patients were contacted, and 143 patients (63% of all eligible patients) completed the study. Mean time from cardiac arrest to follow up was 45 months (range, 24-66). Thirty-nine patients (27%; 95% confidence interval, 21% to 35%) had a Davidson Trauma Score >40 and fulfilled criteria for PTSD. Patients with PTSD had a significantly lower quality of life. The only independent risk factor for the development of PTSD was younger age. There was no difference between patients with or without PTSD regarding the use of sedation and analgesia during or after cardiac arrest.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PTSD in cardiac arrest survivors is high.

14715335,10.1016/j.amjcard.2003.09.027,Assessment of quality of life and cognitive function after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation.,"This prospective cohort study evaluated the impact of the time-related elements of the ""chain of survival"" on the quality of life of patients, taking their characteristics into account. Between 1995 and 2002, consecutive, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from Amsterdam and the surrounding areas were included in this study. A total of 227 patients (12%) survived to hospital discharge and 174 were definitive survivors who were available for assessment at 6 months. Quality of life was measured with the 136-item Sickness Impact Profile (SIP); cognitive functioning was assessed through the Mini Mental State Examination. SIP profiles were compared with profiles of an open Dutch population of the elderly and patients who experienced a stroke. Time intervals of the chain of survival were calculated from the estimated moment of collapse and related to outcome using regression analysis. The SIP profile of survivors was a little above the reference profile, indicating a slightly poorer quality of life, and below the profile of patients after stroke, indicating a better quality of life. Impaired cognitive function was associated with delay in the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 19). Absence of the need for advanced cardiopulmonary life support was associated with better cognitive functioning (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.9). Female gender and older age were associated with impaired physical functioning. Trends were found for better outcomes after early access, immediate resuscitation, early defibrillation, and early advanced care.",The American journal of cardiology,2004,van Alem AP | Waalewijn RA | Koster RW | de Vos R,"Clinical Trial | Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Advanced Cardiac Life Support | Cognition | Cohort Studies | Electric Countershock | Female | Heart Arrest | Humans | Logistic Models | Male | Middle Aged | Outcome Assessment, Health Care | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Recovery of Function | Regression Analysis | Resuscitation | Sickness Impact Profile | Stroke | Time Factors",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, 20-community, cohort study involved consecutive, adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who survived to 1 year. Patients were contacted by telephone and evaluated for the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3), which describes health as a utility score on a scale from 0 (dead) to 1.0 (perfect health). The 8091 cardiac arrest patients had overall survival rates of 5.2% to hospital discharge and 4.0% to 1 year. We successfully contacted and evaluated 268 of 316 (84.8%) of known 1-year survivors. The median HUI3 score was 0.80 (interquartile range, 0.50 to 0.97), which compares well with age-adjusted values for the general population (0.83). Logistic regression identified 2 factors independently associated with very good quality of life (HUI3 >0.90) and their odds ratios (95% CIs), as follows: age 80 years or older, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.84), and citizen-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 2.0 (1.2 to 3.4) (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest ever conducted for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, clearly shows that these patients have good quality of life, and is the first to demonstrate that citizen-initiated CPR is strongly and independently associated with better quality of life. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing community citizen CPR readiness. Given the low rate of citizen-initiated CPR in many communities, we believe that local and national initiatives should vigorously promote the practice of bystander CPR.",Circulation,2003,Stiell I | Nichol G | Wells G | De Maio V | Nesbitt L | Blackburn J | Spaite D | OPALS Study Group,"Clinical Trial | Clinical Trial, Phase II | Clinical Trial, Phase III | Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Aged | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Cohort Studies | Electric Countershock | Emergency Treatment | Female | Heart Arrest | Humans | Logistic Models | Male | Middle Aged | Ontario | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Survivors | Treatment Outcome | Volunteers,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true
12826637,10.1056/nejmoa023053,Long-term outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest after successful early defibrillation.,"BACKGROUND: Mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation is high. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have improved the rate of survival to hospital discharge. We conducted a population-based analysis of the long-term outcome and quality of life of survivors.
METHODS: All patients who had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between November 1990 and January 2001 who received early defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation in Olmsted County, Minnesota, were included. The survival rate was compared with that of an age-, sex-, and disease-matched (2:1) control population of residents who had not had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and with that of age- and sex-matched controls from the general U.S. population. The quality of life was assessed with use of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and compared with U.S. population norms.
RESULTS: Of 200 patients who presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation, 145 (72 percent) survived to hospital admission (7 died in the emergency department) and 79 (40 percent) were neurologically intact (good overall capability or moderate overall disability) at discharge. The mean (+/-SD) length of follow-up was 4.8+/-3.0 years. Nineteen patients died after discharge from the hospital. The expected five-year survival rate (79 percent) was identical to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched controls (P=0.68) but lower than that among the age- and sex-matched U.S. population (86 percent, P=0.02). Fifty patients completed SF-36 surveys at the end of follow-up, and the majority had a nearly normal quality of life, with the exception of reduced vitality.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival among patients who have undergone rapid defibrillation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is similar to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched patients who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The quality of life among the majority of survivors is similar to that of the general population.",The New England journal of medicine,2003,Bunch TJ | White RD | Gersh BJ | Meverden RA | Hodge DO | Ballman KV | Hammill SC | Shen WK | Packer DL,Journal Article,"Aged | Case-Control Studies | Defibrillators, Implantable | Electric Countershock | Emergency Medical Services | Female | Health Surveys | Heart Arrest | Heart Diseases | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Quality of Life | Survival Rate | Treatment Outcome | United States | Ventricular Fibrillation",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
12297352,10.1016/s0300-9572(02)00203-4,Quality of life 6-months after cardiac arrest.,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of outcome after cardiac arrest focuses mainly on survival. Survivors of cardiac arrest end up in different states of health and survival alone may not be a sensitive measure for successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of cardiac arrest survivors with EQ-5D, a generic instrument developed by the EuroQol group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 1997 to December 2000, all cardiac arrest adult patients admitted to an eight-bed medical/surgical (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. At 6-months after ICU discharge survivors attended a follow-up interview and answered EQ-5D questionnaire. A match-control group was created choosing for each survivor of cardiac arrest two controls, with similar age range (+/-5 years) and similar Apache II (+/-3 Apache II units), that were randomly selected among other ICU patients.
RESULTS: From a total of 1106 patients, 97 (9%) patients were admitted after cardiac arrest. Forty-seven patients (48%) were discharged from ICU. Of these, 11 patients died in the ward. Thirty-six (37%) patients were discharged from hospital. Twelve patients died after hospital discharge but before 6-month evaluation. Five patients were not evaluated, three because they were living in distant locations and two for unknown reasons. Nineteen patients attended the follow-up consultation. Eight of these patients were actively working and six of them had managed to return to their previous activity. Eleven patients were retired and seven of these managed to return to their previous level of activity while four patients presented with anoxic encephalopathy: one with mild and one with moderate neurological dysfunction, two with severe anoxic neurological dysfunction. Although a higher percentage of cardiac arrest survivors reported more extreme problems in some dimensions than other ICU patients, no significant differences were found on HR-QOL, when evaluated by EQ-5D.
CONCLUSIONS: When evaluated with EQ-5D at 6-months after ICU discharge, survivors of cardiac arrest exhibit a HR-QOL similar to other ICU survivors. These results agree with previous reports stating that CPR is frequently unsuccessful but if survival is achieved a fairly good quality of life can be expected.",Resuscitation,2002,Granja C | Cabral G | Pinto AT | Costa-Pereira A,Journal Article,"Adult | Aged | Aged, 80 and over | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Heart Arrest | Humans | Intensive Care Units | Male | Middle Aged | Patient Admission | Portugal | Quality of Life | Surveys and Questionnaires | Survival Analysis | Time Factors | Treatment Outcome",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
12228776,10.1067/mhj.2002.125497,Life after a ventricular arrhythmia.,"BACKGROUND: There are few data from community-based evaluations of outcomes after a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (LTVA). We evaluated patients' quality of life (QOL) and medical costs after hospitalization and treatment for their first episode of an LTVA.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated QOL by use of the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 mental health and vitality scales, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) symptom scale, and resource use in patients discharged after a first episode of an LTVA in a managed care population of 2.4 million members.
RESULTS: We enrolled 264 subjects with new cases of LTVA. Although functional status initially decreased compared with self-reports of pre-event functional status, both functional status and symptom levels improved significantly during the study period. These improvements were greater in patients receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) than in patients receiving amiodarone. Ratings of mental health and vitality were not significantly different between the treatment groups and did not change significantly during follow-up. The total 2-year medical costs were higher for patients receiving an ICD than for patients receiving amiodarone, despite lower costs during the follow-up period for the patients receiving an ICD.
CONCLUSIONS: New onset of an LTVA has a substantial negative initial impact on QOL. With therapy, most patients have improvements in their QOL and symptom level, possibly more so after treatment with an ICD. The costs of treating these patients are very high.",American heart journal,2002,Hsu J | Uratsu C | Truman A | Quesenberry C | McDonald KM | Hlatky MA | Selby J,"Comparative Study | Journal Article | Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Aged | Amiodarone | Anti-Arrhythmia Agents | Defibrillators, Implantable | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Health Care Costs | Health Status | Heart Arrest | Hospitalization | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Prospective Studies | Quality of Life | Tachycardia, Ventricular | Treatment Outcome | Ventricular Fibrillation",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true
11947973,10.1016/s0300-9572(02)00002-3,Quality of life in long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The quality of life in long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may be a good outcome measure after resuscitation. Therefore, the psychosocial situation and quality of life in such patients after successful resuscitation was evaluated.
METHODS: Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a community referred to a single tertiary care centre were compared with matched controls. Quality of life was evaluated in 50 consecutive arrest cases (40 males, 10 females; 60+/-13 years) 5-68 months (mean 31.7) after resuscitation according to American Heart Association protocols.
RESULTS: The Psychological General Well-being Index questionnaire indicated no significant differences in anxiety, depression, vitality, general well-being, or self-control between patients and controls. However, the Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire demonstrated significant decreases in physical mobility (14.5+/-18.1 vs. 4.0+/-8.5, P=0.0001), energy levels (25.3+/-31.0 vs. 2.0+/-8.0, P=0.0001), emotional reactions (11.3+/-16.6 vs. 4.0+/-10.2, P=0.009), and sleep patterns (19.2+/-28.6 vs. 8.4+/-16.7, P=0.023) in the arrest patients. Little differences were measured with the Everyday-Life Questionnaire. 49 of the 50 arrest patients judged their situation after resuscitation worth living; no significant changes in familial, and psychosocial parameters occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life was associated with few changes in psychosocial profile after successful resuscitation. The subjective negative factors bore little impact on the quality of daily living in our patients. Thus, continued efforts to improve out-of-hospital resuscitation measures for cardiac arrest are justified since long-term survivors can expect a good quality of life after successful resuscitation.",Resuscitation,2002,Saner H | Borner Rodriguez E | Kummer-Bangerter A | Schüppel R | von Planta M,Journal Article,Emergency Medical Services | Female | Heart Arrest | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Quality of Life | Resuscitation | Survivors | Switzerland,pubmed,B,2026-02-17,false,true,true

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study.
SETTING: An 18-bed, adult cardiac surgery intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching center.
PATIENTS: Twenty-nine cardiac surgery patients who suffered an unexpected cardiac arrest in the immediate postoperative period.
INTERVENTIONS: The New York Heart Association classification and a questionnaire based on the Nottingham Health Profile were used to evaluate functional status and quality of life 4 yrs after hospital discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 29 patients who experienced cardiac arrest during the first 24 hrs after cardiac surgery, 27 patients (93%) were successfully resuscitated and 23 patients (79%) survived to hospital discharge. Evaluation 4 yrs postdischarge showed that, of the 29 patients, 16 patients (55%) were still alive (long-term survivors). Functional status assessment of long-term survivors revealed that 12 patients (75%) were grouped in New York Heart Association class I, 3 patients (19%) in class II, and 1 patient (6%) in class III. None of them had a neurologic deficit. They all were living independently at home, without need of any nursing care. No patient reported any abnormal emotional reactions, and six patients (38%) had mild sleep disturbances, such as early awaking. Regarding activities of daily living, 20% returned to work, 94% were able to look after their home, 96% had a social life, 63% were sexually active, 81% were involved in their hobbies, and 75% had gone on holidays.

This article describes the QOL in patients who participated in The CABG Patch Trial. This trial evaluated the potential benefit of empiric ICD implantation in patients with an increased risk of arrhythmic cardiac death as determined by reduced ejection fraction (<0.36) and an abnormal signal-averaged ECG. Patients were randomized to control (no ICD) or treatment (ICD) limbs. QOL was measured using the SF-36 and other measures among 490 (68%) of 719 patients available at 6-month follow-up. Analysis was performed on 228 control patients (those without ICDs) and 262 patients with ICDs.
RESULTS: Six months after having CABG surgery, patients in the ICD group had lower levels of psychological well-being than those in the control group. In addition, compared to controls, patients whose ICDs had delivered therapy reported feeling less healthy, had reduced physical and emotional role functioning, and had lower levels of psychological well-being.
CONCLUSION: Strategies aimed at easing patients' adjustment to ICDs should be developed and tested for efficacy in the setting of ICD prophylaxis.",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,1999,Namerow PB | Firth BR | Heywood GM | Windle JR | Parides MK,"Clinical Trial | Journal Article | Randomized Controlled Trial | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't | Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Arrhythmias, Cardiac | Coronary Artery Bypass | Death, Sudden, Cardiac | Defibrillators, Implantable | Female | Follow-Up Studies | Health Status | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Patient Satisfaction | Quality of Life | Risk Factors | Socioeconomic Factors | Stroke Volume | Surveys and Questionnaires",pubmed,B,2026-02-17,true,true,true

A prospective study.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life of survivors of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and to correlate quality of life with clinically important parameters.
METHODS: Cohort followed at least six months after hospital discharge. Eligible patients had survived to hospital discharge after sudden cardiac arrest in 1) EDs, wards, and intensive care units of five university hospitals and 2) all locations outside hospitals in two midsized cities. Of 126 patients discharged alive, 30 died before they could be interviewed. Of the 96 patients remaining, 86 (90% of available patients, 68% of survivors to discharge) completed the interview. Quality of life was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, which describes health as a utility score on a scale from perfect health (equal to 1.0) to death (equal to 0.)
RESULTS: Mean age (+/- SD) of interviewed survivors was 65 +/- 14 years, and 47 (55%) were male; mean time between collapse and initiation of CPR was 2.2 +/- 2.6 minutes. Mean utility was 0.72 (+/- 0.22). Utilities were significantly higher among patients who had a shorter duration of resuscitation (mean = 0.81 for those who received less than 2 minutes of CPR, 0.76 for those who received 3 to 10 minutes, and 0.65 for others, p = 0.05, r2 = 0.07). Mean utilities of survivors were worse than those of the general population (mean = 0.85 +/- 0.16, p < 0.01) and those whose activities were not limited by chronic disease (mean = 0.91 +/- 0.08, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Although overall survival was poor, most survivors had acceptable health-related quality of life. Therefore, concerns about poor quality of life are not a valid reason to abandon efforts to improve the health care system's response to victims of sudden cardiac arrest.

DESIGN: Extracted from a prospective national survey on Dutch intensive care units (ICUs).
SETTING: Thirty-six ICUs of both university and nonuniversity hospitals, spread throughout the country.
METHODS: For a period of 6 months, 9,803 consecutive ICU admissions entered the study. Outcome in connection with in-hospital CPR was analyzed by comparing the CPR group (n = 477) with a standardized control group without CPR (n = 500).
INTERVENTIONS: Activities of daily living were registered at the time of hospital admission. A record was kept of each patient for demographics, severity of illness, length of stay, daily use of manpower and ICU technology, and mortality. Six months after hospital discharge, the QOL of 69 patients in both the CPR and control groups was measured with the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP).
RESULTS: CPR was performed in 4.8 percent of the patients, mainly from the general ward. These patients were older, had a higher severity of illness, and a higher daily consumption of nursing resources. The QOL did not correlate with severity of illness on admission, length of stay, or consumption of resources in the ICU. On the whole, the SIP scores of both CPR and control groups did not differ much: 11.7 vs 10.7, and circulatory arrest did not appear to impair the self-sufficiency in the study group significantly in comparison with the controls. An increased dysfunction was found in the CPR group of patients concerning their work and their psychosocial functioning.

A non-randomized cohort prospective study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of defibrillation in prehospital cardiac arrest. Two ambulance companies in the study area developed a defibrillation protocol and they formed the experimental group. A subgroup of these patients received airway management with an esophageal obturator airway (EOA) or endotracheal intubation (ETT). The control group was composed of patients who suffered a prehospital cardiac arrest and did not receive prehospital defibrillation. All survivors were assessed for residual deficits using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS). A total of 221 patients were studied over a 32-month period. Both the experimental group (N = 161) and the control group (N = 60) were comparable with respect to age, sex distribution, and ambulance response time. Survival to hospital discharge was 2/60 (3.3%) in the control group and 12/161 (6.3%) in the experimental group. This difference is not statistically significant. Survival in the experimental group by airway management technique was basic airway support (3/76 3.9%), EOA (3/67 4.5%), and ETT (6/48 12.5%). The improved effect on survival by ETT management was statistically significant. Survivors had minor differences in memory, work, and recreation as compared to ischemic heart disease patients as measured by the SIP and DRS. No effect of defibrillation was found on survival to hospital discharge. However, endotracheal intubation improved survival in defibrillated patients.
