TI  - The self-inflating bulb to detect esophageal intubation during emergency airway management
T2  - ANESTHESIOLOGY
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Anesthesiologists
AB  - Background: The negative-pressure test using a self-inflating bulb (SIB) during emergency intubation was studied to determine its reliability and predictive value in this setting.
   Methods: The endotracheal tube (ETT) position was tested in 300 consecutive patients undergoing in-hospital emergency endotracheal intubation. Immediately after intubation and before ETT cuff inflation, the following protocol was strictly followed: (1) an SIB was compressed connected to the ETT, and released. A 10-s period was allowed for the bulb to inflate. (2) The ETT cuff was inflated and the ETT position was confirmed using colorimetric or infrared carbon dioxide detection, or both, combined with clinical evaluation.
   Results: There were 19 esophageal intubations (6% incidence). The SIB correctly identified all patients with esophageal intubation (sensitivity, 100% and correctly identified all but three ETTs placed in the trachea (specificity, 99%). The three tracheally placed tubes that were misidentified by the bulb syringe occurred during one case each of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, copious secretions, and obesity; of note were three tracheally placed tubes that were misidentified by the carbon dioxide analyzers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Conclusions: The SIB proved to be a sensitive and specific test for esophageal intubation in the emergency setting when used according to the protocol described, and it is complementary. to carbon dioxide detection. The predictive value of the bulb syringe appears to be improved when a prolonged period for reinflation is allowed. It holds particular promise because of its low cost and portability.

TI  - Septic Shock Secondary to a Pyogenic Liver Abscess Following Complicated Appendicitis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Pyogenic liver abscesses (PLAs) are a rare condition in North America and Europe and, rarer still, the cause of septic shock. This case report will describe the rare occurrence of a PLA producing septic shock in a 36-year-old male residing in the United Kingdom following a case of complicated appendicitis.
   The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a three-week history of intermittent loose stools, cramping abdominal pain, recurrent fevers, a heart rate of 111 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg, and a fever of 40.1 degrees Celsius. Despite prompt broad spectrum antibiotic administration and three liters of fluid resuscitation, the patient remained shocked which led to an ICU admission.
   A CT scan prior to transfer found a 7 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm lesion representing a liver abscess (LA) as well as gross inflammatory change affecting the distal small bowel. The LA was managed through insertion of a percutaneous drain under ultrasound guidance performed by the interventional radiology team, as well as ongoing IV antibiotics. Following growth of the gut commensal Streptococcus constellatus from the abscess fluid culture, a colonoscopy was performed which found a severely distorted and inflamed terminal ileum with an impassable stricture, raising not only the suspicion of appendicitis but also Crohn's disease.
   Following the colonoscopy, after a total of 10 days admission, the patient was allowed to go home with a four-week course of oral co-amoxiclav. After discharge, the patient's case was discussed in the gastroenterology inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) multi-disciplinary team meeting due to concerns raised about possible Crohn's disease from the admission CT and following colonoscopy findings. Given the absence of relevant IBD symptoms, a reassuring outpatient MRI small bowel scan (found considerable resolution of the right iliac fossa inflammatory process) and a fecal calprotectin of 29 four months post discharge (normal=0-51 mu g/g), it was concluded the terminal ileum changes were most likely accounted for by a complicated course of appendicitis. When reviewed in a telephone clinic 10 weeks post discharge, he was found to have no persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and was subsequently discharged.
   This case highlights the importance of comprehensive imaging and colonoscopy in the work up of those patients with PLAs with no otherwise evident precipitating factor.

TI  - End-of-life care in German and Dutch nursing homes: a cross-sectional study on nursing home staff's perspective in 2022
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background As society ages, the need for nursing home care is steadily increasing and end-of-life care of nursing home residents has become increasingly more important. End-of-life care differs between Germany and the neighbouring Netherlands. For example, a much higher proportion of German compared to Dutch nursing home residents is hospitalized at the end of life. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate end-of-life care in German and Dutch nursing homes.Methods In this cross-sectional study, a postal survey was sent to 600 randomly selected German and Dutch nursing homes each and addressed to the nursing staff management. Participants were asked to estimate the percentage of nursing home residents whose wishes for emergency situations (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation) are known and to indicate whether facilities offer advanced care planning (ACP). They were also asked to estimate whether general practitioners (GPs)/elder care physicians (ECPs) and nursing home staff are usually well trained for end-of-life care. Finally, participants were asked to estimate the proportion of nursing home residents who die in hospital rather than in the nursing home and to rate overall end-of-life care provision.Results A total of 301 questionnaires were included in the analysis; 199 from German and 102 from Dutch nursing homes (response 33.2% and 17.0%). German participants estimated that 20.5% of residents die in the hospital in contrast to the Dutch estimation of 5.9%. In German nursing homes, ACP is offered less often (39.2% in Germany, 75.0% in the Netherlands) and significantly fewer wishes for emergency situations of residents were known than in Dutch nursing homes. GPs were considered less well-trained for end-of-life care in Germany. The most important measures to improve end-of-life care were comparable in both countries.Conclusion Differences in (the delivery and knowledge of) end-of-life care between Germany and the Netherlands could be observed in this study. These could be due to structural differences (ECPs available 24/7 in the majority of Dutch nursing homes) and cultural differences (more discussion on quality of life versus life-sustaining treatments in the Netherlands). Due to these differences, a country-specific approach is necessary to improve end-of-life care.

TI  - Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with cardiogenic shock
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Aims The safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with contemporary balloon expandable transcatheter valves in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) remain largely unknown. In this study, the TAVRs performed for CS between June 2015 and September 2022 using SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra bioprosthesis from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry were analysed. Methods and results CS was defined as: (i) coding of CS within 24 h on Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry form; and/or (ii) pre-procedural use of inotropes or mechanical circulatory support devices and/or (iii) cardiac arrest within 24 h prior to TAVR. The control group was comprised of all the other patients undergoing TAVR. Baseline characteristics, all-cause mortality, and major complications at 30-day and 1-year outcomes were reported. Landmark analysis was performed at 30 days post-TAVR. Cox-proportional multivariable analysis was performed to determine the predictors of all-cause mortality at 1 year. A total of 309 505 patients underwent TAVR with balloon-expandable valves during the study period. Of these, 5006 patients presented with CS prior to TAVR (1.6%). The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 10.76 & PLUSMN; 10.4. The valve was successfully implanted in 97.9% of patients. Technical success according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria was 94.5%. In a propensity-matched analysis, CS was associated with higher in-hospital (9.9% vs. 2.7%), 30-day (12.9% vs. 4.9%), and 1-year (29.7% vs. 22.6%) mortality compared to the patients undergoing TAVR without CS. In the landmark analysis after 30 days, the risk of 1-year mortality was similar between the two groups [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.21]. Patients who were alive at 1 year noted significant improvements in functional class (Class I/II 89%) and quality of life (& UDelta;KCCQ score +50). In the multivariable analysis, older age (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.03), peripheral artery disease (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.47), prior implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07-1.77), patients on dialysis (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.69-2.53), immunocompromised status (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.06-2.12), lower aortic valve mean gradient, lower albumin levels, lower haemoglobin levels, and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores were independently associated with 1-year mortality. Conclusion This large observational real-world study demonstrates that the TAVR is a safe and effective treatment for aortic stenosis patients presenting with CS. Patients who survived the first 30 days after TAVR had similar mortality rates to those who were not in CS.

TI  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support after the Fontan operation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used to support children with cardiac failure after the Fontan operation. Mortality is high, and causes of mortality remain unclear. We evaluated the in-hospital mortality and factors associated with mortality in these patients.
   Methods: Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry data on patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after the Fontan operation from 1987 to 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographics and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation data were compared for survivors and nonsurvivors. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with mortality.
   Results: Of 230 patients, 81 (35%) survived to hospital discharge. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was more frequent (34% vs 17%, P = .04), and median fraction of inspired oxygen concentration was higher (1 [confidence interval, 0.9-1.0] vs 0.9 [confidence interval, 0.8-1.0], P = .03) before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration and incidence of complications, including surgical bleeding, neurologic injury, renal failure, inotrope use on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and bloodstream infection, were higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (P < .05 for all). In a multivariable model, neurologic injury (odds ratio, 5.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-13.61), surgical bleeding (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-4.56), and renal failure (odds ratio, 2.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-5.59) increased mortality. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration of more than 65 hours to 119 hours (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.76) was associated with decreased mortality.
   Conclusions: Cardiac failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after the Fontan operation is associated with high mortality. Complications during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support increase mortality odds. Prompt correction of surgical bleeding when possible may improve survival.

TI  - Medical interventions for children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: what is the value of a short disabled life?
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - Children with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 (T13 or T18) have low survival rates, and survivors have significant disabilities. Life saving interventions (LSIs) are generally not recommended by many healthcare providers (HCPs). After a diagnosis of T13 or T18, many parents chose termination of pregnancy or comfort care at birth, but others consider treatment to prolong the lives of their children. While LSIs may be effective at prolonging the life of some children, the quality of life of survivors and the possible burden on the family may be considered negatively by HCP, which may lead to conflicts with families. Resource allocation considerations are often invoked to withhold LSI for T13 or T18 even though they are seldom mentioned for older patients with comparable outcomes.
   ConclusionWe should strive to improve communication with parents by 1. Investigating these conditions further to be able to better inform parents and 2. Providing balanced information for families and personalised care for each child.

TI  - One-year survival of patients with a prolonged ICU stay after cardiac surgery -: Predictors for a bad prognosis
T2  - ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN
AB  - Background: In particular in elderly patients, complicated cardiac surgery is often associated with a prolonged postoperative ICU stay and an uncertain prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the one-year survival of such patients, and to identify predictors of a poor prognosis.
   Methods: Over a period of two years, the data of all patients needing a postoperative ICU stay of 7 or more days after heart surgery were analysed retrospectively. Patients undergoing thoracic organ transplantation were excluded. One year after operation, all patients or their relatives were contacted. For the statistical analyses the t-test, Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression were applied.
   Results: 107 patients (76 males, 31 females; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.9 years) had a prolonged ICU stay (range 7 to 143 days; mean 19.6 +/- 18.8 days) after heart surgery (41.1% coronary artery surgery, 7.5% aortic valve surgery, 7.5% mitral valve surgery, 14.0% combinated coronary artery and valve surgery, 3.7% aortic surgery, and 26.2% other cardiac surgery procedures). 80 patients (74.8%) survived the first postoperative year, while 27 patients (25.2%) did not; of these, 14 (51.9%) died while still in hospital. The deceased significantly more often had pulmonary hypertension (29.6% vs. 10.1%, p=0.026), atrial fibrillation (29.6% vs. 11.3%, p=0.034) and a creatinin value above 1.6 mg/dl (33.3% vs. 12.5%, p=0.021) preoperatively, continuous infusion of catecholamins (88.9% vs. 68.8%, p=0.045) intraoperatively, and underwent dialysis (63.0% vs. 30.4%, p=0.005), cardiac resuscitation (40.7% vs. 17.7%, p=0.020), mechanical ventilation for more than 11 days (85.2% vs. 29.1 %, p<0.001), or an ICU stay of more than 14 days (70.4% vs. 40.0%, p=0.008) postoperatively. The risk of dying within the first year increases in the presence of pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio 6,7) or mechanical ventilation for more than 11 days (odds ratio 15.5).
   Conclusions: The chances of surviving a prolonged and complicated ICU stay after cardiac surgery beyond the first postoperative year are unexpectedly high. Pulmonary hypertension and mechanical ventilation for more than 11 days have the greatest negative impact on prognosis.

TI  - Bridge-to-recovery strategy using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for critical pulmonary hypertension complicated with cardiogenic shock
T2  - INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Studies on mechanical-medical bridging for decompensated pulmonary hypertension (PH) are limited. We analysed the outcomes for critical PH patients who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support using a bridge-to-recovery (BTR) strategy. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors of BTR and evaluate the outcomes of survivors.
   METHODS: Between 2009 and 2012, 6 patients who received veno-arterial ECMO due to decompensated PH with cardiogenic shock were retrospectively reviewed. All of the patients were managed with an aggressive titration of PH therapies and the optimization of right ventricular (RV) function to wean them off of ECMO. Three of the patients survived to discharge, and the others suffered in-hospital mortality. The differences between their baseline characteristics, ECMO set-up, haemodynamic change and complications were analysed.
   RESULTS: The average age was 46.67 +/- 14.07 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2. The non-survival group exhibited a higher baseline systolic pulmonary artery pressure (127.67 +/- 25.81 vs 67.67 +/- 24.83 mmHg, P = 0.044) than the survival group before ECMO. All of the non-survivors underwent cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation prior to ECMO implantation (100 vs 0%, P = 0.100). The survivors tended to have received suboptimal PH therapies before ECMO and had more readily correctable predisposing factors of right ventricular failure. The non-survivors required a longer duration of ECMO and suffered more end-organ failure or sepsis, although those differences were not statistically significant. Pneumonia developed in 3 of the survivors and caused late mortality in 2 after discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: ECMO provides a therapeutic window for the medical stabilization of critically decompensated PH patients. Prompt ECMO intervention before haemodynamic collapse and careful patient selection are critical for successful BTR outcomes.

TI  - AUGMENTED PASSIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY WITH P4 PEPTIDE IMPROVES PHAGOCYTE ACTIVITY IN SEVERE SEPSIS
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance threatens to undermine treatment of severe infection; new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Preclinical work shows that augmented passive immunotherapy with P4 peptide increases phagocytic activity and shows promise as a novel therapeutic strategy. Our aim was to determine ex vivo P4 activity in a target population of patients admitted to critical care with severe infection. Methods: We prospectively recruited UK critical care unit patients with severe sepsis and observed clinical course (>= 3 months postdischarge). Blood samples were taken in early (<= 48 h postdiagnosis, n = 54), latent (7 days postdiagnosis, n = 39), and convalescent (3-6 months postdiagnosis, n = 18) phases of disease. The primary outcome measure was killing of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae by neutrophils with and without P4 peptide stimulation. We also used a flow cytometric whole blood phagocytosis assay to determine phagocyte association and oxidation of intraphagosomal reporter beads. Results: P4 peptide increased neutrophil killing of opsonized pneumococci by 8.6% (confidence interval 6.35-10.76, P< 0.001) in all phases of sepsis, independent of infection source and microbiological status. This represented a 54.9% increase in bacterial killing compared with unstimulated neutrophils (15.6%) in early phase samples. Similarly, P4 peptide treatment significantly increased neutrophil and monocyte intraphagosomal reporter bead association and oxidation, independent of infection source. Conclusions: We have extended preclinical work to demonstrate that P4 peptide significantly increases phagocytosis and bacterial killing in samples from a target patient population with severe sepsis. This study supports the rationale for augmented passive immunotherapy as a therapeutic strategy in severe sepsis.

TI  - The Impact of a Machine Learning Early Warning Score on Hospital Mortality: A Multicenter Clinical Intervention Trial
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a machine learning early warning risk score, electronic Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage (eCART), on mortality for elevated-risk adult inpatients. DESIGN: A pragmatic pre- and post-intervention study conducted over the same 10-month period in 2 consecutive years. SETTING: Four-hospital community-academic health system. PATIENTS: All adult patients admitted to a medical-surgical ward. INTERVENTIONS: During the baseline period, clinicians were blinded to eCART scores. During the intervention period, scores were presented to providers. Scores greater than or equal to 95th percentile were designated high risk prompting a physician assessment for ICU admission. Scores between the 89th and 95th percentiles were designated intermediate risk, triggering a nurse-directed workflow that included measuring vital signs every 2 hours and contacting a physician to review the treatment plan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was all-cause inhospital mortality. Secondary measures included vital sign assessment within 2 hours, ICU transfer rate, and time to ICU transfer. A total of 60,261 patients were admitted during the study period, of which 6,681 (11.1%) met inclusion criteria (baseline period n = 3,191, intervention period n = 3,490). The intervention period was associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality for the main cohort (8.8% vs 13.9%; p < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.52-0.71]). A significant decrease in mortality was also seen for the average-risk cohort not subject to the intervention (0.49% vs 0.26%; p < 0.05; adjusted OR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41-0.74]). In subgroup analysis, the benefit was seen in both high- (17.9% vs 23.9%; p = 0.001) and intermediate-risk (2.0% vs 4.0 %; p = 0.005) patients. The intervention period was also associated with a significant increase in ICU transfers, decrease in time to ICU transfer, and increase in vital sign reassessment within 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a machine learning early warning score-driven protocol was associated with reduced inhospital mortality, likely driven by earlier and more frequent ICU transfer.

TI  - Improving prediction accuracy of hospital arrival vital signs using a multi-output machine learning model: a retrospective study of JSAS-registry data
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundCritically ill patients can deteriorate rapidly; therefore, prompt prehospital interventions and seamless transition to in-hospital care upon arrival are crucial for improving survival. In Japan, helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) complement general emergency medical services (GEMS) by providing on-site care, reducing transport times, and aiding facility selection. Vital signs at hospital arrival determine initial management, but existing models are poor at predicting them, especially in patients receiving continuous interventions from both GEMS and HEMS. Therefore, we developed a machine-learning model to accurately predict the actual values of vital signs at hospital arrival using limited patient characteristic data and prehospital vital signs.MethodsUsing data from the Japanese Society for Aeromedical Services registry, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients aged >= 18 years transported by HEMS between April 2020 and March 2022. Patients with cardiac arrest during transport, missing vital signs, and data inconsistencies were excluded. The predictive model used prehospital vital signs from GEMS and HEMS contact times, demographic characteristics, and intervention information. The primary outcome was the actual values of vital signs measured at hospital arrival. After data preprocessing, we constructed a deep neural network multi-output regression model using Bayesian optimization. Model performance was assessed by comparing the predicted values with the actual hospital arrival measurements using mean absolute error, R-2 score, residual standard deviation, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Additionally, the NN model's performance was compared with alternative methods, namely HEMS contact values and change-based predictions derived solely from prehospital data.ResultsThe study included 10,478 patients (median age 70 years; 69% male). The model achieved mean absolute errors of 7.1 bpm for heart rate, 15.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure, 10.8 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, 2.9 breaths/min for respiratory rate, and 0.62 points for Glasgow Coma Scale score. The Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.54 to 0.86. The model outperformed other methods, especially for R-2 scores and residual standard deviations, demonstrating its superior ability to predict actual vital signs values.ConclusionThe multi-output regression model accurately predicted the actual values of vital signs measured at hospital arrival using limited prehospital information, demonstrating the effectiveness of advanced modeling techniques.

AB  - Deletion of the telomerase RNA gene (TER1) in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis results in gradual loss of telomeric repeats and progressively declining cell growth capability (growth senescence). We show that this initial growth senescence is characterized by abnormally large, defectively dividing cells and is delayed when cells initially contain elongated telomeres. However, cells that survive the initial catastrophic senescence emerge relatively frequently, and their subsequent growth without telomerase is surprisingly efficient. Survivors have lengthened telomeres, often much longer than wild type, but that are still subject to gradual shortening. Production of these postsenescence survivors is strongly dependent on the RAD52 gene. We propose that shortened, terminal telomeric repeat tracts become uncapped, promoting recombinational repair between them to regenerate lengthened telomeres in survivors. This process, which we term telomere cap-prevented recombination (CPR) may be a general alternative telomere maintenance pathway in eukaryotes.

TI  - Family-authored ICU diaries to reduce fear in patients experiencing a cardiac arrest (FAID fear): A pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) and their family members often experience significant fear-based distress (cardiac fear; i.e., fear about the CA survivor's heart). Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White). Recruitment (16/25 referred; 64.0%), retention (14/16 enrolled; 87.5%), and intervention adherence (7/10 completed; 70%) were promising. Most agreed that the ICU diary intervention was appropriate (7/10 completed; 70.0%), feasible (9/10 completed; 90.0%]), and acceptable (8/10 completed; 80.0%). Fear was nonsignificantly lower in intervention participants (v. control) at end of hospital care and 30 days later. FAID Fear represents a first step in building theory-based dyadic interventions that can be implemented to support family members of CA survivors in the ICU, with potential to improve outcomes in CA survivors.

TI  - NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES AND THE BRAIN
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES ON OUT-OF-BODY AND NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES
AB  - This chapter presents an overview of neuroscientific approaches to the near-death experience (NDE) focusing on the possible roles of hypoxia, hypercarbia, neurochemicals such as endorphins and serotonin, unusual activity in the temporal lobes, and REM-state intrusions into wakeful consciousness. Recent claims that findings from NDE studies constitute a major challenge to the central assumptions of modern neuroscience are critically assessed. Such claims appear to be based upon a misconception of the so-called "dying-brain hypothesis" and misrepresentations of previous research. It is concluded that although the neuroscientific approach requires further refinement before a definitive and comprehensive account of NDEs can be provided, this approach holds the most promise with respect to understanding this powerful and intriguing aspect of human experience.

TI  - Train-Associated Injuries Pose a Significant Burden on Trauma Care Systems of Emerging Economies
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Background The Indian railway system is the fourth largest in the world and causes about 15 deaths every day, due to intentional or unintentional reasons. This study presents a 5-year retrospective analysis of patients injured due to train-associated events, managed at a level-1 trauma center in India. Materials and methods Hospital-based trauma registry data of train-associated injuries presenting between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Data from 726 patients were analyzed for demographics, injury events, injury regions, their management and outcomes. ISS and NISS were used to quantify the injury severity. Results Mean age was 33 years, with male-to-female ratio 86 to 14%. The majority of patients (62%) were between 20-40 years. The median ISS was 9 (IQR 4-16), median hospital stays 11 days (IQR6-23), with in-hospital mortality of 17.4%. Presence of head injury; ISS > 9 and CPR in ED were independent risk factors of mortality. Trespassers on the rail track had significantly more severe injuries compared to passengers (Median ISS 13 vs. 9, p = 0.012; Median NISS 22 vs.17, p = 0.015); however, mortality and hospital length of stay were not significantly different. Location of injury event (on platform or tracks) showed no difference between the severity of injuries, mortality and hospital length of stay. Conclusions Current study reports comprehensive injury patterns and outcomes of train-associated injuries from a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). Apart from the mortality, there is a high incidence of permanent disabilities from extremity amputations. No significant difference was noted in the severity and outcomes among patients injured on or off train platforms, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety measures including enforcement and promoting safe behavior not only on locations like train tracks but equally at platforms.

TI  - Heart Rate Variability Analysis in an Experimental Model of Hemorrhagic Shock and Resuscitation in Pigs
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown as a promising non-invasive technique for assessing the cardiac autonomic modulation in trauma. The aim of this study was to evaluate HRV during hemorrhagic shock and fluid resuscitation, comparing to traditional hemodynamic and metabolic parameters.
   Methods
   Twenty anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs were submitted to hemorrhagic shock (60% of estimated blood volume) and evaluated for 60 minutes without fluid replacement. Surviving animals were treated with Ringer solution and evaluated for an additional period of 180 minutes. HRV metrics (time and frequency domain) as well as hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were evaluated in survivors and non-survivors animals.
   Results
   Seven of the 20 animals died during hemorrhage and initial fluid resuscitation. All animals presented an increase in time-domain HRV measures during haemorrhage and fluid resuscitation restored baseline values. Although not significantly, normalized low-frequency and LF/HF ratio decreased during early stages of haemorrhage, recovering baseline values later during hemorrhagic shock, and increased after fluid resuscitation. Non-surviving animals presented significantly lower mean arterial pressure (43 +/- 7vs57 +/- 9 mmHg, P<0.05) and cardiac index (1.7 +/- 0.2vs2.6 +/- 0.5 L/min/m(2), P<0.05), and higher levels of plasma lactate (7.2 +/- 2.4vs3.7 +/- 1.4 mmol/L, P<0.05), base excess (-6.8 +/- 3.3vs-2.3 +/- 2.8 mmol/L, P<0.05) and potassium (5.3 +/- 0.6vs4.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, P<0.05) at 30 minutes after hemorrhagic shock compared with surviving animals.
   Conclusions
   The HRV increased early during hemorrhage but none of the evaluated HRV metrics was able to discriminate survivors from non-survivors during hemorrhagic shock. Moreover, metabolic and hemodynamic variables were more reliable to reflect hemorrhagic shock severity than HRV metrics.

TI  - A cost-effectiveness model of genetic testing for the evaluation of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - HEART
AB  - Background Traditional management of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) involves periodic lifetime clinical screening of family members, an approach that does not identify all gene carriers owing to incomplete penetrance and significant clinical heterogeneity. Limitations in availability and cost have meant genetic testing is not part of routine clinical management for many HCM families.
   Objective To determine the cost-effectiveness of the addition of genetic testing to HCM family management, compared with clinical screening alone.
   Methods A probabilistic Markov decision model was used to determine cost per quality-adjusted life-year and cost for each life-year gained when genetic testing is included in the management of Australian families with HCM, compared with the conventional approach of periodic clinical screening alone.
   Results The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $A785 (510 pound or is an element of 587) per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and $A12 720 (8261 pound or is an element of 9509) per additional life-year gained making genetic testing a very cost-effective strategy. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost of proband genetic testing was an important variable. As the cost of proband genetic testing decreased, the ICER decreased and was cost saving when the cost fell below $A248 (161 pound or is an element of 185). In addition, the mutation identification rate was also important in reducing the overall ICER, although even at the upper limits, the ICER still fell well within accepted willingness to pay bounds.
   Conclusions The addition of genetic testing to the management of HCM families is cost-effective in comparison with the conventional approach of regular clinical screening. This has important implications for the evaluation of families with HCM, and suggests that all should have access to specialised cardiac genetic clinics that can offer genetic testing.

TI  - Impact on Diabetic Ketoacidosis Resolution After Implementation of a 2-Bfag Fluid Order Set
T2  - ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Background: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious acute complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes that requires prompt management. Limited data exist supporting the use of a 2-bag DKA protocol in adult patients across all levels of care. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 2-bag DKA protocol in comparison with a traditional DKA management strategy. Methods: Retrospective review of patients admitted with DKA between January 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022, at a single center. Patients were separated into 2 cohorts, traditional or 2-bag. The primary outcome was time to anion gap closure and/or beta-hydroxybutyrate normalization. Secondary outcomes include length of hospitalization, insulin infusion time, and hypoglycemic events. Results: One hundred forty-three patients had a DKA order set initiated during their admission, 59 in the traditional cohort and 84 in the 2-bag cohort. Mean time to anion gap closure was shorter in the 2-bag cohort (12.7 vs 16.9 hours; P = 0.005) and beta-hydroxybutyrate normalization (15.6 vs 25.6 hours; P = 0.026). No difference in hospital length of stay (4 vs 6 days; P = 0.113), duration of insulin infusion (41.6 vs 40.6 hours; P = 0.455), or rates of hypoglycemia (6 vs 4; P = 0.872) was seen. Conclusion and Relevance: Implementation of a 2-bag DKA protocol in the inpatient setting was associated with a shorter time to anion gap closure and beta-hydroxybutyrate normalization. These findings support the option of expansion of a 2-bag DKA protocol to adult patients across all levels of care irrespective of the admission diagnosis.

TI  - Pediatric Sepsis Diagnosis, Management, and Sub-phenotypes
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for children worldwide, including >3 million deaths annually and, among survivors, risk for new or worsening functional impairments, including reduced quality of life, new respiratory, nutritional, or technological assistance, and recurrent severe infections. Advances in understanding sepsis pathophysiology highlight a need to update the definition and diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock, whereas new data support an increasing role for automated screening algorithms and biomarker combinations to assist earlier recognition. Once sepsis or septic shock is suspected, attention to prompt initiation of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation, and vasoactive medications remain key components to initial management with several new and ongoing studies offering new insights into how to optimize this approach. Ultimately, a key goal is for screening to encompass as many children as possible at risk for sepsis and trigger early treatment without increasing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics and preventable hospitalizations. Although the role for adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids and other metabolic therapies remains incompletely defined, ongoing studies will soon offer updated guidance for optimal use. Finally, we are increasingly moving toward an era in which precision therapeutics will bring novel strategies to improve outcomes, especially for the subset of children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and sepsis subphenotypes for whom antibiotics, fluid, vasoactive medications, and supportive care remain insufficient.

TI  - Rational and design of the T-STORHM Study: A prospective randomized trial comparing fresh whole blood to blood components for acutely bleeding trauma patients
T2  - TRANSFUSION CLINIQUE ET BIOLOGIQUE
CP  - THOR Meeting
AB  - Massive hemorrhage remains the main cause of preventable death in combat settings and is also the main cause of year loss in developing countries. The management of these patients relies on blood transfusion and surgery. Time is a key factor, related to survival. Recent events highlight the need to be more efficient in the transfusion supply during terror attacks or mass casualties in civilian settings. Blood components therapy with a 1:1:1 ratio is associated with a decrease of mortality but encounters many logistic issues in those circumstances. Whole blood provides in one bag all the blood components in physiologic proportions with minimal amount of additive solution. Whole blood has been implemented in military as well as civilian settings worldwide. However, direct comparisons with component therapy in prospective clinical trials are scarce. Here we present the rational and the design of the T-STORHM (Trauma-Sang TOtal dans les Hemorragies Massives) trial. This prospective randomized multicentric clinical trial will test low titer group O whole blood to components therapy in the in-hospital management of trauma patients with massive hemorrhage. Sample size calculation, primary and secondary endpoints as trial blood products preparations are discussed. The trial is expected to start in 2019 in 6 civilians and military trauma centers.

TI  - Risk Factors for Intraoperative Hypotension During Decompressive Craniectomy in traumatic Brain Injury Patients
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is an important therapy for treating intracranial pressure elevation following traumatic brain injury (TBI). During this procedure, about one-third of patients become complicated with intraoperative hypotension (IH), which is associated with abruptly decreasing sympathetic activity resulting from brain decompression. This study aimed to identify factors associated with IH during DC procedures and the mortality rate in these patients.
   METHODS: The records of adult TBI patients aged 18 years and older who underwent DC at Songklanagarind Hospital between January 2014 and January 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Using logistic regression analysis, various factors were analyzed for their associations with IH during the DC procedures.
   RESULTS: This study included 83 patients. The incidence of IH was 54%. Multivariate analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale motor response (GCS-M) 1-3 (vs. 4-6), higher preoperative heart rate (PHR), and larger amount of intraoperative blood loss were significantly associated with IH (P = 0.013, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients with GCS-M 1-3 and PHR z 75 bpm had the highest chance of IH (77%), while patients with neither of these risk factors had the lowest chance (29%). The in-hospital mortality rate in the IH and non-IH groups was 44% and 26%, respectively (P = 0.138).
   CONCLUSIONS: GCS-M 1-3, higher PHR, and larger amount of intraoperative blood loss were the risk factors associated with IH during DC procedure in TBI patients. Patients who have these risk factors should be closely monitored and the attending physician he ready to apply prompt resuscitation and treatment for IH.

TI  - Patent foramen ovale is an important predictor of adverse outcome in patients with major pulmonary embolism
T2  - CIRCULATION
CP  - 69th Annual Scientific Session of the American-Heart-Association
AB  - Background-Right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale is frequently diagnosed by contrast echocardiography and can be particularly prominent in the presence of elevated pressures in the right side of the heart. Its prognostic significance in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, however, is unknown.
   Methods and Results-The present prospective study included 139 consecutive patients with major pulmonary embolism diagnosed on the basis of clinical, echocardiographic, and cardiac catheterization criteria. All patients underwent contrast echocardiography at presentation, The end points of the study were overall mortality and complicated clinical course during the hospital stay defined as death, cerebral or peripheral arterial thromboembolism, major bleeding, or need for endotracheal intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patent foramen ovale was diagnosed in 48 patients (35%). These patients had a death rate of 33% as opposed to 14% in patients with a negative echo-contrast examination (P=.015), Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the only independent predictors of mortality in the study population were a patent foramen ovale (odds ratio [OR], 11.4; P<.001) and arterial hypotension at presentation (OR, 26.3; P<.001). Patients with a patent foramen ovale also had a significantly higher incidence of ischemic stroke (13% versus 2.2%; P=.02) and peripheral arterial embolism (15 versus 0%; P<.001). Overall, the risk of a complicated in-hospital course was 5.2 times higher in this patient group (P<.001),
   Conclusions-In patients with major pulmonary embolism, echocardiographic detection of a patent foramen ovale signifies a particularly high risk of death and arterial thromboembolic complications.

TI  - 2023 Update on Sepsis and Septic Shock in Adult Patients: Management in the Emergency Department
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Sepsis/septic shock is a life-threatening and time-dependent condition that requires timely management to reduce mortality. This review aims to update physicians with regard to the main pillars of treatment for this insidious condition. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched from inception with special attention paid to November 2021-January 2023. Results: The management of sepsis/septic shock is challenging and involves different pathophysiological aspects, encompassing empirical antimicrobial treatment (which is promptly administered after microbial tests), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), and vasoactive agents (e.g., norepinephrine (NE)), which are employed to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg and reduce the risk of fluid overload. In cases of refractory shock, vasopressin (rather than epinephrine) should be combined with NE to reach an acceptable level of pressure control. If mechanical ventilation is indicated, the tidal volume should be reduced from 10 to 6 mL/kg. Heparin is administered to prevent venous thromboembolism, and glycemic control is recommended. The efficacy of other treatments (e.g., proton-pump inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, etc.) is largely debated, and such treatments might be used on a case-to-case basis. Conclusions: The management of sepsis/septic shock has significantly progressed in the last few years. Improving knowledge of the main therapeutic cornerstones of this challenging condition is crucial to achieve better patient outcomes.

TI  - Trauma Mortality in Mature Trauma Systems: Are We Doing Better? An Analysis of Trauma Mortality Patterns, 1997-2008
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: Advances in care such as damage control surgery, hemostatic resuscitation, protocol-driven cerebral perfusion management, and lung-protective ventilation have promised to improve survival after major trauma. We examined injury severity, mortality, and preventability in a mature trauma system during a 12-year period to assess the overall benefits of these and other improvements.
   Methods: Using the institutional trauma registry and the quality management database, we analyzed the outcome and the cause of death for all primary trauma admissions from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2008, and linked these data with patient demographics, hospital length of stay, time to death, predicted probability of survival, and peer review of in-hospital deaths.
   Results: Through fiscal year (FY) 2007, primary trauma admissions increased in number, injury severity, and age. Performance benchmarked against predicted probability of survival improved. Mortality through this era ranged from 3% to 3.7% and worsened slightly overall (p = 0.04). However, among those patients admitted with Injury Severity Score 17-25, survival improved significantly (p = 0.0003). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounted for 51.6% of deaths; acute hemorrhage, 30%; and multiple organ failure, 10.5%. Median time to death for uncontrollable hemorrhage, TBI, multiple organ failure was 2 hours, 24 hours, and 15 days, respectively. These patterns did not change significantly over time.
   Conclusion: Survival after severe trauma and survival benchmarked against predicted risk improved significantly at our center during the past 12 years despite generally increasing age and worsening injuries. Advances in trauma care have kept pace with an aging population and greater severity of injury, but overall survival has not improved.

TI  - Clinical features and practice patterns of treatment for adrenal crisis: a nationwide cross-sectional study in Japan
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Context: Adrenal crisis is an endocrine emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. However, the clinical features and practice patterns of treatment for adrenal crisis are not completely understood.
   Objective: To investigate patient characteristics, comorbidities and treatments of adrenal crisis.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients who received intravenous glucocorticoids for adrenal crisis at admission from 1 July 2007 to 31 March 2014, using a national inpatient database in Japan.
   Results: Among approximately 34 million inpatients in the database, we identified 799 patients diagnosed with adrenal crisis and coexisting primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency at admission. The median (interquartile range) age was 58 (28-73) years, and the overall in-hospital mortality was 2.4% (19 of 799 patients). The most common comorbidity at admission was infections excluding pneumonia and gastroenteritis (15.0%). There were 68 (8.5%) patients with gastroenteritis, and no deaths occurred among these patients. The patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency showed significantly higher proportions of admission to ICU, extracellular fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy and catecholamine use than the patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. There were no significant between-group differences in mortality rate and variation in intravenous glucocorticoids (short-acting glucocorticoid, hydrocortisone; moderate-acting glucocorticoid, prednisolone or methylprednisolone; long-acting glucocorticoid, dexamethasone or betamethasone). Of the 19 dead patients, 15 were aged above 60 years, 12 had impaired consciousness at admission and 13 received insulin therapy.
   Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware that older patients with impaired consciousness and diabetes mellitus are at relatively high risk of death from adrenal crisis.

TI  - Difficulties and Countermeasures in Hospital Emergency Management for Fast-Lane Treatment of Acute Stroke During the COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a long incubation period and a high degree of infectivity. Patients may not show specific signs or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, and the age of onset is similar to that of stroke. Furthermore, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. Providing emergency treatment for acute stroke in accordance with the strict epidemic control measures is currently one of the main challenges, as acute stroke is rapid onset and a major cause of death and disability globally. We aimed to evaluate the emergency treatment system for acute stroke during the epidemic control period to provide a reference and basis for informing government and medical institutions on improving patient treatment rates during this period.
   Methods: Difficulties faced in providing emergency treatment for stroke during an epidemic were investigated and combined with medical educational resources and clinical management experiences to construct an emergency treatment framework for acute stroke during the epidemic.
   Findings: Currently, emergency treatment measures for acute stroke during the epidemic control period are limited because the main focus is on identifying COVID-19 comorbidities during the critical period. Establishing standards for patients in the neurological outpatient consultation rooms and emergency observation and resuscitation zones; implementing a fast-lane system for the emergency treatment of patients with acute stroke, and strengthening ward management and medicine popularization, can improve the treatment efficiency for stroke patients during the epidemic and provide a reference for peers in clinical practice.
   Interpretation: Emergency treatment for acute stroke during COVID-19 epidemic control period requires a joint promotion of clinical, popularization, and teaching resources.

TI  - TiME OUT: Time-specific machine-learning evaluation to optimize ultramassive transfusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CP  - 82nd Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma & Clinical Congress of Acute Care Surgery (AAST)
AB  - BACKGROUND Ultramassive transfusion (UMT) is a resource-demanding intervention for trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock, and associated mortality rates remains high. Current research has been unable to identify a transfusion ceiling or point where UMT transitions from lifesaving to futility. Furthermore, little consideration has been given to how time-specific patient data points impact decisions with ongoing high-volume resuscitation. Therefore, this study sought to use time-specific machine learning modeling to predict mortality and identify parameters associated with survivability in trauma patients undergoing UMT. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted at a Level I trauma (2018-2021) and included trauma patients meeting criteria for UMT, defined as >= 20 red blood cell products within 24 hours of admission. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the blood bank and trauma registries, and time-specific data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Time-specific decision-tree models predicating mortality were generated and evaluated using area under the curve. RESULTS In the 180 patients included, mortality rate was 40.5% at 48 hours and 52.2% overall. The deceased received significantly more blood products with a median of 71.5 total units compared with 55.5 in the survivors (p < 0.001) and significantly greater rates of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma at each time interval. Time-specific decision-tree models predicted mortality with an accuracy as high as 81%. In the early time intervals, hemodynamic stability, undergoing an emergency department thoracotomy, and injury severity were most predictive of survival, while, in the later intervals, markers of adequate resuscitation such as arterial pH and lactate level became more prominent. CONCLUSION This study supports that the decision of "when to stop" in UMT resuscitation is not based exclusively on the number of units transfused but rather the complex integration of patient and time-specific data. Machine learning is an effective tool to investigate this concept, and further research is needed to refine and validate these time-specific decision-tree models.

TI  - Procedures to improve daily activities performance in individuals with cerebral anoxia: case report
T2  - ARQUIVOS DE NEURO-PSIQUIATRIA
AB  - Objective: To present a rehabilitation case study; procedures to improve the performance on daily activities were used by the caregiver. Patient: Cerebral anoxia due to cardiac arrest. He presented memory deficits for bath visual and verbal material, temporal disorientation, abulia, psychomotor slowing and bradypsychism. Methods: daily activities were developed in fixed hours; calendar was presented 3 times a day; daily walks were performed; self-care activities were performed by the patient with short verbal commands and cues from the caregiver. Results: We observed improvement on initiative and autonomy for daily activities, attention, temporal orientation and bradypsychism. There was also reduction on response lime. Conclusions: Behavioral control strategies result on improvement For patients and their family although limit their routine. Behavioral control strategy promotes learning through the preserved implicit memory mechanism and results on enhancement at patient's autonomy at home.

TI  - What is the impact of prehospital blood product administration for patients with catastrophic haemorrhage: an integrative review
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Introduction: Catastrophic haemorrhage is recognised as the leading cause of preventable death in trauma and is also prevalent in medical and other surgical aetiology. Prehospital blood product transfusion is increasingly available for both military and civilian emergency teams. Hospitals have well-established massive transfusion protocols for the resuscitation of this patient group, however the use and impact in the prehospital field is less understood.
   Aim: To identify and evaluate the current knowledge surrounding prehospital blood product administration for patients with catastrophic haemorrhage.
   Methods: The integrative review method included systematic searching of online databases Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS and CINAHL alongside hand-searching for primary research articles published prior to 19 November 2018. Papers were included if the population studied patients with catastrophic haemorrhage who received prehospital transfusion of blood products. The level of evidence and quality was evaluated using the NHMRC hierarchy of evidence. All identified full text articles were reviewed by all authors.
   Results: Twenty-two papers were included in the final analysis, including both civilian (16) and military (6) practice. The earliest publication for prehospital transfusion was 1999, with increasing prevalence in recent years. Findings were extracted and into two main categories; (1) transfusion processes included team staffing, product selection, and criteria for transfusion and (2) transfusion outcomes; transfusion safety, haemoglobin, hospital intervention and mortality.
   Discussion: The level of evidence specific to prehospital blood product transfusion is low, with predominantly retrospective methods and rarely sufficient sample sizes to reach statistical significance. Prehospital research is challenged by clinical and logistical variability preventing accurate cohort matching, sample sizes and inconsistent data collection. Evaluation of prehospital transfusion in isolation is also particularly problematic as multiple factors and developments in clinical practice affect patient outcomes and all samples were subject to survival bias.
   Conclusion The volume and strength of the available evidence prevents accurate evaluation of the intervention and definitive practice recommendations however prehospital transfusion is shown to be logistically achievable and without serious incident. The reviewed evidence broadly supports the translation of recent in-hospital studies, such as PROMTT and PROPPR. Further research specific to prehospital practice is required to guide the development of evidence-based protocols. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Psychiatric issues during and after intensive care (ICU) stays
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
AB  - Stays in intensive care units (ICUs) are a source of psychological and physical stress, sometimes resulting in psychological disorders that may persist after ICU discharge. ICU stressors include exhaustion, drug-induced sleep privation, intubation, pain, noise, and a disrupted light-dark cycle. Patients remember traumatic experiences, such as a fear of being killed or abandoned, nightmares, and panic attacks. Depression is frequent but difficult to detect. Psychiatric disorders such as delirium and confusion (hallucinations, agitation, stupor) occur in almost half of all ICU patients. Simple measures can reduce the risk of such disorders, including noise reduction, less intense lighting (especially at night), individual rooms, visible clocks to reduce confusion, frequent family visits, verbal contact, reassurance, and anxiolytics. Anxiety and depression are frequent after ICU stays, and may be mixed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can include fear, feelings of horror, helplessness, avoidance, neurovegetative symptoms, and intrusive thoughts. New techniques are being tested to prevent these disorders, such as logbooks for families and team members to note events during and after the ICU stay, and end-of-stay psychological OK? consultations for both the patient and the family.

TI  - Management of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN FAMILY PRACTICE
AB  - The strategic location of primary care providers (PCPs) in clinics, private general practices and emergency departments is critical to the detection and appropriate management of patients with suicidal behaviour. Their position within the primary care setting and responsibility for preventive and promotive care require PCPs to possess good clinical skills and evidence-based knowledge to assist patients presenting with suicidal ideation and behaviour. The objective of this article is to provide guidelines for the management of suicidal behaviour within the primary care setting, with the goal of reducing deaths from suicide, and the frequency and intensity of suicide attempts. The priority in the management of patients presenting at health facilities following suicide attempts is medical resuscitation and stabilisation. As soon as the patient is medically stable, a thorough suicide risk assessment, which evaluates suicidal ideation/intent, preceding circumstances, predisposing and protective factors, should be conducted. An assessment of current and ongoing suicide risk will assist in determining the safest place to manage the patient. For those with a low level of suicide risk, outpatient management may be considered in the presence of a good social support system at home and a well-documented safety plan. Measures should be put in place to address the modifiable psychosocial risk factors for suicide, whilst appropriate pharmacotherapy is instituted for co-existing mental illness. Post-discharge care such as referral to psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker should be initiated by the primary care practitioner to ensure continuity of care. Support and psycho-education should also be extended to immediate family members of patients with suicidal behaviour for their own well-being and their ability to support the patient.

TI  - A prospective, mixed-methods, before and after study to identify the evidence base for the core components of an effective Paediatric Early Warning System and the development of an implementation package containing those core recommendations for use in the UK: Paediatric early warning system - utilisation and mortality avoidance- the PUMA study protocol
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: In hospital, staff need to routinely monitor patients to identify those who are seriously ill, so that they receive timely treatment to improve their condition. A Paediatric Early Warning System is a multi-faceted socio technical system to detect deterioration in children, which may or may not include a track and trigger tool. It functions to monitor, detect and prompt an urgent response to signs of deterioration, with the aim of preventing morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to develop an evidence-based improvement programme to optimise the effectiveness of Paediatric Early Warning Systems in different inpatient contexts, and to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the programme in predicting deterioration and triggering timely interventions.
   Methods: This study will be conducted in two district and two specialist children's hospitals. It deploys an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) design in conjunction with ethnographic cases studies with embedded process evaluation. Informed by Translational Mobilisation Theory and Normalisation Process Theory, the study is underpinned by a functions based approach to improvement. Workstream (1) will develop an evidence-based improvement programme to optimise Paediatric Early Warning System based on systematic reviews. Workstream (2) consists of observation and recording outcomes in current practice in the four sites, implementation of the improvement programme and concurrent process evaluation, and evaluation of the impact of the programme. Outcomes will be mortality and critical events, unplanned admission to Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU) or Paediatric High Dependency Unit (PHDU), cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, medical emergencies requiring immediate assistance, reviews by PICU staff, and critical deterioration, with qualitative evidence of the impact of the intervention on Paediatric Early Warning System and learning from the implementation process.
   Discussion: This paper presents the background, rationale and design for this mixed methods study. This will be the most comprehensive study of Paediatric Early Warning Systems and the first to deploy a functions-based approach to improvement in the UK with the aim to improve paediatric patient safety and reduce mortality. Our findings will inform recommendations about the safety processes for every hospital treating paediatric in-patients across the NHS.

TI  - The Age of Blood Evaluation (ABLE) Randomized Controlled Trial: Study Design
T2  - TRANSFUSION MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB  - Red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused to treat anemia and to maintain oxygen delivery to vital organs during critical illness. Laboratory and observational studies have raised the possibility that prolonged RBC storage may adversely affect clinical outcomes. Compared with RBCs stored less than 1 week, there are no clinical data demonstrating that RBCs stored longer remain as effective at carrying or releasing oxygen, and observational studies have risen to possibility that prolonged RBC storage might result in harm to vulnerable patients requiring blood transfusions. The "Age of Blood Evaluation" (ABLE) study (ISRCTN44878718) is a double-blind, multicenter, parallel randomized controlled clinical trial. It will test the hypothesis that the transfusion of prestorage leukoreduced RBCs stored for 7 days or less (fresh arm) as compared with standard-issue RBCs stored, on average, 15 to 20 days (control arm) will lead to lower 90-day all-cause mortality and reduced morbidity in critically ill adults. We include adults in intensive care units (ICUs) who (1) have had a request for a first RBC unit transfusion during the first 7 days of ICU admission and (2) have an anticipated requirement for ongoing invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation exceeding 48 hours. Enrolled patients are randomized at the time of transfusion to receive either standard-issue RBC units or RBCs stored 7 days or less issued by the local hospital transfusion service. The primary outcome is 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital mortality, organ failure, and serious nosocomial infections. With 2510 patients, we will be able to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction (from 25% to 20%).
   The ABLE study is currently enrolling patients in 23 university-affiliated and community-hospital ICUs across Canada; sites in France and United Kingdom are expected to start recruitment in 2011. Regardless of the results, ABLE study will have significant implications on the duration of RBC storage. A negative trial will reassure clinicians and blood bankers regarding the effectiveness and safety of standard-issue RBCs. A positive trial will have significant implications with respect to inventory management of RBCs given to critically ill adults with a high risk of mortality and will also prompt research to better understand the RBC storage lesion in the hopes of minimizing its clinical consequences through the development of better storage methods.

TI  - Prehospital emergency life-saving technicians promote the survival of trauma patients: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Appropriate decisions by medical technicians at a trauma scene may influence a patient's prognosis. Emergency life-saving technicians (ELSTs) are certified specialists trained with the knowledge to provide advanced techniques for prehospital emergency care in Japan. However, the benefit of treatment by ELSTs compared to basic emergency medical technicians (BEMTs) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to determine whether treatment by ELSTs improves outcomes for trauma patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the Japan Trauma Data Bank for the years 2004 to 2017. Patients transferred to the hospital directly from the trauma scene and at least 16 years old were included in this study. The following criteria were used to exclude patients; presence of burns, untreatable severe traumas, unknown ELST attendance, and missing prognosis. We compared two groups (ELST group: patients transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with the presence of at least one ELST; BEMT group: patients transported only by BEMTs). Primary outcome was survival to discharge. Secondary outcomes were the need of definitive treatments defined by surgical intervention, intravascular radiology and blood transfusion at the receiving hospital within 24 h. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) adjusted by age, sex, revised trauma score, and Injury severity score (ISS).
   Results: Overall survival to discharge did not improve significantly (adjusted OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.30) with ELST intervention. In-hospital blood transfusion was more frequently required in the ELST group (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20). Emergency interventions (adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09) were not different between the groups. In stratified analysis, the benefit of ELST attendance for survival was observed among patients with ISS <16 (adjusted OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.15), aged 65 years or older (adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.52), during the earlier study period (2004-2008, adjusted OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14-1.97), and shorter transportation time (adjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.41).
   Conclusions: Dispatch systems with ELST should be considered for trauma transports, which may benefit elderly or moderate severity trauma groups, with shorter transportation time conditions.

TI  - Early repolarization with horizontal ST segment may be associated with aborted sudden cardiac arrest: a retrospective case control study
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Risk stratification of the early repolarization pattern (ERP) is needed to identify malignant early repolarization. J-point elevation with a horizontal ST segment was recently suggested as a malignant feature of the ERP. In this study, the prevalence of the ERP with a horizontal ST segment was examined among survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) without structural heart disease to evaluate the value of ST-segment morphology in risk stratification of the ERP.
   Methods: We reviewed the data of 83 survivors of SCA who were admitted from August 2005 to August 2010. Among them, 25 subjects without structural heart disease were included. The control group comprised 60 healthy subjects who visited our health promotion center; all control subjects were matched for age, sex, and underlying disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension). Early repolarization was defined as an elevation of the J point of at least 0.1 mV above the baseline in at least two continuous inferior or lateral leads that manifested as QRS slurring or notching. An ST-segment pattern of <0.1 mV within 100 ms after the J point was defined as a horizontal ST segment.
   Results: The SCA group included 17 men (64%) with a mean age of 49.7 +/- 14.5 years. The corrected QTc was not significantly different between the SCA and control groups (432.7 +/- 37.96 vs. 420.4 +/- 26.3, respectively; p = 0.089). The prevalence of ERP was not statistically different between the SCA and control groups (5/25, 20% vs. 4/60, 6.7%, respectively; p = 0.116). The prevalence of early repolarization with a horizontal ST segment was more frequent in the SCA than in the control group (20% vs. 3.3%, respectively; p = 0.021). Four SCA subjects (16%) and one control subject (1.7%) had a J-point elevation of >2 mm (p = 0.025). Four SCA subjects (16%) and one (1.7%) control subject had an ERP in the inferior lead (p = 0.025).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of ERP with a horizontal ST segment was higher in patients with aborted SCA than in matched controls. This result suggests that ST morphology has value in the recognition of malignant early repolarization.

TI  - IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR FOR PREVENTION OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN PATIENTS WITH VENTRICULAR-TACHYCARDIA AND VENTRICULAR-FIBRILLATION - ICD THERAPY IN SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
T2  - PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Among the various therapy options for survivors of ventricular tachycardia-ventricular fibrillation (VT-VF), the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) seems most promising. It reliably terminates VT-VF and thus significantly impacts sudden cardiac death (SCD) survival. It is more effective than any of the known antiarrhythmic drugs in prevention of SCD, particularly among survivors of cardiac arrest. Compared to VT surgery, the ICD therapy can be offered to a larger pool of patients and can be placed at a lower surgical risk. With proper patient selection, ICD therapy is of major benefits to its recipients since it markedly reduces the chances of VT-VF related mortality; the main cause of premature death in this population. The ICD therapy is cost effective when compared to other medical interventions and could be more so if the implant is carried out early in the course of VT-VF management.

TI  - Sudden cardiac death and post-traumatic stress disorder: More research is needed
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Sudden cardiac death is an event which is traumatic for the individuals, who survive and their relatives. Very few research is concentrated on these survivals and the symptoms arising from post-traumatic stress disorders. In this journal, Birk et al. report on twelve eligible cardiac arrest survivors contacted, of which ten were enrolled. The authors report on heart rate variability biofeedback, which is, according to the authors, a promising nonpharmacologic approach for reducing anxiety. The intervention was comprised of daily sessions of diaphragmatic paced breathing and real-time monitoring of cardiac activity guided by a smartphone app and heart rate monitor. Ninety percent of the patients had good scores for intervention acceptability and feasibility, and 80 % reported good scores for its appropriateness and usability for reducing fear. Trait anxiety decreased significantly pre-to-post intervention. We comment on this finding highlighting other studies targeting sudden cardiac death and supporting that more research with very large randomized clinical trials is needed.

TI  - Potential value of protocols in substantially bleeding trauma patients
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   Early identification of shock and coagulopathy coupled with damage control resuscitation are central tenets of early trauma management. In traumatic injury, haemorrhage is responsible for almost 50% of deaths occurring within the first 24 h of injury and up to 80% of intraoperative trauma mortalities. Immediate haemorrhagic mortality constitutes the largest group of potentially preventable deaths in the initial 24-h period. This review will discuss the recent changes and advancement of early traumatic coagulopathy and the important role of substantial bleeding protocols (SBPs).
   Recent findings
   Ho et al. examined survivor bias and determined when accounting for survivor bias improved survival outcome with higher fresh frozen plasma: red blood cell ratios. The PROMMTT study, a 10-centre observation trial, highlighted the variable nature of infusion, the importance of time and improved outcomes with higher product ratios.
   Summary
   An SBP addresses the organizational issues necessary to respond to massive blood loss in an immediate and sustained manner. It reduces provider variability, facilitates staff communication and compliance, and simplifies the administration of predefined ratios of blood components. A transfusion subcommittee should be formed to directly address the complex issues of implementing a SBP system.

TI  - Impact of Controlled Pericardial Drainage on Critical Cardiac Tamponade With Acute Type A Aortic Dissection
T2  - CIRCULATION
CP  - Meeting of the American-Heart-Association
AB  - Background-Cardiac tamponade is associated with fatal outcomes for patients with acute type A aortic dissection, and the presence of cardiac tamponade should prompt urgent aortic repair. However, treatment of the patient with critical cardiac tamponade who cannot survive until surgery remains unclear. We analyzed our experience of controlled pericardial drainage (CPD) managing critical cardiac tamponade.
   Methods and Results-Between September 2003 and May 2011, 175 patients with acute type A aortic dissection were treated surgically, including 43 (24.6%) who presented with cardiac tamponade on arrival. Eighteen patients, who did not respond to intravenous volume resuscitation, underwent CPD in the emergency department. An 8F pigtail drainage catheter was inserted percutaneously, and drainage volume was controlled by means of several cycles of intermittent drainage to maintain blood pressure at approximate to 90 mm Hg. After CPD, all of the patients were transferred to the operating room, and immediate aortic repair was performed. Systolic blood pressure before CPD was 64.3 +/- 8.2 mm Hg and elevated significantly in all of the cases after CPD. Systolic blood pressure after CPD was 94.8 +/- 10.5 mm Hg, and increase in systolic pressure was 30.5 +/- 11.7 mm Hg. Total volume of aspirated pericardial effusion was 40.1 +/- 30.6 mL, and 10 patients required only <= 30-mL aspiration volume. All of the patients underwent aortic repair successfully. In-hospital mortality was 16.7%; however, there was no complications or mortality related to CPD.
   Conclusions-Preoperative pericardial drainage with control of volume is a safe and effective procedure for acute type A aortic dissection complicated by critical cardiac tamponade. In our patient population, timely controlled pericardial drainage is warranted. (Circulation. 2012;126[suppl 1]:S97-S101.)

TI  - Heterogeneity in defining multiple trauma: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - IntroductionWhile numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in the field of trauma, a substantial portion of them are yielding negative results. One potential contributing factor to this trend could be the lack of agreement regarding the chosen definitions across different trials. The primary objective was to identify the terminology and definitions utilized for the characterization of multiple trauma patients within randomized controlled trials (RCTs).MethodsA systematic review of the literature was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov between January 1, 2002, and July 31, 2022. RCTs or RTCs protocols were eligible if they included multiple trauma patients. The terms employed to characterize patient populations were identified, and the corresponding definitions for these terms were extracted. The subsequent impact on the population recruited was then documented to expose clinical heterogeneity.ResultsFifty RCTs were included, and 12 different terms identified. Among these terms, the most frequently used were "multiple trauma" (n = 21, 42%), "severe trauma" (n = 8, 16%), "major trauma" (n = 4, 8%), and trauma with hemorrhagic shock" (n = 4, 8%). Only 62% of RCTs (n = 31) provided a definition for the terms used, resulting a total of 21 different definitions. These definitions primarily relied on the injury severity score (ISS) (n = 15, 30%), displaying an important underlying heterogeneity. The choice of the terms had an impact on the study population, affecting both the ISS and in-hospital mortality. Eleven protocols were included, featuring five different terms, with "severe trauma" being the most frequent, occurring six times (55%).ConclusionThis systematic review uncovers an important heterogeneity both in the terms and in the definitions employed to recruit trauma patients within RCTs. These findings underscore the imperative of promoting the use of a unique and consistent definition.

TI  - Emergency general surgery in a low-middle income health care setting: Determinants of outcomes
T2  - SURGERY
AB  - Introduction. Emergency general surgery (EGS) has emerged as an important component of frontline operative care. Efforts in high-income settings have described its burden but have yet to consider low- and middle-income health care settings in which emergent conditions represent a high proportion of operative need. The objective of this study was to describe the disease spectrum of EGS conditions and associated factors among patients presenting in a low-middle income context.
   Methods. March 2009 April 2014 discharge data from a university teaching hospital in South Asia were obtained for patients (>= 16 years) with primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes consistent with an EGS condition as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality and occurrence of >= 1 major complication(s). Multivariable analyses were performed, adjusting for differences in demographic and case-mix factors.
   Results. A total of 13,893 discharge records corresponded to EGS conditions. Average age was 47.2 years (+/- 16.8, standard deviation), with a male preponderance (59.9%). The majority presented with admitting diagnoses of biliary disease (20.2%), followed by soft-tissue disorders (15.7%), hernias (14.9%), and colorectal disease (14.3%). Rates of death and complications were 2.7% and 6.6%, respectively; increasing age was an independent predictor of both. Patients in need of resuscitation (n = 225) had the greatest rates of mortality (72.9%) and complications (94.2%).
   Conclusion. This study takes an important step toward quantifying outcomes and complications of EGS, providing one of the first assessments of EGS conditions using American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definitions in a low-middle income health care setting Further efforts in varied settings are needed to promote representative benchmarking worldwide.

TI  - Identification of Cardiac Dysfunction in Sepsis with B-Type Natriuretic Peptide
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
CP  - 118th Scientific Session of the Western-Surgical-Association
AB  - BACKGROUND: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted in response to myocardial stretch and has been used clinically to assess volume overload and predict death in congestive heart failure. More recently, BNP elevation has been demonstrated with septic shock and is predictive of death. How BNP levels relate to cardiac function in sepsis remains to be established.
   STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively gathered sepsis database from a surgical ICU in a tertiary academic hospital. Initial BNP levels, patient demographics, baseline central venous pressure levels, and in-hospital mortality were obtained. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed during initial resuscitation per protocol.
   RESULTS: During 24 months ending in September 2009, two hundred and thirty-one patients (59 +/- 3 years of age, 43% male) were treated for sepsis. Baseline BNP increased with initial sepsis severity (ie, sepsis vs severe sepsis vs septic shock, by ANOVA; p < 0.05) and was higher in those who died vs those who lived (by Fisher's exact test; p < 0.05). Of these patients, 153 (66%) had early echocardiography. Low ejection fraction (<50%) was associated with higher BNP (by Fisher's exact test; p < 0.05) and patients with low ejection fraction had a higher mortality (39% vs 20%; odds ratio = 3.03). We found no correlation between baseline central venous pressure (12.7 +/- 6.10 mmHg) and BNP (526.5 +/- 82.10 pg/mL) (by Spearman's rho, R-s = .001) for the entire sepsis population.
   CONCLUSIONS: In surgical sepsis patients, BNP increases with sepsis severity and is associated with early systolic dysfunction, which in turn is associated with death. Monitoring BNP in early sepsis to identify occult systolic dysfunction might prompt earlier use of inotropic agents. (J Am Coll Surg 2011; 213:139-147. (C) 2011 by the American College of Surgeons)

TI  - Improvements in End-of-Life Care with a Protocol-based Pathway for Cancer Patients Dying in a Singapore Hospital
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: More than half of all deaths in Singapore occur in hospitals. Little is known about the quality of care received by dying patients in hospitals. The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) provides a framework of providing good end-of-life care for dying patients and has been used with success in the United Kingdom (UK). In this study, we investigate whether adoption of a modified LCP in a Singapore hospital translated to better end-of-life care for cancer patients. Materials and Methods: The LCP was adapted and implemented as a pilot project on an oncology ward in Singapore General Hospital. A baseline review of 30 consecutive death records was performed, followed by a 4-month pilot and post-implementation audit of 30 consecutive patients on the adapted LCP. Results: Five types of end-of-life symptoms were analysed. There was only 1 uncontrolled symptom at death in the post-implementation group compared to 24 uncontrolled symptoms in the retrospective audit group. The prescription of breakthrough medications for symptom control increased from 21% in the retrospective audit group to 79% in the post-implementation group. Inappropriate monitoring was discontinued in 25 patients in the post-implementation group compared to none in the retrospective audit group. The documentation of resuscitation status and religion of the patient was improved, achieving full documentation in the post-implementation group. Conclusion: This study shows promising results for improving end-of-life care in cancer patients with a protocol-based pathway in a Singapore hospital. Extension of this care pathway to other settings should be explored to maximise its benefits to patients dying from all causes in hospital. Ann Acad Med Singapore 2012;41:483-93

TI  - High Interleukin-6 Plasma Concentration upon Admission Is Predictive of Massive Transfusion in Severely Injured Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Severe bleeding remains a prominent cause of early in-hospital mortality in major trauma patients. Thus, prompt prediction of patients at risk of massive transfusion (MT) is crucial. We investigated the ability of the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6 to forecast MT in severely injured trauma patients. IL-6 plasma levels were measured upon admission. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were calculated, and sensitivity and specificity were determined. In this retrospective study, a total of 468 predominantly male (77.8%) patients, with a median injury severity score (ISS) of 25 (17-34), were included. The Youden index for the prediction of MT within 6 and 24 h was 351 pg/mL. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: (i) low-IL-6 < 350 pg/mL and (ii) high-IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL. IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL was associated with a lower prothrombin time index, a higher activated partial thromboplastin time, and a lower fibrinogen concentration compared with IL-6 < 350 pg/mL (p <0.0001 for all). Thromboelastometric parameters were significantly different between groups (p <0.03 in all). More patients in the high-IL-6 group received MT (p <0.0001). The ROCs revealed an area under the curve of 0.76 vs. 0.82 for the high-IL-6 group for receiving MT in the first 6 and 24 h. IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL predicted MT within 6 and 24 h with a sensitivity of 45% and 58%, respectively, and a specificity of 89%. IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL appears to be a reasonable early predictor for coagulopathy and MT within the first 6 and 24 h intervals. Large-scale prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

TI  - Strategies to Obtain and Deliver Blood Products Into Critically Injured Children
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Objectives Timely transfusion is associated with improved survival and a reduction in in-hospital morbidity. The benefits of early hemorrhagic shock recognition may be limited by barriers to accessing blood products and their timely administration. We examined how pediatric trauma programs obtain blood products, the types of rapid infusion models used, and the metrics tracked to improve transfusion process efficiency in their emergency department (ED).
   Methods We developed and distributed a self-report survey to members of the Pediatric Trauma Society. The survey consisted of 6 initial questions, including the respondent's role and institution, whether a blood storage refrigerator was present in their ED, the rapid infuser model used to transfuse critically injured children in their ED, if their program tracked 4 transfusion process metrics, and if a video recording system was present in the trauma bay. Based on these responses, additional questions were prompted with an option for a free-text response.
   Results We received 137 responses from 77 institutions. Most pediatric trauma programs have a blood storage refrigerator in the ED (n = 46, 59.7%) and use a Belmont rapid infuser to transfuse critically injured children (n = 45, 58.4%). The American College of Surgeons Level 1 designated trauma programs, or state-based equivalents, and pediatric trauma programs were more likely to have video recording systems for performance improvement review compared with lower designated trauma programs and combined pediatric and adult trauma programs, respectively.
   Conclusions Strategies to improve the timely acquisition and infusion of blood products to critically injured children are underreported. This study examined the current practices that pediatric trauma programs use to transfuse critically injured children and may provide a resource for trauma programs to cite for transfusion-related quality improvement.

TI  - Percutaneous cardiac support during myocardial infarction drastically reduces mortality: perspectives from a swine model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB  - Background/aims: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with cardiogenic shock (CS) remains the leading cause of in-hospital death in acute coronary syndromes. In the AMI-CS pig model we tested the efficacy of temporary percutaneous cardiorespiratory assist device (PCRA) in rescuing the failing heart and reducing early mortality.
   Methods: In open-chest pigs we induced AMI by proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation. Eight animals without PCRA (C group) were compared with 12 animals otherwise treated with PCRA (T group), starting approximately at 60 minutes post-occlusion and lasting 120-180 minutes. In 3 animals of the T group, regional myocardial oxygen content was also imaged by two-dimensional near infrared spectroscopy (2D-NIRS) with and without PCRA, before and after LAD reperfusion.
   Results: All animals without PCRA died despite unrelenting resuscitation maneuvers (120 minutes average survival time). Conversely, animals treated with PCRA showed a reduction in life-threatening arrhythmia and maintenance of aortic pressure, allowing interruption of PCRA in all cases early in the experiments, with sound hemodynamics at the end of the observation period. During LAD occlusion, NIRS showed severe de-oxygenation of the LAD territory that improved with PCRA. After PCRA suspension and LAD reperfusion, the residual de-oxygenated area proved to be smaller than the initial risk area.
   Conclusions: In AMI, PCRA initiated during advanced CS drastically reduced early mortality from 100% to 0% in a 4-5 hour observation period. PCRA promoted oxygenation of the ischemic area during LAD occlusion. Results support the use of PCRA as first line of treatment in AMI-CS, improving myocardial rescue and short-term survival.

TI  - Aetiology and incidence of sudden cardiac arrest and death in young competitive athletes in the USA: a 4-year prospective study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Objective To investigate the aetiology and incidence of sudden cardiac arrest and death (SCAM) in US competitive athletes.
   Methods Prospective surveillance was conducted from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2018 through the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research in collaboration with national sports organisations. Autopsy reports, death certificates, and medical records were reviewed by an expert panel to determine aetiology. Athlete participation statistics from the National Federation of State High School Associations and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) were used to calculate incidence rates per athlete-years (AY). Comparisons of incidence rates were calculated using incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs.
   Results 331 cases of confirmed SCA/D (158 survivors; 173 fatalities) were identified; 15.4% in middle school 61.6% in high school and 16.6% in college and professional athletes. Average age was 16.7 (11-29) years, and the majority were in male (83.7%), basketball (28.7%) or American football (25.4%) athletes. Common causes included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (20.6%), idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy (13.4%), coronary artery anomalies (12.0%) and autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death (9.6%). Coronary anomalies were more common in middle school athletes (28%), while cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic, dilated, non-compaction or restricted) accounted for 47% of cases in college and professional athletes. Incidence was higher in male versus female athletes at the high school (1:43 932 AY (95% CI 1:38101 to 1:50 907) vs 1:203 786 AY (95% CI 1:145 251 to 1:293 794); IRR 4.6 (95% CI 3.1 to 7.2)) and NCAA (1:34 906 AY (95% CI 1:25 385 to 1:49 173) vs 1:123 278 AY (95% CI 1:66 078 to 1:249 853); IRR 3.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 9.5)) levels. African American male NCAA Division I basketball players had the highest annual incidence rate of SCA/D (1:2087 AY (95% CI 1:1073 to 1:4 450)).
   Conclusions Cardiomyopathies account for nearly half of SCA/D cases in college and professional athletes, while coronary artery anomalies play a more prominent role than expected in middle school athletes. Over half of SCA cases in athletes result in sudden death, calling for improved prevention strategies.

TI  - Clinical possibilities for controlling body temperature
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - The constancy of body temperature (CBT) is a cornerstone of homeostatic, homothermic organisms and is essential for a regulated course of biochemical and biophysical reactions. Severe deviations from normothermia (36.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) are life threatening and even a moderate perioperative reduction of the CBT is coupled with an increased morbidity and mortality especially in high-risk patients. The relevant factors are coagulation disturbances, increased infection rate and increased cardiac risk. Normothermia should be achieved by the consistent use of warmth-conserving measures. On the other hand, a deliberate reduction in temperature or induced hypothermia is a neuroprotective procedure, which offers a therapeutic option to minimize neuronal secondary damage after primary hypoxic-ischemic events as well as extending the neuronal tolerance to ischemia. Management includes the practice of cooling down to a defined temperature, rewarming as well as a differentiated control of various parameters. Furthermore, side-effects which increase in severity with decreasing temperature must be taken into consideration.

TI  - Neuropsychological profile of persons with anoxic brain injury:: Differences regarding physiopathological mechanism
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - Primary objective: To determine the neuropsychological profile of persons with anoxic brain injury.
   Methods and procedures: A retrospective study on a population of persons with anoxic brain injury admitted to a Brain Injury Unit ( Institut Guttmann, Spain) from 1995 - 2003. The sample was divided according to physiopathological mechanisms in two sub- groups: ischemic anoxia ( 21 cases) and hypoxemic anoxia ( 11 cases). Functions assessed included orientation, attention, language, visuo- perceptive and visuo- constructive processing and verbal memory.
   Results: Neuropsychological assessment showed diffuse cognitive impairment in all assessed functions. Episodes of ischemic anoxia caused more severe verbal memory and learning problems than episodes of hypoxemic anoxia.
   Conclusions: This study shows that memory problems are the most prominent and relevant impairment, although all other cognitive functions are also impaired, affecting both memory itself and general behaviour. Statistical analysis also provides preliminary evidence on the different profile of memory impairment whether cerebral anoxia had hypoxic or ischemic origin.

TI  - Amplitude-Integrated Electroencephalography Predicts Outcome in Patients with Coma After Acute Brain Injury
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE BULLETIN
AB  - Prognostication of coma patients after brain injury is important, yet challenging. In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) for neurological outcomes in coma patients. From January 2013 to January 2016, 128 coma patients after acute brain injury were prospectively enrolled and monitored with aEEG. The 6-month neurological outcome was evaluated using the Cerebral Performance Category Scale. aEEG monitoring commenced at a median of 7.5 days after coma onset. Continuous normal voltage predicted a good 6-month neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 93.6% and specificity of 85.2%. In contrast, continuous extremely low voltage, burst-suppression, or a flat tracing was correlated with poor 6-month neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 76.5% and specificity of 100%. In conclusion, aEEG is a promising predictor of 6-month neurological outcome for coma patients after acute brain injury.

TI  - Lower dose of hypertonic saline dextran reduces the risk of lethal rebleeding in uncontrolled hemorrhage
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - To challenge whether the recommended dose of 4 mL/kg of 7.5% sodium chloride in 6% Dextran (HSD) is optimal for fluid resuscitation in uncontrolled hemorrhage, 30 anesthetized pigs were randomized to receive a 5-min intravenous infusion of either 1, 2, or 4 mL/kg of HSD beginning 10 min after inducing a 5-mm laceration in the infrarenal aorta. In addition to conventional hemodynamic monitoring, the blood loss was calculated as the difference in blood flow rates between flow probes placed proximal and distal to the injury. The results show that the bleeding stopped between 3 and 4 min after the injury and amounted to 338 +/- 92 mL (mean +/- SEM), which corresponds to 28.5% +/- 6.6% of the estimated blood volume. After treatment with HSD was started, six rebleeding events occurred in the 1-mL group, 11 in the 2-mL group, and 16 in the 4-mL group. The amount of blood lost due to rebleeding increased significantly with the dose of HSD and was also associated with a fatal outcome. The total blood loss was 408 mL in the survivors and 630 mL in the nonsurvivors (median, P < 0.007). The mortality in the three groups was 20%, 50%, and 50%, respectively. In conclusion, infusing 4 mL/kg of HSD after uncontrolled aortic hemorrhage promoted rebleeding and increased the mortality, while a dose of 1 mL/kg appeared to be more suitable.

TI  - Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings, particularly if poorly managed. The cornerstones of effective IAIs management include early diagnosis, adequate source control, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiologic stabilization using intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents in critically ill patients. Adequate empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients with IAIs is of paramount importance because inappropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with poor outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial prescriptions improves treatment effectiveness, increases patients' safety, and minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections (such as Clostridioides difficile) and antimicrobial resistance selection. The growing emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, especially regarding Gram-negative bacteria. The Multidisciplinary and Intersociety Italian Council for the Optimization of Antimicrobial Use promoted a consensus conference on the antimicrobial management of IAIs, including emergency medicine specialists, radiologists, surgeons, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, clinical pharmacologists, hospital pharmacists, microbiologists and public health specialists. Relevant clinical questions were constructed by the Organizational Committee in order to investigate the topic. The expert panel produced recommendation statements based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE Library and experts' opinions. The statements were planned and graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence. On November 10, 2023, the experts met in Mestre (Italy) to debate the statements. After the approval of the statements, the expert panel met via email and virtual meetings to prepare and revise the definitive document. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference and comprises three sections. The first section focuses on the general principles of diagnosis and treatment of IAIs. The second section provides twenty-three evidence-based recommendations for the antimicrobial therapy of IAIs. The third section presents eight clinical diagnostic-therapeutic pathways for the most common IAIs. The document has been endorsed by the Italian Society of Surgery.

TI  - Controlled mild-to-moderate hypothermia in the intensive care unit
T2  - ANAESTHESIST
AB  - Controlled hypothermia is used as a therapeutic intervention to provide neuroprotection and (more recently) cardioprotection. The growing insight into the underlying pathophysiology of apoptosis and destructive processes at the cellular level, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of hypothermia, have led to improved application and to a widening of the range of potential indications. In many centres hypothermia has now become part of the standard therapy for post-anoxic coma in certain patients, but for other indications its use still remains controversial. The negative findings of some studies may be partly explained by inadequate protocols for the application of hypothermia and insufficient attention to the prevention of potential side effects. This review deals with some of the concepts underlying hypothermia-associated neuroprotection and cardioprotection, and discusses some potential clinical indications as well as reasons why some clinical trials may have produced conflicting results. Practical aspects such as methods to induce hypothermia, as well as the side effects of cooling are also discussed.

TI  - Feasibility and Clinical Outcomes of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta in Patients with Traumatic Shock: A Single-Center 5-Year Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEST SURGERY
AB  - Background: Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has recently gained popularity as an adjunct to resuscitation of patients with traumatic shock. However, the effectiveness of REBOA is still debated because of inconsistent indications across centers and the lack of medical records. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of REBOA by analyzing clinical results from a single center. Methods: This study included 96 patients who underwent REBOA between August 2016 and September 2021 at a regional trauma center according to the center's treatment algorithm for traumatic shock. Medical records, including the time of the decision to conduct the REBOA procedure, time of operation, type of aortic occlusion, and clinical outcomes, were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified by RE- BOA protocol (group 1, 2, or 3) and survival status (survivor or non-survivor) for analysis. Results: The overall success rate of the procedure was 97.9%, and the survival rate was 32.6%. In survivors, blood pressure was higher than in non-survivors both before the RE- BOA procedure (p=0.002) and after aortic occlusion (p=0.03). The total aortic occlusion time was significantly shorter (p=0.001) and the proportion of partial aortic occlusion was significantly higher (p=0.014) among the survivors. The non-survivors had more acidosis (p<0.001) and higher lactate concentrations (p<0.001) than the survivors. Conclusion: REBOA may be a feasible bridge therapy for resuscitation of patients with traumatic shock. Prompt and accurate decision-making to perform REBOA followed by damage control surgery could improve survival rates and clinical outcomes.

TI  - Intensive care medicine in Europe: perspectives from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND Anaesthesiology represents a rapidly evolving medical specialty in global healthcare, currently covering advanced peri-operative, pre-hospital and in-hospital critical emergency management (CREM), intensive care medicine (ICM) and pain management. The aim of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) is to develop and promote a coordinated interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary European network of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (AICM) societies for improvement of patient safety and outcome, and to enhance political and public awareness of the role of anaesthesiologists all over Europe. The ESAIC promotes coordinated interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary care for severely compromised patients, based on the European training requirements (ETR) within the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). METHODS To define the current situation of AICM in Europe, a survey was sent in April 2019 to the ESAIC Council and the ESAIC National Anaesthesiologists Societies Committee (NASC) members. The survey posed questions regarding the year of foundation, the inclusion of ICM in the society name, and if, and to what extent, various kinds (postoperative, general, specific, mixed) of national ICUs are being run by differing medical specialties. The study data were compiled and analysed by the ESAIC Board, Council and NASC in December 2019. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Amongst the 42 European national societies surveyed (41 members of ESAIC-NASC plus Luxembourg), nineteen (45%) also include terms related to critical care medicine or ICM in their names, seven (17%) include terms related to reanimation and three (7%) to resuscitation. In recent years, several national societies revised their names to better reflect their gradual embrace of peri-operative medicine, ICM, CREM and pain management. Approximately 70% of ICU beds in Europe, and 100% in Scandinavia, are being run by anaesthesiologists, the remaining 30% being managed by physicians from other surgical or medical specialties. To emphasise future needs and resources of European AICM, the ESAIC drafted an ICM roadmap in terms of clinical practice, organisation of healthcare, interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration, patient safety, outcome and empowerment, professional working conditions, and changes in research, teaching and training required to meet future challenges and expectations.

TI  - Outcomes of Gas-Forming Pyogenic Liver Abscess Are Comparable to Non-Gas-Forming Pyogenic Liver Abscess in the Era of Multi-Modal Care: A Propensity Score Matched Study
T2  - SURGICAL INFECTIONS
AB  - Background: Gas-forming pyogenic liver abscess (GFPLA) occurs in 7%-24% of all PLAs and has been associated traditionally with high mortality rates. Studies have suggested that the use of a proactive approach of prompt resuscitation, parenteral antibiotic agents, percutaneous drainage, and a dedicated multi-disciplinary team may improve clinical outcomes. Hence, we aim to investigate whether the clinical outcomes of PLA are determined by gas formation.
   Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with PLA from 2007 to 2011. A 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed using age, co-morbid diabetes mellitus, presence of septic shock, hemoglobin levels, international normalized ratio, creatinine, total bilirubin, positive blood culture and pus culture, and the size of abscess. Baseline demographics, clinical profile, and peri-operative data were compared.
   Results: There were 213 patients who had PLA: 41 (19.2%) patients had GFPLA and 172 (80.8%) patients had non-GFPLA. The PSM analysis resulted in a total of 108 patients (36 GFPLA and 72 non-GFPLA). Median duration of parenteral antibiotic agents was significantly lower in the GFPLA group (9.5 d vs. 14 d, p = 0.044), but median total duration of antibiotic use was comparable (GFPLA 39 d vs. non-GFPLA 37 d, p = 0.634). Median length of stay (days) did not differ significantly between GFPLA and non-GFPLA (14 vs. 15, p = 0.299). There were no statistically significant differences between GFLPA and non-GFLPA in the need for percutaneous drainage (26/36 (72.2%) vs. 47/72 (65.3%), respectively, p = 0.467) and in-hospital all-cause death (4/36 (11.1%) vs. 7 (9.7%), p = 0.822)
   Conclusions: Outcomes of GFPLA are comparable to those of non-GFPLA in the era of multi-modal care.

TI  - Lactate Profile Assessment-A Good Predictor of Prognosis in Patients with COVID-19 and Septic Shock Requiring Continuous Renal Therapy
T2  - CLINICS AND PRACTICE
AB  - Introduction: Lactate is a useful prognostic marker, as its level increases in hypoxic tissue and/or during accelerated aerobic glycolysis due to excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and decreased lactate clearance. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle 2018 Update suggests premeasurement of lactate within 2-4 h so that physicians perform, assist, administer, and introduce lactate-guided resuscitation to reduce mortality due to sepsis. Methods: A total of 108 patients with septic shock who underwent continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney injury were enrolled in this observational study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, and patients were divided into two groups: survivors and non-survivors. Results: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that lactate levels at 24 h after initiation of CRRT treatment, but not lactate levels at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, were associated with mortality. Lactate clearance was associated with lower mortality among the survivors (OR = 0.140) at 6 h after ICU admission and late mortality (OR = 0.260) after 24 h. The area under the ROC curves for mortality was 0.682 for initial lactate; 0.797 for lactate at 24 h; and 0.816 for lactate clearance at 24 h. Conclusions: Our result reinforces that the determination of lactate dynamics represents a good predictor for mortality, and serial lactate measurements may be more useful prognostic markers than initial lactate in patients with septic shock.

TI  - Protocol for a prospective observational study to improve prehospital notification of injured patients presenting to trauma centres in India
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction: Prehospital notification of injured patients enables prompt and timely care in hospital through adequate preparation of trauma teams, space, equipment and consumables necessary for resuscitation, and may improve outcomes. In India, anecdotal reports suggest that prehospital notification, in those few places where it occurs, is unstructured and not linked to a well-defined hospital response. The aim of this manuscript is to describe, in detail, a study protocol for the evaluation of a formalised approach to prehospital notification.
   Methods and analysis: This is a longitudinal prospective cohort study of injured patients being transported by ambulance to major trauma centres in India. In the preintervention phase, prospective data on patients will be collected on prehospital assessment, notification, inhospital assessment, management and outcomes and recorded in a new tailored multihospital trauma registry. All injured patients arriving by ambulance and allocated to a red or yellow priority category will be eligible for inclusion. The intervention will be a prehospital notification application to be used by ambulance clinicians to notify emergency departments of the impending arrival of a patient. The proportion of eligible patients arriving to hospital after notification will be the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes evaluated will be availability of a trauma cubicle, presence of a trauma team on patient arrival, time to first chest X-ray and inhospital mortality.
   Progress: Ethical approval has been obtained from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and site-specific approval granted by relevant trauma services. The trial has also been registered with the Monash University Human Research and Ethics Committee; Project number: CF16/1814 - 2016000929. Results will be fed back to prehospital and hospital clinicians via a series of reports and presentations. These will be used to facilitate discussions about service redesign and implementation. It is expected that evidence for improved outcomes will enable widespread adoption of this intervention among centres in all settings with less established tools for prehospital assessment and notification.

TI  - Variation in the design of Do Not Resuscitate orders and other code status options: a multi-institutional qualitative study
T2  - BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
AB  - Background US hospitals typically provide a set of code status options that includes Full Code and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) but often includes additional options. Although US hospitals differ in the design of code status options, this variation and its impacts have not been empirically studied. Design and methods Multi-institutional qualitative study at 7 US hospitals selected for variability in geographical location, type of institution and design of code status options. We triangulated across three data sources (policy documents, code status ordering menus and in-depth physician interviews) to characterise the code status options available at each hospital. Using inductive qualitative methods, we investigated design differences in hospital code status options and the perceived impacts of these differences. Results The code status options at each hospital varied widely with regard to the number of code status options, the names and definitions of code status options, and the formatting and capabilities of code status ordering menus. DNR orders were named and defined differently at each hospital studied. We identified five key design characteristics that impact the function of a code status order. Each hospital's code status options were unique with respect to these characteristics, indicating that code status plays differing roles in each hospital. Physician participants perceived that the design of code status options shapes communication and decision-making practices about resuscitation and life-sustaining treatments, especially at the end of life. We identified four potential mechanisms through which this may occur: framing conversations, prompting decisions, shaping inferences and creating categories. Conclusions There are substantive differences in the design of hospital code status options that may contribute to known variability in end-of-life care and treatment intensity among US hospitals. Our framework can be used to design hospital code status options or evaluate their function.

TI  - Observatory of the elderly over 80 years supported by the mobile emergency and resuscitation service
T2  - ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION
AB  - Emergency medical services (EMS) received an increasing number of calls for patients aged 80 and older. The goal of the present study was to evaluate outcome and functional dependence of patients aged 80 and older who EMS managed in the prehospital theater. This prospective study was conducted over 1 year (September 2007-August 2008), all consecutive patients aged 80 and older managed by a medical team during the study period were included. Characteristics of patients, including previous health status and functional dependence, were recorded on-the scene by the attending physician. Three-month mortality was recorded, as well as ADL score. Data are expressed as mean values +/- standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and percentages and compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. P < 0.05 was considered the threshold for significance. Five hundred twenty-three patients were included. Mean age was 86 +/- 5. Median ADL index was 2 (IQR 0-9), and 63% of patients were living at home. At 3 months, the survival rate was 66% (n = 273) and the proportion of patients living at home was 64% (P = 0.9), the median ADL index of survivors was 2 (IQR 0-8) vs 1 (IQR 0-6) initially for this subpopulation, P = 0.01. Our study confirms utility and efficacy of full access of elderly persons to advanced life support especially for self-patients and not restricted based on aging per se. The development and daily use of tools for rapid assessment of autonomy should enable practitioners to innovate and thus, adapt their management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Faceted Approach to Ventricular Tachycardia: A Review of Management Strategies
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Ventricular tachycardia poses a significant therapeutic challenge. It can manifest over a spectrum from minimal palpitation symptoms to sudden cardiac death. This makes large-scale trials on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia difficult to perform. The mechanism of ventricular tachycardia must also be understood before embarking on treatment. Patients with or without structural heart disease will have different mechanisms for the onset and propagation of these arrhythmias. Catheter ablation is an established management option for ventricular tachycardia; however, it is not always successful and anti-arrhythmic medications are often necessary to control these life-threatening arrhythmias. Although anti-arrhythmics can suppress ventricular tachycardias they also carry side effects. In certain substrates, some of these medications can exacerbate arrhythmias or heart failure. For these reasons, a multifaceted approach to treating ventricular tachycardia is necessary. This paper is a comprehensive review of the comprehensive management strategies for ventricular tachycardia. Anti-arrhythmic medications have an important role and their use in various cardiomyopathies and channelopathies is reviewed in detail. We also review the promising effects of gene therapy and artificial intelligence on different substrates for ventricular tachycardia.

TI  - A Clinical and Physiological Prospective Observational Study on the Management of Pediatric Shock in the Post-Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy Trial Era*
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fluid bolus resuscitation in African children is harmful. Little research has evaluated physiologic effects of maintenance-only fluid strategy. DESIGN: We describe the efficacy of fluid-conservative resuscitation of septic shock using case-fatality, hemodynamic, and myocardial function endpoints. SETTING: Pediatric wards of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda, and Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, conducted between October 2013 and July 2015. Data were analysed from August 2016 to July 2019. PATIENTS: Children (>= 60 d to <= 12 yr) with severe febrile illness and clinical signs of impaired perfusion. INTERVENTIONS: IV maintenance fluid (4 mL/kg/hr) unless children had World Health Organization (WHO) defined shock (>= 3 signs) where they received two fluid boluses (20 mL/kg) and transfusion if shock persisted. Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data were collected at presentation, during resuscitation and on day 28. Outcome measures were 48-hour mortality, normalization of hemodynamics, and cardiac biomarkers. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty children (70% males) were recruited, six had WHO shock, all of whom died (6/6) versus three of 24 deaths in the non-WHO shock. Median fluid volume received by survivors and nonsurvivors were similar (13 [interquartile range (IQR), 9-32] vs 30 mL/kg [28-61 mL/kg], z = 1.62, p = 0.23). By 24 hours, we observed increases in median (IQR) stroke volume index (39 mL/m(2) [32-42 mL/m(2)] to 47 mL/m(2) [41-49 mL/m(2)]) and a measure of systolic function: fractional shortening from 30 (27-33) to 34 (31-38) from baseline including children managed with no-bolus. Children with WHO shock had a higher mean level of cardiac troponin (t = 3.58; 95% CI, 1.24-1.43; p = 0.02) and alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (t = 16.5; 95% CI, 2.80-67.5; p < 0.01) at admission compared with non-WHO shock. Elevated troponin (> 0.1 mu g/mL) and hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L) were putative makers predicting outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance-only fluid therapy normalized clinical and myocardial perturbations in shock without compromising cardiac or hemodynamic function whereas fluid-bolus management of WHO shock resulted in high fatality. Troponin and lactate biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction could be promising outcome predictors in pediatric septic shock in resource-limited settings.

TI  - Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Background Peptic ulcer disease is common with a lifetime prevalence in the general population of 5-10% and an incidence of 0.1-0.3% per year. Despite a sharp reduction in incidence and rates of hospital admission and mortality over the past 30 years, complications are still encountered in 10-20% of these patients. Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem, which can consume considerable financial resources. Management may involve various subspecialties including surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. Successful management of patients with complicated peptic ulcer (CPU) involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and timely surgical/radiological treatment. Methods The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5th WSES Congress, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached. Conclusions The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into the two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

TI  - Indications for the Appropriate Use of Damage Control Surgery and Damage Control Interventions in Civilian Trauma Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOVASCULAR RESUSCITATION AND TRAUMA MANAGEMENT
AB  - In patients undergoing emergent operation for trauma, surgeons must decide whether to perform a definitive or damage control (DC) procedure. DC surgery (abbreviated initial surgery followed by planned reoperation after a period of resuscitation in the intensive care unit) has been suggested to most benefit those injured patients more likely to succumb to the "vicious cycle" of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy, and/or postoperative abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) than the failure to complete all organ repairs. However, currently there exists no unbiased evidence to support that DC surgery benefits injured patients. Further, the procedure is associated with substantial morbidity, long durations of intensive care unit and hospital stay, increased healthcare resource utilization, and possibly a reduced quality of life among survivors. Therefore, it is important to ensure that DC laparotomy is only utilized in situations where the expected procedural benefits are predicted to outweigh the expected procedural harms. In this manuscript, we review the comparative effectiveness and safety of DC surgery when used for different procedural indications. We also review recent studies suggesting variation in use of DC surgery between trauma centers and the potential harms associated with overuse of the procedure. We also review published consensus indications for the appropriate use of DC surgery and specific abdominal, pelvic, and vascular DC interventions in civilian trauma patients. We conclude by providing recommendations as to how the above list of published appropriateness indications may be used to reduce overuse of DC surgery and guide medical and surgical education, quality improvement, and surgical practice.

TI  - Cancer Survivors' Experiences With and Preferences for Medical Information Disclosure and Advance Care Planning: An Online Survey Among Indonesian Cancer Support Groups
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - PURPOSE To understand the experiences and preferences of Indonesian cancer survivors regarding medical information disclosure and advance care planning.
   METHODS On the basis of systematic reviews of the scientific literature, qualitative studies, and expert-panel input, we developed an online survey that was distributed to nine cancer survivor support groups in Indonesia.
   RESULTS A total of 1,030 valid responses were received. Most participants were younger than 60 years (92%), female (91%), married (78%), Muslim (75%), diagnosed with breast cancer (68%), highly educated (64%), and more than one year beyond diagnosis of their cancer. If diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, participants wished to be informed about their diagnosis (74%), disease severity (61%), estimated curability (81%), expected disease trajectory (66%), and estimated life expectancy (37%). Between 46%-69% of the participants wished to discuss four topics of advance care planning (end-of-life treatments, resuscitation, health care proxies, and what matters at the end of life); 21%-42% had done so. Of those who wished to discuss these topics, 36%-79% preferred to do so with their family members. The most important reasons for not being willing to engage in advance care planning were the desire to surrender to God's will and to focus on here and now.
   CONCLUSION In a group of cancer survivors, most of them were highly educated, young, female, and diagnosed with breast cancer. Their preferences for medical information and advance care planning varied, with the majority wishing for information and involvement in advance care planning. Culturally sensitive advance care planning involves health care professionals eliciting individuals' preferences for medical information disclosure and discussing different topics in advance care planning conversations.

TI  - CORM-3 ameliorates neurodegeneration in the amygdala and improves depression- and anxiety-like behavior in a rat model of combined traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock
T2  - NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Objective: Emotional disturbances characterized by depression and anxiety among survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) impact the quality of life severely. Currently, there is a lack of effective drug treatment for neurodegeneration induced by TBI, mainly due to failed efficacy of compounds such as corticosteroids, calcium channel blockers, and excitatory amino acid inhibitors. Thus, we sought to continue with our investigation on CORM-3, a water-soluble exogenous carbon monoxide-releasing molecule with excellent anti-inflammatory actions employed in a previous study using a rat model of combined TBI with hemorrhage shock and resuscitation (HSR).
   Methods: Rats were administrated with CORM-3 after induction of TBI and HSR and examined depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, along with cerebral function employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 30-days post-trauma. Also, the following variables were measured: 1) neuronal pyroptosis and apoptosis 24 h post-trauma, 2) the roles of PKG-ERK1/2 signaling pathways with the use of the protein kinase G (PKG) specific inhibitor, KT5823.
   Results: CORM-3-treated rats displayed significant ameliorated depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, improved cerebral blood flow, and fractional anisotropy (FA), showed less neuronal pyroptosis and apoptosis in the amygdala, and upregulated the phosphorylation of Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and ERK1/2. However, CORM-3 neuroprotective effects against trauma were only partially reversed by KT5823.
   Conclusion: CORM-3 ameliorated the emotional deficits and neuronal death induced in the amygdala post-TBI and HSR rat model, and PKG-ERK1/2 signaling might be implicated in the underlying mechanism.

TI  - Factors affecting mortality after penetrating cardiac injuries: 10-year experience at urban level I trauma center
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the lethality of injuries to the heart, optimizing factors that impact mortality for victims that do survive to reach the hospital is critical.
   METHODS: From 2003 to 2012, prehospital data, injury characteristics, and clinical patient factors were analyzed for victims with penetrating cardiac injuries (PCIs) at an urban, level I trauma center.
   RESULTS: Over the 10-year study, 80 PCI patients survived to reach the hospital. Of the 21 factors analyzed, prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio [OR] 5 30), scene time greater than 10 minutes (OR 5 58), resuscitative thoracotomy (OR 5 19), and massive left hemothorax (OR 5 15) had the greatest impact on mortality. Cardiac tamponade physiology demonstrated a "protective'' effect for survivors to the hospital (OR 5.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: Trauma surgeons can improve mortality after PCI by minimizing time to the operating room for early control of hemorrhage. In PCI patients, tamponade may provide a physiologic advantage (lower mortality) compared to exsanguination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - New paradigms and improved results for the surgical treatment of acute type A dissection
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
CP  - 121st Annual Meeting of the American-Surgical-Association
AB  - Objective To examine the effect of an integrated surgical approach to the treatment of acute type A dissections.
   Summary Background Data Acute type A dissection requires surgery to prevent death from proximal aortic rupture or malperfusion. Most series of the past decade have reported a death rate in the range of 15% to 30%.
   Methods From January 1994 to March 2001, 104 consecutive patients underwent repair of acute type A dissection. All had an integrated operative management as follows: intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography; hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) with retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) to replace the aortic arch; HCA established after 5 minutes of electroencephalographic (EEG) silence in neuromonitored patients (66%) or after 45 minutes of cooling in patients who were not neuromonitored (34%); reinforcement of the residual arch tissue with a Teflon felt "neo-media"; cannulation of the arch graft to reestablish cardiopulmonary bypass at the completion of HCA (antegrade graft perfusion); and remodeling of the sinus of Valsalva segments with Teflon felt "neo-media" and aortic valve resuspension (78%) or replacement with a biologic or mechanical valved conduit (22%).
   Results Mean age was 59 +/- 15 (range 22-86) years, with 71% men and 13% redo sternotomy after a previous cardiac procedure. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 196 +/- 50 minutes. Mean HCA with RCP time was 42 +/- 12 minutes (range 1984). Mean cardiac ischemic time was 140 +/- 45 minutes. Eleven percent of patients presented with a preoperative neurologic deficit, and 5% developed a new cerebrovascular accident after dissection repair. The in-hospital death rate was 9%. Excluding the patients who presented neurologically unresponsive or with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n = 5), the death rate was 4%. In six patients adverse cerebral outcomes were potentially avoided when immediate surgical fenestration was prompted by a sudden change in the EEG during cooling. Forty-five percent of neuromonitored patients required greater than 30 minutes to achieve EEG silence.
   Conclusion The authors have shown that the surgical integration of sinus segment repair or aortic root replacement, the use of EEG monitoring, partial or total arch replacement using RCP, routine antegrade graft perfusion, and the uniform use of transesophageal echocardiography substantially decrease the death and complication rates of acute type A dissection repair.

TI  - Biomarkers of Microcirculatory Dysfunction in Sepsis: A Pilot Prospective Observational Study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE EXPLORATIONS
AB  - CONTEXT: To evaluate and compare sublingual microscopy (SLM) to urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assays, dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) quantification of GAGs as biomarkers of microvascular dysfunction in patients with sepsis and septic shock. HYPOTHESIS: Indicators of microvascular dysfunction and markers of endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation would be associated with sepsis. METHODS AND MODELS: Prospective, observational case-control study. SETTING: Denver Health Medical Center, a safety-net hospital in Denver, CO. SUBJECTS: Forty-four adult patients with sepsis or septic shock and 24 healthy control patients undergoing elective orthopedic procedures. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and incarceration. RESULTS: Sublingual microvascular parameters (De Backer Density, proportion of perfused vessels) were measured using darkfield sidestream microscopy, and urinary GAGs were measured via DMMB colorimetric assay and LC-MS/MS targeting heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Validation of HS quantification was performed on a subset using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). LC-MS/MS HS was significantly higher in sepsis vs. controls (Area under the curve 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95), demonstrating higher diagnostic performance than SLM (De Backer Density AUC 0.71) and DMMB GAGs (AUC 0.62). LC-MS/MS and HILIC-MS HS levels were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.001). DMMB GAGs were associated with HS subtypes (p = 0.05) and SLM density (p = 0.03). No significant associations with in-hospital mortality or acute kidney injury were observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated modalities, LC-MS/MS quantification of HS showed the greatest discriminative ability for identifying sepsis and correlated strongly with established mass spectrometric methods. SLM exhibited moderate diagnostic utility and significant associations with GAG levels, reinforcing its biologic relevance. However, its bedside application may be limited by challenges in image acquisition and analysis. The concordance across SLM, DMMB, and LC-MS/MS supports eGC degradation as a key feature of sepsis pathophysiology. These findings highlight the promise of LC-MS/MS as a scalable, rapid, and mechanistically informed platform for biomarker-driven enrichment in future sepsis trials and clinical care.

TI  - Could exhaled methane be used as a possible indicator for hemodynamic changes in trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? Scientific basis supported by a case study
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Introduction: Identification of severe blood loss and hemorrhagic shock in polytrauma patients poses a key challenge for trauma teams across the world, as there are just a few objective parameters, on which clinicians can rely. We investigated the relationship between exhaled air methane (CH4) concentration and blood loss in a polytrauma patient. Decreased blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is one of the first compensatory responses to blood loss. Gases produced by the anaerobic flora of the intestinal segment supplied by the SMA are the primary source of exhaled CH4, which diffuses through the intestinal microvessels into the circulation and is finally eliminated through the lungs. We hypothesized that diminution of exhaled CH4 indicates blood loss and tested our theory in a severely injured patient.
   Methods: Exhaled CH4 concentrations of a severely injured patient were measured using a photoacoustic spectroscope (PAS) attached to the exhalation side of the breathing circuit. The primary objective was to investigate the relationship between exhaled CH4 and conventional indicators of hemorrhage including hemoglobin (Hb) levels, base deficit (BD) values and vital parameters (heart rate and systolic blood pressure) in the early phase of in-hospital care (first 4 h).
   Results: A severely injured patient was admitted with unstable hemodynamic parameters and incomplete left lower limb amputation, (Injury Severity Score: 38, 74/36 mmHg, 76 bpm). At the time of arrival, considerably lower CH4 levels were detected (22,800 PAU) in the exhaled air. During the first 4 h fluid and massive blood resuscitation, the exhaled CH4 levels were continuously rising in parallel with Htc and Hb values. Corresponding to these changes, BD values displayed a decreasing tendency.
   Discussion: Our study was conducted to characterize the changes in exhaled air CH4 concentration in response to hemorrhagic shock and to provide data on a viable clinical use of an experimental technique. According to our results, the real-time detection of exhaled air CH4 concentration is an applicable and promising technique for the early detection of bleeding and hemorrhagic shock in severely injured patients. Further research on large sample size and refinement of the PAS technique is required.

TI  - Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Consult Series #67: Maternal sepsis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Maternal sepsis is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and is a potentially preventable cause of maternal death. This Consult aims to summarize what is known about sepsis and provide guidance for the management of sepsis during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Most studies cited are from the nonpregnant population, but where available, pregnancy data are included.
   The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend that clinicians consider the diagnosis of sepsis in pregnant or postpartum patients with otherwise unexplained end-organ damage in the presence of a suspected or confirmed infectious process, regardless of the presence of fever (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend that sepsis and septic shock in pregnancy be considered medical emergencies and that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately (Best Practice); (3) we recommend that hospitals and health systems use a performance improvement program for sepsis in pregnancy with sepsis screening tools and metrics (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend that institutions develop their own procedures and protocols for the detection of maternal sepsis, avoiding the use of a single screening tool alone (GRADE 1B); (5) we recommend obtaining tests to evaluate for infectious and noninfectious causes of life-threatening organ dysfunction in pregnant and postpartum patients with possible sepsis (Best Practice); (6) we recommend that an evaluation for infectious causes in pregnant or postpartum patients in whom sepsis is suspected or identified includes appropriate microbiologic cultures, including blood, before starting antimicrobial therapy, as long as there are no substantial delays in timely administration of antibiotics (Best Practice); (7) we recommend obtaining a serum lactate level in pregnant or postpartum patients in whom sepsis is suspected or identified (GRADE 1B); (8) in pregnant or postpartum patients with septic shock or a high likelihood of sepsis, we recommend administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, ideally within 1 hour of recognition (GRADE 1C); (9) after a diagnosis of sepsis in pregnancy is made, we recommend rapid identification or exclusion of an anatomic source of infection and emergency source control when indicated (Best Practice); (10) we recommend early intravenous administration (within the first 3 hours) of 1 to 2 L of balanced crystalloid solutions in sepsis complicated by hypotension or suspected organ hypoperfusion (GRADE 1C); (11) we recommend the use of a balanced crystalloid solution as a first-line fluid for resuscitation in pregnant and postpartum patients with sepsis or septic shock (GRADE 1B); (12) we recommend against the use of starches or gelatin for resuscitation in pregnant and postpartum patients with sepsis or septic shock (GRADE 1A); (13) we recommend ongoing, detailed evaluation of the patient's response to fluid resuscitation guided by dynamic measures of preload (GRADE 1B); (14) we recommend the use of norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor during pregnancy and the postpartum period with septic shock (GRADE 1C); (15) we suggest using intravenous corticosteroids in pregnant or postpartum patients with septic shock who continue to require vasopressor therapy (GRADE 2B); (16) because of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in sepsis and septic shock, we recommend the use of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in pregnant and postpartum patients in septic shock (GRADE 1B); (17) we suggest initiating insulin therapy at a glucose level >180 mg/dL in critically ill pregnant patients with sepsis (GRADE 2C); (18) if a uterine source for sepsis is suspected or confirmed, we recommend prompt delivery or evacuation of uterine contents to achieve source control, regardless of gestational age (GRADE 1C); and (19) because of an increased risk of physical, cognitive, and emotional problems in survivors of sepsis and septic shock, we recommend
   ongoing comprehensive support for pregnant and postpartum sepsis survivors and their families (Best Practice).

TI  - Characterization of critically ill adult burn patients admitted to a Brazilian intensive care unit
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Introduction: To characterize the evolution of clinical and physiological variables in severe adult burn patients admitted to a Brazilian burn ICU, we hypothesized that characteristics of survivors are different from non-survivors after ICU admission.
   Methods: A five-year observational study was carried out. The clinical characteristics, physiological variables, and outcomes were collected during this period.
   Results: A total of 163 patients required ICU support and were analyzed. Median age was 34 [25,47] years. Total burn surface area (TBSA) was 29 [18,43]%, and hospital mortality rate was 42%. Lethal burn area at which fifty percent of patients died (LA50%) was 36.5%. Median SAPS3 was 41 [34,54]. Factors associated with hospital mortality were analyzed in three steps, the first incorporated ICU admission data, the second incorporated first day ICU data, and the third incorporated data from the first week of an ICU stay. We found a significant association between hospital mortality and SAPS3 [OR(95%CI) = 1.114(1.062-1.168)], TBSA [OR(95%CI) = 1.043(1.010-1.076)], suicide attempts [OR(95%CI) = 8.126(2.284-28.907)], and cumulative fluid balance per liter within the first week [OR(95%CI) = 1.090(1.030-1.154)]. Inhalation injury was present in 45% of patients, and it was not significantly associated with hospital mortality.
   Conclusions: In this study of an ICU in a developing country, the mortality rate of critically ill burn patients was high and the TBSA was an independent risk factor for death. SAPS3 at admission and cumulative fluid balance in the first seven days, were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The implementation of judicious fluid management after an acute resuscitation phase may help to improve outcomes in this scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

TI  - CAROTID AND VERTEBRAL ARTERY INJURY IN SURVIVORS OF ATLANTOOCCIPITAL DISLOCATION - CASE-REPORTS AND LITERATURE-REVIEW
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) usually results in immediate death from transection of the upper cervical spinal cord near the spinomedullary junction.  However, over the last several decades increasing numbers of AOD survivors have been identified.  Although many of these patients initially demonstrate profound neurologic deficits, a number who survive have regained most or all neurologic functions, indicating that they did not suffer mechanical disruption of the spinal cord at the time of AOD.  In the survivors, a growing body of evidence indicates that many of the initial neurologic deficits are related to vascular injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries and their branches.  We recently encountered three AOD survivors with no evidence of mechanical injury to the spinal cord in which angiography demonstrated vascular injury to the internal carotid artery in the form of vasospasm in one case and to the vertebral arteries in the forms of focal stenosis at the site of dural penetration, focal stenosis and distal vasospasm, and focal stenosis with distal intimal flap and dissection in one case each.  Autopsy after one of three died after cardiac arrest demonstrated diffuse infarction of the cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, brainstem, and upper cervical spinal cord without evidence of mechanical laceration or transection of the spinal cord.  Recovery of neurologic function in two cases following prompt immobilization and angiography suggests that neurologic deficits secondary to vascular injury are potentially reversible.

TI  - Development and Assessment of an Interpretable Machine Learning Triage Tool for Estimating Mortality After Emergency Admissions
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB  - This cohort study examines the performance of an interpretable machine learning triage tool in estimating mortality in individuals admitted to the hospital from the emergency department.
   Question How does an interpretable machine learning triage tool for estimating mortality perform in a cohort of individuals admitted to the hospital from the emergency department compared with other clinical scores?
   Findings In this cohort study, the parsimonious and point-based Score for Emergency Risk Prediction was more accurate in identifying patients who died within 2, 7, or 30 days of admissions than other point-based clinical scores.
   Meaning These results suggest that the Score for Emergency Risk Prediction tool shows promise for triaging patients admitted from the emergency department according to mortality risk.
   IMPORTANCE Triage in the emergency department (ED) is a complex clinical judgment based on the tacit understanding of the patient's likelihood of survival, availability of medical resources, and local practices. Although a scoring tool could be valuable in risk stratification, currently available scores have demonstrated limitations.
   OBJECTIVES To develop an interpretable machine learning tool based on a parsimonious list of variables available at ED triage; provide a simple, early, and accurate estimate of patients' risk of death; and evaluate the tool's predictive accuracy compared with several established clinical scores.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-site, retrospective cohort study assessed all ED patients between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2016, who were subsequently admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore. The Score for Emergency Risk Prediction (SERP) tool was derived using a machine learning framework. To estimate mortality outcomes after emergency admissions, SERP was compared with several triage systems, including Patient Acuity Category Scale, Modified Early Warning Score, National Early Warning Score, Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage, Rapid Acute Physiology Score, and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score. The initial analyses were completed in October 2020, and additional analyses were conducted in May 2021.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three SERP scores, namely SERP-2d, SERP-7d, and SERP-30d, were developed using the primary outcomes of interest of 2-, 7-, and 30-day mortality, respectively. Secondary outcomes included 3-day mortality and inpatient mortality. The SERP's predictive power was measured using the area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic analysis.
   RESULTS The study included 224 666 ED episodes in the model training cohort (mean [SD] patient age, 63.60 [16.90] years; 113 426 [50.5%] female), 56 167 episodes in the validation cohort (mean [SD] patient age, 63.58 [16.87] years; 28 427 [50.6%] female), and 42 676 episodes in the testing cohort (mean [SD] patient age, 64.85 [16.80] years; 21 556 [50.5%] female). The mortality rates in the training cohort were 0.8% at 2 days, 2.2% at 7 days, and 5.9% at 30 days. In the testing cohort, the areas under the curve of SERP-30d were 0.821 (95% CI, 0.796-0.847) for 2-day mortality, 0.826 (95% CI, 0.811-0.841) for 7-day mortality, and 0.823 (95% CI, 0.814-0.832) for 30-day mortality and outperformed several benchmark scores.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this retrospective cohort study, SERP had better prediction performance than existing triage scores while maintaining easy implementation and ease of ascertainment in the ED. It has the potential to be widely applied and validated in different circumstances and health care settings.

TI  - Bowel perforation secondary to illegally induced abortion: a tertiary hospital experience in Tanzania
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB  - Background: Bowel perforation though rarely reported is a serious complication of induced abortion, which is often performed illegally by persons without any medical training in developing countries. A sudden increase in the number of patients in our centre in recent years prompted the authors to analyze this problem. The study was conducted to describe our own experiences in the surgical management of these patients.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study involving patients who were jointly managed by the surgical and gynecological teams at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) for bowel perforation secondary to illegally induced abortion from January 2002 to December 2011. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0.
   Results: A total of 68 patients (representing 4.2% of cases) were enrolled in the study. Their ages ranged from 14 to 45 years with a median age of 21 years. Majority of patients were, secondary school students/leavers (70.6%), unmarried (88.2%), nulliparous (80.9%), unemployed (82.4%) and most of them were dependent member of the family. Previous history of contraceptive use was reported in only 14.7% of cases. The majority of patients (79.4%) had procured the abortion in the 2nd trimester. Dilatation and curettage (82.4%) was the most common reported method used in procuring abortion. The interval from termination of pregnancy to presentation in hospital ranged from 1 to 14 days (median 6 days). The ileum (51.5%) and sigmoid colon (22.1%) was the most common portions of the bowel affected. Resection and anastomosis with uterine repair was the most common (86.8%) surgical procedure performed. Complication and mortality rates were 47.1% and 10.3% respectively. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, gestational age at termination of pregnancy, delayed presentation, delayed surgical treatment and presence of complications were significantly associated with mortality (P < 0.001). The overall median length of hospital stay (LOS) was 18 days (1 day to 128 days). Patients who developed complications stayed longer in the hospital, and this was statistically significant (P = 0.012).
   Conclusion: Bowel perforation following illegally induced abortion is still rampant in our environment and constitutes significantly to high maternal morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of the diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation and early institution of surgical management is of paramount importance if morbidity and mortality associated with bowel perforation are to be avoided.

TI  - OUTCOME AND PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME IN PEDIATRIC SUBMERSION VICTIMS RECEIVING PREHOSPITAL CARE IN KING-COUNTY, WASHINGTON
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims treated by Seattle and King County''s prehospital emergency services were studied. Victims less than 20 years old were identified from hospital admissions and paramedic and medical examiners'' reports. The proportion of fatal or severe outcomes in patients were compared with various risk factors. Of 135 patients, 45 died and 5 had severe neurologic impairment. A subset of 38 victims found in cardiopulmonary arrest had a 32% survival rate, with  67% of survivors unimpaired or only mildly impaired. The two risk factors that occurred most commonly in victims who died or were severely impaired were submersion duration greater than 9 minutes (28 patients) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration longer than 25 minutes (20 patients). Both factors were ascertained in the prehospital phase of care. Submersion duration was associated with a steadily increasing risk of severe or fatal outcomes: 10% risk (7/67) for 0 to 5 minutes, 56% risk  (5/9) for 6 to 9 minutes, 88% risk (21/25) for 10 to 25 minutes, 100% risk (4/4) for >25 minutes. None of 20 children receiving >25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation escaped death or severe neurologic impairment. Our rates for saving all victims, particularly victims in cardiopulmonary arrest, are considerably higher than has been reported before for children. Prompt prehospital advanced cardiac life support is the most effective means of medical intervention for the pediatric  submersion victim. Prehospital information provided the most valuable predictors of outcome.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Less vs. More Frequent Hydrocortisone Dosing in Septic Shock
T2  - CRITICAL CARE EXPLORATIONS
AB  - OBJECTIVES:Guidelines recommend hydrocortisone as an adjunctive treatment in septic shock, but the optimal dosing regimen is unknown. A national shortage of hydrocortisone in 2023 prompted a change in institutional practice for hydrocortisone administration from 50 mg every 6 hours to 100 mg every 12 hours in an effort to reduce waste and conserve vials, creating an opportunity to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these two regimens. The primary efficacy outcome was time to shock resolution, and secondary outcomes evaluated in this study were mortality, renal replacement therapy (RRT), medication costs, and maximum vasopressor dose attained.DESIGN:Single-center, retrospective cohort study.SETTING:ICUs in a quaternary academic medical center.PATIENTS:Adult patients admitted to an ICU with septic shock, defined by mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg despite adequate fluid resuscitation and need for vasopressor infusion, who were treated with hydrocortisone for shock between October 24, 2022, and October 12, 2023.INTERVENTIONS:Treatment with hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours or 100 mg every 12 hours.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:One hundred thirty-eight patients were included in this retrospective chart review from October 24, 2022, to October 12, 2023. Data for 61 patients in the 50 mg every 6 hours group and 77 patients in the 100 mg every 12 hours group were collected and analyzed. In adjusted competing risk models, hydrocortisone regimen was not associated with differences in time to shock resolution (sub-hazard ratio [sub-HR] 0.95 [95% CI, 0.59-1.54]), ICU mortality (sub-HR 1.59; 95% CI, 0.89-2.84), in-hospital mortality (1.35; 95% CI, 0.81-2.26), or time to RRT (sub-HR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.45-2.31). In addition, the hydrocortisone dose regimen was not associated with differences in maximum vasopressor dose attained (mean difference in norepinephrine equivalent, 0.16 mu g/kg/min; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.58 mu g/kg/min). The less frequent dosing resulted in cost savings of $446.10 (95% CI, 253.95-638.25) per patient treated with the more intensive but less frequent hydrocortisone dosing regimen.CONCLUSIONS:A less frequent hydrocortisone dosing regimen was not associated with differences in time to shock resolution. Studies of the comparative effectiveness of different corticosteroid dosing regimens for septic shock are needed.

TI  - Improving Sepsis Outcomes in the Era of Pay-for-Performance and Electronic Quality Measures: A Joint IDSA/ACEP/PIDS/SHEA/SHM/SIDP Position Paper
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Management Bundle (SEP-1) as a pay-for-reporting measure in 2015 and is now planning to make it a pay-for-performance measure by incorporating it into the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. This joint IDSA/ACEP/PIDS/SHEA/SHM/SIPD position paper highlights concerns with this change. Multiple studies indicate that SEP-1 implementation was associated with increased broad-spectrum antibiotic use, lactate measurements, and aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients with suspected sepsis but not with decreased mortality rates. Increased focus on SEP-1 risks further diverting attention and resources from more effective measures and comprehensive sepsis care. We recommend retiring SEP-1 rather than using it in a payment model and shifting instead to new sepsis metrics that focus on patient outcomes. CMS is developing a community-onset sepsis 30-day mortality electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) that is an important step in this direction. The eCQM preliminarily identifies sepsis using systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, antibiotic administrations or diagnosis codes for infection or sepsis, and clinical indicators of acute organ dysfunction. We support the eCQM but recommend removing SIRS criteria and diagnosis codes to streamline implementation, decrease variability between hospitals, maintain vigilance for patients with sepsis but without SIRS, and avoid promoting antibiotic use in uninfected patients with SIRS. We further advocate for CMS to harmonize the eCQM with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Adult Sepsis Event surveillance metric to promote unity in federal measures, decrease reporting burden for hospitals, and facilitate shared prevention initiatives. These steps will result in a more robust measure that will encourage hospitals to pay more attention to the full breadth of sepsis care, stimulate new innovations in diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately bring us closer to our shared goal of improving outcomes for patients.
   This multidisciplinary position paper describes why the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) should retire the Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure rather than make it pay-for-performance and provides recommendations to improve CMS's planned electronic sepsis mortality measure.

TI  - Antiseptics for burns
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Burn wounds cause high levels of morbidity and mortality worldwide. People with burns are particularly vulnerable to infections; over 75% of all burn deaths (after initial resuscitation) result from infection. Antiseptics are topical agents that act to prevent growth of micro-organisms. A wide range are used with the intention of preventing infection and promoting healing of burn wounds.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects and safety of antiseptics for the treatment of burns in any care setting.
   Search methods
   In September 2016 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OvidMEDLINE, OvidMEDLINE (In-Process& OtherNon-IndexedCitations), OvidEmbase, andEBSCOCINAHL. We also searched three clinical trials registries and references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language, date of publication or study setting.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any burn wound and assessed the use of a topical treatment with antiseptic properties.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction.
   Main results
   We included 56 RCTs with 5807 randomised participants. Almost all trials had poorly reported methodology, meaning that it is unclear whether they were at high risk of bias. In many cases the primary review outcomes, wound healing and infection, were not reported, or were reported incompletely.
   Most trials enrolled people with recent burns, described as second-degree and less than 40% of total body surface area; most participants were adults. Antiseptic agents assessed were: silver-based, honey, Aloe Vera, iodine-based, chlorhexidine or polyhexanide (biguanides), sodium hypochlorite, merbromin, ethacridine lactate, cerium nitrate and Arnebia euchroma. Most studies compared antiseptic with a topical antibiotic, primarily silver sulfadiazine (SSD); others compared antiseptic with a non-antibacterial treatment or another antiseptic. Most evidence was assessed as low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, often in single studies.
   Antiseptics versus topical antibiotics
   Compared with the topical antibiotic, SSD, there is low certainty evidence that, on average, there is no clear difference in the hazard of healing (chance of healing over time), between silver-based antiseptics and SSD (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67; I-2 = 0%; 3 studies; 259 participants); silver-based antiseptics may, on average, increase the number of healing events over 21 or 28 days' follow-up (RR 1.17 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37; I-2 = 45%; 5 studies; 408 participants) and may, on average, reduce mean time to healing (difference in means -3.33 days; 95% CI -4.96 to -1.70; I-2 = 87%; 10 studies; 979 participants).
   There is moderate certainty evidence that, on average, burns treated with honey are probably more likely to heal over time compared with topical antibiotics (HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.52; I-2 = 66%; 5 studies; 140 participants).
   There is low certainty evidence from single trials that sodium hypochlorite may, on average, slightly reduce mean time to healing compared with SSD (difference in means -2.10 days, 95% CI -3.87 to -0.33, 10 participants (20 burns)) as may merbromin compared with zinc sulfadiazine (difference in means -3.48 days, 95% CI -6.85 to -0.11, 50 relevant participants). Other comparisons with low or very low certainty evidence did not find clear differences between groups.
   Most comparisons did not report data on infection. Based on the available data we cannot be certain if antiseptic treatments increase or reduce the risk of infection compared with topical antibiotics (very low certainty evidence).
   Antiseptics versus alternative antiseptics
   There may be some reduction in mean time to healing for wounds treated with povidone iodine compared with chlorhexidine (MD 2.21 days, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.08). Other evidence showed no clear differences and is of low or very low certainty.
   Antiseptics versus non-antibacterial comparators
   We found high certainty evidence that treating burns with honey, on average, reduced mean times to healing in comparison with non-antibacterial treatments (difference in means -5.3 days, 95% CI -6.30 to -4.34; I-2 = 71%; 4 studies; 1156 participants) but this comparison included some unconventional treatments such as amniotic membrane and potato peel. There is moderate certainty evidence that honey probably also increases the likelihood of wounds healing over time compared to unconventional anti-bacterial treatments (HR 2.86, 95% C 1.60 to 5.11; I-2 = 50%; 2 studies; 154 participants).
   There is moderate certainty evidence that, on average, burns treated with nanocrystalline silver dressings probably have a slightly shorter mean time to healing than those treated with Vaseline gauze (difference in means -3.49 days, 95% CI -4.46 to -2.52; I-2 = 0%; 2 studies, 204 participants), but low certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference in numbers of healing events at 14 days between burns treated with silver xenograft or paraffin gauze (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.16 1 study; 32 participants). Other comparisons represented low or very low certainty evidence.
   It is uncertain whether infection rates in burns treated with either silver-based antiseptics or honey differ compared with non-antimicrobial treatments (very low certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in infection rates between an iodine-based treatment compared with moist exposed burn ointment (moderate certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether infection rates differ for SSD plus cerium nitrate, compared with SSD alone (low certainty evidence).
   Mortality was low where reported. Most comparisons provided low certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between many treatments. There may be fewer deaths in groups treated with cerium nitrate plus SSD compared with SSD alone (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; I-2 = 0%, 2 studies, 214 participants) (low certainty evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   It was often uncertain whether antiseptics were associated with any difference in healing, infections, or other outcomes. Where there is moderate or high certainty evidence, decision makers need to consider the applicability of the evidence from the comparison to their patients. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias.

TI  - Hypothermia for refractory status epilepticus
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction Status epilepticus (SE) can be refractory to conventional anticonvulsants, requiring anesthetic doses of medications to suppress seizures. This approach carries significant morbidity, is associated with a high fatality rate, and may not always control SE. Hypothermia has been shown to suppress epileptiform activity experimentally, but has not previously been used as a primary modality to control SE in humans.
   Methods Four patients with SE refractory to benzodiazepine and/or barbiturate infusions were treated with hypothermia (target temperature: 31-35 degrees C) using an endovascular cooling system. All received continuous EEG monitoring, three were on midazolam infusions and one had recurrent seizures on weaning from pentobarbital.
   Results Therapeutic hypothermia was successful in aborting seizure activity in all four patients, allowing midazolam infusions to be discontinued; three achieved a burst-suppression pattern on EEG. After controlled rewarming, two patients remained seizure-free, and all four demonstrated a marked reduction in seizure frequency. Adverse events included shivering, coagulopathy without bleeding, and venous thromboembolism. Two death occurred, neither directly related to hypothermia; however, immunosuppression related to the use of barbiturates and hypothermia may have contributed to an episode of fatal sepsis in one patient.
   Conclusions Hypothermia was able to suppress seizure activity in patients with SE refractory to traditional therapies with minimal morbidity. It appears promising as an alternative or an adjunct to anesthetic doses of other agents, but requires further study to better evaluate its safety and efficacy.

TI  - Bereavement-Related Needs and Their Relation to Mental Health Symptoms Among Adults Bereaved by Suicide and Fatal Overdose
T2  - JOURNAL OF LOSS & TRAUMA
AB  - Despite the high prevalence of suicide and fatal overdose, and the morbidity associated with these forms of bereavement, little is known about the loss-related needs of adults bereaved by these two causes, including whether survivors' needs differ from those losing significant persons to other forms of sudden death and how these needs may relate to psychiatric symptomatology. Using a newly validated measure (the Sudden Bereavement Needs Inventory) and an online survey design, the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of adults (N = 403) who have experienced the suicide or fatal overdose of a close other within the past five years, to compare these needs with those of individuals bereaved by a sudden natural death, and to explore how the importance of specific need categories relates to psychiatric symptomatology. Results showed great overlap between adults bereaved by suicide and fatal overdose across all bereavement need categories, with notable differences between these two groups and those bereaved by a sudden-natural loss (e.g., cardiac arrest). Further, among the suicide and overdose bereaved, the self-rated importance of specific need categories accounted for much of the variation in symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression, with relational needs and meaning-based needs emerging as most strongly related to psychiatric symptoms. Study results may suggest the importance of addressing specific needs in therapy among overdose and suicide bereaved individuals to promote adaptive outcomes.

TI  - Ischemia - Reperfusion injury: A roadmap to precision therapies
T2  - MOLECULAR ASPECTS OF MEDICINE
AB  - Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is prevalent in the medical field and significantly limits the therapeutic outcomes of various ischemic diseases, adversely affecting patient prognosis. The pathogenesis of I/R injury is highly complex, involving intricate interactions among oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and multiple cell death pathways. Once the mitochondrial respiratory chain is impaired, it triggers oxidative stress responses, leading to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS not only directly damage cells but also activate inflammatory responses and initiate multiple cell death signalling pathways, such as necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, thereby exacerbating tissue damage. Moreover, the clinical manifestations of I/R injury vary significantly across different organs, such as the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and lungs, and are further influenced by patients' underlying conditions, posing challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, constructing a comprehensive assessment system based on individual patient characteristics (such as genetic polymorphisms and comorbidities) to accurately predict the risk of I/R injury is particularly important. Currently, there are diverse strategies for the prevention and treatment of I/R injury, but translating basic research into clinical application remains challenging. Developing personalized treatment plans tailored to different cell types holds promise for overcoming existing therapeutic bottlenecks, significantly improving patient outcomes, and providing new directions for addressing the challenges of I/R injury.

TI  - The Massive Transfusion Score as a decision aid for resuscitation: Learning when to turn the massive transfusion protocol on and off
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND Previous work proposed a Massive Transfusion Score (MTS) calculated from values obtained in the emergency department to predict likelihood of massive transfusion (MT). We hypothesized the MTS could be used at Hour 6 to differentiate who continues to require balanced resuscitation in Hours 7 to 24 and to predict death at 28 days.
   METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients in whom the MT protocol was initiated from 2005 to 2011. Data including timing of blood products were determined at Hours 0, 6, 12, and 24. For each patient, transfusion needs were defined based on either an inappropriately low hemoglobin response to transfusion or a hemoglobin decrease of greater than 1 g/dL if no transfusion. Timing and cause of death were used to account for survivor bias. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of outcome.
   RESULTS A total of 190 MT protocol activations were included, and by Hour 6, 61% required 10 U or greater packed red blood cells. Calculated at initial presentation, a revised MTS (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, base deficit 6, temperature < 35.5 degrees C, international normalized ratio > 1.5, hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) was superior to the original MTS (including heart rate 120 beats per minute, Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma [FAST] status, mechanism) or the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score for predicting MT (area under the curve [AUC] MT at 6 hours, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.79; at 24 hours, 0.72; 0.61-0.83; p < 0.05). For those alive at Hour 6, the revised MTS was predictive of future packed red blood cell need (AUC, 0.87) in Hours 7 to 12, 24-hour mortality (AUC, 0.95), and 28-day mortality (AUC, 0.77). For each additional positive trigger of the MTS at Hour 6, the odds of death at 24 hours and 28 days were substantially increased (24-hour odds ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.3-9.3; 28-day odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.2; p < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSION Early end points of resuscitation adopted from the components of the revised MTS are predictive of ongoing transfusion. Failure to normalize these components by Hour 6 portends a particularly poor prognosis.

TI  - Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy for Mild Heart Failure. The Time Has Come
T2  - REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - Current guidelines recommend cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), previously known as biventricular pacing, in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] <= 35%), QRS prolongation (>= 120 ms), and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure (HF). These recommendations come after multiple prospective, randomized trials demonstrated the benefits of CRT in advanced HF that included > 6000 subjects. These initial trials targeted secondary prevention in the highest-risk cohorts, which was similar to the development of many other cardiovascular therapies. Such examples include implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy initially used only for cardiac arrest survivors or lipid lowering therapy restricted to use after myocardial infarction. Today a majority of patients receive these therapies as primary prevention. Thus, it is logical and not surprising that a therapy as successful as CRT would be evaluated in subjects with mild HF. Two such 1, studies were published recently: the Resynchronization Reverses Remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction (REVERSE) study and the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT).
   Taken together, these trials randomized 2430 subjects with NYHA class I or II HF to CRT or to no CRT The results show beneficial effects of CRT very similar to those observed for severe HF cohorts. Specifically, this therapy improves functional status, reduces HF hospitalizations, and promotes reverse remodeling. The results from REVERSE and MADIT-CRT provide strong, new support to expand the use of CRT to all, patients with HF and a wide QRS.

TI  - J-wave syndromes. From cell to bedside
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
CP  - Conference of the International-Society-for-Computerized-Electrocardiology
AB  - The J wave, a deflection that follows the QRS complex of the surface electrocardiogram, is usually partially buried in the R wave in humans, appearing as a J-point elevation. An early repolarization (ER) pattern characterized by J-point elevation, slurring of the terminal part of the QRS, and ST-segment elevation has long been recognized and considered to be totally benign. Recent studies have presented evidence demonstrating that an ER pattern in inferior leads or inferolateral leads is associated with increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias, named early repolarization syndrome. Early repolarization syndrome and Brugada syndrome share similar electrocardiographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, risk factors, as well as a common arrhythmic platform related to amplification of I-to-mediated J waves. Although Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome differ with respect to the magnitude and lead location of abnormal J wave manifestation, they can be considered to represent a continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression, termed J-wave syndromes. Early repolarization syndrome has been proposed to be divided into 3 subtypes: type 1, displaying an ER pattern predominantly in the lateral precordial leads, is prevalent among healthy male athletes and rarely seen in ventricular fibrillation survivors; type 2, displaying an ER pattern predominantly in the inferior or inferolateral leads, is associated with a higher level of risk; whereas type 3, displaying an ER pattern globally in the inferior, lateral, and right precordial leads, is associated with the highest level of risk for development of malignant arrhythmias and is often associated with ventricular fibrillation storms.

TI  - Hypothermia for acute ischemic stroke: Not just another neuroprotectant
T2  - NEUROLOGIST
AB  - Background: Based on empirical experience, hypothermia has long been known to be a potent putative neuroprotectant. Recent insights into the mechanisms of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion suggest reasons why hypothermia may be an ideal modality for extending the time window for thrombolytic stroke therapy.
   Review Summary: Hypothermia protects brain tissue from the effects of ischemia in multiple ways. It retards energy depletion, reduces intracellular acidosis, and lessens the ischemic overdose of excitatory neurotransmitters. This attenuates the influx of intracellular calcium, the herald of subsequent neuronal death. Additionally, hypothermia suppresses synthesis of oxygen free radicals involved in secondary damage associated with reperfusion. It also suppresses the mechanisms related to blood-brain barrier degeneration and postischemic remodeling. Animal and human data shows that deep hypothermia is primarily protective and is used in several cardiothoracic and neurosurgical applications and that mild hypothermia enhances recovery after focal and global ischemic brain injuries. Preliminary data on hypothermia in human stroke also show promising potential.
   Current methods of instituting hypothermia, including patient selection, temperature and timing, cooling methods, and complications are reviewed in detail.
   Conclusions: Neuroprotection conferred by mild to moderate hypothermia is likely to undergo phase III clinical trials in various clinical settings. Novel technology promises a broad application even outside intensive care settings. Preliminary studies suggest that mild to moderate hypothermia is a useful adjunct to thrombolytic therapy for stroke. Timing, degree, and duration rules are being developed and methods of cooling further perfected to optimize the safety and efficacy of this promising approach.

TI  - BLUNT TRAUMATIC CARDIAC RUPTURE - A 5-YEAR EXPERIENCE
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
AB  - Blunt traumatic cardiac rupture is associated with a high rate of mortality. A review of the computerized trauma registry (1983 to 1988) identified 32 patients with this injury (ages 19 to 65 years; mean age, 39.5 years; 21 men and 11 women). Twenty-one patients (65.6%) were injured in vehicular crashes, 3 (9.4%) in pedestrian accidents, 3 (9.4%) in motorcycle accidents; 3 (9.4%) sustained crush injury; 1 (3.1%) was injured by a fall; and 1 (3.1%) was kicked in the chest by a horse. Anatomic  injuries included right atrial rupture (13 [40.6%]), left atrial rupture (8 [25%]), right ventricular rupture (10 [31.3%]), left ventricular rupture (4 [12.5%]), and rupture of two cardiac chambers (3 [9.4%]). Diagnosis was made by thoracotomy in all 20 patients presenting in cardiac arrest. In the remaining 12 patients, the diagnosis was established in seven by emergency left anterolateral thoracotomy and in five by subxyphoid pericardial window. Seven of these 12 patients (58.3%) had clinical cardiac tamponade and significant upper torso cyanosis. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS), Trauma Score (TS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were 33.8, 13.2, and 14.3, respectively, among survivors and 51.5, 8.3, and 7.0 for nonsurvivors. The overall mortality rate was 81.3% (26 of 32 patients), the only survivors being those presenting with vital signs (6 of 12 patients [50%]). All patients with rupture of two cardiac chambers or with ventricular rupture died. The mortality  rate from myocardial rupture is very high. Rapid prehospital transportation, a high index of suspicion, and prompt surgical intervention contribute to survival in these patients.

TI  - Multimodal approaches supporting the diagnosis, prognosis and investigation of neural correlates of disorders of consciousness: A systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The limits of the standard, behaviour-based clinical assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) prompted the employment of functional neuroimaging, neurometabolic, neurophysiological and neurostimulation techniques, to detect brain-based covert markers of awareness. However, uni-modal approaches, consisting in employing just one of those techniques, are usually not sufficient to provide an exhaustive exploration of the neural underpinnings of residual awareness. This systematic review aimed at collecting the evidence from studies employing a multimodal approach, that is, combining more instruments to complement DoC diagnosis, prognosis and better investigating their neural correlates. Following the PRISMA guidelines, records from PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus were screened to select peer-review original articles in which a multi-modal approach was used for the assessment of adult patients with a diagnosis of DoC. Ninety-two observational studies and 32 case reports or case series met the inclusion criteria. Results highlighted a diagnostic and prognostic advantage of multi-modal approaches that involve electroencephalography-based (EEG-based) measurements together with neuroimaging or neurometabolic data or with neurostimulation. Multimodal assessment deepened the knowledge on the neural networks underlying consciousness, by showing correlations between the integrity of the default mode network and the different clinical diagnosis of DoC. However, except for studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography, the integration of more than one technique in most of the cases occurs without an a priori-designed multi-modal diagnostic approach. Our review supports the feasibility and underlines the advantages of a multimodal approach for the diagnosis, prognosis and for the investigation of neural correlates of DoCs.

TI  - Prognostic Value of Brain Diffusion-Weighted Imaging after Cardiac Arrest
T2  - ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Objective: Outcome prediction is challenging in comatose postcardiac arrest survivors. We assessed the Feasibility and prognostic utility of brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, (DWI) during the First week.
   Methods: Consecutive comatose postcardiac arrest patients were prospectively enrolled, AWI data of patients who met pre-defined specific prognostic criteria were used to determine distinguishing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds. Group I criteria were death at 6 months and absent motor response or absent pupillary reflexes or bilateral absent cortical responses at 72 hours or vegetative at I month. Group 2 criterion was survival at 6 months with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4 or 5 (group 2A) or 3 (group 2B). The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated at 50 X 10(-6) mm(2)/sec intervals.
   Results: Overall, 86% of patients underwent DWI. Fifty-one patients with 62 brain DWIs were included. Forty patients met the specific prognostic criteria. The percentage of brain volume with in ADC value less than 650 to 700 X 10(-6) mm(2)/sec best differentiated between Group I and Groups 2A and 2B combined (p < 0.001), whereas the 400 to 450 X 10(-6) mm(2)/sec threshold best differentiated between Groups 2A and 2B (p = 0.003). The ideal time window for prognostication using DWI was between 49 arid 108 hours after the arrest. When comparing DWI in this time window with the 72-hour neurological examination, DWI improved the sensitivity for predicting Poor outcome by 38% while maintaining 100% specificity (p 0.021).

TI  - Early repolarization is associated with symptoms in patients with type 1 and type 2 long QT syndrome
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND Early repolarization (ER) is associated with an increased risk for death from cardiac causes. Recent evidence supports ER's role as a modifier and/or predictor of risk in many cardiac conditions.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of ER among genotype-positive patients with long QT syndrome (LOTS) and evaluate its utility in predicting the risk of symptoms.
   METHODS ER was defined as QRS slurring and/or notching associated with >= 1-mV QRS-ST junction (3-point) elevation in at least 2 contiguous leads, excluding the anterior precordial leads. The ECG with the most prominent ER was used for analysis. Major ER was defined as >= 2-mm 3-point elevation. Symptoms of LOTS included cardiac syncope, documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and resuscitated cardiac arrest.
   RESULTS One hundred thirteen patients (mean age 41 +/- 19 years; 63 female) were reviewed, among whom 414 (mean 3.7 +/- 1.5) ECGs were analyzed. Of these, 30 patients (27%) with a history of symptoms. Fifty patients (44%) had ER, and 19 patients (17%) had major ER. Patients with major ER were not different from patients without major ER with respect to age, sex, long QT type, longest QTc recorded, number of patients with QTc >500 ms, or use of betablockade. Univariate and independent predictors of symptom status included the presence of major ER, longest QTc recorded >500 ms, and female sex.
   CONCLUSION ER > 2 mm was the strongest independent predictor of symptom status related to LOTS, along with female sex and QTc >500 ms.

TI  - Substitution of artificial colloids for fresh frozen plasma in pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass surgery
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
AB  - BackgroundIn many centers, fresh frozen plasma is generally used as the main component of pump prime in pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass. However, many factors have resulted in stringent control of plasma transfusion and prompted the study of safe and efficient substitutes.
   AimsThe aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a priming strategy with gelatin during cardiopulmonary bypass in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery and identify the factors associated with postoperative chest-tube drainage.
   MethodsWe reviewed 1164 pediatric patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between January 2012 and April 2013 in Fuwai hospital. Infants and children were primed with different types of solution: plasma or gelatin. Clinical data included postoperative coagulation function (pharmacological agents, chest-tube drainage, and transfusion requirements), recovery indicators (mechanical ventilator time, ICU stay and hospital stay), incidence of in-hospital mortality, and morbidity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify factors correlated with postoperative chest-tube drainage.
   ResultsNo difference in mortality or morbidity was found between the plasma and gelatin groups. In infants, increased chest-tube drainage (postoperation 12 hours, median difference -0.046 ml/kg/hr, 95%CI: -0.105 to -0.007, P = 0.001; postoperation 24 hours, median difference -0.047 ml/kg/hr, 95%CI: -0.081 to -0.025, P < 0.001), and decreased transfusion (red blood cell, median difference 0.00 ml/kg/hr, 95%CI: 0.000-100, P < 0.001; fresh frozen plasma, median difference 5.556 ml/kg/hr, 95%CI: 2.30-8.333, P = 0.001), and recovery time (mechanical ventilator time, median difference 3.00 hours, 95%CI: 1.00-5.500, P < 0.001; ICU stay, median difference 17.00 hours, 95%CI: 1.00-22.000, P = 0.001; hospital stay, median difference 1.00 day, 95%CI: 0.00-2.000, P = 0.038) were demonstrated in the gelatin group. In children, the transfusion requirements (red blood cell, median difference 100 ml, P < 0.001;fresh frozen plasma, median difference 1.11 ml/kg, 95%CI: 0.000-2.42, P = 0.001) were decreased in the gelatin group. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the type of priming solution ( = 1.940,95%CI: 1.057-2.823,P < 0.001), bypass time ( = 0.024, 95%CI: 0.013-0.036, P < 0.001), and age ( = -0.257, 95%CI: -0.422 to -0.09, P = 0.002) were independent variables correlating with chest-tube drainage in infants.
   ConclusionIn the general pediatric patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, substitution of gelatin for fresh frozen plasma in cardiopulmonary bypass is feasible.

TI  - Lactate clearance as a prognostic marker of mortality in severely ill febrile children in East Africa
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Hyperlactataemia (HL) is a biomarker of disease severity that predicts mortality in patients with sepsis and malaria. Lactate clearance (LC) during resuscitation has been shown to be a prognostic factor of survival in critically ill adults, but little data exist for African children living in malaria-endemic areas.
   Methods: In a secondary data analysis of severely ill febrile children included in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) resuscitation trial, we assessed the association between lactate levels at admission and LC at 8 h with all-cause mortality at 72 h (d72). LC was defined as a relative lactate decline >= 40% and/or lactate normalisation (lactate < 2.5 mmol/L).
   Results: Of 3170 children in the FEAST trial, including 1719 children (57%) with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, 3008 (95%) had a baseline lactate measurement, 2127 (71%) had HL (lactate >= 2.5 mmol/L), and 1179 (39%) had severe HL (>= 5 mmol/L). Within 72 h, 309 children (10.3%) died, of whom 284 (92%) had baseline HL. After adjustment for potential confounders, severe HL was strongly associated with mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 6.96; 95% CI 3.52, 13.76, p < 0.001). This association was not modified by malaria status, despite children with malaria having a higher baseline lactate (median 4.6 mmol/L vs 3 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and a lower mortality rate (OR = 0.42; p < 0.001) compared to non-malarial cases. Sensitivity and specificity analysis identified a higher lactate on admission cut-off value predictive of d72 for children with malaria (5.2 mmol/L)than for those with other febrile illnesses (3.4 mmol/L). At 8 h, 2748/3008 survivors (91%) had a lactate measured, 1906 (63%) of whom had HL on admission, of whom 1014 (53%) fulfilled pre-defined LC criteria. After adjustment for confounders, LC independently predicted survival after 8 h (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.14, 0.42; p < 0.001). Absence of LC (< 10%) at 8 h was strongly associated with death at 72 h (OR 4. 62; 95% CI 2.7, 8.0; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Independently of the underlying diagnosis, HL is a strong risk factor for death at 72 h in children admitted with severe febrile illnesses in Africa. Children able to clear lactate within 8 h had an improved chance of survival. These findings prompt the more widespread use of lactate and LC to identify children with severe disease and monitor response to treatment.

TI  - Emergency department thoracotomy: Survival of the least expected
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Although emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is often considered a controversial "last chance" method of resuscitation, we hypothesized that EDT performed in a busy urban Level I trauma center has significant salvage rates despite the absence of traditional survival predictors. A retrospective review revealed that 180 patients underwent EDT after traumatic arrest for penetrating injury between 2000 and 2005. All were deemed nonsalvageable by other resuscitation methods. Injury mechanism and location, signs of life (SOLs), initial cardiac rhythm, and presence of vital signs were analyzed. In total, 23 patients survived hospitalization neurologically intact. Compared to nonsurvivors, survivors more often suffered multiple stab wounds (21.7% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.001), presented with field (95.7% vs. 72.6%, p = 0.016) and ED (87.0% vs. 60.5%, p = 0.014) SOLs, had sustainable cardiac rhythms (sinus tachycardia, 43.5% vs. 10.2%, p = 0.001; normal sinus rhythm, 17.4% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.037), and had measurable vital signs (65.2% vs. 25.5%; p = 0.001). However, only 3 of 23 (13.0%) survivors had all survival predictors, and one survivor had none. Frequent predictors in survivors were field SOLs (95.7%), ED SOLs (87.0%), salvageable initial cardiac rhythms (78.3%), and obtainable vital signs (65.2%). Stabbing mechanism (30.4%) and cardiac injury location (30.4%) were least common. Had a strict policy of EDT performance based solely on the presence of survival predictors been followed and EDT withheld, several patients who ultimately survived would have died. Our study suggests that EDT is a technique that should be utilized for patients with critical penetrating injuries even in the absence of many traditional survival predictors.

TI  - The challenges of prompt identification and resuscitation in children with acute fulminant myocarditis: case series and review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
AB  - Aim:
   To describe the clinical presentation, triage, resuscitation and outcome of acute fulminant myocarditis in children presenting to district hospitals and referred for cardiac intensive care.
   Methods:
   Case series describing five patients (from 2 weeks to 12 years old) with a diagnosis of acute fulminant myocarditis, presented to outlying hospitals between December 2006 and December 2007 and retrieved to a cardiac intensive care unit.
   Results:
   All children were admitted with non-specific symptoms such as vomiting, cough and poor feeding to their local hospital, where various provisional diagnoses such as viral gastroenteritis, bronchitis or renal failure were considered. Acute physiological deterioration usually prompted the referral for intensive care. Two children died at the referring hospital during stabilisation by the retrieval team. Three children survived transport to intensive care and to hospital discharge; two received mechanical support and one underwent urgent orthotopic heart transplantation. Enterovirus and parvovirus were identified as causative agents in two patients. In one case, macrophage activation syndrome was diagnosed although no clear viral trigger was identified. Median length of hospitalisation among survivors was 33 days, and mechanical cardiac support was required for a median of 12 days.
   Conclusions:
   The diagnosis and initial management of acute fulminant myocarditis is extremely challenging. Prognosis for patients admitted to a cardiac centre for early mechanical support can be very favourable, while a delay in considering the diagnosis may result in poor outcome. The diagnosis of myocarditis should be considered in any previously well child presenting with a viral prodrome and non-specific organ dysfunction associated with dysrhythmias, shock or acute heart failure, even in the absence of cardiomegaly.

TI  - Early medical care and trauma management in mass casualties from major explosive accidents: a retrospective analysis and recommendations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of mass casualties resulting from major explosive accidents and to identify the shortcomings in the management of such casualties during sudden explosive events.Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from a gas explosion at a cafeteria in a district of Southwest China. Key treatment measures, including injury assessments, early triage, timing of surgeries, hospital stay duration, and complications, were systematically collected and analyzed.Results The explosion resulted in 16 fatalities at the scene and 10 survivors, all of whom received prompt triage, classification, transportation, and effective treatment. Among the survivors, two were male and eight were female, aged 26-50 years, with an average age of 39 years. The on-site mortality rate was 61.5%. Among the survivors, one patient with severe traumatic brain injury died 11 days post-incident despite medical intervention, while another was rehospitalized due to the recurrence of a pre-existing chronic condition. Three patients experienced varying degrees of hearing loss upon discharge, with one also reporting intermittent tinnitus. Four patients showed improvement and were discharged.Conclusion The on-site mortality rate in mass casualties from major explosions is extremely high, and the injuries are often complex. Current early triage methods are limited and overly simplistic. The incidence of pulmonary injuries is high in explosive accidents, with rapid disease progression and elevated mortality. Timely identification of blast injuries and continuous monitoring of injury progression are critical to preventing further exacerbation of traumatic brain injuries and other organ damage. Strengthening regional trauma care infrastructure is essential for reducing preventable deaths.

TI  - Relationship of Serum and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers With Intracranial Hypertension and Cerebral Hypoperfusion After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background: There is little that can be done to treat or reverse the primary injury that occurs at the time of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Initial management of the patient with severe TBI focuses on prevention of subsequent secondary insults, namely, intracranial hypertension (ICH) and cerebral hypoperfusion (CH). Currently, there is no reliable way to predict which patients will develop ICH and CH other than clinical acumen; therefore, indicators of impending secondary intracranial insults may be useful in predicting these events and allowing for prevention and early intervention. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship of cytokine levels with intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with severe TBI.
   Methods: Patients at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center were prospectively enrolled for a 6-month period. Inclusion criteria were older than 17 years, admission within the first 6 hours after injury, Glasgow Coma Scale <9 on admission, and placement of a clinically indicated ICP monitor. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid, when available, were collected on admission and twice daily for 7 days. Cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were analyzed by multiplex bead array assays. Hourly values for ICP and CPP were recorded, and means, minimum (for CPP) or maximum (for ICP) values, percentage time ICP >20 mm Hg (% ICP20) and CPP <60 mm Hg (% CPP60), and cumulative Pressure Times Time Dose (PTD; mm Hg . h) for ICP >20 mm Hg (PTD ICP20) and CPP <60 mm Hg (PTD CPP60) were compared with the serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels that were drawn before 12-hour time periods (PRE) and after 12-hour time periods (POST) of monitoring.
   Results: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. In-hospital mortality was 12.5%, and good functional outcome was noted in 58%. Two hundred and seventy-five serum samples were taken and analyzed. IL-6 levels in the serum were found in the highest concentration of the cytokines measured. PTD ICP20 and PTD CPP60 were moderately correlated with increased PRE IL-8 levels (r = 0.34, p < 0.001; r = 0.53, p < 0.001). PTD ICP20 was also correlated with PRE TNF-alpha levels (r = 0.27, p < 0.001) as was PTD CPP60 (r = 0.25, p < 0.001). POST IL-8 levels were found to be correlated with PTD ICP20 (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and PTD CPP60 (r = 0.54, p < 0.001). POST TNF-alpha was associated with PTD ICP20 (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). PTD CPP60 was also moderately correlated with POST TNF-alpha levels (r = 0.26, p < 0.001). When comparing patients with good versus poor outcome, median daily serum IL-8 levels were associated with poor outcome.
   Conclusions: IL-8 and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha demonstrated the most promise in this study to be candidate serum markers of impending ICH and CH. The clinical relevance of this is the suggestion that we may be able to predict impending secondary insults after TBI before the clinical manifestation of these events. Given the known morbidity of ICH and CH, early intervention and prevention may have a significant impact on outcome. This becomes even more important when decisions must be made about timing of interventions. Increased levels of IL-8 and TNF-alpha in the serum during episodes of ICH and CH imply there are significant systemic effects of these events. These serum biomarkers are promising as diagnostic targets. In addition, further study of the precise role of these molecules may have significant implications for inflammatory system manipulation in the management of severe TBI.

TI  - Direct Peritoneal Resuscitation (DPR) Improves Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV and Acute Physiology Score When Used in Damage Control Laparotomies: Prospective Cohort Study on 37 Patients
T2  - SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL-INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SURGERY AND SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Using direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) as an adjunct when managing patients undergoing damage control laparotomy (DCL) shows promising results. We report our initial experience in utilizing DPR when managing patients who underwent DCL for emergent surgery at the index operation.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively collected data on 37 patients between August 2020 to October 2021 who underwent DCL with open abdomens after the index operation and utilized DPR. DPR was performed using peritoneal lavage with DIANEAL PD-2-D 2.5% Ca 3.5 mEq/L at a rate of 400ml/hour. Patients' physiological scores and clinical outcomes were evaluated.
   Results: 86% required DCL and DPR due to septic abdomen/bowel ischemia. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 62 years (53-70); 62% were male, and median (IQR) body mass index was 30.0kg/m(2) (25.5-38.4). On DPR initiation, median (IQR) APACHE-IV score was 48 (33-64) and median (IQR) Acute Physiology Score (APS) was 31 (18-54). After initiation, median (IQR) APACHE-IV score and median (IQR) APS were 39 (21-62) and 19 (11-56), respectively, and both showed significant improvement in survivors (p<0.05). Median (IQR) DPR duration was four days (2-8) and primary abdominal closure was achieved in 30 patients (81%). There were eight mortalities (21.6%) within 30 days postoperatively, of which seven were within 3-24 days due to uncontrolled sepsis/multiple organ failure. The most frequent complication was surgical-site infection recorded in 12 patients (32%). Twenty-four patients (67%) were discharged home/transferred to a rehab center/nursing home.
   Conclusion: DPR application showed significant improvement of APACHE-IV score and APS in patients with peritonitis/septic abdomen.

TI  - Intranasal Temperature Modulation Device in Awake Healthy Volunteers: A First In-Human Safety and Tolerability Study
T2  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fever after brain injury is a known contributor to poor outcomes; however, temperature-modulating devices (TMDs), such as surface and intravascular systems, face significant limitations, including delayed deployment, invasiveness, patient discomfort, skin integrity issues, frequent induction of shivering, and the need for sedation, all of which hinder timely neuroprotective therapy and confound neurological assessments. This first in-human study evaluated the safety and tolerability of an intranasal TMD, which delivers thermoelectrically temperature-regulated air via a nasal cannula to affect the core temperature. Five healthy, awake adult volunteers (median age 34 years old, 57.1% men) underwent intranasal cooling with 5 degrees C cooled air delivered at flow rates between 15 and 58 liters per minute. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The reduction in core body temperature was recorded using an esophageal temperature probe. No pharmacological agents or sedatives were administered to the patient. All participants exhibited a consistent downward trend in core body temperature, with an average reduction of 0.7 degrees C at 30 minutes and 1.2 degrees C at 60 minutes. Notably, no shivering or adverse events related to the intranasal TMD were reported. Cooling was well-tolerated, with esophageal probe placement being the only limiting factor for full protocol completion in some subjects. Participants remained fully conscious and communicative throughout the therapy. This intranasal TMD achieved clinically relevant core cooling without triggering shivering or requiring sedation, thereby addressing the key barriers associated with traditional TMDs. These promising early results support further investigation of this intranasal TMD in patients with acute neurological injury. Future studies should explore its performance in critical care and prehospital environments, where time-sensitive neuroprotection is most impactful.

TI  - Lance-Adams syndrome or chronic post-hypoxic myoclonus in adults: a systematic literature review
T2  - BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Lance-Adams syndrome, or chronic post-hypoxic myoclonus, is a disabling chronic myoclonic disorder occurring in survivors of brain hypoxic events. Using a systematic methodology for literature search and data acquisition, we extensively reviewed all published cases of Lance-Adams syndrome since the first original patients were described by JW Lance and RD Adams in 1963. We analysed the available data of 272 patients extracted from the 153 included studies to summarize the natural history of Lance-Adams syndrome, outline the full spectrum of this disorder and deepen our understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Two-thirds of patients suffered from a respiratory hypoxic leading event. The main causes of anoxia were peri-surgery and anaesthetic accidents, asthma attacks/bronchospasm, cardiac disorders and intoxications/drug overdoses. Many patients exhibited a 'pure' Lance-Adams syndrome, characterized by multi-focal action-induced myoclonic jerks predominant to distal limbs. Morphologic brain imaging did not show any specific abnormalities. Neurophysiological evaluations, including EEG recordings, polymyography of myoclonus and jerk-locked back averaging of myoclonus, revealed features of cortical myoclonus in the majority of patients. Both EEG, showing epileptiform discharges on the frontal and central median regions, and brain metabolism imaging, showing hypometabolism on the pericentral regions, indicated that myoclonus in Lance-Adams syndrome originates within the motor cortex. Some anti-seizure medications have shown some effectiveness and certain neuromodulation techniques have promising effects.
   Vellieux et al. compile all the available data about Lance-Adams syndrome to elucidate the natural history, outline the full spectrum and deepen our understanding of this disorder. They provide new perspectives on the mechanistic underpinnings of Lance-Adams syndrome, particularly regarding the cortical or sub-cortical origin of myoclonus.

TI  - CHILDHOOD DROWNING AND NEAR-DROWNING IN THE UNITED-STATES
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISEASES OF CHILDREN
AB  - More than 2000 children drown each year; in some states drowning is considered the leading cause of death for children under the age of 5 years. Many survivors of near-drowning have permanent neurologic disability. There are two distinct high risk groups: children under 5 years of age and boys aged 15 to 19 years. Most drownings in the former group occur in residential pools. Among survivors, the clinical course is bimodal; intact survival and survival with severe permanent disability are the most likely outcomes. The outcome of an immersion event is determined within a few minutes of the onset of immersion, mandating an emphasis on primary prevention. A requirement for pool fencing is the most promising such strategy and could be implemented soon. Training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and (for older children) alcohol abuse prevention programs may be valuable adjuncts.

TI  - DAMAGE CONTROL - AN APPROACH FOR IMPROVED SURVIVAL IN EXSANGUINATING PENETRATING ABDOMINAL INJURY
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 23RD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE WESTERN-TRAUMA-ASSOC
AB  - Definitive laparotomy (DL) for penetrating abdominal wounding with combined vascular and visceral injury is a difficult surgical challenge. Physiologic derangements such as dilutional coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis often preclude completion of the procedure. ''Damage control'' (DC), defined as initial control of hemorrhage and contamination followed by intraperitoneal packing and rapid closure, allows for resuscitation to normal physiology in the intensive care unit and subsequent definitive re-exploration. The purpose of the study was to compare the damage control technique with definitive laparotomy. Over a 3 1/2-year period, 46 patients with penetrating abdominal injuries required laparotomy and urgent transfusion of greater than 10 units packed red blood cells for exsanguination. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for degree and pattern of injury, probability of survival, actual survival, transfusion requirements for the preoperative and postoperative phases, resuscitation and operative times, lowest perioperative temperature, pH, and HCO3. No significant differences were identified between 22 DL and 24 DC patients and actual survival rates were similar (55% DC vs. 58% DL). However, in a subset of 22 patients with major vascular injury and two or more visceral injuries (maximum injury subset), otherwise similar to the overall group, survival was markedly improved in patients treated with damage control (10 of 13, 77%*) vs. DLM (1 of 9, 11%) (Fisher's exact test, * p < 0.02). In preparation for return to the operating room, DC survivors averaged 8.4 units of packed red blood cells transfused and 10.3 units fresh frozen plasma over a mean ICU stay of 31.7 hours. Resolution of coagulopathy (mean prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time 19.5/, 70.4 to 13.3/34.9), normalization of acid-base balance (mean pH/HCO3 7.37/20.6 to 7.42/24.2), and core rewarming (mean 33.2-degrees-C to 37.7-degrees-C) were achieved. All patients had gastrointestinal procedures at reoperation (mean operative time, 4.3 hours). We conclude that damage control is a promising approach for increased survival in exsanguinating patients with major vascular and multiple visceral penetrating abdominal injuries.

TI  - A Case of Asymptomatic Occipital Condyle Fracture with Incomplete Occipitocervical Dislocation: How Did It Happen?
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) is a lesion rarely observed in a trauma center, because of high mortality in the preclinical phase. The number of AOD survivors is increasing thanks to the improvement in pre-hospital resuscitation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our goal is to describe a case of incomplete atlantooccipital dislocation presented without any neurologic, cardiorespiratory, or metabolic problems, which remained constant even after surgical treatment. Our purpose is also to discuss treatment approaches to minimize subsequent neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a rapid immobilization with spine table and cervical collar, the consensual stabilization of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, and a successive prompt occipitocervical stabilization. C2 should be included in the stabilization because of the ligamentous conformation of craniocervical joint.

TI  - Evaluation of a Multifaceted Educational Intervention to Improve Palliative Care in the Intensive Care Unit Adopting the Care and Communication Bundle
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE NURSING
AB  - Currently, palliative care needs are inconsistently implemented in intensive care units (ICUs). To remedy this problem, a multifaceted educational intervention was delivered to interdisciplinary ICU team members to promote the adoption of the Care and Communication Bundle for patients identified as being at a high risk of death. A preintervention/postintervention evaluation design was used to determine the extent to which the nine quality measures of the Care and Communication Bundle, patient length of stay, and patient mortality were changed after this educational intervention. On the basis of statistical results, documentation of an appropriate decision maker, advance directives, resuscitation status, and social work contact significantly improved after the multifaceted educational intervention to integrate palliative care measures into the ICU.

TI  - Respiratory Diseases in Firefighters and Fire Exposers
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - With the increasing use of synthetic chemical based products in building construction in recent decades, there has been growing concern over the health hazards to firefighters and fire exposers from the inhalation of the toxic components of smoke. Toxic combustion products can have profound effects on the respiratory system, causing symptoms, physiologic changes, and chronic diseases. Prompt evaluation is important and should include chest films, pulmonary function testing, arterial blood gas analysis, and bronchoscopy. Positive findings require aggressive management with adequate oxygenation, ventilation, pulmonary toilet, and fluid resuscitation. Clinicians caring for individuals who have sustained inhalation damage to their respiratory tract need to comprehensively understand the mechanisms, natural history, management, and prevention of acute inhalation injury, so that they can help individual patients recover without serious complications.

TI  - Antiarrhythmic therapies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death
T2  - DRUGS
AB  - Despite remarkable advances in cardiovascular therapeutics, sudden cardiac death remains a significant problem. In this review, data from clinical trials and other studies on antiarrhythmic therapies have been evaluated in order to determine effective strategies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in high risk patients.
   Overall, routine prophylactic use of class I antiarrhythmic agents in high risk patients, mostly survivors of acute myocardial infarction, is associated with increased risk of death [61 trials, 23 486 patients: odds ratio (OR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.27, p < 0.05]. Conversely, beta-blockers are associated with highly significant reductions in risk of death in postinfarction patients (56 trials, 53 521 patients: OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.87, p < 0.00001).
   Overall data from the amiodarone trials on high risk patients, including postinfarction patients, patients with congestive heart failure or survivors of cardiac arrest, suggest that this agent is effective in reducing the risk of death (14 trials, 5713 patients: OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, p = 0.01) although further studies are needed to better define which types of patients will potentially benefit most from this agent. No benefits were seen with calcium channel blockers (26 trials, 21 644 patients: OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13, p = NS).
   The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a promising option for high risk patients, but definition of its role awaits the completion of ongoing clinical trials. Since causes of sudden death are heterogeneous, the clinician should pursue a multifactorial approach to its prevention. Primary and secondary prevention of cardiac ischaemia, through the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and maximising the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction, should lead to a future decrease in the incidence of sudden cardiac death.

TI  - Healthcare Utilization is High in Adult Patients Relapsing after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
T2  - BIOLOGY OF BLOOD AND MARROW TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Disease relapse is the leading cause of death for patients with acute leukemia (AL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Relapse post-HCT is associated with poor prognosis; however, inpatient healthcare utilization of this population is unknown. Here we describe survival, intensity of healthcare utilization, and characteristics associated with high resource use at the end of life (EOL). Adult patients with AL/MDS who underwent HCT at a large regional referral center with subsequent relapse between 2005 and 2015 were included in this retrospective study. We compared the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients as well as healthcare utilization over 2 years postrelapse and at EOL by postrelapse disease-directed therapeutic interventions. We created a composite score for EOL healthcare utilization intensity by summing the presence of any of the following criteria: death in the hospital, use of chemotherapy, emergency department, hospitalization, intensive care unit, intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or hemodialysis in the last month of life. Higher scores indicate more intense healthcare use at EOL. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine variables (demographic characteristics, postrelapse treatment group, advance directives documentation, palliative care referral, time to relapse) associated with EOL healthcare utilization intensity. One hundred fifty-four patients were included; median age at relapse was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 to 63), 55% were men, 79% had AL, and median time from HCT to relapse was 6 months (IQR, 3 to 10). After relapse, 28% received supportive care only, 50% received chemotherapy only, and 22% received chemotherapy plus cell therapy (either donor lymphocyte infusion, second HCT, or donor lymphocyte infusion plus second HCT). With the exception of time until relapse and Karnofsky Performance Status, baseline characteristics (gender, age, race, graft-versus-host disease, year of treatment) did not significantly differ by postrelapse treatment group. One hundred thirty-six patients (88%) died within 2 years of relapse; survival differed significantly by postrelapse treatment group, with those receiving disease-directed treatment showing lower risk of death. Healthcare use in AL/MDS patients after post-HCT relapse was high overall, with 44% visiting the emergency department at least once (22% at least 2 times), 93% hospitalized (55% at least 2 times, 16% at least 5 times), and 38% using the intensive care unit (median length of stay 5, days; IQR, 3 to 10). Use was high even among those receiving only supportive care. For those patients who died, the mean intensity score for EOL healthcare use was 1.8 (standard deviation, 1.8). Most patients (70%) had a marker of high-intensity healthcare utilization at the EOL or died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, an increase in age (estimate -.03 (95% CI, -.06 to -.003) and having AL versus MDS were significantly associated with a decreased EOL healthcare intensity score; no other variables were associated with intensity of EOL healthcare use. Healthcare utilization after post-HCT relapse is associated with receipt of disease-directed therapy but remains high across all groups despite known poor prognosis. Interventions are needed to minimize nonbeneficial treatments and promote goal-concordant EOL care in this seriously ill patient population.

TI  - Effect of Coronary Artery Disease on COVID-19-Prognosis and Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary As of October 2021, over 245 million people have been infected and nearly 5 million have died due to COVID-19. Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammation of the arterial wall with coronary artery disease (CAD) that may lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which remains the main cause of death in developed countries. We believe that due to CAD development factors affecting the vessel wall, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may precipitate further advancement of future thromboembolic events by a plaque erosion or rupture. Therefore, this metanalysis aims to unambiguously establish the role of the history of CAD in mortality and severity of COVID-19 disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients with pre-existing CAD were shown to have a more severe course of COVID-19, but this association has not been clarified. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the association between CAD and COVID-19 outcomes. We searched Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to 2 November 2021. There were 62 studies with a total population of 49,286 patients included in the meta-analysis. CAD occurrence in survivor vs. non-survivor groups varied and amounted to 9.2% vs. 22.9%, respectively (OR = 0.33; 95%CI: 0.29 to 0.39; I-2 = 70%; p < 0.001). CAD was also associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease and was (10.8% vs. 5.6%, respectively, for severe vs. non-severe groups (OR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.59 to 3.27; I-2 = 72%; p < 0.001). The role of history of CAD in mortality and severe condition in COVID-19 presents itself as prominent-although a risk of bias in retrospective trials needs to be assessed, in case of our meta-analysis the statistically significant results when it comes to higher mortality among patients with CAD compared to non-CAD patients, a more severe condition observed in patients with CAD, and a visibly more frequent admission to intensive care unit in patients with CAD, it seems that an incidence of cardiovascular events plays a role in COVID-19 prognosis.

TI  - IATROGENIC COMPLICATIONS IN ADULT INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS - A PROSPECTIVE 2-CENTER STUDY
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives. a) To evaluate the frequency, types, severity, and morbidity of iatrogenic complications; b) determine associated factors that favor iatrogenic complications; and c) suggest new or more efficient protective measures that may be taken to improve patient safety.
   Design: Prospective, observational study.
   Setting. Two ICUs in France.
   Patients and Methods. The study included 382 patients (age greater-than-or-equal-to 15 yrs; 400 consecutive admissions). Patients were monitored by two physicians in each ICU to assess all iatrogenic complications occurring during their ICU stay, with the exception of adverse effects of drugs. An iatrogenic complication was defined as an adverse event that was independent of the patient's underlying disease.
   Results. We observed 316 iatrogenic complications in 124 (31%) of the 400 admissions. Of these iatrogenic complications, 107 (in 53 [13%] of the 400 admissions) complications were major, three leading to death. Severe hypotension, respiratory distress, pneumothorax, and cardiac arrest represented 78% of the major iatrogenic complications. Fifty-nine percent of the major iatrogenic complications had clearly identified associated factors. Human errors accounted for 67% of these factors. Patients >65 yrs (adjusted odds ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 4.9) and those patients admitted with two or more organ failures (adjusted odds ratio = 4.8, 95% confidence interval: 2.5 to 9.2) were more likely to develop major iatrogenic complications. High or excessive nursing workload also led to an increased risk of major iatrogenic complications. Persistent morbidity, secondary to iatrogenic complications at the time of discharge, was present in five survivors. The risk of ICU death was about two-fold higher for the patients with major iatrogenic complications than in the remaining patients after adjusting for the Organ System Failure Score and the prognosis of the disease (relative risk = 1.92, 95% confidence interval: 1.28 to 2.56).
   Conclusions Major iatrogenic complications were frequent, associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates, related to high or excessive nursing workload, and were often secondary to human errors. To improve patient safety in our ICUs, preventive measures should be targeted primarily on the elderly and the most severely ill patients. Special attention should be given to improving the organization of workload and training, and promoting wider use of noninvasive monitoring.

TI  - Comparison of hemorrhage control agents applied to lethal extremity arterial hemorrhages in swine
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 18th Annual Meeting of the Eastern-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - Background: QuikClot powder (QC), chitosan dressing (CD), and fibrin sealant dressing (FSD) are new hemostatic products touted to be more effective in controlling severe extremity bleeding than the current standard gauze dressing. All have been utilized in the global war on terrorism. Our objective was to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of these three products in a model of severe extremity arterial hemorrhage that could not be stopped by standard gauze treatment.
   Methods: A model of severe extremity arterial hemorrhage was developed in swine that was 100% fatal with standard gauze application and manual compression. The Army Field Bandage (AFB) was the standard gauze control. Anesthetized animals (n = 60, 15/group, 37.7 +/- 2.5 kg) were splenectomized and instrumented. A reproducible femoral artery injury was created using a 6 mm aortic punch, and free bleeding was allowed for 45 seconds. Each hemostatic agent was applied twice with three-minute compressions. All products were applied on actively bleeding wounds through a pool of blood. Fluid resuscitation was started with the first compression and titrated to a mean pressure of 65 mm Hg. Animals were observed for 180 minutes or until death. Endpoints were percent survival, survival time, blood loss, resuscitation volume, wound temperatures and tissue histology. Data are expressed as mean +/- SD and analyzed by Fisher's exact, logrank, and nonparametric ANOVA tests.
   Results: Baseline physiologic parameters were similar among groups. AFB did not produce bemostasis. QC also showed no hemostatic benefit, and QC treatment markedly increased maximum wound temperatures to an average of 70.8 +/- 14.2 C (p < 0.001). CD stopped bleeding temporarily in only one animal. There were no survivors in the AFB, QC, or CD groups. CD numerically prolonged survival time (58.9 +/- 21.1 minute) compared with the control (38.4 +/- 24.7 minutes,p = 0.045) but the difference was not significant. FSD reduced bleeding (p < 0.05) and prevented exsanguination in 10/15 (2/3) animals, and resulted in a significantly longer average survival time (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: FSD was superior to other currently utilized hemostatic products in controlling lethal arterial hemorrhage in this model of a fatal extremity wound. CD showed some hemostatic benefit. The exothermic reaction of QC was significant and resulted in gross and histologic tissue changes of unknown clinical significance. Controlled human studies with the promising products are required.

TI  - DEFINITIVE CONTROL OF BLEEDING FROM SEVERE PELVIC FRACTURES
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
AB  - Patients (40) with severe pelvic fracture and extraperitoneal hemorrhage were reviewed; 18 patients seen prior to 1975 (group I) were clinically similar to 22 patients seen subsequently (group II). Major pelvic fracture hemorrhage was defined as bleeding in excess of 2000 ml over initial resuscitation volumes. Of 22 group II patients, 10 met the criteria for continued extraperitoneal bleeding and were immobilized in an inflatable G-suit (external compression device) after surgically remediable lesions were excluded. Ventilator support and hemodynamic monitoring were instituted and clinical response recorded. Prompt cessation of bleeding was seen in 9 of 10 patients. One patient required selective catheterization of a bleeding artery with subsequent embolic occlusion. Significant reductions in overall mortality and the frequency of shock related death were seen in group II patients. Sepsis was the leading cause of late death in survivors. Immobilization of pelvic fracture patients in the G-suit is recommended to control continuing retroperitoneal hemorrhage when surgically correctable bleeding points were dealt with. Failure of patients to respond promptly to the G-suit strongly suggests arterial bleeding amenable to selective catheterization and embolic occlusion.

TI  - Update in Sepsis 2012
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Pivotal sepsis clinical trials and preclinical research in 2012 are reviewed. For interventions ranging from synthetic complex starch solutions to recombinant human activated protein C, large multicenter randomized controlled trials generally failed to show benefit and some even demonstrated harm in the intervention group. In smaller innovative clinical trials simple interventions such as external cooling to control fever and biomarker-guided weaning from mechanical ventilation found potential benefit. Biomarkers for sepsis, including multimarker panels, are increasingly showing promise for clinical application. Breakthroughs in basic research in sepsis continue to highlight the complexity of the systemic inflammatory response and its consequences. A series of publications in AJRCCM follow the septic inflammatory response starting from intracellular structures and organelles to mitochondria and the cytoskeleton. Additional publications explore the key leukocyte subsets acting in sepsis, highlighting the underappreciated role of helper T-cell type 2-related pathways. Cellular remnants in the form of microparticles contribute to coagulopathy and further organ dysfunction. As a consequence, we suggest that sepsis may be the paradigm disease or condition requiring personalized care first to discover and validate new therapies and second to increase survival.

TI  - Local cerebral hypothermia induced by selective infusion of cold lactated ringer's: a feasibility study in rhesus monkeys
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background and Objective: Hypothermia has shown promise as a neuroprotective strategy for stroke. The use of whole body hypothermia has limited clinical utility due to many severe side effects. Selective brain cooling, or local brain hypothermia, has been previously proposed as an alternative treatment strategy. This study investigated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of selective brain hypothermia induced by local infusion of ice-cold lactated Ringer's solution in rhesus monkeys.
   Methods: Eight male rhesus monkeys were used in this study. Brain temperature in the territory supplied by middle cerebral artery (MCA) was reduced by infusing 100 mL of ice-cold (0 degrees C) lactated Ringer's solution over 20 min via a micro-catheter placed in the proximal MCA (n = 4). Vital signs and the temperature of the brain and rectum were monitored before and after infusion. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were used to evaluate cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), cerebral edema, and vasospasm. Another cohort of rhesus monkeys (n = 4) were used as systemic cooling controls.
   Results: Oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, and hematologic analysis of the two groups remained within the normal range after infusion. Mild cerebral hypothermia (< 35 degrees C) was achieved in 10 min (0.3 degrees C/min) and was maintained for 20 min in local cortex and striatum following local infusion. The average lowest cerebral temperature in the locally cooled animals was 33.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C in the striatum following 20-min infusion. This was not observed in animals cooled by systemic infusion. The decreases in the rectal temperature for local and systemic infusion were 0.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C and 0.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C, respectively. Selective brain cooling did not cause any cerebral edema as determined by MRI or vasospasm in the perfused vessel based on DSA. Selective cerebral hypothermia did not significantly alter CVR.
   Conclusion: Local infusion of ice-cold lactated Ringer's solution via micro-catheter is a safe and effective method for selective cerebral hypothermia. This cooling method could potentially be developed as a new treatment in acute ischemic stroke.

TI  - Clot-Inducing Minerals Versus Plasma Protein Dressing for Topical Treatment of External Bleeding in the Presence of Coagulopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 23rd Annual Meeting of the Eastern-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - Background: Previous studies identified WoundStat (WS, smectite) and Combat Gauze (CG, kaolin-coated gauze) as the most effective available agents for controlling arterial bleeding with potential utility in casualty care. Tissue sealant properties of WS suggested its potential advantage over clot-promoting CG for treating coagulopathic bleeding. This study compared the efficacy of CG and WS with a fibrinogen-based (FAST) dressing to control bleeding in coagulopathic animals.
   Methods: Coagulopathy was induced in pigs (n = 55, 35 kg) by similar to 50% isovolemic hemodilution and hypothermia (core temperature, 33 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C). A 6-mm arteriotomy was made in the femoral artery and free bleeding allowed for 30 seconds. A test agent (n = 13-15 per group) or control product (gauze, GZ, n = 12) was applied to the wounds and compressed with a Kerlix gauze for 2 minutes. Fluid resuscitation was given, titrated to a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Animals were observed for 180 minutes or until death. Angiography using the computed tomography method was performed on survivors, and local tissues were collected for histology.
   Results: No differences were seen in baseline measures. Coagulopathy, confirmed by a 31% increase in prothrombin time and a 28% reduction in clotting strength (maximum amplitude, thrombelastography assay), was similar in all groups before injury. The average pretreatment blood loss was 11.9 mL/kg +/- 0.4 mL/kg with no difference among groups. Posttreatment blood loss, however, was significantly different (p = 0.015) ranging from 18.2 mL/kg +/- 8.8 mL/kg (FAST) to 63.3 mL/kg +/- 10.2 mL/kg (GZ controls). Stable hemostasis was achieved in 10 of 13 (FAST), 5 of 15 (CG), 2 of 15 (WS), and 1 of 12 (GZ) animals in each group, resulting in significantly different survival rates (8-77%; p = 0.001). The average survival times were 145 (FAST), 119 (CG), 75 (WS), and 74 (GZ) minutes for different groups (p < 0.002). The outcomes with the FAST dressing were significantly better than with WS or GZ in this coagulopathic bleeding model. Essentially, no difference was found between WS and GZ control. Computed tomography images showed limited blood flow only through the vessels treated with FAST dressings. Histologic observations of the vessels indicated minimal damage with FAST and CG and greater injury with WS with some residues present on the tissues.
   Conclusion: The tissue sealant property of WS is apparently mediated by clot formation in the wound; therefore, it was ineffective under coagulopathic conditions. CG was partially effective in maintaining blood pressure up to 1 hour after application. FAST dressing showed the highest efficacy because of the exogenous delivery of concentrated fibrinogen and thrombin to the wound, which bypasses coagulopathy and secures hemostasis.

TI  - Atlanto-occipital dislocation in a child: a challenging diagnosis. Illustrative case
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-CASE LESSONS
AB  - BACKGROUND Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) is a highly unstable injury of the osseoligamentous complex at the craniocervical junction that is more common in children. Its diagnosis remains a challenging process that must integrate clinical presentation and radiological criteria. OBSERVATIONS A 9-year-old child presented with severe craniocervical trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale score 6) and cardiorespiratory arrest on-site. Prompt resuscitation on-site and transfer to the university hospital were performed, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage around the brainstem and a retroclival hematoma. Most of the radiological criteria on CT scans for AOD were negative, except for the occipital condyle-C1 interval, and further imaging with magnetic resonance imaging permitted the diagnosis of AOD with rupture of both the tectorial membrane and the transverse ligament. Occipital-cervical Oc-C1-2 fixation was performed. The neurological outcome was excellent, with full recovery 6 months after the trauma. LESSONS AOD should be suspected in all high-intensity trauma in children, especially if the clinical presentation includes cardiorespiratory arrest and other brainstem and/or upper cervical cord symptoms along with premedullary subarachnoid hemorrhage. Understanding the ligamentous nature of the injury resulting in "normal" radiographs or CT scans is important to avoid underdiagnosing AOD, which can have detrimental consequences.

TI  - Penetrating cardiac injuries
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
AB  - Our objective was to determine the influence of several clinical factors on the survival of patients with penetrating wounds to the heart. A retrospective review of 80 consecutive penetrating cardiac injuries treated in a Level II urban trauma center from 1980 through 1994 were examined. Thirty-six patients (45%) had gunshot wounds (including 1 shotgun wound), and 44 (55%) had stab wounds. Intervention consisted of emergency room (ER) or operating room thoracotomy. We measured the effect of several clinical factors on morbidity and patient survival. Survival rate was 17 of 36 (47%) in gunshot injuries and 35 of 44 (80%) in stab injuries, with an overall survival rate of 52 of 80 patients (65%). The average age was 24 years (range, 9-53), and there were 3 female patients. Twelve patients (15%) had multiple cardiac injuries, and 63 (79%) had other associated injuries. Fourteen patients (17%) presented with no blood pressure, and 55 (69%) were hypotensive on admission. ER thoracotomy was performed on 7 of 52 survivors (13%) and 24 of 28 nonsurvivors (86%). Survival after ER thoracotomy was 7 of 31 patients (22%). A selective approach is recommended, because ER thoracotomy has a limited role in penetrating cardiac injury. A high index of suspicion, prompt resuscitation, and immediate definitive surgical management resulted in a high survival rate for these frequently lethal injuries.

TI  - EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTIC AND FLUID RESUSCITATION UPON SURVIVAL-TIME IN EXPERIMENTAL INTESTINAL ISCHEMIA
T2  - SURGERY GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - Acute massive intestinal ischemia is an abdominal catastrophe. Prompt diagnosis and restoration of blood flow is essential; otherwise, massive intestinal resection occurs, leading to death or, in the survivors, intestinal cripples. In this study, the time of warm reversible ischemia in the canine intestine was explored. After this time was established, fluids and antibiotics were administered to note change in survival times. Massive intestinal ischemia (superior mesenteric artery was clamped) was tolerated without death for five hours (20 dogs in each group). With six hours of ischemia, a 10 per cent mortality rate occurred; with seven hours of ischemia, a 90% mortality rate occurred. These dogs had a maintenance of 75 milliliters of fluid administered per hour. Using this group of dogs as the control (that is, the group with seven hour clamping time of the superior mesenteric artery with maintenance intravenously administered replacement), fluids were given to dogs in the experimental group to keep the pulmonary artery wedge pressure at a normal value (average of 300 milliliters per hour). This gorup of dogs had an increased survival rate of 40 per cent (ten dogs). Antibiotics were given to the dogs in the experimental group both before and after clamping, increasing the over-all survival rate to more than 80 per cent (46 dogs). Aggressive fluid replacement and antibiotic coverage may lengthen the so-called golden period in which intestinal ischemia may be reversed by revascularization.

TI  - Prognostic factors and monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis: gram-positive versus gram-negative pathogens
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: Monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis is rapidly progressive and life-threatening. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the clinical presentation and outcome for patients with this disease differ for those infected with a gram-positive as compared to gram-negative pathogen.
   Methods: Forty-six patients with monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis were examined retrospectively from November 2002 to January 2008. All patients received adequate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, aggressive resuscitation, prompt radical debridement and adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Eleven patients were infected with a gram-positive pathogen (Group 1) and 35 patients with a gram-negative pathogen (Group 2).
   Results: Group 2 was characterized by a higher incidence of hemorrhagic bullae and septic shock, higher APACHE II scores at 24 h post-admission, a higher rate of thrombocytopenia, and a higher prevalence of chronic liver dysfunction. Gouty arthritis was more prevalent in Group 1. For non-survivors, the incidences of chronic liver dysfunction, chronic renal failure and thrombocytopenia were higher in comparison with those for survivors. Lower level of serum albumin was also demonstrated in the non-survivors as compared to those in survivors.
   Conclusions: Pre-existing chronic liver dysfunction, chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia, and post-operative dependence on mechanical ventilation represent poor prognostic factors in monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. Patients with gram-negative monobacterial necrotizing fasciitis present with more fulminant sepsis.

TI  - Plasma levels of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in patients with massive pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: a prospective cohort study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Introduction: Cell-free plasma mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) and nuclear DNA (n-DNA) are biomarkers with prognostic utility in conditions associated with a high rate of cell death. This exploratory study aimed to determine the plasma levels of both nucleic acids in patients with massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and to compare them with other biomarkers, such as heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) and troponin I (Tn-I)
   Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 37 consecutive patients with massive PE, 37 patients with submassive PE, and 37 healthy subjects. Quantifications of plasma mt-DNA and n-DNA with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and plasma H-FABP and Tn-I by commercial assays, were done on blood samples drawn within 4 hours after presentation at the emergency department.
   Results: Plasma mt-DNA and n-DNA concentrations were much higher in patients with massive PE (median, 2,970 GE/ml; interquartile range (IQR), 1,050 to 5,485; and 3,325 GE/ml, IQR: 1,080 to 5,790, respectively) than in patients with submassive PE (870 GE/ml and 1,245 GE/ml, respectively; P < 0.01) or controls (185 GE/ml and 520 GE/ml, respectively). Eighteen patients with massive PE died of a PE-related cause by day 15 of observation. Plasma mtDNA and n-DNA values were 2.3-fold and 1.9-fold higher in the subgroup of nonsurviving patients than in survivors. H-FABP and Tn-I values were also higher in patients with massive PE who died (7.3 ng/ml and 0.023 ng/ml, respectively) than in those who survived (6.4 ng/ml, and 0.016 ng/ml, respectively). By receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, the best cutoff values for predicting 15-day mortality were 3,380 GE/ml for mt-DNA, 6.8 ng/ml for H-FABP, 3,625 GE/ml for n-DNA, and 0.020 ng/ml for Tn-I, based on the calculated areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78 to 0.99), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69 to 093), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.91), and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.79), respectively. By stepwise logistic regression, a plasma mt-DNA concentration greater than 3,380 GE/ml (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 8.22; 95% CI, 1.72 to 39.18; P < 0.001) and a plasma value of H-FBAP >6.8 ng/ml (OR, 5.36; 95% CI, 1.06 to 27.08; P < 0.01) were the only independent predictors of mortality.
   Conclusions: mt-DNA and H-FBAP might be promising markers for predicting 15-day mortality in massive PE, with mt-DNA having better prognostic accuracy.

TI  - Capillary refill: prognostic value in Kenyan children
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB  - Aims: To determine whether delayed capillary refill time (. 3 seconds) is a useful prognostic indicator in Kenyan children admitted to hospital.
   Methods: A total of 4160 children admitted to Kilifi District Hospital with malaria, malarial anaemia, acute respiratory tract infection (ARI), severe anaemia ( haemoglobin <50 g/l), gastroenteritis, malnutrition, meningitis, or septicaemia were studied.
   Results: Overall, delayed capillary refill time (dCRT), present in 346/4160 (8%) of the children, was significantly more common in fatal cases (44/189, 23%) than survivors (7.5%), and had useful prognostic value. In children admitted with malaria, gastroenteritis, or malnutrition, likelihood ratio tests suggested that dCRT was useful in identifying high risk groups for mortality, but its prognostic value in anaemia, ARI, and sepsis was unclear due to low case fatality or limited numbers. The severity features of impaired consciousness and deep breathing were significantly associated both with the presence of dCRT and fatal outcome. In children, with either of these severity features, a less stringent value of dCRT(>2 s) identified 50% of children with hypotension (systolic BP <2SD) and 40% of those requiring volume resuscitation ( for metabolic acidosis).
   Conclusions: Although CRT is a simple bedside test, which may be used in resource poor settings as a guide to the circulatory status, dCRT should not be relied on in the absence of other features of severity. In non-severe disease, the additional presence of hypoxia, a moderately raised creatinine (>80 mumol/l), or a raised white cell count should prompt the need for fluid expansion.

AB  - The goals of management of bleeding peptic ulcer disease (BPUD) are early diagnosis, prompt resuscitation, and urgent endoscopy to stop bleeding. Last few decades have witnessed a diminishing role of surgery in the management of BPUD. When non-operative strategies such as endoscopy and angioembolization fail to achieve hemostasis, surgery is used as the last resort. This is a case series analysis of 70 patients with BPUD who underwent emergency surgery from January 2002 to December 2014. Demographic profile, clinical parameters, and perioperative outcomes were studied. Baseline data of survivors was compared with non-survivors. Outcome of patients with > 2 endoscopic attempts was compared with <= 2 endoscopic attempt patients. Mean age of the patients was 68.5 years (range 38-93) and majority were male (85.7%). Thirty-nine patients (55.7%) had duodenal ulcers (DU). Among patients with gastric ulcers (GU), the most common location was incisura (n = 16, 51.6%). Most patients had two endoscopic procedures before surgery was undertaken. The most frequent operations performed were under running of duodenal ulcer (n = 40, 57.1%). Fifty-nine patients (84.3%) developed complications and 30-day mortality was 15.7%. There was no difference in demographic and clinical profile of survivors compared to non-survivors. Patients who received > 2 endoscopies had lower hemoglobin (p = 0.01) compared to patients with <= 2 endoscopies, but there was no difference in 30-day mortality (p = 0.68). Exhaustive non-operative strategy and reserving surgery as salvage in refractory BPUD gives acceptable outcomes.

TI  - Susceptibility to childhood sepsis, contemporary management, and future directions
T2  - LANCET CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Sepsis disproportionally affects children across all health-care settings and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in neonatal and paediatric age groups. As shown in the first paper in this Series, the age-specific incidence of sepsis is highest during the first years of life, before approaching adult incidence rates during adolescence. In the second paper in this Series, we focus on the unique susceptibility of paediatric patients to sepsis and how the underlying dysregulated host response relates to developmental aspects of children's immune system, genetic, perinatal, and environmental factors, and comorbidities and socioeconomic determinants of health, which often differ between children and adults. State-of-the-art clinical management of paediatric sepsis is organised around three treatment pillars-diagnosis, early resuscitation, and titration of advanced care-and we examine available treatment guidelines and the limitations of their supporting evidence. Serious evidence gaps remain in key areas of paediatric sepsis care, especially surrounding recognition, common interventions, and survivor support, and to this end we offer a research roadmap for the next decade that could accelerate targeted diagnostics and personalised use of immunomodulation. However, improving outcomes for children with sepsis relies fundamentally on systematic quality improvement in both recognition and treatment, which is the theme of the third paper in this Series. Digital health, as shown in the fourth and final paper of this Series, holds promising potential in breaking down the barriers that hinder progress in paediatric sepsis care and, ultimately, global child health.

TI  - Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 ameliorates traumatic brain injury-induced cardiac dysfunctions via inhibition of pyroptosis and apoptosis
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently results in cardiac dysfunction and impacts the quality of survivors' life. It has been reported that carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3) administration immediately after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR) ameliorated the HSR-induced cardiac dysfunctions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the application of CORM-3 on TBI exerted therapeutic effects against TBI-induced cardiac dysfunctions. Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12) including Sham, TBI, TBI/CORM-3 and TBI/inactive CORM-3 (iCORM-3) groups. TBI was established by a weight-drop model. The rats in the TBI/CORM-3 group and TBI/iCORM-3 group were intravenously injected with CORM-3 and iCORM-3 (4 mg/kg) following TBI, respectively. The time of death in the rats that did not survive within 24 h was recorded. 24 h post-trauma, the cardiac function, pathological change, serum troponin T and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels, pyroptosis, apoptosis and expressions of TUNEL staining, Gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-1 beta, IL-18, ratio Bax/Bcl-2 were assessed by echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, chemiluminescence, immunofluorescence, and western blot assays, respectively. TBI-treated rats exhibited dramatically decreased ejection fraction and aggravated myocardial injury, increased mortality rate, elevated levels of serum troponin T and CK-MB, promoted cardiac pyroptosis and apoptosis, and upregulated expressions of cleaved caspase-3, GSDMD N-terminal fragments, IL-1 beta, IL-18, and ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, whereas CORM-3 partially reversed these changes. CORM-3 ameliorated TBI-induced cardiac injury and dysfunction. This mechanism may be responsible for the inhibition of pyroptosis and apoptosis in cardiomyocyte.

TI  - Acute management of complex cardiac injuries
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CP  - 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
AB  - Background: Injury to the heart has been studied extensively, However, a small group of patients with injuries to the coronary arteries or intracardiac structures may require a different operative approach,
   Methods: Retrospective review of a cardiovascular injury database.
   Results: Over a 20-year period, 711 cardiac injuries were treated. The mean age of the victims was 31.1 (90% men), Causes were primarily stab wounds (54%) and gunshot wounds (42%), Cardiac chambers injured included the right ventricle (40%), left ventricle (40%), right atrium (24%), and left atrium (3%), The overall mortality was 47%, Sixty complex injuries occurred, Of 21 left anterior descending coronary artery injuries (76.2% mortality), two patients presented with sufficient signs of life to warrant emergent coronary artery bypass (mortality 50%), There were seven circumflex/obtuse marginal coronary artery injuries, all treated with ligation (mortality 71.4%), Eight right/posterior descending coronary artery injuries (mortality 62.5%) were seen, and all but one were treated with ligation, The one patient not treated with ligation underwent coronary bypass and died, Delayed mitral valve replacement was performed for two valvular injuries (mitral), There were a total of 14 intracardiac fistulas (mortality 35.7%), All six of the surviving patients with ventricular septal defect required reoperation,
   Conclusion: The mortality for complex injuries (coronary, septal, valvular) was 53%, This group was a specific population that self-selected by surviving to operation, Acute operations for complex injuries (beyond cardiorrhaphy) were primarily heroic life-saving efforts, Reoperation for cardiac injuries was most common for septal or valvular injuries, Only 2% of all survivors required reoperation to correct a residual defect.

TI  - Outcomes of Expectantly Managed Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes Occurring Before 24 Weeks of Gestation
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
CP  - 55th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Gynecologic-Investigation
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess contemporary outcomes in expectantly managed preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) before 24 weeks of gestation.
   METHODS: We analyzed all patients with singleton pregnancies and preterm PROM before 24 weeks of gestation from 2001 to 2007. Patients immediately electing delivery, delivering within 12 hours of preterm PROM, carrying anomalous fetus(es), or multiple gestations were excluded. Neonatal survival without major morbidities was the primary outcome. Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression models. Week-specific probability estimates for neonatal morbidity and mortality were calculated based on gestational age at the time of preterm PROM.
   RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine women fulfilled study criteria. Median gestational age at preterm PROM for all patients was 21.4 (range 14.0-23.9) weeks of gestation. Median delivery gestational age was 24.7 (range 15.4-3.1) weeks. Forty-seven patients experienced either an intrauterine fetal demise, elected delivery after initial expectant management, or delivered before planned resuscitation. Of 112 newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care, 89 (56.0% of all neonates) survived; 43 (48.3% of survivors, 27.0% of all neonates) had no major neonatal morbidities. Morbidity probabilities decreased with increasing gestational age at the time of preterm PROM. Delivery gestational age was predictive of both neonatal morbidity and mortality.
   CONCLUSION: More than one half of women who achieved at least 12 hours of latency and elected expectant management had a surviving infant; nearly 50% of survivors had no major neonatal morbidity. These contemporary outcomes are valuable in counseling women with early preterm PROM. (Obstet Gynecol 2009;114:29-37)

TI  - DIRECTED EMERGENCY ROOM THORACOTOMY - A PROGNOSTIC PREREQUISITE FOR SURVIVAL
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB  - The results of 163 patients (49 SWs, 85 GSWs, 29 blunt trauma) who had resuscitative thoracotomy in the emergency room (ERT) were reviewed to reassess the indications for the procedure. The Revised Trauma Score (RTS) of the patients ranged from 0 to 3 in 138, 4 to 8 in 21, and > 8 in four. No patient with blunt trauma survived. Sixteen patients [12 (24.5%) with stab wounds and 4 (4.7%) with gunshot wounds] were eventually discharged, an overall survival of 9.8%. Eight of the survivors were without vital signs on arrival at the emergency center and one of them had only signs of life at the scene. Survival was best when the site of penetration was thoracic (n = 84) and the ERT was "directed" at potential cardiac injury. Fifty-six of these patients (66.6%) did have cardiac wounds with tamponade and 12 of them survived (21.4%). Two of the remaining 28 patients, both with pulmonary injury, were salvaged. This was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than in patients with head and neck (n = 4), abdominal (n = 19), or multiple site (n = 40) injury when the ERT was nondirected. Two of the five patients (40%) with extremity vascular injuries survived after ERT was successful in restoring a cardiac rhythm. These data suggest that in patients without vital signs, ERT "directed" at potential cardiac injury based on thoracic penetration is an important prognostic prerequisite for survival. Emergency room thoracotomy is not beneficial in blunt trauma and its role in penetrating abdominal injuries remains unproven.

TI  - Nurse Staffing, the Clinical Work Environment, and Burn Patient Mortality
T2  - JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
CP  - 52nd Annual Meeting of the American-Burn-Association (ABA)
AB  - The complexity of modern burn care requires an integrated team of specialty providers working together to achieve the best possible outcome for each burn survivor. Nurses are central to many aspects of a burn survivor's care, including physiologic monitoring, fluid resuscitation, pain management, infection prevention, complex wound care, and rehabilitation. Research suggests that in general, hospital nursing resources, defined as nurse staffing and the quality of the work environment, relate to patient mortality. Still, the relationship between those resources and burn mortality has not been previously examined. This study used a multivariable risk-adjusted regression model and a linked, cross-sectional claims database of more than 14,000 adults (=18 years) thermal burn patients admitted to 653 hospitals to evaluate these relationships. Hospital nursing resources were independently reported by more than 29,000 bedside nurses working in the study hospitals. In the high burn patient-volume hospitals (=100/y) that care for the most severe burn injuries, each additional patient added to a nurse's workload is associated with 30% higher odds of mortality (P <.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.94), and improving the work environment is associated with 28% lower odds of death (P <.05, 95% CI: 0.07-0.99). Nursing resources are vital in the care of burn patients and are a critical, yet previously omitted, variable in the evaluation of burn outcomes. Attention to nurse staffing and improvement to the nurse work environment is warranted to promote optimal recovery for burn survivors. Given the influence of nursing on mortality, future research evaluating burn patient outcomes should account for nursing resources.

TI  - Oxidized High-Density Lipoprotein Induces Endothelial Fibrosis Promoting Hyperpermeability, Hypotension, and Increased Mortality
T2  - ANTIOXIDANTS
AB  - During systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the bloodstream, producing large amounts of oxidized HDL (oxHDL). OxHDL loses the vascular protective features of native HDL, acquiring detrimental actions. Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial fibrosis, characterized by adhesion protein downregulation and fibrotic-specific gene upregulation, disrupting endothelial monolayer integrity. Severe systemic inflammatory conditions, as found in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), exhibit endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and organ hypoperfusion, promoting organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Because endothelial fibrosis disturbs the endothelium, it is proposed that it is the cellular and molecular origin of endothelial hyperpermeability and the subsequent deleterious consequences. However, whether oxHDL is involved in this process is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the fibrotic effect of oxHDL on the endothelium, to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism, and to determine its effects on vascular permeability, blood pressure, and mortality. The results showed that oxHDL induces endothelial fibrosis through the LOX-1/NOX-2/ROS/NF-kappa B pathway, TGF-beta secretion, and ALK-5/Smad activation. OxHDL-treated rats showed endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and an enhanced risk of death and mortality, which was prevented using an ALK-5 inhibitor and antioxidant diet consumption. Additionally, the ICU patients showed fibrotic endothelial cells, and the resuscitation fluid volume administered correlated with the plasma oxHDL levels associated with an elevated risk of death and mortality. We conclude that oxHDL generates endothelial fibrosis, impacting blood pressure regulation and survival.

TI  - Fluid balance after continuous renal replacement therapy initiation and outcome in paediatric multiple organ failure
T2  - ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Background Patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) often receive large amounts of resuscitation fluid, making them at high risk of fluid overload (FO). Our main objective was to investigate if the ability to achieve a negative fluid balance during the first 3 continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) days was associated with mortality in children with MOF. Methods Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary multidisciplinary academic paediatric hospital. The study included 63 patients (age 0-18 years) with 3 or more failing organs receiving CRRT due to acute kidney injury and/or fluid overload. Results The median age was 4 months, and PICU mortality was 29%. Survivors had significantly lower degree of FO at CRRT initiation, (median 15% (Interquartile range 9-22)) than non-survivors (24% (17%-37%), P = 0.002). On PICU admission, PIM-3 score was significantly higher in non-survivors (P = 0.01), but at CRRT initiation there was no difference in PELOD-2 score (P = 0.98). Mortality in patients achieving a cumulative net negative fluid balance during the first 3 days after CRRT initiation was 12%, compared to 86% in those not achieving this (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the inability to achieve a net negative fluid balance during 3 days after CRRT initiation (P < 0.0001) and FO >20% at CRRT initiation (P = 0.0019) remained associated with mortality. Conclusion Our results suggest that early fluid removal is associated with improved patient outcome in critically ill children receiving CRRT, and that prompt measures should be taken to prevent fluid overload in critical illness. These results need to be verified in further, prospective studies.

TI  - The Role of Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) as an Early Indicator of Mortality in Pediatric Septic Shock
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS
AB  - Background: Despite advancements in antibiotic therapy and resuscitation protocols, sepsis and septic shock remain major contributors to morbidity and mortality in children. We aimed to investigate the utility of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) for the early detection of septic shock and to evaluate its accuracy in predicting mortality. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED), enrolling patients diagnosed with the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. In addition to assessing infection biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, suPAR levels were quantified upon admission using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Results: Overall 72 patients and 80 healthy children included. Plasma suPAR levels demonstrated a statistically significant elevation in the sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups compared with the control group (p < 0.001 for all). The septic shock group exhibited the highest suPAR levels upon admission, surpassing both the sepsis and severe sepsis groups (p = 0.009 and 0.042). ROC analysis underscored the promising potential of suPAR with an AUC of 0.832 for septic shock. Analysis of mortality prediction revealed significantly higher suPAR levels in nonsurvivors than survivors (9.7 ng/mL vs. 4.2 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Employing plasma suPAR levels to discriminate between mortality and survival, a threshold of >= 7.0 ng/mL demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 71.0%. Conclusion: Plasma suPAR levels have the potential as a biomarker for predicting mortality in children with septic shock. In pediatric septic shock, the presence of plasma suPAR >= 7 ng/mL along with an underlying disease significantly increases the risk of mortality.

TI  - Appropriate Use of Emergency Department Thoracotomy: Implications for the Thoracic Surgeon
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Background. Practice guidelines for the appropriate use of emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) according to current national resuscitative guidelines have been developed by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) and published. At an urban level I trauma center we analyzed how closely these guidelines were followed and their ability to predict mortality.
   Methods. Between January 2003 and July 2010, 120 patients with penetrating thoracic trauma underwent EDT at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH). Patients were separated based on adherence (group 1, n = 70) and nonadherence (group 2, n = 50) to current resuscitative guidelines, and group survival rates were determined. These 2 groups were analyzed based on outcome to determine the effect of a strict policy of adherence on survival.
   Results. Of EDTs performed during the study period, 41.7% (50/120) were considered outside current guide-lines. Patients in group 2 were less likely to have traditional predictors of survival. There were 6 survivors in group 1 (8.7%), all of whom were neurologically intact; there were no neurologically intact survivors in group 2 (p = 0.04). The presence of a thoracic surgeon in the operating room (OR) was associated with increased survival (p = 0.039).
   Conclusions. A policy of strict adherence to EDT guidelines based on current national guidelines would have accounted for all potential survivors while avoiding the harmful exposure of health care personnel to blood-borne pathogens and the futile use of resources for trauma victims unable to benefit from them. Cardiothoracic surgeons should be familiar with current EDT guidelines because they are often asked to contribute their operative skills for those patients who survive to reach the OR.

TI  - Mortality in paediatric burns at the Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH), Adelaide, South Australia: 1960-2017
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Background: Burn injuries are the third leading cause of preventable death in children worldwide, resulting in over 100 000 annual hospitalisations. In the paediatric population, scalds are the commonest mechanism and burn injuries of greater than 40% total burn surface area (TBSA) are associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate.
   Aims: The aim of this study was to review mortality in paediatric burns in a tertiary burns centre over a 60-year period, providing an understanding of local causes of mortality and directing future clinical research.
   Methods: We reviewed data collected prospectively from patients treated for burn injuries at the WCH from 1960 to 2017. Data of age, gender, mechanism of injury and TBSA were collected. TBSA of 40% and greater were included in the study.
   Results: All patients with total burn surface area (TBSA) less than 40% survived. There were a total of 75 patients who sustained burns of or greater than 40% TBSA. Overall mortality was 34% (26 of 75) of which 24 occurred in the 1960s. Of the 21 patients who died of flame burn injuries, 12 of them were described as clothes catching alight from being in close proximity to the source of flame. Average length of stay for patients who did not survive was 7 days (1-26).
   Conclusion: Mortality has since declined and the prognosis for survival good, even in TBSA of greater than 90%. The investigations in fabric flammability led by Dr Thomas Pressley and Mr Murray Clarke prompted the rewriting of Australian standards for production of children's clothing. This, in combination with advances in paediatric resuscitation, surgical techniques as well as wound care has improved survival rates and outcomes in extensive burn injuries. Future studies focus to see not only better survival rates, but also better aesthetic and functional outcomes in burn survivors. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Amputation trends in military personnel during the israel-hamas war in 2023-24
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Objective: To characterize the mechanisms, distribution, and outcomes of traumatic limb amputations among military casualties during the Israel-Hamas War, and to evaluate the association between life-saving interventions and survival. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from the Israel Defense Forces Trauma Registry. The cohort included 3253 urgent battlefield casualties who sustained limb injuries and were treated by IDF medical forces between October 27th, 2023 and October 31st, 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were anatomical distribution of amputations, mechanism of injury, application of life-saving interventions (tourniquet, whole blood, freeze-dried plasma), and survival on the way to hospital admission and during hospitalization. Results: Of 3253 casualties, 135 (4.2 %) were initially recorded as having amputations. After review, 112 cases were confirmed to involve at least one amputated limb. Explosive devices were the leading cause of injury among amputees (88.9 %). Among the 112 confirmed cases, 50 (44.6 %) survived until hospital admission, and 62 (55.4 %) were pronounced dead prior to hospital arrival; 4 of the survivors died during hospitalization. Tourniquets were applied in 90 % of survivors compared to 24.2 % of deceased (p < 0.001). Whole blood and FDP were administered more frequently in survivors (60 % and 40 %, respectively) than in deceased casualties (9.7 % and 4.8 %, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Above-knee amputations were the most common anatomical level in both groups. Conclusion and Relevance: Combat-related limb amputations during the Israel-Hamas War were primarily caused by explosions and were associated with high mortality. Prompt application of life-saving interventions, particularly tourniquets and early blood resuscitation, was strongly associated with survival. These findings emphasize the critical need for rapid hemorrhage control and trauma care readiness in modern military conflict settings.

TI  - Treatment of meningococcal purpura fulminans
T2  - ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE
CP  - 17th Annual Meeting of the Groupe-de-Pathologie-Infectieuse-Pediatrique
AB  - In France, the incidence of meningococcal infections is increasing. The most severe presentation, called purpura fulminans, has a death rate of 20-25%; 5 to 20% of the survivors need skin grafts and/or amputations. Diagnosis of invasive meningococcal infection is very difficult when purpura and "toxic" appearance are absent. one should take into account parents' impression of their ill child. This diagnosis must be evoked in any child presenting with febrile purpura (like in the United Kingdom, parents should be encouraged to use the "tumbler test" to identify a vasculitic rash); a fulminant form is to be suspected in the presence of only one ecchymosis and signs of infection, remembering that recognition of shock is difficult in children. Recently, the Health Authority has recommended to administer a third generation cephalosporin promptly (before biological investigations) for any child with signs of infection and a necrotic or ecchymotic purpura (> 3 mm of diameter), and then to refer the patient to the hospital. By grouping the patients from 7 studies, it can be observed that preadmission antibiotic administration has a protective effect on mortality (odds ratio: 0.36; 95% confidence interval. 0.23-0.56); a negative effect was observed in only one of these series. Children with purpura fulminans should be referred to a paediatric intensive care unit. Management includes antibiotics, steroids, fluid resuscitation and catecholamines (be aware of hypoglycaemia, particularly in infants, and hypocalcaemia). Treatment of cutaneous necrosis and distal ischemia is difficult and still controversial: antithrombin, protein C, tissue plasminogen activator and vasodilator infusion have no proven efficacy. Cases must be rapidly notified to the Public Health Service who will institute chemoprophylaxis for close contacts. Given the predominance of serogroup B in France, we hope that an efficient vaccine will soon become available. (C) 2001 Editions scientitiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

TI  - Experiences of Alaska Native people living with burn injury and opportunities for health system strengthening
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundInjuries are a leading cause of death and disability for Alaska Native (AN) people. Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) is supporting the development of a burn care system that includes a partnership between Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) in Anchorage, AK and UW Medicine Regional Burn Center at Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in Seattle, WA. We aimed to better understand the experiences of AN people with burn injuries across the care continuum to aid development of culturally appropriate care regionalization.MethodsWe performed focus groups with twelve AN people with burn injury and their caregivers. A multidisciplinary team of burn care providers, qualitative research experts, AN care coordinator, and AN cultural liaison led focus groups to elicit experiences across the burn care continuum. Transcripts were analyzed using a phenomenological approach and inductive coding to understand how AN people and families navigated the medical and community systems for burn care and areas for improvement.ResultsThree themes were identified: 1-Challenges with local burn care in remote communities including limited first aid, triage, pain management, and wound care, as well as long-distance transport to definitive care; 2-Divergence between cultural values and medical practices that generated mistrust in the medical system, isolation from their support systems, and recovery goals that were not aligned with their needs; 3-Difficulty accessing emotional health support and a survivor community that could empower their resilience.ConclusionParticipants reported modifiable barriers to culturally competent treatment for burn injuries among AN people. The findings can inform initiatives that leverage existing resources, including expansion of the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) telementoring program, promulgation of the Phoenix Society Survivors Offering Assistance in Recovery (SOAR) to AK, coordination of regionalized care to reduce time away from AK and provide more comfortable community reintegration, and define rehabilitation goals in terms that align with personal goals and subsistence lifestyle skills. Long-distance transport times are non-modifiable, but better pre-hospital care could be achieved by harnessing existing telehealth services and adapting principles of prolonged field care to allow for triage, initial care, and resuscitation in remote environments.

TI  - Emergency thoracotomy: Appropriate use in the resuscitation of trauma patients
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
CP  - 44th Annual Meeting of the Midwest-Surgical-Association
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of emergency thoracotomy in our institution in an effort to determine whether this procedure is both beneficial and cost effective in blunt and/or penetrating trauma. We conducted a retrospective review of charts and coroner's reports. Our setting was a Level I trauma center in a tertiary-care facility. We examined the cases of trauma patients presenting to the trauma center over a 2-year period. Of 2490 patients who presented to the emergency department over the study period 41 underwent early thoracotomy. Twelve of these were excluded from the study because their cases were not truly emergent. Of the remaining 29 ten were admitted for penetrating injuries and 19 for blunt injuries. The average Injury Severity Scores for penetrating and blunt injuries were 30 and 40 respectively. There were four blunt trauma patients who died in the emergency department, 15 went to the operating room, and five who survived to go to the intensive care unit. All blunt trauma patients requiring emergency thoracotomy died within 9 days of presentation. Of the ten penetrating wound patients two died in the emergency department, four died in the operating room, and four went to the intensive care unit after surgery. One of the four patients who went to the intensive care unit died approximately 6 days after injury. The other three patients survived and are now living normal productive lives. All survivors of penetrating trauma who required emergency thoracotomy had their procedure performed in the operating room. Overall survival rates for penetrating and blunt trauma were 30 and 0 per cent respectively. Pericardial tamponade was found in 50 per cent of the penetrating trauma patients (two of the three survivors) and four of 19 of the blunt trauma patients. This reinforces the importance of a prompt pericardiotomy upon opening the chest. At our institution the algorithm for emergency thoracotomy is liberal and is not cost effective for blunt trauma. We need to re-evaluate our decision-making process concerning the use of emergency thoracotomy especially in the blunt trauma patient. The review also shows the importance of pericardiotomy when performing an emergency thoracotomy.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of regional oxygen saturation to estimate central venous saturation in sepsis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
AB  - Current treatment guidelines for sepsis claim an early goal-directed hemodynamic optimization including fluid resuscitation, use of vasopressors and inotropic agents. We investigated the correlation between the prominent treatment goal central venous saturation (ScvO(2)) and the frontal and the thenar regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Secondary, we examined the value of ScvO(2), lactate levels and rSO(2) as surrogate markers of an impaired tissue oxygenation for outcome prediction in sepsis. This prospective, observational study was performed at the surgical intensive care unit of the University Hospital Giessen. A total of 50 patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock were included. ScvO(2), rSO(2) and lactate were measured at sepsis diagnosis (baseline), 24 and 48 h, thereafter. We investigated the predictive value of frontal and thenar rSO(2) for a decreased SvcO(2) under 70 %. For survivor and non-survivors ScvO(2), rSO(2) and lactate were analysed. Patients with ScvO(2) > 70 % showed a trend to higher levels of fontal rSO(2) (62.81 +/- A 8.06 vs. 53.54 +/- A 15.48; p = 0.058). ROC-analysis revealed a minor prediction of a decreased ScvO(2) by frontal rSO(2) levels at baseline (AUC = 0.687; 95 % CI 0.511-0.863; p = 0.047). Combined measurements of lactate and ScvO2 showed significantly elevated mortality for patients with ScvO2 a parts per thousand yen70 % and lactate levels a parts per thousand yen2.5 mmol/l (log rank test p = 0.004). In the group with ScvO(2) < 70 % and lactate levels < 2.5 mmol/l no patients died during the observation period. Frontal rSO(2) correlates with ScvO(2) but both frontal and thenar rSO2 do not exactly discriminate between patients with high or low ScvO2 in sepsis. The combination of elevated lactate > 2.5 mmol/l and ScvO(2) > 70 % is highly associated with poor outcome in ICU patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock.

TI  - Incidence and pyognosis of intyaabdominal hypeytension in a mixed population of critically ill patients: A multiple-center epidemiological study
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CP  - 14th Annual Congress of the European-Society-of-Intensive-Care-Medicine
AB  - Objective: Intraabdominal hypertension is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in surgical and trauma patients. The aim of this study was to assess, in a mixed population of critically ill patients, whether intraabdominal pressure at admission was an independent predictor for mortality and to evaluate the effects of intraabdominal hypertension on organ functions.
   Design: Multiple-center, prospective epidemiologic study.
   Setting: Fourteen intensive care units in six countries.
   Patients: A total of 265 consecutive patients admitted for > 24 hrs during the 4-wk study period.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Intraabdominal pressure was measured twice daily via the bladder. Data recorded on admission were the patient demographics with Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and type of admission; during intensive care stay, Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score and intraabdominal pressure were measure daily together with fluid balance. Nonsurvivors had a significantly higher mean intraabdominal pressure on admission than survivors: 11.4 +/- 4.8 vs 9.5 +/- 4.8 mm Hg. Independent predictor for mortality were age (odds ratio, 1.04: 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.06; p = .003), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.15; p < .0001), type of intensive care unit admission (odds ratio, 2.5 medical vs. surgical; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.16; p = .01), and the presence of liver dysfunction (confidence ration, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-5.8; p = .04). The occurrence of intraabdominal hypertension during the intensive care unit stay was also an independent predictor of mortality (relative risk, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.06; p = .01) had significantly higher Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores during the intensive care unit stay than patients without intraabdominal hypertension.
   Conclusions: Intraabdominal hypertension on admission was associated with severe organ dysfunction during the intesive care unit stay. The mean intraabdominal pressure on admission was not an independent risk factor for mortality; however, the occurrence of intraabdominal hypertension during the intensive care unit stay was an independent outcome predictor.

TI  - Evaluating the clinical impact of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta in patients with blunt trauma with hemorrhagic shock and coexisting traumatic brain injuries: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Background: The impact of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) on traumatic brain injuries remains uncertain, with potential outcomes ranging from neuroprotection to exacerbation of the injury. The study aimed to evaluate consciousness recovery in patients with blunt trauma, shock, and traumatic brain injuries. Material and methods: Data were obtained from the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program from 2017 to 2019. During the study period, 3 138 896 trauma registries were examined, and 16 016 adult patients with blunt trauma, shock, and traumatic brain injuries were included. Among these, 176 (1.1%) underwent REBOA. Comparisons were conducted between patients with and without REBOA after implementing 1:3 propensity score matching to mitigate disparities. The primary outcome was the highest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score during admission. The secondary outcomes encompassed the volume of blood transfusion, the necessity for hemostatic interventions and therapeutic neurosurgery, and the mortality rate. Results: Through well-balanced propensity score matching, a notable difference in mortality rate was observed, with 59.7% in the REBOA group and 48.7% in the non-REBOA group (P=0.015). In the REBOA group, the median 4 h red blood cell transfusion was significantly higher (2800 ml [1500-4908] vs. 1300 ml [600-2500], P<0.001). The REBOA group required lesser hemorrhagic control surgeries (31.8 vs. 47.7%, P<0.001). The incidence of therapeutic neurosurgery was 5.1% in the REBOA group and 8.7% in the non-REBOA group (P=0.168). Among survivors in the REBOA group, the median highest GCS score during admission was significantly greater for both total (11 [8-14] vs. 9 [6-14], P=0.036) and motor components (6 [4-6] vs. 5 [4-6], P=0.037). The highest GCS score among the survivors with predominant pelvic injuries was not different between the two groups (11 [8-13] vs. 11 [7-14], P=0.750). Conclusions: Patients experiencing shock and traumatic brain injury have high mortality rates, necessitating swift resuscitation and prompt hemorrhagic control. The use of REBOA as an adjunct for bridging definitive hemorrhagic control may correlate with enhanced consciousness recovery.

TI  - Coagulation dysfunction of severe burn patients: A potential cause of death
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Background: Research on coagulation dysfunction following burns is controversial. This study aimed to describe the coagulation changes in severe burn patients by examining coagulation parameters.Methods: Patients with third-degree total body surface area (TBSA) burns of >= 30% were enrolled between 2017 and 2020. Platelet (PLT) count and coagulation indexes (including APTT, INR, FIB, DD, and AT III) were measured at admission and once weekly for 8 weeks, and statistical analysis was performed. The patient medical profiles were reviewed to ex-tract demographic and clinical data, including TBSA, third-degree TBSA, and inhalation injury. The total intravenous fluids and transfusions of crystalloids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and red blood cells (RBC) were calculated during the forty-eight-hour period. The number of sepsis cases was recorded.Results: We enrolled 104 patients , and while the overall coagulation trend fluctuated, in-flection points appeared around one week and demonstrated hypercoagulability. INR was significantly higher in the non-survival group than in the survivors' group from admission to three weeks after burn (all p < 0.01). From post-injury week 1 to post-injury week 3, the APTT in the non-survival group was greater than in the survival group, but the non-survival group's PLT count was lower than that in the survival group (all p < 0.05). At two and three weeks after burns, the FIB levels in the non-survival group were significantly lower than those of the survival group (both p < 0.01). The prevalence of inhalation injury and the proportion of sepsis cases were significantly higher in the non-survival group than in the survival group ( p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). At the time of death, APTT, INR, and FDP levels were significantly higher in the non-survival group in the survivor group, and FIB, ATIII, and PLT were significantly lower than in the survivor group (all p < 0.01). On the day of death, nine of the 12 dead patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).Conclusions: Coagulation dysfunction was most prominent in severe burn patients 1 week after injury and presented as hypercoagulability. Large-area burn injury, large amounts of fluid resuscitation, inhalation injury, and sepsis may all contribute to coagulation dys-function, which can further develop into DIC and even death in severe burns patients.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

TI  - Early source control of infection in patients seen in the emergency department: a systematic review
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE QUIMIOTERAPIA
AB  - Introduction and objective. The term source (or focus) control encompasses all those physical measures that can be used to reduce the inoculum and modify those factors in the infectious medium that promote microbial growth or foreign antimicrobial defenses of the host. The main objective of this systematic review (SR) is to know and compare whether early detection and control of the focus (in less than 6 hours) in adult patients treated in the ED for severe infection or sepsis, compared to not controlling the focus or delayed focus control (more than 12 hours) is more effective and safer (improves clinical evolution, mortality, complications, hospital stay or need for ICU admission).
   Method. A systematic review is carried out following the PRISMA regulations in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Lilacs, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, Tripdatabase and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2000 to December 31, 2023 without language restrictions and using a combination of MESH terms: "Source Control", "Early" "Infection OR Bacterial Infection OR Sepsis", "Emergencies OR Emergency OR Emergency Department" and "Adults". Observational cohort studies were included. No meta-analysis techniques were performed, but results were compared narratively.
   Results. A total of 1,658 articles were identified, of which 2 that met the inclusion criteria and were classified as high quality were finally analyzed. The included studies represent a total of 2,404 patients with 678 cases in which an intervention was performed to control the focus (28.20%). In the first study, 28-day mortality was lower in patients who underwent an intervention to control the focus (12.3% vs. 22.5%; P <0.001), with an adjusted HR of 0.538 (95% CI: 0.389-0.744; P<0.001). In the second, it was demonstrated that the time elapsed from when the patient was evaluated for the first time and was hemodynamically stabilized, until the start of surgery was associated with his survival at 60 days with an OR of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.19-0.45; P <0.0001). In fact, for each hour of delay an adjusted OR of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.16-0.47; P<0.0001) is established. So if the intervention is performed before 2 hours at 60 days, 98% of the patients are still alive, if it is performed between 2-4 hours it is reduced to 78%, if it is between 4-6 hours it drops to 55%, but if it is done for more than 6 hours there will be no survivors at 60 days.
   Conclusions. This review shows that source control carried out after the evaluation of patients attending the ED reduces short-term mortality (30-60 days) and that it would be advisable to implement any required source control intervention as soon as possible, ideally early (within 6 hours).

TI  - Is Shock Index Associated With Outcome in Children With Sepsis/Septic Shock?
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the association between PICU shock index (the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure) and PICU mortality in children with sepsis/septic shock. To explore cutoff values for shock index for ICU mortality, how change in shock index over the first 6 hours of ICU admission is associated with outcome, and how the use of vasoactive therapy may affect shock index and its association with outcome.
   Design: Retrospective cohort.
   Setting: Single-center tertiary PICU.
   Subjects: Five hundred forty-four children with the diagnosis of sepsis/septic shock.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: From January 2003 to December 2009, 544 children met International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference of 2005 criteria for sepsis/septic shock. Overall mortality was 23.7%. Among all patients, hourly shock index was associated with mortality: odds ratio of ICU mortality at 0 hour, 1.08, 95% CI (1.04-1.12); odds ratio at 1 hour, 1.09 (1.04-1.13); odds ratio at 2 hours, 1.09 (1.05-1.13); and odds ratio at 6 hours, 1.11 (1.06-1.15). When stratified by age, early shock index was associated with mortality only in children 1-3 and more than or equal to 12 years old. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in age 1-3 and more than or equal to 12 years old for shock index at admission was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.58-0.80) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.52-0.72) respectively, indicating a fair predictive marker. Although higher shock index was associated with increased risk of mortality, there was no particular cutoff value with adequate positive or negative likelihood ratios to identify mortality in any age group of children. The improvement of shock index in the first 6 hours of ICU admission was not associated with outcome when analyzed in all patients. However, among patients whose shock index were above the 50th percentile at ICU admission for each age group, improvement of shock index was associated with lower ICU mortality in children between 1-3 and more than or equal to 12 years old (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). When controlling for the use of vasoactive therapy within the first 6 hours with logistic regression analysis, shock index at hour 6 remained significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14).
   Conclusions: Shock index may have promise as a marker of mortality in children with sepsis/septic shock. Although there is no clear cutoff shock index to identify risk of mortality, given the higher risk of mortality as shock index increases, children with elevated shock index may benefit from more aggressive resuscitation and higher level of care.
