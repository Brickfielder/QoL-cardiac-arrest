wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Sex Differences in Patient-Reported Outcomes in the Immediate Recovery Period After Resuscitation: Findings From the Cross-sectional DenHeart Survey,"BackgroundA paucity of resuscitation studies have examined sex differences in patient-reported outcomes upon hospital discharge. It remains unclear whether male and female patients differ in health outcomes in their immediate responses to trauma and treatment after resuscitation.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to examine sex differences in patient-reported outcomes in the immediate recovery period after resuscitation.MethodsIn a national cross-sectional survey, patient-reported outcomes were measured by 5 instruments: symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire [B-IPQ]), symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ESAS]), quality of life (Heart Quality of Life Questionnaire), and perceived health status (12-Item Short Form Survey).ResultsOf 491 eligible survivors of cardiac arrest, 176 (80% male) participated. Compared with male, resuscitated female reported worse symptoms of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety score >= 8) (43% vs 23%; P = .04), emotional responses (B-IPQ) (mean [SD], 4.9 [3.12] vs 3.7 [2.99]; P = .05), identity (B-IPQ) (mean [SD], 4.3 [3.10] vs 4.0 [2.85]; P = .04), fatigue (ESAS) (mean [SD], 5.26 [2.48] vs 3.92 [2.93]; P = .01), and depressive symptoms (ESAS) (mean [SD], 2.60 [2.68] vs 1.67 [2.19]; P = .05).ConclusionsBetween sexes, female survivors of cardiac arrest reported worse psychological distress and illness perception and higher symptom burden in the immediate recovery period after resuscitation.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Preliminary Exploration of Long-Term Patient Outcomes After Tracheostomy in Burns: A Burn Model System Study,"Introduction: Upper airway management is crucial to burn care. Endotracheal intubation is often performed in the setting of inhalation injury, burns of the face and neck, or large burns requiring significant resuscitation. Tracheostomy may be necessary in patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support. This study compares long-term, patient-reported outcomes in burn patients with and without tracheostomy.Materials and methods: Data from the Burn Model System Database, collected from 2013 to 2020, were analyzed. Demographic and clinical data were compared between those with and without tracheostomy. The following patient-reported outcomes, collected at 6-, 12-, and 24-mo follow-up, were analyzed: Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure, employment status, and days to return to work. Regression models and propensitymatched analyses were used to assess the associations between tracheostomy and each outcome.Results: Of 714 patients included in this study, 5.5% received a tracheostomy. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated that only VR-12 Physical Component Summary scores at 24-mo follow-up were significantly worse among those requiring tracheostomy. Tracheostomy was not associated with VR-12 Mental Component Summary, Satisfaction with Life, Community Integration Questionnaire, or Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile Measure scores. Likewise, tracheostomy was not found to be independently associated with employment status or days to return to work.Conclusions: This preliminary exploration suggests that physical and psychosocial recovery, as well as the ability to regain employment, are no worse in burn patients requiring tracheostomy. Future investigations of larger scale are still needed to assess center- and provider-level influences, as well as the influences of various hallmarks of injury severity. Nonetheless, this work should better inform goals of care discussions with patients and families regarding the use of tracheostomy in burn injury.Published by Elsevier Inc.",JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH,2023,"Galicia, KE; Mehta, A; Kowalske, KJ; Gibran, NS; Stewart, BT; McMullen, K; Wolf, SE; Ryan, CM; Kubasiak, J; Schneider, JC",10.1016/j.jss.2023.06.005,,WOS:001045100500001,A

We hypothesized that patients undergoing definitive laparotomy (DEF) would have better PROs compared to those treated with damage control laparotomy (DCL). Methods: The DCL Trial randomized DEF versus DCL in abdominal trauma. PROs were measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D) questionnaire at discharge and six months postdischarge (1 = perfect health, 0 = death, and <0 = worse than death) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian. Unadjusted Bayesian analysis with a neutral prior was used to assess the posterior probability of achieving minimal clinically important difference. Results: Of 39 randomized patients (21 DEF versus 18 DCL), 8 patients died (7 DEF versus 1 DCL). Of those who survived, 28 completed the EQ-5D at discharge (12 DEF versus 16 DCL) and 25 at 6 mo (12 DEF versus 13 DCL). Most patients were male (79%) with a median age of 30 (interquartile range (IQR) 21-42), suffered blunt injury (56%), and were severely injured (median injury severity score 33, IQR 21 - 42). Median EQ-5D value at discharge was 0.20 (IQR 0.06 - 0.52) DEF versus 0.31 (IQR -0.03 - 0.43) DCL, and at six months 0.51 (IQR 0.30 0.74) DEF versus 0.50 (IQR 0.28 - 0.84) DCL.

Methods A national cross-sectional survey including patients with known cardiac disease at hospital discharge combined with national register data at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Loneliness was evaluated using one self-reported question, and information on cohabitation was available from national registers. Patient-reported outcomes were Short Form-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and HeartQoL. Clinical outcomes were 1-year cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation) and all-cause mortality from national registers. Results A total of 13 443 patients (53%) with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure or heart valve disease completed the survey. Of these, 70% were male, and mean age was 66.1 among women and 64.9 among men. Across cardiac diagnoses, loneliness was associated with significantly poorer patient-reported outcomes in men and women. Loneliness predicted all-cause mortality among women and men (HR 2.92 (95% CI 1.55 to 5.49) and HR 2.14 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.22), respectively). Living alone predicted cardiac events in men only (HR 1.39 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.85)). Conclusions A strong association between loneliness and poor patient-reported outcomes and 1-year mortality was found in both men and women across cardiac diagnoses. The results suggest that loneliness should be a priority for public health initiatives, and should also be included in clinical risk assessment in cardiac patients.",HEART,2020,"Christensen, AV; Juel, K; Ekholm, O; Thrysoe, L; Thorup, CB; Borregaard, B; Mols, RE; Rasmussen, TB; Berg, SK",10.1136/heartjnl-2019-315460,,WOS:000507619400014,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,"Is frailty associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest? - A Swedish cohort study","Background: Frailty is associated with poor 30-days survival after in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.Methods: Patients aged >= 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Results: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, respectively, p-value < 0.01).Conclusion: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and poorer general health.",RESUSCITATION,2022,"Jonsson, H; Piscator, E; Israelsson, J; Lilja, G; Djaerv, T",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2022.07.013,,WOS:000880404500011,A

To address this critical practice gap, we plan a mixed-methods study to co-produce and evaluate a new cardiac arrest-specific patient/survivor-reported outcome measure (PROM). Methods: International guidelines have informed a two-stage, iterative, and interactive process. Stage one will establish what is important to measure following cardiac arrest. A meta-ethnography of published qualitative research and a qualitative exploration of the experiences of survivors and their key supporters will inform the development of a measurement framework. This will be supple-mented by existing, extensive reviews describing concepts that have previously been measured in this population. Focus groups with survivors, key supporters, and healthcare professionals, followed by further interviews with survivors and key supporters, will inform the iterative refinement of the framework, candidate items, and PROM structure. Stage two will involve a psychometric evaluation following completion by a large cohort of survivors. Measurement theory will inform: the identifica-tion of items that best measure important outcomes; item reduction; and provide robust evidence of measurement and practical properties.Discussion: An international, collaborative approach to PROM development will engage survivors, key supporters, researchers, and health pro-fessionals from study commencement. Successful co-production of the cardiac arrest survivorship and health-related quality of life (CASHQoL) mea-sure will provide a robust, relevant, and internationally applicable measure, suitable for completion by adult survivors, and integration into research, registries, and routine care settings.Ethical approval: University of Warwick Biomedical & Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 22/20-21 granted 10/11/20).",RESUSCITATION PLUS,2022,"Haywood, KL; Southern, C; Tutton, E; Swindell, P; Ellard, D; Pearson, NA; Parsons, H; Couper, K; Dainty, KN; Agarwal, S; Perkins, G",10.1016/j.resplu.2022.100288,,WOS:000850959900001,A

A nationwide registry study from Norway,"Introduction: Self-perceived health status data is usually collected using patient-reported outcome measures. Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out -ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate. Results: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 +/- 0.24 vs 0.82 +/- 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 +/- 21 vs 79 +/- 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension.

Patients with normal or mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF >= 40%) will be randomized to open-label treatment with beta-blockers or no such therapy. The event-driven trial will randomize similar to 5700 patients and continue until 950 primary endpoints have occurred. As of July 2023, 5228 patients have been randomized. Of the first 4000 patients randomized, median age was 62 years, 79% were men, 48% had a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and 84% had a normal LVEF. The primary endpoint is a composite of adjudicated recurrent MI, incident heart failure (HF), coronary revascularization, ischaemic stroke, all-cause mortality, malignant ventricular arrhythmia, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The primary safety endpoint includes a composite of recurrent MI, HF, all-cause mortality, malignant ventricular arrhythmia, or resuscitated cardiac arrest 30 days after randomization. Secondary endpoints include each of the components of the primary endpoint, patient-reported outcomes, and other clinical outcomes linked to beta-blocker therapy. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.

An outcome central to survivorship is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to the determinants of HRQoL of OHCA survivors.Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 15 August 2022 to identify studies investigating the asso-ciation of at least one determinant and HRQoL in adult OHCA survivors. All articles were independently reviewed by two investigators. We abstracted data pertaining to determinants and classified them using a well-established HRQoL theoretical framework - the Wilson and Cleary (re-vised) model.Results: 31 articles assessing a total of 35 determinants were included. Determinants were classified into the five domains in the HRQoL model. 26 studies assessed determinants related to individual characteristics (n = 3), 12 studied biological function (n = 7), nine studied symptoms (n = 3), 16 studied functioning (n = 5), and 35 studied characteristics of the environment (n = 17). In studies that included multivariable analyses, most reported that individual characteristics (older age, female sex), symptoms (anxiety, depression), and functioning (impaired neurocognitive function) were sig-nificantly associated with poorer HRQoL.Conclusions: Individual characteristics, symptoms, and functioning played significant roles in explaining the variability in HRQoL. Significant non-modifiable determinants such as age and sex could be used to identify populations at risk of poorer HRQoL, while significant modifiable determinants such as psychological health and neurocognitive functioning could serve as targets for post-discharge screening and rehabilitation plans.",RESUSCITATION,2023,"Pek, PP; Fan, KC; Ong, MEH; Luo, N; Ostbye, T; Lim, SL; Ho, AF",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109794,,WOS:001001962600001,A

The rationale relates to concerns about lack of awareness of patients regarding their functioning. However, although lack of awareness occurs in some patients with severe TBI, or in TBI involving certain lesion locations, or very soon after injury, this conclusion has been overgeneralized. The objective of this study is to determine the validity of patient-reported health-related quality of life by evaluating its relationship to injury severity and more objective indices of outcome, in a representative series of adults with TBI. A consecutive sample of 374 persons with TBI at least 14 years old, and having a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score 12, an acute seizure, or a CT scan showing TBI- related findings. Seventy-six percent (374/491) of the eligible survivors were assessed at 6 months post-injury on the Life Satisfaction Survey. The greatest decrease in satisfaction was in the ability to think and remember, work, receive adequate income, and participate in leisure and recreational activities. Dissatisfaction significantly related to the functional limitation in that area as judged by the patients themselves (p<0.001) or by someone who knew them well (p0.001). The most severely injured group reported the most dissatisfaction for 13 out of 17 areas assessed.

Two more randomized trials have since been published in 2022 and 2023. Based on the combined findings and review of the evidence, an international panel of authors identified gaps in science, inequities in care and diversity in outcomes, and suggested research opportunities and next steps. The science pertaining to ECPR would benefit from the United States contributing uniform data to existing registries and sharing common data with the ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) international registry to increase the sample size for observational research. In addition, well-designed efficacy trials, recruiting across different regions of care evaluating long-term follow-up, including patient reported outcomes, cost effectiveness, and equity measures, would contribute significantly to the body of science. Workshop participants defined the population of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest most likely to benefit from ECPR. ECPR-eligible patients include those aged 18 to 75 years functioning independently without comorbidity; before suffering a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without any obvious cause of the cardiac arrest; presenting in a shockable rhythm and transported with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation to an ECPR-capable institute within 30 minutes, which is recommended after 3 rounds of advanced life support treatment without return of spontaneous circulation.

A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomised clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritised through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterised relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with >= 1 tools from Health Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources allow.

At 6 months, survivors at 61 sites in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland were invited to a follow-up. The participants answered two questions on self-reported physical activity. Answers were categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of physical activity and further dichotomized into a low versus moderate/high level of physical activity. Potential risk factors for a low level of physical activity were collected and investigated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results: At 6 months, 807 of 939 (86%) OHCA survivors answered the two questions of physical activity; 34% reported a low, 44% moderate and 22% high level of physical activity.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are considered as standard care for patients with increased risk of arrhythmias. However, 1 in 4 ICD patients experiences psychological distress post-ICD implantation. The WEB-based distress management program for ICD patients (WEBCARE) was developed to mitigate anxiety and depression and enhance health-related quality of life in ICD patients. This study investigates the 6-and 12-months outcomes. Method: A total of 289 consecutive ICD patients from 6 referral hospitals in the Netherlands were randomized to either the WEBCARE (n = 146) or usual care (n = 143) group. Patients in the WEBCARE group received an online, 12-weeks fixed, 6 lesson behavioral treatment based on problem solving therapy. Patients in the usual care group receive care as usual. Results: Current findings show no significant difference on anxiety, depression or quality of life between the WEBCARE and Usual Care group at 6-and 12-months postimplantation. Conclusions: In this clinical trial of a Web-based behavioral intervention for ICD patients, the Web-based treatment was not superior to usual care on the long-term regarding patient reported outcomes.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,COSCA (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Adults An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation,"Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomized clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritized through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterized relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with >= 1 tools from Health Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources allow.",CIRCULATION,2018,"Haywood, K; Whitehead, L; Nadkarni, VM; Achana, F; Beesems, S; Böttiger, BW; Brooks, A; Castrén, M; Ong, MEH; Hazinski, MF; Koster, RW; Lilja, G; Long, J; Monsieurs, KG; Morley, PT; Morrison, L; Nichol, G; Oriolo, V; Saposnik, G; Smyth, M; Spearpoint, K; Williams, B; Perkins, GD",10.1161/CIR.0000000000000562,,WOS:000434255300002,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,In-depth assessment of health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest,"Introduction: Evidence on physical and psychological well-being of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survivors is scarce. The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Methods: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Results: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5). Discussion: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We included survivors from the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial, who completed EQ-5D-5L at 6 months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the hypothesised unidimensional latent structure of EQ level sum score (EQ LSS), summarizing scores across Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/depression. Differential item functioning was evaluated for age. We examined internal consistency and precision for the EQ LSS. We evaluated construct validity of EQ LSS, EQ value and EQ VAS, using the modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, representing functional outcome and cognitive function-two common health challenges experienced by OHCA survivors. Results: 783 of 939 (84%) eligible survivors were included. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit and strong factor loadings for all dimensions (0.61-0.90). We observed a significant but negligible effect of age on Mobility (b = 0.29, p < 0.001, Delta R-2 = 0.019). Internal consistency was 0.88. The floor effect was 35%. Survivors with more functional dependency and/or cognitive problems reported significantly worse health by EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS (all, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The psychometric properties of EQ LSS support its use to measure health status in OHCA research.

Methods: In this retrospective single-survey study, 198 patients completed the EHP-30 and the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) Global Health validated questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 8-10 years after index surgery. Results: Demographic comparison revealed significant differences in racial demographics and disability status between the EACPP and OCPP groups. There was no significant difference in EHP-30, PROMIS Global Physical, or Global Mental scores between the two groups. Patients with lower stage endometriosis (stage I/II) reported diminished HRQoL in the EHP-30 and Global Physical scores as compared to patients with higher stage (stage III/IV) endometriosis or OCR Additionally, no differences were found between incidence of abuse history and EHP-30 and PROM IS scores between the two groups. Higher age and higher PROMIS Global Physical scores were associated with lower pain and higher HRQoL scores on the EHP-30. Persistently high rates of sexual dysfunction were seen across both groups. Discussion: This study demonstrates that women with EACPP and OCPP appear to have similar natural histories and quality of life on long term follow-up.

Mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. In addition to survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key outcome parameter for OHCA patients.Methods and results The analysis included 169 survivors from the TOMAHAWK trial who completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up (6M-FU/12M-FU). HRQoL was assessed using a questionnaire based on the EuroQoL-5D-3L. This tool includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best imaginable subjective health) and a descriptive system with five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No relevant differences were found between patients in the immediate angiography group and those in the delayed/selective angiography group regarding EQ-VAS scores at 6M-FU (70 +/- 21 vs. 74 +/- 18) and 12M-FU (72 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 17). Patients reported the most problems with usual activities (33% and 38%, respectively), and the fewest limitations in self-care (18% and 17%, respectively) at 6M-FU. Women reported more problems than men in all five dimensions. Elderly patients (>= 65 years) were more likely than younger OHCA survivors to indicate limitations in mobility, self-care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort.Conclusion OHCA survivors of the TOMAHAWK trial rated their HRQoL 6 and 12 months after the event as relatively good, but there were notable differences between women and men and between younger and elderly patients.

Although clinical guidelines recommend structured post-cardiac arrest follow-up, such follow-up is often lacking or inconsistent. Tailored digital interventions are scarce but may help address gaps in follow-up resources. The CARDIS trial evaluates the effects on patient-reported outcome measures of a co-created, web-based support programme designed to improve wellbeing, self management, and reintegration into everyday life for cardiac arrest survivors. Methods: CARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling cardiac arrest survivors aged >18 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard post-cardiac arrest care, including a routine followup visit with screening and management of cognitive, physical and emotional health, as well as a printed booklet. The intervention group will additionally receive access to a webbased selfguided support programme for 3 months. After study completion, control participants will be offered the programme. Outcomes: Primary outcome is overall wellbeing and health (QWB) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported cognitive problems, HRQoL, life satisfaction, symptoms of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. A process evaluation will evaluate social selection bias, adherence and participants experiences. Discussion: The CARDIS trial will investigate the use of more accessible and standardised follow-up pathways by complementing existing care structures, thereby enhancing equity in long-term recovery and quality-of-life without requiring additional healthcare resources. The process evaluation will provide data on adherence, social selection, and engagement, essential for future implementation.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Perioperative medicine: The outlook,"Perioperative medicine, a natural extension of anesthesiology and critical care, is emerging as a pivotal specialty in response to an aging population, rising comorbidities, and the growth of minimally invasive and outpatient surgery. Its goal is to design individualized care pathways that integrate prehabilitation, post-hospital follow-up, and city-hospital coordination to ensure safe recovery, particularly for high-risk patients. The structuring of these pathways relies on multidisciplinary teams and the creation of dedicated ""care pathway team"" capable of anticipating patient needs, preparing discharge, and streamlining communication between hospital and community providers. Indicators, long viewed merely as quality control tools, are evolving into levers for anticipation, decision-making, and personalization of care, particularly through the integration of patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs, PREMs). The rise of digital health and artificial intelligence opens major opportunities: early detection of complications, virtual patient modeling, clinical decision support, and connected follow-up. Their success, however, depends on interoperable information systems, high-quality data, and active medical oversight to mitigate bias. Over the next thirty years, anesthesiology, resuscitation, and perioperative medicine will need to combine pharmacological and technological innovation with environmental sustainability - reducing the carbon footprint of clinical practices - while also improving caregivers' quality of life.

Methods: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted across three heart centers in Denmark. While in-hospital, OHCA survivors were screened for cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and traumatic distress using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised. At three-month follow-up, fatigue severity was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS >= 4 indicates clinically important fatigue. Logistic regression models were applied. Results: Overall, 173 survivors were included (mean age 63.1 +/- 11.7 years). At follow-up, the median FSS score was 3.2 points (IQR 2-9) and 42 % of survivors presented with clinically important fatigue (FSS >= 4). Those with fatigue were more often female, had longer hospital stays, reported greater in-hospital symptoms of anxiety, depression and traumatic distress, poorer sleep quality and health-related quality of life at follow-up.

Whether cognitive impairment at hospital discharge is associated with recovery defined as functional status and fatigue measured at 1-month post-discharge is not known. Methods: Consecutive CA patients admitted at an academic center (May 14, 2021-June 23, 2023) were assessed for cognitive impairment (modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-m < 33) and depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire) at hospital discharge. Poor functional status (primary outcome; modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3) and fatigue severity (patient-reported outcome; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were assessed 1-month post-discharge.

Methods: We present data from survivors aged 18-50 years registered with OHCA in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017. Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise habits prior to OHCA.

Results: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised >5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly (p < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical-and mental health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting >5 hours of exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less.

HRQoL impairments were frequently reported, particularly in pain/discomfort (60.5% [95% CI 57.9-63.0%; I-2 = 37.6%]), usual activities (52.6% [95% CI 50.0-55.2%; I-2 = 0.0%]), and anxiety/depression (49.0% [95% CI 46.4-51.6%; I-2 = 0.0%]). Cognitive impairments were reported in one study. Substantial statistical heterogeneity (I-2 > 75%) was observed across most analyses. Wide variation in outcome measures, follow-up duration, and reporting methods limited synthesis.

At the data cutoff (DCO) of the prior publications, 65% of participants were still receiving treatment. This report presents up to 5 years of additional safety and efficacy data from these studies. Methods This manuscript includes data from the phase 1 and phase 2, stratum 1 study which included participants with clinically significant PN-related morbidity. Participants received continuous selumetinib dosing (1 cycle = 28 days). Safety and efficacy data through February 27, 2021 are included. PN response assessed by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis: Confirmed partial response (cPR) >= 20% decrease from baseline on 2 consecutive evaluations. Phase 2 participants completed patient-reported outcome measures assessing tumor pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale-11) and interference of pain in daily life (pain interference index). Results For the 74 children (median age 10.3 years; range 3-18.5) enrolled, overall cPR rate was 70% (52/74); median duration of treatment was 57.5 cycles (range 1-100). Responses were generally sustained with 59% (44) lasting >= 12 cycles. Tumor pain intensity (n = 19, P = .015) and pain interference (n = 18, P = .0059) showed durable improvement from baseline to 48 cycles. No new safety signals were identified; however, some developed known selumetinib-related adverse events (AEs) for the first time after several years of treatment. Conclusions With up to 5 years of additional selumetinib treatment, most children with NF1-related PN had durable tumor shrinkage and sustained improvement in pain beyond that previously reported at 1 year. No new safety signals were identified; however, ongoing monitoring for known selumetinib-related AEs is needed while treatment continues.",NEURO-ONCOLOGY,2023,"Gross, AM; Dombi, E; Wolters, PL; Baldwin, A; Dufek, A; Herrera, K; Martin, S; Derdak, J; Heisey, KS; Whitcomb, PM; Steinberg, SM; Venzon, DJ; Fisher, MJ; Kim, A; Bornhorst, M; Weiss, BD; Blakeley, JO; Smith, MA; Widemann, BC",10.1093/neuonc/noad086,,WOS:000993375500001,A

Objectives were to (i) describe item-and scale-level response patterns, and (ii) evaluate the preliminary construct validity of the ECR-RS, including its dimensional (structural), known-groups, and convergent validity. Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional validation study, with OHCA survivors completing the ECR-RS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the mental health component from the Short Form-12 (SF-12 MCS) three months post-arrest. Descriptive statistics and floor/ceiling analyses were performed. Dimensional validity was assessed using response distribution patterns and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by reliability using Cronbach's as. Known-group validity was tested using a priori hypotheses, Spearman's correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Convergent validity was evaluated by correlating ECR-RS total scores with HADS and SF-12 MCS. Results: Among 123 survivors (median age 59.9 years, 84 % male), ECR-RS total scores were low on both subscales and floor effects were observed at scale level (31 % for avoidant and 72 % for anxious attachment). EFA supported the expected two-factor structure, though item 4-6 showed poor loadings/cross-loadings. Internal consistency was acceptable (total scale Cronbach's a = 0.88) and improved when problematic items were excluded. Known-group hypotheses were not supported. Anxious attachment correlated moderately with symptoms of anxiety and depression and was inversely correlated with mental health scores. Conclusion: The ECR-RS demonstrated partial construct validity among OHCA survivors, but item-level inconsistencies and pronounced floor effects limit its utility.

Methods This is a cohort-based secondary analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial, an international, prospective, multicentre study. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (1-9): fit (1-3), prefrail (4), frail (5), and severely frail (6-9). Main outcomes were mortality and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 6 and 24 months. Additional outcomes included neuroprognostication, withdrawal-of-life-sustaining-therapies (WLST), functional decline (retrospectively reported pre-arrest versus 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score), health status (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and life satisfaction at 6 and 24 months. Results Of 1861 participants, 240 (13%) were prefrail, and 188 (10%) were frail or severely frail. Mortality and poor functional outcome increased significantly with greater frailty. Compared to fit participants, adjusted ORs (95% CI) for 6 month mortality were: prefrail 2.7 (1.8-3.8), frail 3.7 (1.9-7.1), and severely frail 8.9 (4.2-18.7); and poor functional outcome: prefrail 2.9 (1.9-4.2), frail 3.9 (1.9-8.1), and severely frail 35.4 (8.4-148.8). Severely frail participants underwent neuroprognostication less often (p < 0.001), while WLST was more common in the prefrail, frail and severely frail (p < 0.001). Prefrail and frail survivors tended to report more frequent functional decline and lower health status, though with individual variation. Conclusion Frailty was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

The Department of Defense funded the Coalition for National Trauma Research to generate a comprehensive research agenda spanning the continuum of trauma/burn care from prehospital to rehabilitation. The Burn/Reconstructive Surgery group represents one focus area for this research agenda development. METHODS Experts in burn and reconstructive surgery research identified gaps in knowledge, generated research questions and prioritized questions using a consensus driven Delphi survey approach. Participants were identified using established Delphi recruitment guidelines to ensure heterogeneity and generalizability with military and civilian representatives. Literature reviews informed the panel. Panelists were encouraged to use a PICO format to generate research questions: Patient/Population; Intervention; Compare/Control; Outcome. Participants ranked the priority of each question on a nine-point Likert scale, which was categorized to represent low, medium, and high priority items. Consensus was defined based on >= 60% panelist agreement. RESULTS Subject matter experts generated 949 research questions in 29 Burn & 26 Reconstruction topics. Five hundred ninety-seven questions reached consensus. Of these, 338 (57%) were high-priority, 180 (30%), medium-priority, and 78 (13%) low-priority questions. CONCLUSION Many high-priority questions translate to complex wound management and outcomes. Panel recognition that significant gaps in knowledge exist in understanding functional outcomes after injury underscores the importance of long-term recovery metrics even when studying acute injury or interventions such as resuscitation or inhalation injury.

Risk factors of such states is diabetes mellitus (DM), considered one of the most widespread health-related problems of the 21st century. Orthopedists perform big joint replacements that usually concern older adults and therefore often deal with patients suffering from comorbidities. DM is frequently one of them and can furthermore often remain underdiagnosed. The other risk for complication is a rapid beginning of the rehabilitation which starts on the day following the surgery. To eliminate the debilitating impact of DM and hypoglycemia on surgical patients, we aim to investigate the relationship between the glycemia values and the postoperative outcomes in certain periods of time in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will have inserted a glycemia measuring device (Dexcom G5, Inc., San Diego, CA) in the periods of time. First time it will take place 14 days prior to the surgery and right after the surgery for the second time for the period of another 14 days. All patients will undergo standard total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty procedures. Patients will be assessed preoperatively and 14 days, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The assessment of the joint condition will consist of: patient-reported outcomes (The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Harris Hip Score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]); assessment of potential SSI and cardiovascular complications (the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score [FINDRISC], the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) and the clinical examination. To investigate the influence of orthopedic surgery (anesthesia) on glycemia and the significance and safety of early patients mobilization after the big joints surgeries. To investigate changes of glycemia in patients with normal glycemia metabolism, potentially protecting them from hypoglycemia during hospital stay and increasing their awareness of potential development of DM in the future.

The objective of this follow-up study was to assess the long-term clinical outcomes of the ECPR-based versus CCPR approach.Methods The Prague OHCA trial was a single-center, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with witnessed refractory OHCA of presumed cardiac origin, without return of spontaneous circulation, were randomized during ongoing resuscitation on scene to conventional CPR (CCPR) or an ECPR-based approach (intra-arrest transport, ECPR if ROSC is not achieved prehospital and immediate invasive assessment).Results From March 2013 to October 2020, 264 patients were randomized during ongoing resuscitation on scene, and 256 patients were enrolled. Long-term follow-up was performed 5.3 (interquartile range 3.8-7.2) years after initial randomization and was completed in 255 of 256 patients (99.6%). In total, 34/123 (27.6%) patients in the ECPR-based group and 26/132 (19.7%) in the CCPR group were alive (log-rank P = 0.01).

This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS.Methods: This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cere -bral Performance Category (CPC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2.

With increasing long-term survival, there is a need to understand health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures. Although there are current recommendations for measuring HRQoL in OHCA survivors, there is significant heterogeneity in assessment timing and the measurement tools used to quantify HRQoL outcomes, making the interpretation and comparison of HRQoL difficult. Identifying groups of survivors of OHCA with poor HRQoL measures could be used for targeted intervention studies. Sex differences in OHCA resuscitation characteristics, post-cardiac arrest treatment, and short-term survival outcomes are well-documented, although variability in study methods and statistical adjustments appear to affect study results and conclusions. It is unclear whether sex differences exist in HRQoL among OHCA survivors and if study methods and statistical adjustment for patient characteristics or arrest circumstances impact the rsults. In this narrative review article, we provide an overview of the assessment of HRQoL and the main domains of HRQoL. We summarize the literature regarding sex differences in HRQoL in OHCA survivors. Few multivariable-adjusted studies reported HRQoL sex differences and there was significant heterogeneity in study size, timing of assessment, and domains measured and reported.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of adults (aged >= 18 years) who had an emergency medical service (EMS) attempted resuscitation with an initially shockable rhythm between 2015 and 2024. We excluded paediatric cases, traumatic aetiology and EMS witnessed OHCA. Survivors to hospital discharge were followed up 12 months post-arrest to assess functional recovery according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.

Detailed knowledge of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term cognitive function is limited. HRQoL and cognitive function were assessed in ECPR-survivors and OHCA-survivors with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation after standard advanced cardiac life support Methods: Fifteen ECPR-survivors and 22 age-matched sACLS-survivors agreed to participate in this follow-up study. Participants were examined with echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and neuropsychological testing, and answered HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and Short Form 36 (SF-36)), and Results: Most patients were male (73 % and 82 %) and median age at follow-up was similar between groups (55 years and 60 years). Low flow time was significantly longer for ECPR-survivors (86 min vs. 15 min) and lactate levels were significantly higher (14.1 mmol/l vs. 3.9 mmol/l). No betweengroup difference was found in physical function nor in cognitive function with scores corresponding to the 23rd worst percentile of the general population. SACLS-survivors had HRQoL on level with the Danish general population while ECPR-survivors scored lower in both EQ-5D-5L (index score 0.73 vs. 0.86, p = 0.03, visual analog scale: 70 vs. 84, p = 0.04) and in multiple SF-36 health domains (role physical, bodily pain, general health, and Conclusions: Despite substantially longer low flow times with thrice as high lactate levels, ECPR-survivors were similar in cognitive and physical function compared to sACLS-survivors.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,"Cardiac arrest, stony heart, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation: An updated revisit","The post-resuscitation period is recognized as the main predictor of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) outcomes. The first description of post-resuscitation syndrome and stony heart was published over 50 years ago. Major manifestations may include but are not limited to, persistent precipitating pathology, systemic ischemia/reperfusion response, post-cardiac arrest brain injury, and finally, post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) after successful resuscitation. Why do some patients initially survive successful resuscitation, and others do not? Also, why does the myocardium response vary after resuscitation? These questions have kept scientists busy for several decades since the first successful resuscitation was described. By modifying the conventional modalities of resuscitation together with new promising agents, rescuers will be able to salvage the jeopardized post-resuscitation myocardium and prevent its progression to a dismal, stony heart. Community awareness and staff education are crucial for shortening the resuscitation time and improving short- and long-term outcomes. Awareness of these components before and early after the restoration of circulation will enhance the resuscitation outcomes. This review extensively addresses the underlying pathophysiology, management, and outcomes of post-resuscitation syndrome. The pattern, management, and outcome of PAMD and post-cardiac arrest shock are different based on many factors, including in-hospital cardiac arrest vs out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), witnessed vs unwitnessed cardiac arrest, the underlying cause of arrest, the duration, and protocol used for CPR. Although restoring spontaneous circulation is a vital sign, it should not be the end of the game or lone primary outcome; it calls for better understanding and aggressive multi-disciplinary interventions and care. The development of stony heart post-CPR and OHCA remain the main challenges in emergency and critical care medicine.",WORLD JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,2024,"El-Menyar, A; Wahlen, BM",10.4330/wjc.v16.i3.126,,WOS:001198177700003,A

This paper aims to summarise the available literature on the long-term cognitive, health-related quality of life (QoL) and mental health outcomes of survivors of OHCA. Between 30 and 50% of survivors of OHCA experience cognitive deficits for up to several years post-discharge. Deficits of attention, declarative memory, executive function, visuospatial abilities and verbal fluency are commonly reported. Survivors of OHCA appear to report high rates of mental illness, with up to 61% experiencing anxiety, 45% experiencing depression and 27% experiencing post-traumatic stress. Fatigue appears to be a commonly reported long-term outcome for survivors of OHCA. Investigations of long-term QoL for these patients have produced mixed findings. Carers of survivors of OHCA report high rates of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, with insufficient social and financial support. The heterogeneous range of instruments used to assess cognitive function and QoL prevent any clear conclusions being drawn from the available literature. The potential biases inherent in this patient population and the interaction between QoL, cognitive performance and mental health warrant further investigation, as does the role of post-discharge support services in improving long-term patient outcomes.",ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE,2015,"Green, CR; Botha, JA; Tiruvoipati, R",10.1177/0310057X1504300504,,WOS:000361270000004,A

Methods: The neurological outcome in survivors and their level of performance, subjective well-being and quality of life were evaluated. Results: A follow-up study of 27 cardiac arrest survivors was conducted; four patients (15%) died during the first year, a total of seven patients (26%) within 5 years. Twenty-two patients (81%) were discharged from hospital without neurological deficit (cerebral performance category (CPC) score: 1), three patients scored CPC 2 and two patients CPC 3. Heart failure classification on discharge was, according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria 2.1 +/- 0.9. Fifteen patients (56%) managed to return to their previous level of activity. At the time of follow-up 18 patients (67%) were still alive, of whom 15 responded to a survey regarding life satisfaction. Thirteen patients (87%) judged their situation to be worth living and twelve (80%) considered their survival a second chance, while five (33%) feared they could suffer another cardiac arrest. Reactions from close relatives included fear/anxiety (n = 14; 78%), a sustained burden on family life (n = 12; 67%), and occasional depression (n = 7; 39%). Conclusions: Thrombolytic therapy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may produce a favourable neurological outcome. The majority of long-term survivors reported a good subjective quality of life. In one-third of close family members some negative factors had a lasting impact on the quality of daily living. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Long-term survival and health-related quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest,"Introduction: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is an adverse event associated with high mortality. Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors. Methods: A multicentre prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. Patients > 18 years receiving car-diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by pre-arrest Mod-ified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year. Results: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 69.7% was functionally independent. Conclusion: One-year survival after IHCA in this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies.

Few PICUs worldwide provide a multidisciplinary follow-up program as routine practice at an outpatient clinic with standardized measurements, using validated instruments including neuropsychological assessments by psychologists. The primary goal of such a follow-up program should be to provide excellent care to children and their caregivers, thereby resulting in a high attendance. Pediatric psychologists, neurologists and pediatricians/pediatric intensivists should ideally be involved to screen for delayed development and psychosocial problems and offer appropriate care at the same time.

It is unknown how HRQoL evolves over time, and assessments at different time points may lead to different results. Methods: In a NORCAST sub study, OHCA survivors eligible for health status (EQ-5D-3L) and HRQoL (SF-36) assessments were examinated six months and five years after OHCA. At five-year follow-up, survivors also retrospectively assessed their health status for each consecutive year fol-lowing OHCA. The next of kin independently assessed health status and HRQoL of their respective OHCA survivors. Results: Among 138 survivors alive after six months and 117 after five years, 80 (88% male) completed both follow-ups. Health status and HRQoL remained stable over time, except for increasing SF-36 mental summary score and decreasing physical functioning and physical component score. Anxiety and depression levels were generally low, although younger survivors stated more anxiety than older survivors. Retrospective assessment showed reduced health status for the first two years, which increased only from the third year. Explorative analyses revealed that younger age, long-er time to return of spontaneous circulation (tROSC) and late awakening affected health status, particularly in the first two years post-arrest. Conclusions: OHCA survivors showed stable health status and HRQoL with only minor differences between six months and five years.

The study examined various criteria in long-term survival of more than 360 days after out-of-hospital resuscitation in an urban rescue service system. Methods: The patient collective consisted of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 1 year after hospital discharge from 2020-2022 in D & uuml;sseldorf, Germany. The survivors were interviewed 12-18 months after hospital discharge using a multidimensional questionnaire on their general state of health, living situation, neurological status (CPC = Cerebral Performance Category Score), subjective perception of quality of life/life satisfaction and work situation. Result: The questionnaire was sent to 149 patients, of whom 103 responded (response rate: 69%, male: 83%, age: 61 +/- 13 years). Of the respondents, 91% rated themselves as having a good neurological treatment outcome (CPC 1-2). Mild to severe anxiety/depression was experienced by 48% and pain symptoms by 44%. More often to significantly more often than before the OHCA, 74% had fatigue and 59% suffered from mild to severe concentration disorders. Furthermore, 41% felt that their own quality of life was the same or better than before the event and 61% rated their own life satisfaction as very good to good. 73% of patients returned to work within 1 year. Conclusion: Long-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest shows an overall high CPC rating, but only half of the patients rated their own quality of life/life satisfaction as positive.

The primary outcome is mortality at 6 months. This protocol describes an extended follow-up sub-study of the STEPCARE-trial with the main objective to provide detailed long-term outcomes for survivors and caregivers. It will focus on potential neuroprotection and improved recovery for different targets of sedation, temperature, and MAP management at 6 and 12 months post-OHCA. Methods All survivors and one caregiver per survivor at selected STEPCARE sites will be invited to participate. Randomization is stratified by site. This sub-study extends the main STEPCARE follow-up at 6 months by undertaking detailed assessments, face-to-face meetings, inclusion of a caregiver, and repeating the assessments at 12 months. Our main outcome for survivors is cognitive function measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and for caregivers, the caregiver burden measured by the Zarit Burden Interview. Additional outcomes include symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fatigue, physical function, life satisfaction, and life impact (disability), assessed by psychometrically robust measures. The estimated sample size is 600. Efforts to improve interrater reliability and decrease missing data are integral to the study design.

All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12month EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS). Results: There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data. The ECPR cohort was younger [mean(SD) 50.4(13.46) vs 60.5(14.01) yrs, p < 0.01] and more likely to have received bystander CPR [19(79%) ECPR vs 397(52%) CCPR, p < 0.001]. Both cohorts had similar proportions of males, witnessed arrests and initial shockable rhythms. Median (IQR) arrest to ROSC/ECMO time was longer in ECPR than CCPR [61(41.5-97) vs 6(2-14) minutes, p < 0.001]. The median (IQR) EQ-5D-5L utility score [0.95 (0.72-1) ECPR vs 0.96 (0.86-1) CCPR, p = 0.64] and median (IQR) EQ-VAS at 12 months [80 (64.5-90) ECPR vs 75 (60-85) CCPR, p = 0.39] were similar.

The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.Exposure All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Main Outcome and Measures Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.Results Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.Conclusions and Relevance Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population.

Methods: This is a long-term follow-up sub-study of the TTH48 multicentre trial. OHCA survivors from participating sites were contacted 5-8 years post OHCA. Survival rates were collected from medical registries. Telephone interviews were performed to collect basic outcomes and quality of life. Questionnaires surveyed patients and relatives levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep, fatigue, cognitive decline and everyday life participation. Results: 279 patients were included at the participating sites, 161 (58%) were still alive. A vast majority of the participating survivors (97.8%) had favourable outcomes (CPC 1-2) and quality of life was comparable to the background population. Among the participating OHCA survivors, 5.5% met the criteria for anxiety, 2.7% for depression, 4.5% for PTSD, 24.5% reported sleep problems, 45.5% reported fatigue, and 40.7% were working full-or part-time. Among the participating relatives, 7.0% met the criteria for anxiety, 1.2% for depression, 3.5% for PTSD, and 52.3% of the relatives reported that the patient had suffered cognitive decline post OHCA. ROSC delay, higher age, and female sex were negatively associated with several long-term outcomes. Treatment allocation was not associated with better outcomes. Conclusions: Long-term OHCA survivors had acceptable outcomes, though self-reported sleep and fatigue problems and relatives-reported cognitive decline were prevalent. Higher age and longer ROSC delay were risk factors of poorer outcome, primarily driven by mortality. Female sex was a risk factor of worse self-reported outcomes.

Better-quality bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, cardiocerebral resuscitation principles, and intensive post-resuscitation hospital care have improved survival. However, cognitive and functional impairment after cardiac arrest remain areas of concern. Research focus has shifted beyond prognostication in the immediate post-arrest period to identification of mechanisms for long-term brain injury and implementation of promising protocols to reduce neuronal injury. These include therapeutic temperature management (TTM), as well as pharmacologic and psychological interventions which also improve overall neurological function. Comprehensive assessment of cognitive function post-arrest is hampered by heterogeneous measures among studies. However, the domains of attention, long-term memory, spatial memory, and executive function appear to be affected.

Neurocognitive outcome of children after drowning incidents cannot be accurately predicted in the early course of treatment. Therefore, aggressive out-of-hospital and in-hospital treatment is emphasized. There are ""miracle"" cases after long submersion times that have been reported in the medical literature, which mostly concern small children. However, many of the survivors will remain severely neurologically compromised after remarkably shorter submersion times and will consequently be a great burden to their family and society for the rest of their lives. The duration of submersion, the need of advanced life support at the site of the accident, the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival at the emergency room are important factors related to survival with mild neurological deficits or intact function in drowned children. Data on long-term outcome are scarce. The used outcome measurement methods and the duration of follow-up have not been optimal in most of the existing studies. Proper neurological and neurophysiological examinations for drowned children are superior to outcome scales based chart reviews.

Because-of widespread implementation of defibrillation programs, more patients survive VF OHCAs, making subsequent care of these patients important. Early hospitalization must focus on potential neurologic injury and therapy targeted at the underlying cardiac disease and antiarrhythmic therapy for long-term secondary prevention of sudden death. Attention to certain cohorts who are at high risk. despite their underlying disease, such as women and elderly patients, is necessary. These cohorts may have the greatest response to short-term and long-term therapies for cardiac rehabilitation.

Adult survivors who experienced IHCA between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, and were alive for over 1 year after IHCA were included. Worsening QOL among IHCA survivors was determined using three criteria: decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability.Results: A total of 22,611 IHCA survivors from 903 hospitals were included in the final analysis, and 7,796 (34.5%) experienced worsening QOL. Specifically, 5,595 (24.7%), 1,694 (7.5%), and 1,617 (7.2%) survivors experienced decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability, respectively. The proportion of brain lesion disability increased from 6.3% to 10.8% after IHCA.

Methods All resuscitation attempts performed over a period of 30 months (2011-2013) by the emergency medical services of the city of Bonn were retrospectively analyzed on the basis of treatment records and the German Resuscitation Registry.

This study investigated bystander-initiated CPR effects on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival at hospital admission in comparative pediatric population experiencing OHCA. Methods: Multicenter retrospective observational study conducted between January 2015 and December 2023 using the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry (Re<acute accent>AC) data. Pediatric patients (0-17 years) with OHCA were included. Patients who received bystander-initiated CPR were matched with those who did not using propensity score. Primary endpoints were ROSC and survival at hospital admission. Secondary endpoints were survival at D30 and favorable neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC score of 1 or 2). Results: Of 2162 eligible pediatric patients, 1289 (59.6 %) received bystander-initiated CPR. After propensity score matching (n = 645 pairs), bystander-initiated CPR (vs without CPR by a bystander) was associated with improved ROSC (31.2 % vs 23.7 %; adjusted OR [AOR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and survival at hospital admission (28.7 % vs 19.8 %; AOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2). No significant difference was observed for survival at D30 (3.7 % vs 3.9 %; AOR 0.9, 95 % CI 0.5-1.7) or favorable neurological outcomes. Conclusions: In this nationwide French cohort, bystander-initiated CPR in pediatric OHCA was associated with improved ROSC and survival at hospital admission, but not with D30 survival or favorable neurological outcomes.

However, survivors are at risk of neurological impairment from anoxic brain damage which could affect quality of life and lead to need of care at home or in a nursing home. Methods: We linked data on ICHAs in Denmark with nationwide registries to report 30-day survival as well as factors associated with survival. Furthermore, among 30-day survivors we reported the one-year cumulative risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission with mortality as the competing risk. Results: In total, 517 patients (27.3%) survived to day 30 out of 1892 eligible patients; 338 (65.9%) were men and median age was 68 (interquartile range 58-76). Lower age, witnessed arrest by health care personnel, monitored arrest and presumed cardiac cause of arrest were associated with 30 day survival. Among 454 30-day survivors without prior anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission, the risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission within the first-year post-arrest was 4.6% (n = 21; 95% CI 2.7-6.6%) with a competing risk of death of 15.6% (n = 71; 95% CI 12.3-19.0%), leaving 79.7% (n = 362) alive without anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission. When adding the risk of need of in-home care among 343 30-day survivors without prior home care needs, 68.8% (n = 236) were alive without any of the composite events one-year post-arrest.

Of the 37 patients who were alive at hospital discharge, 32 answered the EuroQol-5 dimensional-5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). For patients discharged alive from the hospital, mean survival was 8.1 years, 8.4 years for cardiogenic shock, and 5.0 years for patients with refractory cardiac arrest. EQ-5D-5L index value of ECMO survivors was not significantly different from the general age-matched population.

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term (1-year and beyond) survival outcomes, including overall survival and survival with favorable neurological status and the quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes, among patients who survived the initial OHCA event (30 days or till hospital discharge). Methods: Embase, Medline and PubMed were searched for primary studies (randomized controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional studies) which reported the long-term survival outcomes of OHCA patients. Data abstraction and quality assessment was conducted, and survival at predetermined timepoints were assessed via single-arm meta-analyses of proportions, using generalized linear mixed models. Comparative meta-analyses were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratio (RR) estimates, using the DerSimonian and Laird model. Results: 67 studies were included, and among patients that survived to hospital discharge or 30-days, 77.3% (CI = 71.2-82.4), 69.6% (CI = 54.5- 70.3), 62.7% (CI = 54.5-70.3), 46.5% (CI = 32.0-61.6), and 20.8% (CI = 7.8-44.9) survived to 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-and 15-years respectively.

Data sources Electronic databases searched included Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. The search was limited to studies published in the last five years (2015-2019). Study selection Original studies assessing neurocognitive functioning or HRQoL in children who were previously admitted to the PICU were included in this systematic review. Data extraction Of the 3649 identified studies, 299 met the inclusion criteria based on title abstract screening. After full-text screening, 75 articles were included in the qualitative data reviewing: 38 on neurocognitive functioning, 33 on HRQoL, and 4 on both outcomes. Data synthesis Studies examining neurocognitive functioning found overall worse scores for general intellectual functioning, attention, processing speed, memory, and executive functioning. Studies investigating HRQoL found overall worse scores for both physical and psychosocial HRQoL. On the short term (<= 12 months), most studies reported HRQoL impairments, whereas in some long-term studies HRQoL normalized. The effectiveness of the few intervention studies during and after PICU admission on long-term outcomes varied. Conclusions PICU survivors have lower scores for neurocognitive functioning and HRQoL than children from the general population.

Methods An explorative post-hoc study was conducted on survivor data from the international Target Temperature Management after Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest trial, investigating serum NFL sampled 48/72-hours post-arrest and neurocognitive outcome 6 months post-arrest. Results Among the long-term surviving participants (N = 457), serum NFL (n = 384) was associated to all outcome instruments, also when controlling for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Associations between NFL and the patient-reported Two Simple Questions (TSQ) were however attenuated when adjusting for vitality and mental health. NFL predicted results on the outcome instruments to varying degrees, with an excellent area under the curve for the clinician-report Cerebral Performance Category (CPC 1-2: 0.90). Most participants were classified as CPC 1 (79%). Outcome instrument correlations ranged from small (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]-TSQ) to strong (CPC-MMSE).

Methods A scoping review was performed studying published reviews after 2008, focusing on outcome of CPR in patients aged >= 70 years following IHCA and OHCA. In addition, 11 (IHCA) and 19 (OHCA) eligible studies published after the 2 included reviews were analyzed regarding: return of spontaneous circulation, survival until hospital discharge, long-term survival, neurological outcome, discharge location or other measurements for quality of life (QoL). Results The survival until hospital discharge ranged between 11.6 and 28.5% for IHCA and 0-11.1% for OHCA, and declined with increasing age. The same trend was seen regarding 1-year survival rates with 5.7-25.0% and 0-10% following IHCA and OHCA, respectively. A good neurological outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2 was found in 11.5-23.6% (IHCA) and up to 10.5% (OHCA) of all patients. However, the proportion of CPC 1-2 among patients surviving until hospital discharge was 82-93% (IHCA) and 77-91.6% (OHCA). Few studies included other QoL measures as an outcome variable. Other risk factors aside from age were identified, including nursing home residency, comorbidity, non-shockable rhythm, non-witnessed arrest. The level of frailty was not studied as a predictor of arrest outcome in the included studies. Conclusions Hospital survival rates following IHCA and OHCA in the older population improved in the recent decade, though do not exceed 28.5% and 11.1%, respectively. The effect of age on outcome remains controversial and age should not be used as the sole decision criterium whether to initiate CPR.

We studied 90 consecutive patients with sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest who were resuscitated in the general ward of our hospital. Twenty-five (28%) were discharged from the hospital. Multivariate analysis revealed that the promptness of initiation of CPR, age, severity of cardiac dysfunction, time and the type of arrhythmia are of significance in relation to survival. To evaluate long-term survival after hospital cardiac arrest, we analyzed long-term follow-up data accumulated during a 16 year period. In the group of 25 patients in our study, there have been a total of 10 deaths (40%). Five of the 10 deaths resulted from recurrent cardiac arrest and 1 was a noncardiac death.

The termination of resuscitation (TOR) rule, widely adopted internationally, aims to preserve dignity, optimize resources, and protect healthcare providers. However, prehospital TOR is not implemented in Japan, presenting legal and practical challenges. This study analyzes temporal trends in prehospital and in-hospital interventions for OHCA patients with poor predicted outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (JAAM-OHCA) registry (June 2014-December 2021). Adult OHCA patients with medical causes were included if they fulfilled all the advanced life support (ALS) TOR rule criteria: unwitnessed arrest, no return of spontaneous circulation, no bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and no automated external defibrillator use or defibrillation. Prehospital and in-hospital interventions were evaluated. Results: Among 11,334 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 2,447 received all three ALS interventions (advanced airway management, intravenous access, and epinephrine administration). Over time, in-hospital interventions, including endotracheal intubation (56%) and epinephrine administration (82%), decreased, while advanced therapies, including coronary angiography, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and targeted temperature management, remained rare (<1%). The median time to TOR after hospital arrival shortened to 18 min. In contrast, prehospital epinephrine administration increased, while advanced airway management and intravenous access decreased. Conclusions: OHCA patients who met TOR rule showed a decrease in in-hospital interventions.

There is limited understanding of OHCA-related sequelae and their impact on co-survivors. This study describes the 3-month post-discharge health outcomes among OHCA survivors and co-survivors in the Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship cohort study (QualiCAS). Methods: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study, enrolling subjects from 1 February 2023 to 30 November 2024. Physical, psychological, cognitive, and social health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and caregiver burden were described separately for survivors and co-survivors. HRQoL of survivors and co-survivors was compared againstage-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted Singapore population norm for EQ-5D-5L. Results: 62 survivors and 36 co-survivors completed 3-month assessments. 9.7 %, 6.5 %, 3.6 % of survivors screened positive for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Survivors experienced mild cognitive impairment (43.1 %), impaired mobility (41.1 %), and weak muscle strength (39.7 %). Functional independence was high, and 73.9 % of survivors returned to employment. Survivors' HRQoL was lower compared to the general population (0.90 vs. 0.96).

Recent findings Qualitative interview and survey-style studies explored the lived experience of SCA survivors and revealed common themes (e.g., need for recovery expectations and long-term follow-up resources). A heightened awareness for the unique needs of family and loved ones of survivors led to qualitative studies focusing on these members as well. Methodology papers published portend prospective assessment and follow-up cohort studies. However, no investigations evaluating discharge processes or specific interventions directed at domain impairments common after SCA were identified in the review period. International work continues to identify patient and family-centered priorities for outcome measurement and research.

Our aim was to elucidate the long-term course of patients experiencing this hazardous complication. Methods: Between 1988 and 1999, 76 patients suffered sudden hemodynamic collapse following isolated CABG. All patients underwent emergency resternotomy and open cardiac massage. An emergency cardiac reoperation was performed in the 62 (82%) primary survivors. Additional 76 patients were pair-matched to the study patients on the basis of their preoperative characteristics and served as controls. Of the study patients, 41 (54%), and of the controls, 76, (100%) were discharged. In December 2009, all patients were traced with respect to mortality data and the health-related quality of life of living patients was studied using the RAND-36 Item Health Survey questionnaire. Results: Altogether 19 (73%) of the 26 study patients, and 38 (84%) of the 45 controls were available. After exclusion of the early deaths, the life expectancy was similar between the groups: neither overall (p = 0.60) nor cardiac (p = 0.64) survival differed significantly after a mean follow-up time of 15.1 +/- 3.5 years. In addition, cardiac re-interventions were equally frequently required in both the groups. The RAND-36 scores were congruent (p = ns) between the groups and the age- and sex-matched national reference population in the health-related quality-of-life dimensions describing physical, mental, and social domains. Conclusions: Patients who have survived severe hemodynamic collapse, open cardiac massage, and emergency cardiac reoperation following CABG achieve similar long-term prognosis in terms of survival and cardiac interventions as the pair-matched control patients. In addition, 15 years postoperatively, they have a good health-related quality of life, similar to that of an age- and sex-matched national reference population.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Long-term subjective memory function in ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors resuscitated by early defibrillation,"Background: Brain injury after a cardiac arrest remains a major cause of morbidity. Programs focusing on early defibrillation have yielded improved survival of patients after hospital discharge following ventricular fibrillation (VF) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early defibrillation that promptly restores a circulating rhythm should decrease the hypoxic period and subsequent organ injury. Therefore this study was designed to determine if long-term memory complaints persist in VF OHCA survivors resuscitated in an early defibrillation program when compared with a healthy control population not experiencing cardiac arrest. Methods: All patients with an OHCA between November 1990 and January 2001 who received defibrillation by emergency medical services personnel in Olmsted County, MN, USA, were included. The memory function questionnaire (MFQ), a 64-item, 7-point Likert-scaled instrument to evaluate the perception of everyday memory functioning was sent to all survivors. The MFQ comprises four scales: general frequency of forgetting (rates general forgetting), retrospective functioning (compares current memory with past ability), seriousness of forgetting (rates how memory impairment impacts daily life), and mnemonics usage (measures adaptation). The MFQ is scaled so that high scores reflect less severe memory complaints. The comparison population comprised members of the Mayo Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) cohort. Quality of life was ascertained with a short form (SF)-36 survey. Results: Seventy-nine of the 200 VF OHCA patients (40%) were discharged. Twenty-two patients have died since dismissal, with an overall average length of follow-up of 4.9 +/- 3.0 years. Thirty-eight (67%) of the survivors completed the MFQ. Compared with the normal. there was a significant decrease in the general frequency of forgetting score of 144.2 +/- 37.4 versus 168.1 +/- 27.3 (P < 0.001) and the seriousness of forgetting score of 84.8 +/- 26.7 versus 95.2 +/- 19.7 (P = 0.004). The retrospective function-scale scores were not significantly different (18.4 +/- 6.8 versus 18.7 +/- 5.0 (P = 0.74)). Younger patients (lesser than 65 years of age) reported an increase in general forgetting and the seriousness of forgetting compared with older survivors. A comparison with SF-36 scores suggested an association between general forgetting and decreased vitality (P = 0.03) and the seriousness of forgetting with a decreased general health (P = 0.005), mental health (P = 0.009), physical functioning (P = 0.02), and vitality (P = 0.05). Conclusion: In a cohort of VF OHCA patients, survivors report more memory complaints in comparison with a general healthy older population. There were more long-term-memory complaints in younger patients. Patients with higher long-term quality-of-life score have fewer memory complaints. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Enhanced inpatient monitoring and post-IHCA management have improved survival rates and better neurological outcomes at discharge. This study aims to evaluate the IHCA survival rate and analyse key determinants influencing survival status. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using retrospective secondary data from a northern referral tertiary public hospital's cardiac arrest registry, encompassing IHCA cases in patients aged 18 and above between February 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. The data included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, IHCA event timing, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival status, and post-arrest neurological outcomes. Patient survival was measured from the initiation of resuscitation to discharge or death, with survival analysis performed. Factors associated with IHCA survival were explored using logistic regression. Results: A total of 934 IHCA cases were analyzed. The mean patient age was 60.8 years, with most being male (63.9%) and of Chinese ethnicity (45.5%). IHCA commonly occurred in non-critical care areas (61.0%), with 79.6% admitted for medical conditions. Successful ROSC was achieved in 43.5% of cases, and 8.2% had a shockable first rhythm.

Outcomes variables and follow-up time points evaluated were widely heterogeneous which limits comprehensive analysis of PICS after VA-ECMO. In general, the longer-term PICS-related outcomes of survivors of VA-ECMO were worse than the general population, and approaching that of patients with chronic disease. Available studies identified high rates of abnormal 6-minute walk distance, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder that persisted for years. Half or fewer survivors return to work years after discharge. Only 2 of 27 studies examined cognitive outcomes and no studies evaluated cognitive dysfunction within the first year of recovery. No studies evaluated the impact of targeted interventions on these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Survivors of VA-ECMO represent a population of critically ill patients at high risk for deficits in physical, emotional, and cognitive function related to PICS. This systematic review highlights the alarming reality that PICS and in particular, neurocognitive outcomes, in survivors of VA-ECMO are understudied, underrecognized, and thus likely undertreated. These results underscore the imperative that we look beyond survival to focus on understanding the burden of survivorship with the goal of optimizing recovery and outcomes after these life-saving interventions. Future prospective, multicenter, longitudinal studies in recovery after VA-ECMO are justified.",CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2023,"Higa, KC; Mayer, K; Quinn, C; Jubina, L; Suarez-Pierre, A; Colborn, K; Jolley, SE; Enfield, K; Zwischenberger, J; Sevin, CM; Rove, JY",10.1097/CCM.0000000000005900,,WOS:001050040500030,A

Such systems of care, which are highly influenced by the environment in which they operate, produce efficiency and effectiveness in responding to cardiac arrest. Part 4 of the 2025 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care focuses on systems of care, emphasizing elements that are relevant to a broad range of resuscitation situations. The chapter follows the Chain of Survival, beginning with prevention and preparedness to resuscitate, proceeding to early identification of cardiac arrest, and moving to effective resuscitation through to post-cardiac arrest care, survivorship, and recovery. This Part provides cardiac arrest systems of care guidelines on how to train specific personnel, protocols that have been demonstrated to be effective, as well as the incorporation of nonhuman resources to optimize cardiac arrest care with ongoing debriefing and quality improvement strategies. Specific to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, included are recommendations about emergency medical services team composition and transport recommendations, community initiatives to promote lay rescuer response, public access defibrillation and naloxone, and an enhanced role for emergency telecommunicators.

Limited study compared two risk scores, the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores in the current East Asian NSTEMI patients. Methods This retrospective observational study consecutively collected patients in a large academic hospital between 01/01 and 11/01/2017 and followed for 4 years. Patients were scored by TIMI and GRACE scores on hospital admission. In-hospital endpoints were defined as the in-hospital composite event, including mortality, re-infarction, heart failure, stroke, cardiac shock, or resuscitation. Long-term outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality in 4-year follow-up. Results A total of 232 patients were included (female 29.7%, median age 67 years), with a median follow-up of 3.7 years. GRACE score grouped most patients (45.7%) into high risk, while TIMI grouped the majority (61.2%) into medium risk. Further subgrouping the TIMI medium group showed that half (53.5%) of the TIMI medium risk population was GRACE high risk (>= 140). Compared to TIMI medium group + GRACE < 140 subgroup, the TIMI medium + GRACE high-risk (>= 140) subgroup had a significantly higher in-hospital events (39.5% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.05), long-term all-cause mortality (22.2% vs. 0% p < 0.001) and cardiac death (11.1% vs. 0% p = 0.045) in 4-year follow-up. GRACE risk scores showed a better predictive ability than TIMI risk scores both for in-hospital and long-term outcomes. (AUC of GRACE vs. TIMI, In-hospital: 0.82 vs. 0.62; long-term mortality: 0.89 vs. 0.68; long-term cardiac mortality: 0.91 vs. 0.67, all p < 0.05). Combined use of the two risk scores reserved both the convenience of scoring and the predictive accuracy. Conclusion GRACE showed better predictive accuracy than TIMI in East Asian NSTEMI patients in both in-hospital and long-term outcomes.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Emergent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Resuscitated Victims of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"Long-term survival rates even after successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are dismal. Most of those initially resuscitated expired during their hospitalization. Recent reports have suggested that a more aggressive approach to postresuscitation care is the key to better outcome. Waiting for the evidence of neurological recovery before acting can result in missed opportunity to improve such recovery. Immediate induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia for all resuscitated victims who remain comatose offers the best hope for neurological recovery. Numerous reports suggest that early coronary angiography and PCI also improve outcome among those resuscitated from cardiac arrest whose postresuscitation ECG show evidence of ST elevation myocardial infarctions. Most promising is combining these two postresuscitation therapies, namely immediate induction of hypothermia and early coronary angiography and PCI. Combining these therapies has resulted in long-term survival rates of 70% with more than 80% of all such survivors neurologically functional. Even those without ST elevation on their postresuscitation ECG can greatly benefit from timely induction of hypothermia and early angiography/PCI.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate long -term pain, lung function, physical function, and fracture healing after manual or mechanical CPR and in patients with and without flail chest. Methods: Patients experiencing out -of -hospital cardiac arrest between 2013 and 2020 and transported to Sahlgrenska University Hospital were identified. Survivors who had undergone a computed tomography (CT) showing chest wall injury were contacted. Thirty-five patients answered a questionnaire regarding pain, physical function, and quality of life and 25 also attended a clinical examination to measure the respiratory and physical functions 3.9 (SD 1.7, min 2 -max 8) years after the CPR. In addition, 22 patients underwent an additional CT scan to evaluate fracture healing. Results: The initial CT showed bilateral rib fractures in all but one patient and sternum fracture in 69 %. At the time of the follow-up none of the patients had persistent pain, however, two patients were experiencing local discomfort in the chest wall. Lung function and thoracic expansion were significantly lower compared to reference values (FVC 14 %, FEV1 18 %, PEF 10 % and thoracic expansion 63 %) ( p < 0.05). Three of the patients had remaining unhealed injuries. Patients who had received mechanical CPR in additional to manual CPR had a lower peak expiratory flow (80 vs 98 % of predicted values) ( p =0.030) =0.030) and those having flail chest had less range of motion in the thoracic spine (84 vs 127 % of predicted) ( p = 0.019) otherwise the results were similar between the groups.

The following scores were calculated for 1,163 OHCA patients who were treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) at 21 hospitals in South Korea: OHCA, cardiac arrest hospital prognosis (CAHP), C-GRApH (named on the basis of its variables), TTM risk, 5-R, NULL-PLEASE (named on the basis of its variables), Serbian quality of life long-term (SR-QOLl), cardiac arrest survival, revised post-cardiac arrest syndrome for therapeutic hypothermia (rCAST), Polish hypothermia registry (PHR) risk, and PROgnostication using LOGistic regression model for Unselected adult cardiac arrest patients in the Early stages (PROLOGUE) scores and prediction score by Aschauer et al. Their accuracies in predicting poor outcome at 6 months after OHCA were determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration belt. In the complete-case analyses, the PROLOGUE score showed the highest AUC (0.923; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.904-0.941), whereas the SR-QOLl score had the lowest AUC (0.749; 95% CI, 0.711-0.786). The discrimination performances were similar in the analyses after multiple imputation. The PROLOGUE, TTM risk, CAHP, NULL-PLEASE, 5-R, and cardiac arrest survival scores were well calibrated. The rCAST and PHR risk scores showed acceptable overall calibration, although they showed miscalibration under the 80% CI level at extreme prediction values.

From October 2004 to May 2014, 163 patients with a mean age of 75.5 years (range 70-91) required veno-arterial ECLS. The main indication was postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (79.6%). Extracorporeal life support duration averaged 5.6 +/- 4.3 days. Thirty-day mortality was 72% (n = 117) and follow-up survival rate was 14.1% with a median follow-up of 23.7 months (range 1.5-102.3). Lactatemia was identified as an independent risk factor of 30 day mortality. Previous stroke, lactatemia, bilirubinemia, and ECLS implantation under cardiac massage were identified as independent risk factors for long-term mortality. Extracorporeal life support after TAVI procedure and intra-aortic balloon pump support were identified as protective factors for both 30 day and long-term survival. The 23 patients, still alive at last follow up, have a good quality of life, doing well, and self-catering. Although mortality rate at 30 days is more than 70% in elderly patients requiring circulatory support with ECLS, survivors can pretend to an acceptable long-term survival with a good quality of life.

Although post-ROSC care is crucial for survival with intact neurology, there are insufficient well-established protocols for post-resuscitation care. We aimed to evaluate post-resuscitation care in the emergency department (ED) of adult (aged >= 16 years) OHCA patients with sustained ROSC and its associated neurologically intact survival.Methods:A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted for OHCA patients with sustained ROSC at the ED. Data including demographics, pre-hospital resuscitation, ED resuscitation, post-resuscitation care and eventual outcomes were analysed.Results:Among 921 OHCA patients, 85 (9.2%) had sustained ROSC at the ED. Nineteen patients (19/85, 22.4%) survived, with 13 (13/85, 15.3%) having intact neurology at discharge. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were performed in all OHCA patients, whereas computed tomography (CT) was performed inconsistently, with CT brain being most common (74/85, 87.1%), while CT pulmonary angiogram (6/85, 7.1%), abdomen and pelvis (4/85, 4.7%) and aortogram (2/85, 2.4%) were done infrequently. Only four patients (4.7%) had all five neuroprotective goals of normoxia, normocarbia, normotension, normothermia and normoglycaemia achieved in the ED. The proportion of all five neuroprotective goals being met was significantly higher (P = 0.01) among those with neurologically intact survival (3/13, 23.1%) than those without (1/72, 1.4%).Conclusion:Post-resuscitation care at the ED showed great variability, indicating gaps between recommended guidelines and clinical practice.

Design Multicenter retrospective observational study. Setting Three veterinary teaching hospitals. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 25) and cats (n = 15). Measurements and Main Results Medical records of animals that underwent CPR and survived to discharge were retrospectively reviewed, and information was recorded regarding CPR event, PCA hospitalization, and short- and long-term outcomes. Ninety-two percent of CPA events occurred in hospital and were witnessed, and 8% occurred out of hospital. Eighty-five percent of events occurred during general anesthesia or sedation. CPR efforts ranged from <1 to 18 min, and animals remained hospitalized between 0.5 and 15.5 days after return of spontaneous circulation. Seventy-three percent of animals required supplemental oxygen, 13% required mechanical ventilation, and 20% required vasopressor, positive inotropic, or glucocorticoid therapy. Hyperosmolar therapies were administered to 38% of animals, anticonvulsants were given to 18%, and 8% of animals developed new-onset PCA seizures. The median (range) modified Glasgow Coma Scale score before CPA was 18 (11-18), 12 h PCA was 16 (6-18), and 72 h PCA was 17.5 (14-18). Median survival time was 455 days (range: 11-2650 days). Twenty-five percent of owners perceived a persistent disability in their pets, from behavioral changes to required nutritional and recumbent care.

Survivors of OHCA often experience a combination of complex medical, physical and psychological needs that have a significant impact on quality of life. Guidelines suggest a multi-dimensional follow-up to address both physical and non-physical domains for survivors. However, it is likely that there is substantial unwarranted variation in provision of services throughout the UK. Currently, there is no nationally agreed model for the follow-up of OHCA survivors and there is an urgent need for a set of standards and guidelines in order to ensure equal access for all. Accordingly, the British Cardiovascular Interventional Society established a multi-disciplinary working group to develop a position statement that summarises the most up-to-date evidence and provides guidance on essential and desirable services for a dedicated follow-up pathway for survivors of OHCA.",INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY-REVIEWS RESEARCH RESOURCES,2022,"Mion, M; Simpson, R; Johnson, T; Oriolo, V; Gudde, E; Rees, P; Quinn, T; Von Vopelius-Feldt, J; Gallagher, S; Mozid, A; Curzen, N; Davies, J; Swindell, P; Pareek, N; Keeble, TR",10.15420/icr.2022.08,,WOS:001108740400013,A

All 5-year survivors received a questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the standardized EuroQol 5D Five Levels instrument, and occupational status was assessed using the standardized Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Productivity Cost Questionnaire. Of the initial 428 participants, 230 (54%) survived the hospital admission, 213 (50%) survived the first year, and 155 (36%) survived 5 years. Five-year survival rates were 42% for patients receiving ECMO for respiratory support, 39% for cardiac support, and 25% for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The response rate to the questionnaire was 72%. HRQoL was rated satisfactory at 5 years, with a median EuroQol index of 0.82 (interquartile range, 0.73-0.98). Five-year survivors reported slight-to-moderate impairment of mobility (39%), impairment of usual activities (44%), and pain or discomfort (60%).

Therefore, the psychosocial situation and quality of life in such patients after successful resuscitation was evaluated. Methods: Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a community referred to a single tertiary care centre were compared with matched controls. Quality of life was evaluated in 50 consecutive arrest cases (40 males, 10 females; 60+/-13 years) 5-68 months (mean 31.7) after resuscitation according to American Heart Association protocols. Results: The Psychological General Well-being Index questionnaire indicated no significant differences in anxiety, depression, vitality, general well-being, or self-control between patients and controls, However, the Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire demonstrated significant decreases in physical mobility (14.5+/-18.1 vs. 4.0+/-8.5, P = 0.0001), energy levels (25.3+/-31.0 vs. 2.0+/-8.0, P = 0.0001), emotional reactions (11.3+/-16.6 vs. 4.0+/-10.2, P=0.009), and sleep patterns (19.2+/-28.6 vs. 8.4+/-16.7, P=0.023) in the arrest patients. Little differences were measured with the Everyday-Life Questionnaire. 49 of the 50 arrest patients judged their situation after resuscitation worth living; no significant changes in familial, and psychosocial parameters occurred. Conclusions: The quality of life was associated with few changes in psychosocial profile after successful resuscitation. The subjective negative factors bore little impact on the quality of daily living in our patients. Thus, continued efforts to improve out-of-hospital resuscitation measures for cardiac arrest are justified since long-term survivors can expect a good quality of life after successful resuscitation.

Survivors often suffer from cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression, that affect significantly their quality of life. Current post-discharge care is inconsistent and frequently overlooks subtle but disabling symptoms. The ENFORCER trial aims to significantly enhance the health and quality of life of OHCA survivors by providing a comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly internet-based lifestyle intervention. Methods: ENFORCER is a multicentre, parallel group randomized controlled trial involving OHCA survivors aged 18-80 years with cognitive impairment or anxiety/depression measured through validated instruments. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or the control group. The intervention group will receive a one-year program via a secure web application, offering cognitive, emotional, and physical rehabilitation support. The control group will receive standard care. The primary outcome is the difference in the proportion of patients without cognitive or emotional symptoms between the two groups after one year. Secondary outcomes include changes in the level of patients' cognitive and emotional symptoms, quality of life, sleep quality, sexual interest and satisfaction, and caregivers' burden, quality of life, sleep quality and emotional symptoms in the two groups. Discussion: The trial addresses the need for consistent post-discharge care, and the timely detection and treatment of cognitive and emotional problems. The internet-based approach allows to potentially reach many patients, ensuring cost-effectiveness and high adherence rates.

Early prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical measures predict long-term outcomes. Methods: In a longitudinal multicenter cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26). Results: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive relation with twelve-month MoCA (beta = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94).

Little is known about the etiology of this serious complication. We sought to summarize current scientific knowledge about potentially modifiable risk factors during intensive care unit (ICU) treatment that may play a substantial role in the development of long-term cognitive impairment. All searches were run on October 1, 2017. The search strategy included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid CDR, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect, Scopus, and Web of Science, and included MeSH headings and keywords related to intensive care, critical care, and cognitive disorders. Searches were restricted to adult subjects. Inclusion required follow-up cognitive evaluation at least 2 months after ICU discharge. Studies assessing patients with cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and cardiac surgery history were excluded. The search strategy resulted in 3180 studies. Of these, 28 studies (.88%) met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Delirium and duration of delirium were associated with long-term cognitive impairment after ICU admission in 6 of 9 studies in which this factor was analyzed. Weaker and more inconsistent associations have been reported with hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, fluctuations in serum glucose levels, and in-hospital acute stress symptoms. Instead, most of the studies did not find significant associations between long-term cognitive impairment and mechanical ventilation; use of sedatives, vasopressors, or analgesic medications; enteral feeding; hypoxia; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; systolic blood pressure; pulse rate; or length of ICU stay. Prolonged delirium may be a risk factor for long-term cognitive impairment after critical illness, though this association has not been entirely consistent across studies. Other potentially preventable factors have not been shown to have strong or consistent associations with long-term cognitive dysfunction in survivors of critical illness.

About 50% of these patients can survive and are discharged from hospitals. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is crucial for evaluating survived ECMO patients. This scoping review aims to identify instruments commonly used to measure HRQOL of ECMO survivors and give pertinent instrument characteristics.Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE (OVID), MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, and three Chinese databases from January 2012 to December 2021. Two reviewers independently reviewed publication selection and data extraction.Results Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (93%) were cross-sectional, and the median (or average) follow-up time ranged from 3 months to 9 years. Two prospective studies (7%) followed patients longitudinally until 1 year after discharge. ECMO survivors had poorer long-term HRQOL than the general population. However, it is comparable to or better than patients with other critical or chronic illnesses.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Key components of a community response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with substantial geographical, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in outcome. Successful resuscitation efforts depend on the 'chain of survival', which includes immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system, early bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with an emphasis on chest compressions, rapid defibrillation, basic and advanced emergency medical services and integrated post-cardiac arrest care. Well-orchestrated telecommunicator CPR programmes can improve rates of bystander CPR - a critical link in the chain of survival. High-performance CPR by emergency medical service providers includes minimizing interruptions in chest compressions and ensuring adequate depth of compressions. Developing local, regional and statewide systems with dedicated high-performing cardiac resuscitation centres for post-resuscitation care can substantially improve survival after OHCA.

The present study provides such follow-up and defines the impact of variables used to grade resuscitation efforts [base deficit (BD) and core temperature (cT)]. One hundred forty-seven patients presenting with rAAA were retrospectively reviewed. Overall perioperative mortality was 35 per cent (51/147) and mean age was 72 years. Survival data were available for 99 per cent of patients with a mean and median follow-up of 45 months. Life table analysis revealed one-, 2-, and 5-year survival to be 81, 75, and 58 per cent, respectively. Eighty-three per cent of patients reported a quality of life equal to that of their preoperative status. Both initial cT (P = 0.02) and BD (P = 0.03) were significantly associated with perioperative mortality. Using a logistic regression model cT remained a significant factor (P = 0.006) associated with survival. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mode of transportation, and surgeon's training were not significant. Despite the advanced age of the present cohort, acceptable perioperative mortality and long-term survival rates were attained. The majority of patients resumed a lifestyle comparable to that of their preoperative state; therefore, long-term longitudinal follow-up suggests that aggressive management with rapid correction of BD and cT results in excellent functional outcome.",AMERICAN SURGEON,2003,"Piper, G; Patel, NA; Chandela, S; Benckart, DH; Young, JC; Collela, JJ; Healy, DA",,,WOS:000184837900018,A

In addition to usual prognostic characteristics, patients' medical history may also influence their outcome. This study aimed to investigate the role of pre-arrest comorbidities on hospital survival, neurological outcome and mode of death in OHCA patients with successful ROSC. Methods: From Jan 2012 to Sep 2017, all consecutive non-traumatic OHCA adults, admitted with a stable ROSC were included. Utstein characteristics, circumstances of arrest and interventions were prospectively recorded. Prior comorbidities were measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and the population was divided into 3 groups (CCI 0, CCI 1-3 and CCI > 4). The association of CCI with early and long-term mortality was assessed using logistic regression and association with withdrawal-of-life sustaining treatments (WLST) or another cause of death using multinomial regression. Results: During the study period, 777 patients were analyzed and 483 (62%) died before hospital discharge, with death rate of 49%, 60% and 70% in CCI 0, CCI 1-3 and CCI > 4 respectively. After adjustment, an increase CCI was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.47 [1.35 -4.52], p = 0.001 for CCI 1-3; OR = 2.82 [1.49-5.33], p = 0.003 for CCI > 4; ref = CCI 0). Other independent predictors were non-shockable rhythm (OR = 3.23 [2.08-5]), lack of bystander CPR (OR = 1.96 [1.22-3.13]), epinephrine dose > 2 mg (OR = 5.56 [3.70-8.33]), CA to CPR > 5 min (OR = 1.96 [1.28 -3.03]) and CPR to ROSC > 20 min (OR = 2.13 [1.39-3.23]). Using multinomial regression, an increase in CCI was associated with all modes of in-hospital death, particularly with WLST-related death (RRadj = 2.48 [1.26-4.90], p = 0.01 for CCI = 1-3 and 3.75 [1.85-8.7.58], p < 0.001 for CCI > 4, reference CCI = 0). Conclusion: Alteration of chronic health status, as assessed by an elevated CCI, was associated with a higher mortality and a worse neurological outcome in OHCA patients.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Quality of life 6-months after cardiac arrest,"Background: Evaluation of outcome after cardiac arrest focuses mainly on survival. Survivors of cardiac arrest end up in different states of health and survival alone may not be a sensitive measure for successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Objectives: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of cardiac arrest survivors with EQ-5D, a generic instrument developed by the EuroQol group. Patients and methods: From April 1997 to December 2000, all cardiac arrest adult patients admitted to an eight-bed medical/surgical (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. At 6-months after ICU discharge survivors attended a follow-up interview and answered EQ-5D questionnaire. A match-control group was created choosing for each survivor of cardiac arrest two controls, with similar age range ( 5 years) and similar Apache 11 ( 3 Apache 11 units), that were randomly selected among other ICU patients. Results: From a total of 1106 patients, 97 (9%) patients were admitted after cardiac arrest. Forty-seven patients (48%) were discharged from ICU. Of these, I I patients died in the ward. Thirty-six (37%) patients were discharged from hospital. Twelve patients died after hospital discharge but before 6-month evaluation. Five patients were not evaluated, three because they were living in distant locations and two for unknown reasons. Nineteen patients attended the follow-up consultation. Eight of these patients were actively working and six of them had managed to return to their previous activity. Eleven patients were retired and seven of these managed to return to their previous level of activity while four patients presented with anoxic encephalopathy: one with mild and one with moderate neurological dysfunction, two with severe anoxic neurological dysfunction. Although a higher percentage of cardiac arrest survivors reported more extreme problems in some dimensions than other ICU patients, no significant differences were found on HR-QOL, when evaluated by EQ-5D. Conclusions: When evaluated with EQ-5D at 6-months after ICU discharge, survivors of cardiac arrest exhibit a HR-QOL similar to other ICU survivors. These results agree with previous reports stating that CPR is frequently unsuccessful but if survival is achieved a fairly good quality of life can be expected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Little is understood about such perceptions as they relate to provider role and experience. A multi-disciplinary group in the PCICU of a single center was surveyed regarding two patient scenarios: (1) ECMO after cardiac surgery, and (2) cardiac arrest with need for CPR. Respondents indicated their risk tolerance for potential complications of these interventions, and the impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Responses were compared based on providers' role and experience. 101 providers were surveyed and were willing to tolerate a 50% risk of death with ECMO or continued CPR but had less tolerance for the risk of other long-term morbidities. For most potential complications, nurses had the lowest risk tolerance and attending physicians the highest. Provider experience had no impact on risk tolerance. All providers underestimated HRQoL scores compared to previously published scores of patients who survived the surveyed scenarios. This survey is one of the first to explore providers' perceptions of ECMO and CPR. PCICU providers are more willing to accept the risk of death than other morbid complications, and poorly predict HRQoL outcomes. Team members have varied risk tolerance for complications and predict their impact differently.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Comprehensive pre- and in-hospital near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring after return of spontaneous circulation predicts neurological outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a prospective observational study and literature review,"Background An increase in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels during advanced life support in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and can predict neurological outcome. Data from the post-ROSC phase are scarce but may predict clinical outcomes as well.Methods For this prospective observational study, we measured rSO2 via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients after ROSC following OHCA in both the pre- and in-hospital setting for up to 72 h. Patients were followed up for their post-ROSC treatment and outcomes. NIRS values were then compared between patients with favorable and non-favorable neurological outcomes, and cutoff values were assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analyses. In addition, a narrative review on the topic was performed.Results Of the 27 included patients, 37% survived hospital discharge, and 26% showed favorable neurological outcomes (CPC 1 or 2). RSO2 was significantly higher in individuals with CPC 1/2 (67 [60-69] % vs. 59 [50-70] %; p = 0.049). This was even more pronounced for initial (= a mean of the first 5 min) NIRS values (70 [65-77] % vs. 57 [49-68] %; p = 0.025) and NIRS values rising in the first 10 min (43% vs. 5% of patients; p = 0.042). A ROC analysis for initial rSO2 showed a significant discriminatory power to predict CPC 1/2 (AUC = 0.789, p = 0.025), and both ROC and CART analyses suggested an optimal cutoff of approximately 62% rSO2.Conclusion We identified a potential RSO2 cutoff measured via NIRS in the post-ROSC phase after OHCA to predict favorable neurological outcomes. Initial values and rising trends may be more useful for prognostication than prolonged ICU measurements.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Current Perspectives on Rehabilitation Following Return of Spontaneous Circulation After Sudden Cardiac Arrest: A Narrative Review,"Background/Objectives: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a major global health concern with high mortality despite advances in resuscitation techniques. Achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) represents merely the initial step in the extensive rehabilitation journey. This review highlights the critical role of structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation following ROSC, emphasizing the necessity of integrated physiotherapy, neurocognitive therapy, and psychosocial support to enhance quality of life and societal reintegration in survivors. Methods: This narrative review analyzed peer-reviewed literature from 2020-2025, sourced from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Emphasis was on clinical trials, expert guidelines (e.g., European Resuscitation Council 2021, American Heart Association 2020), and high-impact journals, with systematic thematic analysis across rehabilitation phases. Results: The review confirms rehabilitation as essential in addressing Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness, cognitive impairment, and post-intensive care syndrome. Early rehabilitation (0-7 days post-ROSC), focusing on parameter-guided mobilization and cognitive stimulation, significantly improves functional outcomes. Structured interdisciplinary interventions encompassing cardiopulmonary, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains effectively mitigate long-term disability, facilitating return to daily activities and employment. However, access disparities and insufficient randomized controlled trials limit evidence-based standardization. Discussion: Optimal recovery after SCA necessitates early and continuous interdisciplinary engagement, tailored to individual physiological and cognitive profiles. Persistent cognitive fatigue, executive dysfunction, and emotional instability remain significant barriers, underscoring the need for holistic and sustained rehabilitative approaches. Conclusions: Comprehensive, individualized rehabilitation following cardiac arrest is not supplementary but fundamental to meaningful recovery. Emphasizing early mobilization, neurocognitive therapy, family involvement, and structured social reintegration pathways is crucial. Addressing healthcare disparities and investing in rigorous randomized trials are imperative to achieving standardized, equitable, and outcome-oriented rehabilitation services globally.",HEALTHCARE,2025,"Salwa, K; Kaziród-Wolski, K; Rebak, D; Sielski, J",10.3390/healthcare13151865,,WOS:001548791000001,A

Blood samples were collected at ICU admission, 12 h, and 48 h post-cardiac arrest. Poor neurological outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3-5 at 2-6 months after cardiac arrest. Plasma samples were retrospectively analysed for GFAP, tau, and NFL. Serum NSE was analysed in clinical care. Prognostic performances were tested with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).Results Of the 428 included patients, 328 were OHCA, and 100 were IHCA. At ICU admission, 12 h and 48 h post-cardiac arrest, GFAP predicted neurological outcome after OHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.76 (0.70-0.82), 0.86 (0.81-0.90) and 0.91 (0.87-0.96), and after IHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.77 (0.66-0.87), 0.83 (0.74-0.92) and 0.83 (0.71-0.95). At the same time points, tau predicted outcome after OHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.72 (0.66-0.79), 0.75 (0.69-0.81), and 0.93 (0.89-0.96) and after IHCA with AUC (95% CI) 0.61 (0.49-0.74), 0.68 (0.56-0.79), and 0.77 (0.65-0.90). Adding the change in biomarker levels between time points did not improve predictive accuracy compared to the last time point. In a subset of patients, GFAP at 12 h and 48 h, as well as tau at 48 h, offered similar predictive value as NSE at 48 h (the earliest time point NSE is recommended in guidelines) after both OHCA and IHCA. The predictive performance of NFL was similar or superior to GFAP and tau at all time points after OHCA and IHCA.Conclusion GFAP and tau are promising biomarkers for neuroprognostication, with the highest predictive performance at 48 h after OHCA, but not superior to NFL.

A cardiac arrest can lead to hypoxic brain injury, which can affect all levels of functioning. Objective. To investigate 1-year outcome and the pattern of recovery after surviving a cardiac arrest. Methods. This was a multicenter, prospective longitudinal cohort study with 1 year of follow-up (measurements 2 weeks, 3 months, 1 year). On function level, physical/cardiac function (New York Heart Association Classification), cognition (Cognitive Log [Cog-log], Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), emotional functioning (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) were assessed. In addition, level of activities (Frenchay Activities Index, FAI), participation (Community Integration Questionnaire [CIQ] and return to work), and quality of life (EuroQol 5D, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36, Quality of Life after Brain Injury) were measured. Results. In this cohort, 141 cardiac arrest survivors were included. At 1 year, 14 (13%) survivors scored below cutoff on the Cog-log. Both anxiety and depression were present in 16 (15%) survivors, 29 (28%) experienced posttraumatic stress symptoms and 55 (52%), severe fatigue. Scores on the FAI and the CIQ were, on average, respectively 96% and 92% of the prearrest scores. Of those previously working, 41 (72%) had returned to work. Most recovery of cognitive function and quality of life occurred within the first 3 months, with further improvement on some domains of quality of life up to 12 months. Conclusions.

The 'Utstein-style' data of patients surviving non-traumatic cardiac arrest 24 (14-32) months were prospectively collected. The everyday activities and psychological concerns of patients with a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 and 2 using a questionnaire were analyzed. The chi(2)-square test was used for statistical analysis. The questionnaires of 92 patients (median age 59, IQR 51-68; females 36) were evaluated. Patients enjoy life (84%; n = 73), have depression (36%; n = 31), consider their survival a 'second chance' (84%; n = 73) and fear that they may suffer cardiac arrest again (56%; n = 45). The average quality of life is 7 on a scale from 0 (worst) to IO (perfect). The majority of cardiac arrest survivors have a satisfactory life. No significant correlation between the type of emergency cardiac care and post cardiac arrest life was found. The fact that there was no association with the type of emergency cardiac care may be due to the narrow selection of patients (CPC 1 and 2), the small number of patients or factors contributing to post cardiac arrest life other than emergency treatment.

Clinical trials generally showed limited benefit but are difficult to perform in a timely manner. In this clinical study, we evaluated the association between the use of hypothermia (or not) and health-related quality of life among survivors of pediatric cardiac arrest as well as overall mortality. DESIGN: Single-center, retrospectively identified cohort with prospective assessment of health-related quality of life. SETTING: PICU of a pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Children with either out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest from January 2012 to December 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned into two groups: those who received therapeutic hypothermia at less than or equal to 35 degrees C and those who did not receive therapeutic hypothermia but who had normothermia targeted (36-36.5 degrees C). The primary outcome was health-related quality of life assessment and the secondary outcome was PICU mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied 239 children, 112 (47%) in the therapeutic hypothermia group. The median (interquartile range) of lowest temperature reached in the 48 hours post cardiac arrest in the therapeutic hypothermia group was 33 degrees C (32.6-33.6 degrees C) compared with 35.4 degrees C (34.7-36.2 degrees C) in the no therapeutic hypothermia group (p < 0.001). At follow-up, 152 (64%) were alive and health-related quality of life assessments were completed in 128. Use of therapeutic hypothermia was associated with higher lactate and lower pH at baseline. After regression adjustment, therapeutic hypothermia (as opposed to no therapeutic hypothermia) was associated with higher physical (mean difference, 15.8; 95% CI, 3.5-27.9) and psychosocial scores (13.6 [5.8-21.5]). These observations remained even when patients with a temperature greater than 37.5 degrees C were excluded. We failed to find an association between therapeutic hypothermia and lower mortality.

For those who were admitted with a neurocritical illness, the number can be as high as 60%. The most common diagnoses for a neurocritical illness admission include traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, post-cardiac arrest, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, meningo/encephalitis, and stroke. The gut-brain axis is crucial to childhood development, particularly neurodevelopment. Alterations on either side of the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis have been shown to alter typical development and have been associated with autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and learning disabilities, among others. For those patients who have experienced a direct neurologic insult, subsequent interventions may contribute to dysbiosis, which could compound injury to the brain. Increasing data suggests the existence of a critical window for both gut microbiome plasticity and neurodevelopment in which interventions could help or could harm and warrant further investigation.",FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,2025,"Ronan, V",10.3389/fped.2024.1499330,,WOS:001411055300001,A

Of the 181 resuscitated patients, 23 (13%) could be discharged. Outcome was significantly affected by the following variables: presence of shock or renal failure before cardiac arrest (CA) (odds ratio = 10.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.3-85.8 and odds ratio = 13.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-109.2, respectively), administration of epinephrine (odds ratio = 11.2; 95% confidence interval = 3.2-39.2) or prolonged CPR (> 15 min) (odds ratio = 4.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-13.7).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,"Out of hospital cardiac arrest: Past, present, and future","Advances in resuscitation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) provide an opportunity to improve public health. This review reflects on past developments, present status, and future possibilities using the science-education-implementation framework of the Utstein Formula and the clinical framework of the links in the chain of survival. With the discovery of CPR and defibrillation in the mid 20th century, resuscitation developed a scientific construct for progress. Systems of emergency community response provided operational efficiency to treat OHCA. Contemporary resuscitation involves integrated interventions in the chain of survival: early recognition, early CPR, early defibrillation, expert and timely advanced life support and hospital care, and multidimensional rehabilitation. Implementation of scientific advances is especially challenging given the unexpected nature of OHCA, the need for time-sensitive interventions, and the substantial collective of stakeholders involved in the chain of survival. Systematic measurement provides the foundation to evaluate performance and guide implementation initiatives. For many systems, telecommunicator CPR and high-performance CPR by emergency professionals are accessible, near-term programs to improve OHCA outcome. Smart technologies that activate, coordinate, and/or coach community ""volunteers"" to accelerate early CPR and defibrillation have conceptual promise, though robust implementation has been achieved by only a handful of systems.

We aimed to determine HRQoL during 1-year after refractory OHCA in patients treated with ECPR and CCPR. Methods: We present a secondary analysis of the multicenter INCEPTION-trial, which studied the effectiveness of ECPR versus CCPR in patients with refractory OHCA. HRQoL was prospectively assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Poor HRQoL was pragmatically defined as an EQ-5D-5L health utility index (HUI) > 1 SD below the age-adjusted norm. We used mixed linear models to assess the difference in HRQoL over time and univariable analyses to assess factors potentially associated with poor HRQoL. Results: A total of 134 patients were enrolled, and hospital survival was 20% (27 patients). EQ-5D-5L data were available for 25 patients (5 ECPR and 20 CCPR). One year after OHCA, the estimated mean HUI was 0.73 (0.05) in all patients, 0.84 (0.12) in ECPR survivors, and 0.71 (0.05) in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.31). Eight (32%) survivors had a poor HRQoL. HRQoL was good in 17 (68%) patients, with 100% in ECPR survivors versus 60% in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.14). Conclusion: One year after refractory OHCA, 68% of the survivors had a good HRQoL.

We explored the psychological adjustment and experiential perspectives of survivors and families in the second year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: A prospective, mixed-methods study of adult OHCA survivors in Victoria, Australia was conducted. Eighteen survivors and 12 family members completed semi-structured interviews 14-19 months post-arrest. Survivors' cognition, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured using a battery of psychological assessments. A thematic content analysis approach was applied to qualitative interview data by two independent investigators, with data coded and categorised into themes and sub-themes. Results: Survivors' cognition, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were not clinically elevated in the second year post-arrest. Subjective cognitive failures were associated with increased anxiety but not with mental state. Depression was significantly correlated with post traumatic symptoms. Six primary themes emerged from survivors' recovery stories, focused on: awakening and realisation, barriers to adjustment, psychosocial difficulties, integration, protective factors and unmet needs. Family perspectives revealed four primary themes focused on trauma exposure, survivor adjustment problems, family impact, and areas for service improvement. Conclusion: Survivors and their family members describe complex recovery journeys characterised by a range of psychosocial adjustment challenges, which are not adequately captured by common psychological measures.

However, few studies have examined the prognosis of choking-induced cardiac arrest. The aim of this study was to reveal the rates of survival and dependence on devices in the long term after choking-induced cardiac arrest. Methods We analyzed data from the Shizuoka Kokuho Database, which consists of claims data of approximately 2.2 million people, from April 2012 to September 2018. We selected patients with choking-induced cardiac arrest who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the hospital. Patients were excluded if they were less than 20 years old, had an upper airway tumor, received ventilation assistance, or received enteral nutrition in the month prior to cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was death, and the secondary outcomes were the rates of survival at 3-months and independence on devices. Descriptive statistics are presented and compared among age groups (20-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, 85 years and older), and survival time analysis (Kaplan-Meier method) was performed. Results In total, 268 patients were analyzed, including 26 patients in the 20-64 age group, 33 patients in the 65-74 age group, 70 patients in the 75-84 age group, and 139 patients in the >= 85 age group. The overall 3-month survival rate was 5.6% (15/268). The 3-month survival rates were 3.8% (1/26) in the 20-64 age group, 15.2% (5/33) in the 65-74 age group, 8.6% (6/70) in the 75-84 age group, and 2.2% (3/139) in the >= 85 age group. The overall 12-month survival rate was 2.6% (7/268). Of the 7 patients who survived for 12 months, 3 received ventilation management and 5 received tube or intravenous feedings at 3 months. These survivors were still receiving ventilation assistance and tube feedings in the hospital and had not been discharged at 12 months. Conclusions The prognosis of choking-induced cardiac arrest was extremely poor when patients were not resuscitated before hospital arrival.

There has been little literature on the long-term outcomes after surgical reconstruction and factors affecting it. The aim of this study was to study factors affecting long-term outcomes following surgical repair of iatrogenic bile duct injury being referred to a tertiary care centre. Between January 2005 to December 2011, 138 patients with bile duct injury were treated in a single surgical unit in a tertiary care referral hospital. Preoperative details were recorded. After initial resuscitation, any intra-abdominal collection was drained and an imaging of biliary anatomy was done. Once the general condition of the patient improved, patients were taken up for a side-to-side extended left duct hepaticojejunostomy. The post-operative outcomes were recorded and a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan and liver function tests were done, and then the patients were followed up at regular intervals. Clinical outcome was evaluated according to clinical grades described by Terblanche and Worthley (Surgery 108: 828-834, 1990). The variables were compared using chi-square, unpaired Student's t test and Fisher's exact test. A two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Methods and Results We conducted 15 semistructured, one-on-one interviews with cardiac arrest survivor members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation; the interviews were conducted by telephone and recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis, informed by the Framework Method, to identify underlying themes regarding cardiac arrest survivorship challenges and recommendations to improve cardiac arrest survivorship. Regarding challenges, the overarching theme was a feeling of unpreparedness to confront postarrest challenges because of lack of resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Regarding recommendations, we uncovered 3 overarching themes including systemic recommendations (eg, providing appropriate resources and expectations, educating providers about survivorship, following up with survivors, including caregivers in treatment planning), social recommendations (eg, attending peer support groups, spending time with loved ones, providing support resources for family members), and individual coping recommendations (eg, acceptance, resilience, regaining control, seeking treatment, focusing on meaning and purpose). Conclusions We described common challenges that survivors of cardiac arrest face, such as lacking resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Additionally, we identified promising pathways that may improve cardiac arrest survivorship at systemic, social, and individual coping levels. Future studies could use our findings as targets for interventions to support and improve survivorship.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION,2022,"Presciutti, A; Siry-Bove, B; Newman, MM; Elmer, J; Grigsby, J; Masters, KS; Shaffer, JA; Vranceanu, AM; Perman, SM",10.1161/JAHA.121.025713,,WOS:000826949500024,A

Regardless of the cause of collapse, multiple organ systems may be affected secondary to post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Interventions required for post-ROSC care are bundled into a care regimen: prompt identification and treatment of the cause of cardiac arrest; and treatment of electrolyte abnormalities. It is also essential to establish definitive airway management to maintain normocapnic ventilation, prevent hyperoxia, and optimise haemodynamic management via judicious intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs. Targeted temperature management after ROSC confers neuroprotection and leads to improved neurological outcomes. Glycaemic control of blood glucose levels at 6-10 mmol/L, adequate seizure management and measures to optimise neurological functions should be integrated into the care bundle.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Mid-term (30-to 90-day) neurological changes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: A nationwide retrospective study (the JAAM-OHCA registry),"Objective: Few studies have focused on mid/long-term neurological changes in out-of- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Some studies suggest that there is still a slow, small, progressive improvement in cognitive function and quality of life for this population, even in the mid/long term. However, clinical data focused on mid/longterm outcomes for OHCA patients are still lacking. This study aimed to assess mid-term neurological changes in OHCA patients. We summarized patients' improved or worsened neurological changes between 30 and 90 days. Then we identified the relationship between clinical variables and 30- to 90-day neurological improvement. Methods: A retrospective review of data (Jun 2014 - Dec 2017) from a Japanese nationwide OHCA registry was conducted. Inclusion criteria were OHCA patients >= 18 years old. Exclusion criteria were death within 30 days and missing Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 30 and 90 days. We described the distributions of 30-day and 90-day CPC scores as well as the number and portion of patients whose CPC scores improved and worsened between 30 and 90 days. Additionally, factors affecting improved neurological changes over the time period were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of the registry's 34,745 patients, 1868 were analyzed. Favorable neurological outcomes (CPC scores of 1 and 2) were seen in 1020/1868 patients at 90 days. CPC scores at 90 days were: CPC 1: 866 (46%), CPC 2: 154 (8.2%), CPC 3: 224 (12%), and CPC 4: 392 (20%), respectively. A total of 232 patients (CPC 5: 12%) died between 30 and 90 days. In 133 patients (7%), 90-day CPC scores improved compared to their 30-day scores. In 260 patients (14%), 90-day CPC scores worsened compared with their 30-day scores. Application of target temperature management was an independent factor for 30- to 90-day neurological improvement (adjusted odds ratio: 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.68). Conclusions: In our nationwide registry, 7% of resuscitated patients had improved neurological changes in the 30to 90-day period; most of the improvements were CPC scores improving from 2 to 1. Target temperature management was an independent factor associated with CPC improvement over the 30- to 90-day period. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Cardiac arrest: long-term cognitive and imaging analysis,"Background: Neurological and cognitive sequelae resulting from cardiac arrest (CA), despite their potential personal and social impact, are usually not considered as major outcome measures in long-term analysis of survivors. The aim of this study is to analyze the contribution of neuropsychological testing and cerebral imaging to the development of a long-term classification of neurological impairment. Patients and methods: A total of 19 patients admitted over a 3 years period in an eight-bed intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital with a diagnosis of CA were alive and attended a 6-month follow-up consultation. Eleven of these patients agreed to participate in this study carried out between I and 3 years after CA. Patients were classified using the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC), neurological examination, detailed cognitive testing and computerized tomography (CT) scan with qualitative and quantitative imaging analysis. Results: Six of the 11 patients had good cerebral performance. Verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory scores were associated with CPC. All patients with at least moderate cerebral disability had abnormal verbal memory test results compared with only one survivor with CPC 1; visuo-spatial short-term memory was abnormal in four moderately affected survivors and normal in those with CPC 1. The bicaudate ratio evaluated in the CT scan was correlated with the verbal memory score while the III ventricle diameter correlated with the executive functions score, suggesting involvement of different brain areas in these functions. Conclusions: Neuropsychological and CT scan measurements are proxy measures of long-term impairment of CA survivors, providing a dichotomized global evaluation of CA survivors in close agreement with CPC.

ECPR uses veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) to maintain organ perfusion while treating reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Commonly applied criteria to select suitable patients include witnessed cardiac arrest, early bystander CPR, and a time frame of less than 60 minutes from collapse to ECPR initiation. A meta-analysis by Low et al. (2023), which included 11 studies with 4,595 ECPR and 4,597 CCPR patients, demonstrated that ECPR was not only associated with higher survival rates, but also better long-term neurological outcomes. Additionally, a higher number of ECPR procedures per center was linked to reduced mortality rates. A 2024 updated meta-analysis confirmed these findings and demonstrated further that ECPR significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Further insights on this topic can be gained from the individual studies on ECPR for treatment of OHCA: In general, there are several different modalities of how ECPR can be deployed, ranging from implantation at the site of the index event vs. implantation in the hospital, and even the place of implantation in the hospital varies. However, it seems that the actual pathway of how the VA-ECMO is implanted is of lower importance, and highly depends on the local infrastructure of a given hospital (rural area vs. municipal area), while achieving the lowest possible low-flow time should be the primary goal. The available data also shows that, despite all the advances, ECPR is still a high-risk intervention which is very demanding on the personnel and requires an abundance of resources. Overall, ECPR is a promising therapy for patients with OHCA to improve survival with good neurological outcome, but only if applied in a highly structured and standardized way, and in carefully selected patients.",DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT,2025,"Kriz, M; Schrage, B",10.1055/a-2286-0403,,WOS:001428127800011,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,The epidemiology of out-of-hospital 'sudden' cardiac arrest,"It is difficult to assemble data from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest since there is often lack of objective information. The true incidence of sudden cardiac death out-of-hospital is not known since far from all of these patients are attended by emergency medical services. The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest increases with age and is more common among men. Among patients who die, the probability of having a fatal event outside hospital decreases with age: i. e. younger patients tend to more often die unexpectedly and outside hospital. Among the different initial arrhythmias, ventricular Fibrillation is the most common among patients with cardiac aetiology. The true distribution of initial arrhythmias is not known since several minutes most often elapse between collapse and rhythm assessment. Most patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a cardiac aetiology. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests most frequently Occur in the patient's home, but the prognosis is shown to be better when they occur in a public place. Witnessed arrest. ventricular fibrillation as initial arrhythmia and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are important predictors for immediate survival. In the long-term perspective. cardiac arrest in connection with acute myocardial infarction. high left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate age. absence of other heart failure signs and no history of myocardial infarction promotes better prognosis. Still there is much to learn about time trends. the influence of patient characteristics, comorbidity and hospital treatment among patients with prehospital cardiac arrest.

In this preliminary study, we investigated the optimum timing of thoracotomy which brings high rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and keeps the incidence of unnecessary thoracotomy minimal. Ninety-five adult patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were analyzed. Of those, 26 patients were treated by the open-chest CPR in a prospective consecutive fashion. In this group, the ROSC rate was investigated in connection with the interval from hospital arrival, or ambulance call, to thoracotomy. Another 69 patients were treated by standard CPR. In this uncontrolled group, the interval from arrival at hospital to ROSC was investigated to define the 'natural hospital course' by the conventional treatment. Patient characteristics in the open-chest CPR group and the standard CPR group were similar. In the open-chest CPR group, 15 patients obtained ROSC. There was a tendency that the ROSC rate was highest in the patients with thoracotomy within 5 min of hospital arrival and declined as the timing of thoracotomy was delayed. Similar tendency was noted when the timing of thoracotomy was counted from the ambulance call. In the standard CPR group, only two patients obtained ROSC during the initial 5 min of hospital course. These results suggest that thoracotomy within 5 min of hospital arrival brings the highest ROSC Tate while keeps the incidence of unnecessary thoracotomy acceptable.",RESUSCITATION,1993,"TAKINO, M; OKADA, Y",10.1016/0300-9572(93)90165-M,,WOS:A1993LW26300009,A

However, information about predictors is not provided. A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify early predictors of long-term cognitive outcome after cardiac arrest. Methods: Scopus and PubMed were systematically searched to identify studies on early predictors of long-term cognitive outcome in patients after cardiac arrest. The population included adult cardiac arrest survivors and potential early predictors were demographics, early cognitive screening scores, imaging measures, electroencephalographic measures, and levels of blood biomarkers. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results: Five articles were included. Risk of bias was assessed as low or moderate. Most detected longterm cognitive impairments were in the domain of memory. Coma duration (2 studies), early cognitive impairments by the self-developed clinical Bedside Neuropsychological Test Battery (BNTB) screener (2 studies), and high S-100B levels on day 3 (2 studies) were the most prominent identified determinants of cognitive impairment on the group level. On the individual patient level, a score on the BNTB of <= 94.5 predicted cognitive impairments at 6 months after cardiac arrest (1 study without external validation).

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a considerable lifesaving therapy but systemic thrombolysis before cannulation could carry a high risk of hemorrhage and alter the prognosis.MethodsBetween June 2012 and June 2023, we retrospectively analyzed from three intensive care units in Sorbonne University, ECMO-related complications and 90-day mortality for high-risk PE patients who received ECMO without previous systemic thrombolysis compared to those cannulated after systemic thrombolysis failure. Hospital discharge survivors were assessed for long-term health-related quality of life and echocardiographic evaluations.Results72 high-risk PE patients [median age 48 (37-61) years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) 74 (60-85)] were placed on VA-ECMO for 5 (5-7) days. 31 (43%) patients underwent pre-ECMO thrombolysis (thrombolysis ECMO group, T +) compared to 41 patients (57%, no thrombolysis ECMO group, T-). There was more pre-ECMO cardiac arrest in the thrombolysis ECMO group (94% vs. 67%, p = 0.02). Ninety-day survival was not different between groups (39% vs 46%, log-rank test, p = 0.31).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to November 28, 2021, for randomized trials and observational studies reporting propensity score-matched data and comparing adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation with those treated with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary outcome was survival with favorable neurological outcome at the longest follow-up available. Secondary outcomes were survival at the longest follow-up available and survival at hospital discharge/30 days. Results We included six studies, two randomized and four propensity score-matched studies. Patients treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation had higher rates of survival with favorable neurological outcome (81/584 [14%] vs. 46/593 [7.8%]; OR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.41-3.15; p < 0.001, number needed to treat 16) and of survival (131/584 [22%] vs. 102/593 [17%]; OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.87; p = 0.02) at the longest follow-up available compared with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Successful weaning of VA-ECMO may not be possible, and bridging with further mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as urgent implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), may represent the only means to sustain the patient haemodynamically. In the recovery phase, many survivors are not suitably prepared physically or psychologically for the novel issues encountered during daily life with an LVAD. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of our institutional database between 2012 and 2019 was performed to identify patients treated with VA-ECMO for CS who underwent urgent LVAD implantation whilst on MCS. Post-cardiotomy cases were excluded. QoL was assessed prospectively during a routine follow-up visit using the EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 level (EQ-5D-5L) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys. Results: Among 126 in-hospital survivors of VA-ECMO therapy due to cardiogenic shock without prior cardiac surgery, 31 (24.6%) urgent LVAD recipients were identified. In 11 (36.7%) cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed (median 10, range 1-60 min) before initiation of VA-ECMO, and in 5 (16.7%) cases, MCS was established under CPR. Mean age at LVAD implantation was 51.7 (+/-14) years and surgery was performed after a mean 12.1 (+/-8) days of VA-ECMO support. During follow-up of 46.9 (+/-25.5) months, there were 10 deaths after 20.4 (+/-12.1) months of LVAD support. Analysis of QoL questionnaires returned a mean EQ-5D-5L score of 66% (+/-21) of societal valuation for Germany and a mean PHQ-9 score of 5.7 (+/-5) corresponding to mild depression severity. When compared with 49 elective LVAD recipients without prior VA-ECMO therapy, there was no significant difference in QoL results. Conclusions: Patients requiring urgent LVAD implantation under VA-ECMO support due to CS are associated with comparable quality of life without a significant difference from elective LVAD recipients.

Design: A longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Seven metropolitan hospitals in Australia. Patients: Data were collected for hospitalized adults (>= 18 yr) who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest, defined as ""a period of unresponsiveness, with no observed respiratory effort and the commencement of external cardiac compressions."" Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Prior to hospital discharge, patients were approached for consent to participate in 6-month and 12-month telephone interviews. Outcomes included the modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Euro-Quality of Life 5 Dimension 5 Level, return to work and hospital readmissions. Forty-eight patients (80%) consented to follow-up interviews. The mean age of participants was 67.2 (+/- 15.3) years, and 33 of 48 (68.8%) were male. Good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score <= 3) was reported by 31 of 37 participants (83.8%) at 6 months and 30 of 33 (90.9%) at 12 months. The median Euro-Quality of Life-5D index value was 0.73 (0.33-0.84) at 6 months and 0.76 (0.47-0.88) at 12 months. The median Euro-Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale score at 6 months was 70 (55-80) and 75 (50-87.5) at 12 months.

Gender disparities have emerged as crucial determinants of OHCA outcomes; however, China-specific evidence remains limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 3,272 adult non-traumatic OHCA patients treated at the Zhengzhou Emergency Medical Rescue Center between 2017 and 2020. Patient characteristics and interventions were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to assess their associations with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Results: Among 3,272 OHCA patients, women accounted for 27.6% (n = 902), and were significantly older than men (70.1 vs. 61.1 years, p < 0.001). Compared with men, women experienced lower rates of witnessed arrest (51.2% vs. 64.0%, p < 0.001), CPR from bystanders (4.8% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.01), AED use (8.9% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.005), and shockable initial rhythm (6.7% vs. 16.1%, p < 0.001). In addition, women were less likely to experience an OHCA in a public location (13.7% vs. 26.4%, p < 0.001). The female sex remained independently associated with a significantly lower prehospital ROSC rate (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.13-0.53, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Significant gender disparities were identified in prehospital outcomes of OHCA patients in Zhengzhou. Compared with men, women were older and less likely to experience a cardiac arrest in public locations, have the event witnessed, receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from a bystander, present with a shockable rhythm, or require an automated external defibrillator (AED).

Individuals within this patient cohort grapple with uncertainty regarding the potential advantages of extracorporeal life support (ECMO) cannulation. This study elucidates the neurological outcomes and quality of life of post-cardiac arrest patients who attained spontaneous circulation and underwent ECMO cannulation. This is a retrospective case study within a local context, the research involved 32 patients who received ECMO support following an intrahospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An additional 32 patients experienced cardiac arrest with ROSC before undergoing cannulation. The average age was 41 years, with the primary causes of cardiac arrest identified as acute coronary syndrome (46.8%), pulmonary thromboembolism (21.88%), and hypoxemia (18.7%). The most prevalent arrest rhythm was asystole (37.5%), followed by ventricular fibrillation (34.4%). The mean SOFA score was 7 points (IQR 6.5-9), APACHE II score was 12 (IQR 9-16), RESP score was -1 (IQR -1 to -4) in cases of respiratory ECMO, and SAVE score was -3 (IQR -5 to 2) in cases of cardiac ECMO. Overall survival was 71%, and at 6 months, the Barthel score was 75 points, modified Rankin score was 2, cerebral performance categories score was 1, and the SF-12 had an average score of 30. Notably, there were no significant associations between the time, cause, or rhythm of cardiac arrest and neurological outcomes. Importantly, cardiac arrest is not a contraindication for ECMO cannulation. A meticulous assessment of candidates who have achieved spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, considering the absence of early signs of poor neurological prognosis, is crucial in patient selection.

We evaluated the Effects of small-dose dopamine on splanchnic blood flow and renal function after successful resuscitation with this potent vasoconstrictor in an established porcine CPR model. After 4 min of cardiac arrest, and 3 min of CPR, animals received 0.4 U/kg vasopressin and were continuously infused with either dopamine 4 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) (n = 6),or saline placebo (n = 6). Defibrillation was performed 5 min after drug administration; all animals were observed for 6 h after return of spontaneous circulation. During the postresuscitation phase, average mean rt SD superior mesenteric artery blood flow was significantly (P = 0.002) higher in the dopamine group compared with the placebo group (1185 +/- 130 vs 740 +/- 235 mL/min), whereas renal blood flow was comparable between groups (255 +/- 40 vs 250 +/- 85 mL/min). The median calculated glomerular filtration rate had higher values in the dopamine group (70-120 mL/min) than in the placebo group (40-70 mL/min; P = 0.1 at 0 min and P = 0.08 at 360 min), We conclude that small-dose dopamine administration may be useful in improving superior mesenteric artery blood flow and renal function after successful resuscitation with vasopressin. Implications: Long-term survival after cardiac arrest may be determined by the ability to ensure adequate organ perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in the postresuscitation phase. Ln this regard, small-dose dopamine improved postresuscitation blood flow to the mesenteric bed when vasopressin was used as an alternative vasopressor in an animal model of cardiac arrest.",ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,1999,"Voelckel, WG; Lindner, KH; Wenzel, V; Bonatti, JO; Krismer, AC; Miller, EA; Lurie, KG",10.1097/00000539-199912000-00020,,WOS:000083982400020,A

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Prognostic Factor in Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Refractory In- and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is used to improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest (CA) refractory to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR); however, ECPR carries several risks including futility and high cost. Although ECPR requires proper and rapid decision-making, the immediately available prognostic factors remain unclear. Objectives: This study evaluated the prognostic factors available during CCPR among patients with in-hospital CA (IHCA) and out-of-hospital CA (OHCA), respectively. Methods: This single-center retrospective study included consecutive ECPR recipients at our institution from January 2013 to September 2024. Uni-and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of 30-day mortality. Results: Of the 204 patients (age, 63 f 14 years; male, 77%; OHCA, 45%; out-of-hours ECPR, 52%; initial shockable rhythm, 52%) included in this study, the overall 30-day survival rate was 24%. Patients with IHCA had a significantly better survival rate than those with OHCA (30% vs. 15%, p = 0.013). The optimal lactate cutoff values for discriminating outcomes were 9.2 mmol/L for IHCA and 14.3 mmol/L for OHCA. Among patients with IHCA, serum lactate levels, and initial shockable rhythm were significantly associated with 30-day mortality, whereas among patients with OHCA, serum lactate levels, out-of-hours ECPR, and bystander CPR were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: Determining serum lactate levels before ECPR is potentially useful for prompt and accurate decision-making among patients with IHCA or OHCA. However, greater discretion may be required for out-of-hours ECPR in patients with OHCA. Larger studies validating these observations are needed to identify optimal candidates for ECPR.

Methods: This prospective cohort study investigates the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 to predict outcomes at hospital discharge of adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care at a large Swiss tertiary academic medical center (COMMUNICATE/PROPHETIC cohort study). We prompted ChatGPT-4 with sixteen prognostic parameters derived from established post -cardiac arrest scores for each patient.

To investigate the changes in vertebral function after minimally invasive surgery in patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures and investigate the impact of percutaneous minimally invasive surgery on patients' quality of life by following up the patients in the long term. Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed to select 80 patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures treated in our hospital from April 2013 to October 2018, and the patients were divided into a study group and a control group according to the difference in their choice of procedure. The two groups were compared in terms of perioperative wound pain, serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the two groups were followed up for 2 years to compare the changes in anterior vertebral body height and Cobb's angle during the follow-up period and to compare the differences in quality of life between the two groups. Results. (1) The pain level of patients in the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group at the 1st and 3rd postoperative days (p < 0.05). (2) The CK activity and CPR level of patients in the study group were significantly lower than that of the control group at the 1st and 3rd postoperative days (p < 0.05).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Radiomics for Predicting the Development of Brain Edema from Normal-Appearing Early Brain-CT After Cardiac Arrest and Return of Spontaneous Circulation,"Background: Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is a feared complication post-cardiac arrest (CA). The timing of brain imaging remains a topic of ongoing debate. Early computed tomography (CT) scans can reveal acute intracranial pathologies but may have limited predictive value due to delayed manifestation of HIBI-related changes. Radiomics analyses present a promising approach to identifying subtle imaging markers, potentially aiding early HIBI detection. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed post-CA patients between 2016 and 2023 who received immediate brain CTs. Patients without acute intracranial pathology on initial scans and who underwent follow-up brain CTs within 14 days post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were included. Image segmentation involved manual basalganglia segmentation and automated whole-brain segmentation. Radiomics features were calculated using Pyradiomics (v3.0.1) in 3DSlicer (v5.2.2). Feature selection involved reproducibility analysis via ICC and LASSO regression, retaining five features per segmentation method. A logistic regression model for each segmentation method underwent 5-fold cross-validation. Results were summarized with ROC analyses and average sensitivity and specificity. Results: A total of 83 patients (average age: 65 +/- 13.3 years, 19 women) with CA and ROSC were included. Follow-up CT scans after 5.2 +/- 2.9 days revealed brain edema in 47 patients.

Patient survival to hospital discharge with favourable functional and neurological status is around 21-30%. The Bern University Hospital is a tertiary medical centre in Switzerland with a cardiac arrest team that is available 24 h per day, 7 days per week. Due to lack of central documentation of cardiac arrest team interventions, the incidence, outcomes and survival rates of cardiac arrests in the hospital are unknown. Our aim was to record all cardiac arrest team interventions over 1 year, and to analyse the outcome and survival rates of adult patients after in-hospital cardiac arrests. Methods We conducted a prospective single-centre observational study that recorded all adult in-hospital cardiac arrest team interventions over 1 year, using an Utstein-style case report form. The primary outcome was 30-day survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation, neurological status (after return of spontaneous circulation, after 24 h, after 30 days, after 1 and 5 years), according to the Glasgow Outcomes Scale, and functional status at 30 days and 1 year, according to the Short-form-12 Health Survey. Results The cardiac arrest team had 146 interventions over the study year, which included 60 non-life-threatening alarms (41.1%). The remaining 86 (58.9%) acute life-threatening situations included 68 (79.1%) as patients with cardiac arrest. The mean age of these cardiac arrest patients was 68 +/- 13 years, with a male predominance (51/68; 75.0%). Return of spontaneous circulation was recorded in 49 patients (72.1%). Over one-third of the cardiac arrest patients (27/68) were alive after 30 days with favourable neurological outcome. The patients who survived the first year lived also to 5 years after the event with favourable neurological and functional status. Conclusions The in-hospital cardiac arrest incidence on a large tertiary Swiss university hospital was 1.56 per 1000 patient admissions. After a cardiac arrest, about a third of the patients survived to 5 years with favourable neurological and functional status.

Fifty-three patients completed follow-up MMSEs, and the median scores were 20.0 (IQR, 13.5-23.0) for the first and 25.0 (IQR, 21.5-28.0) for the last test. Of the specific domains, recall (0.0 (IQR, 0.0-1.0) to 2.0 (IQR, 1.0-3.0)) and attention/calculation (3.0 (IQR, 1.0-4.0) to 4.0 (IQR, 2.0-5.0)) were the most affected domains until ICU discharge. The factors that were correlated with cognitive impairment on the last MMSE were older age (OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14), p=0.016), increased time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (OR, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15), p=0.012), and length of hospital stay (OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.14), p=0.044). Conclusions. Cognitive impairments were common immediately after patients regained consciousness but recovered substantially before ICU discharge. Recall and attention/calculation still were impaired until ICU discharge, and older age, increased time to ROSC, and LOS were associated with this cognitive decline.",EMERGENCY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL,2019,"Kim, SH; Oh, SH; Park, KN; Kim, TH",10.1155/2019/2578258,,WOS:000498561800001,A

Methods: PARAMEDIC -3 is a pragmatic, allocation concealed, open -label, multi -centre, superiority randomised controlled trial. It will recruit 15,000 patients across English and Welsh ambulance services. Adults who have sustained an out -of -hospital cardiac arrest are individually randomised to an intraosseous access first strategy or intravenous access first strategy in a 1:1 ratio through an opaque, sealed envelope system. The randomised allocation determines the route used for the first two attempts at vascular access. Participants are initially enrolled under a deferred consent model. The primary clinical -effectiveness outcome is survival at 30 -days. Secondary outcomes include return of spontaneous circulation, neurological functional outcome, and health -related quality of life. Participants are followed -up to six -months following cardiac arrest. The primary health economic outcome is incremental cost per quality -adjusted life year gained. Conclusion: The PARAMEDIC -3 trial will provide key information on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of drug route in out -of -hospital cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,The effect of thermoelectric craniocerebral cooling device on protecting brain functions in post-cardiac arrest syndrome,"Aim This study aimed to protect brain functions in patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest through the application of local cerebral hypothermia. By utilizing a specialized thermal hypothermia device, this approach sought to mitigate ischemic brain injury associated with post-cardiac arrest syndrome, enhance survival rates, and improve neurological outcomes as measured by standardized scales.Methods A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted involving patients aged >= 18 years who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest and achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Patients were cooled using a hypothermia helmet to achieve a target temperature of 32 degrees C-34 degrees C, maintained for 36-72 h, followed by controlled rewarming and normothermia for 72 h. Neurological recovery was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale, where CPC 1-2 denotes good recovery and CPC 3-5 indicates poor outcomes. Body temperature, hemodynamic parameters, biochemical changes, and survival data were meticulously recorded and analyzed. Statistical analysis included paired t-tests to compare pre- and post-treatment data.Results Of 116 cardiac arrest cases, 30 (25.86%) were in-hospital, and 16 (53.33%) of these achieved ROSC. Among the patients, 62.5% underwent emergency coronary angiography due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The mean time to hypothermia initiation was 32.9 +/- 13.5 min, with hypothermia maintained for 58 +/- 6.4 h. Neurological outcomes were favorable, with 62.5% of patients achieving CPC scores of 1 or 2, indicating functional recovery and independence. In contrast, CPC scores of 3 or higher were observed in 37.5% of patients, reflecting varying degrees of disability. Biochemical analysis revealed significant decreases in sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels, alongside increased urea and creatinine concentrations. Hemodynamic improvements included elevated systolic blood pressure and heart rate, while left ventricular ejection fraction remained stable. Overall survival was 75%, and the majority (62.5%) of survivors were discharged without significant neurological deficits.Conclusion The findings suggest that early and targeted application of craniocerebral thermal hypothermia has the potential to improve survival and preserve neurological function in post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The high rates of favorable outcomes, as reflected by CPC scores, underscore the neuroprotective effects of localized hypothermia. Further large-scale, multicenter trials are recommended to validate these promising results and refine protocols for optimal clinical application.",FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE,2025,"Nadir, A; Kara, D; Turkoz, A",10.3389/fcvm.2024.1502173,,WOS:001402597800001,A

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the Korean National Fire Agency ALS protocol on prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with OHCA. Methods This study included patients with adult-presumed cardiac arrest between January and December 2020. The main factor of interest was ambulance type according to ALS protocol, which was divided into dedicated ALS ambulance (DA), smartphone-based ALS ambulance (SALS), and non-DA, and the main analysis factor was prehospital ROSC. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results During the study period, a total of 18,031 adult patients with OHCA was treated by the emergency medical services, including 7,520 DAs (41.71%), 2,622 SALSs (14.54%), and 7,889 non-DAs (43.75%). The prehospital ROSC rate of the DA group (13.19%) was higher than those of the non-DA group (7.91%) and the SALS group (11.17%, P<0.01).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Continuous deep sedation versus minimal sedation after cardiac arrest and resuscitation (SED-CARE): A protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Background: Sedation is often provided to resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients to tolerate post-cardiac arrest care, including temperature management. However, the evidence of benefit or harm from routinely administered deep sedation after cardiac arrest is limited. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of continuous deep sedation compared to minimal sedation on patient-important outcomes in resuscitated OHCA patients in a large clinical trial. Methods: The SED-CARE trial is part of the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation (STEPCARE) trial, a randomized international, multicentre, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, superiority trial with three simultaneous intervention arms. In the SED-CARE trial, adults with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) who are comatose following resuscitation from OHCA will be randomized within 4 hours to continuous deep sedation (Richmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS) -4/-5) (intervention) or minimal sedation (RASS 0 to -2) (comparator), for 36 h after ROSC. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at 6 months after randomization. The two other components of the STEPCARE trial evaluate sedation and temperature control strategies. Apart from the STEPCARE trial interventions, all other aspects of general intensive care will be according to the local practices of the participating site. Neurological prognostication will be performed according to European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines by a physician blinded to the allocation group. To detect an absolute risk reduction of 5.6% with an alpha of 0.05, 90% power, 3500 participants will be enrolled. The secondary outcomes will be the proportion of participants with poor functional outcomes 6 months after randomization, serious adverse events in the intensive care unit, and patient-reported overall health status 6 months after randomization.

Guidelines recommend early screening to identify patients at risk for cognitive impairment, but there is no consensus on the best screening method. We aimed to identify quantitative EEG measures relating with short- and long-term cognitive function after cardiac arrest for potential to cognitive outcome prediction. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study designed to develop a prediction model for cognitive outcome after cardiac arrest. For the current analysis, we used twenty-minute EEG registrations from 80 patients around one week after cardiac arrest. We calculated power spectral density, normalized alpha-to-theta ratio (nATR), peak frequency, and center of gravity (CoG) of this peak frequency. We related these with global cognitive functioning (scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) at one week, three and twelve months follow-up with multivariate mixed effect models, and with performance on standard neuropsychological examination at twelve months using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: Each individual EEG parameter related to MoCA at one week (beta(nATR) = 7.36; P < 0.01; beta(peak) frequency = 1.73, P < 0.01; beta(CoG) = -9.88, P < 0.01). The nATR also related with the MoCA at three months ((beta(nATR) = 2.49; P 0.01). No EEG metrics significantly related to the MoCA score at twelve months. nATR and peak frequency related with memory performance at twelve months. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2016 and December 2022 at two French PICUs and included patients under 18 years old hospitalized with ROSC after OHCA. ResultsDuring the study period, 53 patients were included, 27 (51%) were males the median age was 4 years old. Drowning (n = 15, 28%) and other causes of respiratory failure (n = 9, 17%) were the most common causes of cardiac arrest. The TDS rate was 38% (n = 20), and 15 patients (75%) of the survivals were considered to have good cognitive function discharged from the PICU. Neurological dysfunction was the most common cause of death including brain death in 19 patients (35%) and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy due to poor neurological prognosis. Witnessed cardiac arrest and length of low flow < 20 min increased the chances of survival by 4.2-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively. Asystole as the initial rhythm, epinephrine use, severe acidosis, bilateral areflexic mydriasis on admission, liver, and renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were associated with a lower TDS rate, whereas shockable rhythms were associated with a higher TDS rate. Conclusion: In our study, TDS rate of children hospitalized in the PICU after OHCA with ROSC was 38%. Among most of the survivors the neurological prognosis was good. Further, the data implies that primary prevention and optimal early response remain the key strategies to improve survival after OHCA. In addition, neurological dysfunction was the most common cause of death after ROSC, highlighting the opportunity to increase organ donation for transplantation.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Intermediate-term outcomes after paediatric cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation - what is known (and unknown),"The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in infants and children with cardiac disease who develop refractory cardiogenic shock, cyanosis, or cardiac arrest is increasing. Early mortality in children with cardiac disease who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains an important issue, as only 40% of cannulated patients survive to discharge from the hospital. However, it is encouraging that 90% children who are discharged alive from the hospital after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are still alive at intermediate-term follow-up. Surviving patients are at risk for long-term dysfunction of multiple organ systems related to their underlying cardiac disease, non-cardiac comorbidities, treatment-related complications, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Among the most important acute complications related to support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is injury to the central nervous system, which may contribute to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. All of these factors, in turn, influence quality of life. Many survivors remain medically complex related to their underlying cardiac disease, comorbidities, and sequelae of complications acquired over their lifetime. Neurological morbidity clearly plays an important role in approximately one-third of survivors, with significant deficits in approximately 10%. The limited data about quality of life data that are available for survivors of cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation suggests that approximately 15-30% of survivors have at least moderately decreased quality of life. Overall, published data support the ongoing use of support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children with acute cardiac failure, most of whom would die without it. However, programmatic efforts to improve the selection of patients and the preservation of the function of end organs during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are clearly needed in order to improve long-term outcomes.",CARDIOLOGY IN THE YOUNG,2011,"Costello, JM; Cooper, DS; Jacobs, JP; Chai, PJ; Kirsch, R; Rosenthal, T; Dalton, HJ; Graziano, JN; Quintessenza, JA",10.1017/S1047951111001697,,WOS:000299264900016,A

Critical determinants of survival and long-term functional status after cardiac arrest are timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of an external defibrillator for patients with a shockable rhythm. Outcomes are still far from satisfactory, despite ongoing efforts to improve cardiac arrest response systems, as well as elaborate postresuscitation algorithms. Targeted temperature management at the wide range between 32 degrees C and 36 degrees C has been one of the main therapeutic strategies to improve neurological outcome in postresuscitation care. This recommendation has been mainly based on 2 small randomized trials that were published 20 years ago. Most recent data derived from the TTM2 (Targeted Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial, which included 1861 patients, challenge this strategy. It showed no benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33 degrees C over normothermia at 36 degrees C to 37.5 degrees C with fever prevention. Because temperature management at lower temperatures also correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any benefit in the TTM2 trial, a modification of the guidelines with harmonizing temperature management to normothermia might be necessary.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION,2022,"Lüsebrink, E; Binzenhöfer, L; Kellnar, A; Scherer, C; Schier, J; Kleeberger, J; Stocker, TJ; Peterss, S; Hagl, C; Stark, K; Petzold, T; Fichtner, S; Braun, D; Kääb, S; Brunner, S; Theiss, H; Hausleiter, J; Massberg, S; Orban, M",10.1161/JAHA.122.026539,,WOS:000877032700024,A

Research Question: The primary objective was to assess the association between DAOH and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months, as well as to assess the construct validity of DAOH as an outcome measure. Study Design and Methods: Using data from the Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients With Septic Shock, Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation, and Crystalloid vs Hydroxyethyl Starch trials, we calculated the number of DOAH at day 90 (DAOH-90). HRQoL was estimated with the EQ-5D utility index score (range, -0.59 to 1) and the EQ-5D visual analog scale (range, 0-100) at 6 months. The association between DAOH and HRQoL was assessed using linear models, nonlinear models, and nonparametric measures of association. Results: Six thousand two hundred thirteen trial participants included. The median index hospital length of stay was 16 days (interquartile range [IQR], 8-30), and mortality for the index hospitalization was 1,402 of 6,213 (22.6%). The median number of DAOH-90 was 60 days (IQR, 0-77 days). Each additional DAOH-90 was associated with an estimated increase in the 6-month EQ-5D utility index (range, 0-1) of 0.01 (95% CI, 0.01-0.011; P < .001). Adjusted analysis showed that each additional DAOH-90 was associated with an increase of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.04; P < .001) in the EQ-5D visual analog scale (range, 0-100).

The aim of this study is to investigate the combined association of those stepwise interventions with OHCA management in Shenzhen, as a representative city in China. Methods: This registry-based retrospective study included emergency medical services (EMS)-treated adult OHCA patients with presumed cardiac etiology in Shenzhen, China, covering the period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2022. During this period, three key interventions were implemented sequentially: a public access defibrillation (PAD) program on October 1, 2017, a civilian cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training program on July 1, 2020, and telecommunicator cardiopulmonary resuscitation (T-CPR) on November 23, 2021. The outcomes of bystander CPR and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were compared with pre-intervention controls. Results: A total of 6,571 EMS-treated presumed cardiac etiology adult OHCA patients were included, among which were 623 cases with bystander-witnessed OHCA and a shockable rhythm. Across four periods, the rates of both bystander CPR (8.55 vs. 12.60 vs. 18.31 vs. 23.10%) and ROSC (6.01 vs. 5.29 vs. 9.59 vs. 8.33%) showed an increasing trend. For the rate of bystander CPR, the likelihood was significantly increased after implementation of the PAD program (OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.21-2.23]) and civilian CPR training program (OR 2.12 [95% CI: 1.52-2.95]), and after the addition of the T-CPR application (OR 3.06 [95% CI: 2.14-4.39]), compared with the pre-period. Similarly, cumulative interventions were associated with a higher ROSC (OR 0.84 [95% CI: 0.62-1.14], OR 1.52 [95% CI: 1.07-1.89], OR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.07-1.89]) when compared with the pre-period. In subgroup analysis, cumulative interventions significantly improved the rate of bystander CPR in cases where OHCA occurred in public locations, and ROSC in cases where the time from symptom onset to calling 120 was within 10 min. Conclusion: Stepwise interventions in pre-hospital emergency care increased likelihood of bystander CPR and ROSC following pre-hospital resuscitation significantly. This improvement is attributed to the coordination and cumulative effect of multiple positive interventions for OHCA management.",RESUSCITATION,2025,"Xu, HB; Zhu, H; He, Q; Zhang, L",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2025.110594,,WOS:001471967300001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Air Pollution and Cardiac Arrest: A More Significant Intermediate Role of COPD than Cardiac Events,"No prior studies have linked long-term air pollution exposure to incident sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or its possible development trajectories. We aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and SCA, as well as possible intermediate diseases. Based on the UK Biobank cohort, Cox proportional hazard model was applied to explore associations between air pollutants and SCA. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were selected as intermediate conditions, and multistate model was fitted for trajectory analysis. During a median follow-up of 13.7 years, 2884 participants developed SCA among 458 237 individuals. The hazard ratios (HRs) for SCA were 1.04-1.12 per interquartile range increment in concentrations of fine particulate matter, inhalable particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Most prominently, air pollutants could induce SCA through promoting transitions from baseline health to COPD (HRs: 1.06-1.24) and then to SCA (HRs: 1.16-1.27). Less importantly, SCA could be developed through transitions from baseline health to MACE (HRs: 1.02-1.07) and further to SCA (HRs: 1.12-1.16). This study provides novel and compelling evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution could promote the development of SCA, with COPD serving as a more important intermediate condition than MACE.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,2024,"Luo, HH; Zhang, QL; Meng, X; Kan, HD; Chen, RJ",10.1021/acs.est.4c00083,,WOS:001227922200001,A

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that included patients who suffered OHCA in Pirkanmaa Finland in 2022. Two researchers listened to all calls separately determining key-time events of the call. All patients with confirmed recognisable OHCA during the call who had background data and audio recordings available were included. Results: We received 451 recordings, 246 of which met the inclusion criteria, and 217 (88 %) were recognised as OHCA. The beginning of tele-CPR guidance (1 min 20 sec vs 1 min 55 sec, p = 0.002) and initiation of bystander CPR (2 min 48 sec vs 3 min 50 sec, p = 0.012) were faster in cases with shockable rhythm on EMS arrival. Every minute of delay in the dispatcher initiating tele-CPR guidance decreased the probability of shockable initial rhythm by 23 % (OR 0.76 [0.61;0.95], p = 0.018). Shockable initial rhythm was more common among patients who were alive at three months after OHCA (83 % vs 21 %, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, shockable initial rhythm favoured 3-month survival (OR 16.67 [5.41;52.63], p < 0.001). Overall survival at three months was 12 % (29/246), of which 90 % (26/29) had a Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2. Conclusion: Quick tele-CPR guidance may be related to/ associated with improving the chances for shockable initial rhythm, thus further improving the chances for long-term survival.",RESUSCITATION,2025,"Järvenpää, V; Korpela, SP; Mäki, P; Huhtala, H; Setälä, P; Hoppu, S",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2025.110755,,WOS:001560972200004,A

At referral seven patients had abnormal physical findings, nine had abnormal electrocardiograms with non-specific right-sided abnormalities, and seven patients had increased heart size or prominent right ventricles on chest x ray. During long term follow up (mean 8.8 years, range 1.5 to 28 years) 11 patients had abnormal physical findings, 11 had electrocardiographic changes, and nine had increased heart size. Recurrent sustained right ventricular tachycardia was the most common arrhythmia (10 patients). Two patients experienced ventricular fibrillation. Seven patients suffered from over 10 episodes of ventricular tachycardia, nine required cardioversions, and 10 patients had associated serious symptoms such as syncope, severe hypotension, or cardiac arrest. Four patients required operation to correct the arrhythmia and three patients developed right heart failure. Two out of three deaths were sudden. These data suggest that in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia right ventricular abnormalities may be progressive and that the condition may affect the left ventricle. The course of the ventricular arrhythmias was highly variable and could not be predicted in individual patients.

Among these, acute lung injury (ALI) is frequent and yields significant challenges to post-cardiac arrest recovery. Understanding the relationship between CPR and ALI is determinant for refining resuscitation techniques and improving patient outcomes. This review aims to analyze the existing literature on ALI following CPR, emphasizing prevalence, clinical implications, and contributing factors. The review seeks to elucidate the pathogenesis of ALI in the context of CPR, assess the efficacy of CPR techniques and ventilation strategies, and explore their impact on post-cardiac arrest outcomes. CPR-related injuries, ranging from skeletal fractures to severe internal organ damage, underscore the complexity of managing post-cardiac arrest patients. Chest compression, particularly when prolonged and vigorous, i.e., mechanical compression, appears to be a crucial factor contributing to ALI, with the concept of cardiopulmonary resuscitation-associated lung edema (CRALE) gaining prominence.

This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical effectiveness of initial vascular access attempts through the intraosseous route to the intravenous route in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science, up to March 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score-matched (PSM) observational studies comparing initial attempt intraosseous access with initial intravenous access in patients with OHCA. R Studio version 4.4.2 was used to perform statistical analysis applying a random-effect model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to determine the robustness of findings and estimate required information size (RIS). Four RCTs and four PSM studies involving 28 632 patients with OHCA were identified. The analysis revealed no significant differences between initial vascular access attempts via the intraosseous route compared with the intravenous route regarding survival to hospital discharge [odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-1.13, P = 0.49], sustained return of spontaneous circulation (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74-1.02, P = 0.09) or survival with favorable neurological outcomes (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54-1.03, P = 0.08). Meta-regression identified initial shockable rhythm as a significant modifier of survival to hospital discharge (P = 0.012). TSA demonstrated the Z curve failed to reach the RIS, indicating that further studies are needed for conclusive evidence.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Influences on the duration and success of out-of-hospital resuscitation of geriatric patients over 80 years of age - a retrospective evaluation,"Background Society is experiencing an increasing shift in the age distribution and accordingly, increased resuscitation rates of patients over 80 years and older. In 2022, more than 34% of people resuscitated in Germany were older than 80 years, although older age is considered a poor predictor for the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Professional societies provide ethical recommendations on when resuscitation may be considered futile and should be terminated. However, the extent to which these recommendations are implemented is unclear. Methods Retrospective evaluation of pre-hospital documentation of out-of-hospital resuscitations in patients >= 80 years of age in the period 01/01/2014-12/31/2022 in one German county combined with data of the German Resuscitation Registry. For statistical testing, the significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results In total 578 cases were analyzed. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC): 26% (n = 148). Survival to discharge: 6.1% (n = 35). Median CPR duration: 17 min (10-28 min). The older the patients were, the worse the survival rate (p = 0.05) and the shorter the time to termination (p < 0.0001). No patient over 90 years of age was discharged alive. Resuscitation was also significantly shorter until termination with poorer ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score (p < 0.001). Residents resuscitated significantly longer than specialists (p = 0.02). In surviving patients, there was a significant correlation between short CPR duration and good cerebral performance category (CPC) value: Median CPC1/2 = 5 min [3-10 min] vs. CPC 3/4 = 18 min [10-21 min]; p = 0.01. Interpretation Old age and poor health status is associated with shorter CPR duration until termination and older age is associated with poorer prognosis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) concerning the possibility of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival. A short resuscitation time is associated with a better CPC value. Therefore, when resuscitating patients over 80 years of age, even greater care should be taken to ensure that reversible causes are quickly corrected in order to achieve a ROSC and a good neurological outcome. Alternatively, resuscitation should be terminated promptly, as good survival can no longer be guaranteed. Resuscitation lasting more than 20 min should be avoided in any case, in line with the termination of resuscitation (ToR) criteria.",BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2024,"Heuser, N; Rupp, D; Glass, S; Sassen, MC; Morin, A; Volberg, C",10.1186/s12873-024-01099-3,,WOS:001336894000003,A

The role of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac arrest remains unclear. Aims: We aimed to describe, with an emphasis on clinical applications, what is known about the role of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac arrest. Data Sources: A PubMed literature review was performed for relevant articles. Only articles in English that studied cytokines in patients with cardiac arrest were included. Results: Cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PCAS. Following cardiac arrest, the large release of circulating cytokines mediates the ischemia/reperfusion injury, brain dysfunction, and myocardial dysfunction seen. Interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and matrix metalloproteinases all play a unique prognostic role in PCAS. High levels of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with mortality and/or poor neurologic outcomes. Interventions to modify the systemic inflammation seen in PCAS continue to be heavily studied. Currently, the only approved medical intervention for comatose patients following cardiac arrest is targeted temperature management. Medical agents, including minocycline and sodium sulfide, have demonstrated promise in animal models.

In megacities, the use of organs obtained from those who died as a result of sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) for transplantation is one of the promising ways of addressing the problem of organ donor shortage. In St. Petersburg, the model of transition from life support via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) of patients after OHCA to ECMO life support for organs of potential donors was tested for the first time. Materials and methods. In order to implement the program, round-the-clock ECMO and transplantation teams were organized at the inpatient emergency ward of Pavlov First St. Petersburg State Medical University. Interaction with the St. Petersburg City Emergency Station, St. Petersburg was established. The protocol of work with potential donors brought to the hospital after a sudden circulatory arrest was developed, approved by the ethics committee, and implemented in clinical practice. This was the first in Russia and in international practice. Between 2017 and 2020, 67 patients with sudden OHCA were brought to the inpatient emergency ward. In 4 (5.97%) cases, advanced cardiovascular life support was successful, and 11 (16.42%) patients became effective donors. Mortality among this group of patients without subsequent postmortem donation was 77.61% (52 patients). Results. Liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) whose blood circulation was restored by ECMO (ECMO NHBD) was performed in 5 recipients who were in severe condition against the background of liver failure. In 1 (20%) case, there was severe liver allograft dysfunction for 33 days with subsequent complete restoration of function. Kidney transplantation was performed in 22 patients. Immediate graft function occurred in 10 (45.45%), while delayed function occurred in 12 (54.55%) patients. Kidney graft survival was 86.4%, kidney graft recipient survival was 95.5%, liver graft recipient survival was 80%, and the follow-up period was 24.1 +/- 7.15 months. Conclusion. The use of ECMO to save the lives of patients with sudden OHCA can be implemented in conditions of a high degree of organization and synchronization of the work of the city emergency medical station and the emergency department of a multidisciplinary hospital. If cardiopulmonary resuscitation with ECMO (ECMO CPR) fails, it is possible to launch the ECMO NHBD donor program. Long-term outcomes of liver and kidney transplantation from ECMO NHBD are consistent with those using organs from brain-dead donors.

Although resuscitation advancements have increased survival, many survivors suffer cognitive impairments that affect their quality of life. Most research has focused on neurological outcomes, whereas little attention has been paid to cognitive function. The aim is to investigate the proportion of cognitive impairment in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest and to investigate the association between the duration of cardiac arrest and level of cognitive function.Methods In this prospective cohort study, 184 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening tool. Duration of cardiac arrest was defined by no flow, low flow, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. Multiple logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) and CI.Results Of 184 survivors assessed, 26% had normal cognitive function at discharge, increasing to 67% at 6 months (n=149). Median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score improved from 23 (Q25-Q75: 20-26) to 26 (Q25-Q75: 24-28). At 6 months, adjusted ORs per minute were 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for low flow and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for time to return of spontaneous circulation, whereas associations at discharge were near null (aOR approximate to 0.99). No significant association was found either at discharge or follow-up.Conclusions Cognitive function improved considerably within 6 months following cardiac arrest, with the proportion of patients exhibiting normal cognitive function increasing from 26% to 67%.

To date, valid protein markers do not exist to prognosticate survivors and non-survivors before the end of TTM. The aim of this study is to identify specific protein patterns/arrays, which are useful for prediction in the very early phase after ROSC. Material and Methods: A total of 20 adult patients with ROSC (19 male, 1 female; 69.9 +/- 9.5 years) were included and dichotomized in two groups (survivors and non-survivors at day 30). Serum samples were drawn at day 1 after ROSC (during TTM). Three panels (organ failure, metabolic, neurology, inflammation; OLINK, Uppsala, Sweden) were utilised. A total of four proteins were found to be differentially regulated (>2- or t-test). Bioinformatic platforms were utilised to analyse pathways and identify signalling cascades and to screen for potential biomarkers. Results: A total of 276 proteins were analysed and revealed only 11 statistically significant protein alterations (Siglec-9, LAYN, SKR3, JAM-B, N2DL-2, TNF-B, BAMBI, NUCB2, STX8, PTK7, and PVLAB). Following the Bonferroni correction, no proteins were found to be regulated as statistically significant. Concerning the protein fold change for clinical significance, four proteins (IL-1 alpha, N-CDase, IL5, CRH) were found to be regulated in a clinically relevant context. Conclusions: Early analysis at 1 day after ROSC was not sufficiently possible during TTM to prognosticate survival or non-survival after OHCA. Future studies should evaluate protein expression later in the course after ROSC to identify promising protein candidates.",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,2022,"Hinkelbein, J; Johnson, LKV; Kiselev, N; Schmitz, J; Hellmich, M; Drinhaus, H; Lichtenstein, T; Storm, C; Adler, C",10.3390/jcm11040996,,WOS:000763020900001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,"Post-cardiac arrest syndrome: definition, pathophysiology, and management","The post-cardiac arrest syndrome is a delicate, critical and complex condition that involves most patients resuscitated by a cardiac arrest. The main pathophysiological mechanism of this syndrome is a widespread ischemia-reperfusion damage, then there are other pathological alterations involving various organs which, if untreated, can evolve into multiorgan dysfunction. For this reason, a series of diagnostic-therapeutic actions (bundles) are necessary to ensure a correct management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome: adequate oxygenation and ventilation, hemodynamic stabilization, temperature control, early prediction of neurological outcome, optimization of metabolic aspects, indication and timing of coronary angiography. The management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the fifth link in the chain of survival, consists of a set of early, complex and multidisciplinary interventions, which must be promptly started, immediately after a return of spontaneous circulation, regardless of the location of cardiac arrest presentation, and it aims to obtain a good hemodynamic and neurological recovery.

Using data from the German Resuscitation Registry, we investigated the outcome of non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with VL versus direct laryngoscopy (DL) for airway management.Methods: We analysed retrospective data of 14,387 patients from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2021 (VL group, n = 2201; DL group, n = 12186). Primary endpoint was discharge with cerebral performance categories one and two (CPC1/2).

Identifying hospital-level factors that contribute to variations in care can provide opportunities to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate variation in post-cardiac arrest care within a large EMS system and explore the contribution of hospital-level factors. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis from a regional cardiac system serving over 10 million persons. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are transported to 36 cardiac arrest centers with 24/7 emergent coronary angiography (CAG) capabilities and targeted temperature management (TTM) policies based on regional guidelines. We included adult patients >= 18 years with non-traumatic OHCA from 2016-2018. Patients with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order and those who died in the emergency department (ED) were excluded. For the TTM analysis, we also excluded patients who were alert in the ED. The primary outcome was receiving CAG or TTM after cardiac arrest. The secondary outcome was neurologic recovery (dichotomized to define a ""good"" outcome as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2). We used generalized estimating equations including patient-level factors (age, sex, witnessed arrest, initial rhythm) and hospital-level factors (academic status, hospital size based on licensed beds, annual OHCA patient volume) to estimate the odds ratios associated with these variables. Results: There were 7831 patients with OHCA during the study period; 4694 were analyzed for CAG and 3903 for TTM. The median and range for treatment with CAG and TTM after OHCA was 23% (12-49%) and 58% (17-92%) respectively. Hospital size was associated with increased likelihood of CAG, adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.05-2.86, p = 0.03. Academic status approached significance in its association with TTM, adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 0.98-2.91, p = 0.06. Overall, 28% of patients survived with good neurologic outcome, ranging from 17 to 43% across hospitals.

Audiovisual feedback from an AED may assist bystanders achieve higher quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, the association between audiovisual feedback and clinical outcomes is not well assessed in real-life OHCA. The aim of this study was to assess the association between audiovisual feedback from an AED used in bystander resuscitation with rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day survival in a real-life cohort of patients with OHCA. Methods and Results We included 325 patients treated with bystander AED use before arrival of emergency medical services during 2016 to 2019 from the Capital Region of Denmark. Patients were divided into a ""feedback"" and a ""nonfeedback"" group, depending on presence of audiovisual feedback from the AED. Audiovisual feedback was defined as voice prompts with continuous feedback to ongoing resuscitation. Rates of ROSC upon hospital admission and 30-day survival were assessed, and univariate and multivariable models were applied to decide the association to audiovisual feedback. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, primary heart rhythm, and location of OHCA. A total of 155 (48%) patients had a bystander AED applied with audiovisual feedback and 170 (52%) without audiovisual feedback. A lower rate of ROSC was found in the feedback group compared with the nonfeedback group (33% [n=51] versus 45% [n=76]; P=0.03). No association was observed between AV feedback and 30-day survival (feedback=27% [n=42] and nonfeedback=31% [n=53]; P=0.49). In the unadjusted logistic regression model, audiovisual feedback was associated with a decreased chance of ROSC (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95; P=0.03), which remained significant after adjusted analysis (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.97; P=0.04), whereas we found no significant association between audiovisual feedback and 30-day survival in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Conclusions Audiovisual feedback from an AED used by bystanders was associated with a lower chance of ROSC at hospital admission, but we found no significant difference in 30-day survival.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Outcomes Following Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Children With Cardiac Disease,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a commonly used form of mechanical circulatory support in children with congenital or acquired heart disease and cardiac failure refractory to conventional medical therapies. In children with heart disease who suffer cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been successfully used to provide cardiopulmonary support when conventional resuscitation has failed to establish return of spontaneous circulation. Survival to hospital discharge for children with heart disease support is approximately 40% but varies widely based on age, indication for support, and underlying cardiac disease. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is lifesaving in many instances, it is associated with many complications and is expensive. Thus, a clear understanding of survival to discharge and long-term functional and neurologic outcomes are essential to guide the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation now and in the future.

Data Sources: The search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine, clinical trial registries, and bibliographies. Study Selection: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers. Data Extraction: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the current standard dose of epinephrine to placebo, high or low dose epinephrine, any other vasopressor alone or in combination were screened by three independent reviewers. Data Synthesis: A total of 17 trials (21,510 patients) were included; seven were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, pooled results from two trials showed that standard dose of epinephrine increased return of spontaneous circulation (risk ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.82-3.89), survival to hospital admission (risk ratio, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.68-3.72), and survival to discharge (risk ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.86).

There were no differences in outcomes between standard dose of epinephrine and vasopressin alone or in combination with epinephrine. Conclusions: Largely based on one randomized controlled trial, standard dose of epinephrine improved overall survival but not neurologic outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients compared with placebo.

Limited data from Western China prompted this study to investigate the characteristics of IHCA using the Utstein style. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 456 pediatric patients with IHCA (2018-2022) at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University assessed demographics, arrest characteristics, outcomes and mortality risk factors. The primary outcome was survival to discharge; the secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) > 20 min, 24 h survival, and favorable neurological outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify the mortality risk factors. Results: ROSC > 20 min was achieved in 78.07% of cases, with 37.94% surviving to discharge (86.13% of survivors had favorable neurological outcomes). Etiological stratification identified general medical conditions (52.63%) as the predominant diagnoses, with surgical cardiac patients demonstrating superior resuscitation outcomes (ROSC > 20 min: 86.84%, discharge survival: 64.04%). Initial arrest rhythms predominantly featured non-shockable patterns, specifically bradycardia with poor perfusion (79.39%), whereas shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia) constituted only 4.17% of cases. Multivariable regression analysis identified five independent risk factors: vasoactive infusion before arrest (OR = 7.69), CPR > 35 min (OR = 13.92), emergency intubation (OR = 5.17), administration of >2 epinephrine doses (OR = 3.12), and rearrest (OR = 8.48). Notably, prolonged CPR (>35 min) correlated with higher mortality (8.96% survival vs. 48.54% for 1-15 min), yet all six survivors with CPR > 35 min had favorable neurological outcomes.

Additionally, economic aspects of such events are poorly studied. The purpose of this study is to provide data for survival, quality of life and costs directly related to the cardiac arrest for a region of Switzerland served by one emergency medical service (EMS).MethodsEighty eight patients older than 18years of age that were resuscitated by the EMS Winterthur in the year 2013 were included and retrospective analysis of EMS-protocols was performed. For patients alive at follow-up, 2years after the event, a structured interview with quality of life questionnaires was conducted. This study was accepted by the local Ethics Committee.ResultsThirty five percent (n=31) of resuscitated patients were admitted alive to the hospital following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This incidence was as high as 60%, if the patients had a shockable rhythm as first rhythm. Survival to follow-up was 16% (n=14). These patients had an excellent quality of life overall, with little to no limitations in daily life. There was no significant difference in survival for patients in outlying regions with comparatively longer timespans until arrival of EMS. Median EMS-costs for deceased patients were CHF 1731 (inter-quartile range 346), for survivors CHF 2169 (inter-quartile range CHF 444) and median hospital-costs were CHF 27707 (inter-quartile range CHF 62 ' 783).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Experimental paper Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 exerts neuroprotection effects after cardiac arrest in mice: A randomized controlled study,"Background : Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is the leading cause of death in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA). Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM-3) is a water -soluble exogenous carbon monoxide that has been shown to have neuroprotection benefits in several neurological disease models. However, the effects of CORM-3 on PCABI is still unclear. Methods : A mice model combined asystole with hemorrhage was used. Mice were anesthetized and randomized into 4 groups (n = 12/group) and underwent either 9.5 min CA followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or sham surgery. CORM-3 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (normal saline) were administered at 1 h after return of spontaneous circulation or sham surgery. Survival, neurologic deficits, alterations in the permeability of the brainblood barrier and cerebral blood flow, changes of oxidative stress level, level of neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration, and the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway were measured. Results : In CORM-3 treated mice that underwent CA/CPR, significantly improved survival (75.00% vs. 58.33%, P = 0.0146 (24 h) and 66.67% vs. 16.67%, P < 0.0001 (72 h)) and neurological function were observed at 24 h and 72 h after ROSC ( P < 0.05 for each). Additionally, increased cerebral blood flow, expression of tight junctions, and reduced reactive oxygen species generation at 24 h after ROSC were observed ( P < 0.05 for each). CORM-3 treated mice had less neuron death and alleviated neuroinflammation at 72 h after ROSC ( P < 0.05 for each). Notably, the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was significantly activated in mice subjected to CA/CPR with CORM-3 treatment. Conclusions : CORM-3 could improve survival and exert neuroprotection after CA/CPR in mice.

This review synthesizes current knowledge on MTx, focusing on its role in modulating immune responses and explores its potential in treating post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS).MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive narrative review of animal and human studies that have investigated the effects of MTx in the context of immunomodulation. This included a review of the immune responses following critical condition such as ischemia reperfusion injury, the impact of MTx on these responses, and the therapeutic potential of MTx in various conditions.ResultsRecent studies indicate that MTx can modulate complex immune responses and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury post-CA, suggesting MTx as a novel, potentially more effective approach. The review highlights the role of MTx in immune modulation, its potential synergistic effects with existing treatments such as therapeutic hypothermia, and the need for further research to optimize its application in PCAS. The safety and efficacy of autologous versus allogeneic MTx, particularly in the context of immune reactions, are critical areas for future investigation.ConclusionMTx represents a promising frontier in the treatment of PCAS, offering a novel approach to modulate immune responses and restore cellular energetics.

The population included adults and children in any setting with cardiac arrest. The outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation, sur-vival, survival with favourable neurologic outcome to hospital discharge and 30 days or longer, and quality of life outcome. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and ROBINS-I were performed to assess risk of bias for controlled and observational studies, respectively.Results: The systematic review identified 4 studies on 3 randomised controlled trials on 554 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, 8 observational studies on 2,731 adult cardiac arrest patients, and 3 observational studies on 17,449 paediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) patients. The randomised controlled and observational studies showed that routine calcium administration during cardiac arrest did not improve the outcome of adult OHCA or IHCA or paediatric IHCA. The risk of bias for the adult trials was low for one recent trial and high for two earlier trials, with randomization as the primary source of bias. The risk of bias for the individual observational studies was assessed to be critical due to con-founding.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,"Effect of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta in nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial","BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue worldwide and is associated with low survival rates and poor neurological outcomes. The generation of optimal coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) via high-quality chest compressions is a key factor in enhancing survival rates. However, it is often challenging to provide adequate CPP in real-world cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) scenarios. Based on animal studies and human trials on improving CPP in patients with nontraumatic OHCA, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is a promising technique in these cases. This study aims to investigate the benefits of REBOA adjunct to CPR compared with conventional CPR for the clinical management of nontraumatic OHCA.MethodsThis is a parallel-group, randomized, controlled, multinational trial that will be conducted at two urban academic tertiary hospitals in Korea and Taiwan. Patients aged 20-80 years presenting with witnessed OHCA will be enrolled in this study. Eligible participants must fulfill the inclusion criteria, and written informed consent should be collected from their legal representatives. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention (REBOA-CPR) or control (conventional CPR) group. The intervention group will receive REBOA and standard advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS). Meanwhile, the control group will receive ACLS based on the 2020 American Heart Association guidelines. The primary outcome is the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The secondary outcomes include sustained ROSC, survival to admission, survival to discharge, neurological outcome, and hemodynamic changes.DiscussionOur upcoming trial can provide essential evidence regarding the efficacy of REBOA, a mechanical method for enhancing CPP, in OHCA resuscitation. Our study aims to determine whether REBOA can improve treatment strategies for patients with nontraumatic OHCA based on clinical outcomes, thereby potentially providing valuable insights and guiding further advancements in this critical public health area.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT06031623.

HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure.Results: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1 -q3) = 70 (50-80). Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 4-8% of the total vari-ance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Since IHCA survivors with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous stroke.",RESUSCITATION,2023,"Israelsson, J; Koistinen, L; Arestedt, K; Rooth, M; Bremer, A",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109822,,WOS:001002238600001,A

While stroke and cardiac arrest are typically considered when discussing ischemic brain injuries, there is much evidence that smaller ischemic insults underlie neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The ""regenerative"" capacity of the brain relies on several aspects of plasticity that are crucial for normal functioning; less affected brain areas may take over function previously performed by irreversibly damaged tissue. To harness the endogenous plasticity mechanisms of the brain to provide recovery of cognitive function, we must first understand how these mechanisms are altered after damage, such as cerebral ischemia. In this review, we discuss the long-term cognitive changes that result after cerebral ischemia and how ischemia alters several plasticity processes. We conclude with a discussion of how current and prospective therapies may restore brain plasticity and allow for recovery of cognitive function, which may be applicable to several disorders that have a disruption of cognitive processing, including traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease.",JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE,2017,"Stradecki-Cohan, HM; Cohan, CH; Raval, AP; Dave, KR; Reginensi, D; Gittens, RA; Youbi, M; Perez-Pinzon, MA",10.3233/JAD-170057,,WOS:000411066100007,A

Evidence linking them to post-discharge outcomes is limited, but could support targeted rehabilitation efforts. Aim To assess whether ADL ability measures and cognitive screening at hospital discharge were associated with post-discharge ADL ability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and return to work. Methods This prospective cohort study included 200 OHCA survivors admitted to Aarhus University Hospital. Self-reported ADL ability was measured using the Activities of Daily Living Interview (ADL-I). Observed ADL ability was measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), dichotomised into age-matched or below-ability. Cognitive function was assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariable regressions, with multiple imputation, analysed associations between variables and outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Adjusted analyses showed significant associations between personal ADL-I ((3adjusted = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2;0.5) and AMPS ((3adjusted = 0.6, 95%CI:-1.2;-0.03) at discharge and self-reported ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Translating Guidelines into Practice: A Multicentre Audit of the Implementation of ERC Survivorship and Follow-Up Recommendations After Cardiac Arrest,"Background: Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest frequently experience long-lasting problems with fatigue, cognition and mood. European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines recommend functional assessment of physical/non-physical issues prior to discharge, and systematic review within three months covering at least cognition, mood, fatigue, and support for patients and their families. How these recommendations are implemented and what barriers are encountered in routine care remains unknown. Methods: We conducted a multicentric, prospective 6-month audit across four tertiary cardiac-arrest centres in England where temporarily funded follow-up pathways were in place. Five operational criteria were developed based on ERC guidelines. Adherence was quantified, and reasons for non-completion were collected and mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify behavioural and contextual factors influencing implementation. Results: A total of 143 OHCA survivors were discharged alive. Pre-discharge assessments were offered to 116/143 patients (81%) but only completed in 81 (57%). Reasons for non-completion included early discharge, severe cognitive impairment and, less frequently, patient refusal. Of 132 survivors eligible for follow-up, 108 (82%) were contacted and 87 (66%) attended. Only 25% of follow-ups occurred within the recommended 3-month period (median 185 days, IQR 81-225). Among those seen, assessments were completed for cognition (44%), mood (52%), and fatigue (51%). Reasons for omission included patient refusal, clinical discretion, and time constraints. Survivors' family members were invited in all cases, but only 45% attended. Conclusions: Adherence to guideline-recommended assessments was variable and dependent on local practices, resource limitations, and patient/clinician-related factors. Key barriers mapped to the TDF domains of 'Environmental context and resources', 'Beliefs about consequences' and 'Social influences'.

More than 10 tools were used to assess neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive outcomes, indicating a lack of standardization in assessment methodologies. The overall prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was 41% (95% CI 33%-49%): pain/discomfort (52%, 95% CI 42%-63%), sleep disturbance (37%, 95% CI 0%-98%), anxiety (36%, 95% CI 27%-46%), depression (31%, 95% CI 22%-40%), and PTSD (18%, 95% CI 9%-29%). The prevalence of neurocognitive impairment was 38% (95% CI 13%-65%). The prevalence of functional impairment was 52% (95% CI 40%-64%): daily activities (54%, 95% CI 41%-66%), mobility (41%, 95% CI 28%-54%), and self-care (21%, 95% CI 13%-31%). The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in VV-ECMO patients was higher than that in VA-ECMO patients (55% [95% CI 34%-75%] vs 32% [95% CI 23%-41%], p = 0.01), though the prevalence of neurocognitive and functional impairment was not different between the groups. The prevalence of favorable neurologic outcomes was not different at various follow-ups: 3 months (23%, 95% CI 12%-36%), 6 months (25%, 95% CI 16%-35%), and >= 1 year (28%, 95% CI 21%-36%, p = 0.68).DiscussionA substantial proportion of ECMO patients seemed to experience neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive and functional impairments at long-term follow-up. Considerable heterogeneity in methodology for gauging these outcomes exists, warranting the need for standardization.

Ghrelin showed efficacy in experimental models and was associated with lower neuron-specific enolase levels in the clinical Ghrelin in Coma (GRECO) trial. Here, we present cognitive and psychosocial outcomes at 1-year follow-up. Methods and results: GRECO was a Phase 2 multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. The intervention was intravenous acyl-ghrelin 600 mu g twice daily or placebo for 1 week, starting within 12 h after the arrest. Patients were assessed after 1 year using cognitive tests and questionnaires measuring participation, health-related quality of life, mood, and caregiver strain. Composite z-scores of the cognitive tests were computed by comparing the scores with those of a norm population and averaging the tests for memory, attention, and executive functioning separately. Groups were compared based on composite z-scores and cut-off scores for psychosocial outcomes. Of the 160 participants originally included, 66 of the 85 participants who survived to 1 year after OHCA completed the psychosocial and cognitive follow-up. The intervention group scored numerically higher across the cognitive domains compared with the control group, but the differences were not statistically significant (memory median = -0.850 vs. -1.385, U = 424.5, P = 0.587; attention median = -0.733 vs. -0.717, U = 420.5, P = 0.548; and executive functioning median = -0.311 vs. -0.482, U = 408.5, P = 0.323). There were significantly fewer signs of depression in the intervention group (U = 322.5, P = 0.014). Conclusion: This predefined secondary analysis found that ghrelin treatment was associated with non-significantly but consistently better cognitive outcomes and significantly fewer signs of depression.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury is characterized by 4 distinct but overlapping phases: ischemic depolarization, reperfusion repolarization, dysregulation, and recovery and repair. Previous research has been challenging because of the limitations of laboratory models; heterogeneity in the patient populations enrolled; overoptimistic estimation of treatment effects leading to suboptimal sample sizes; timing and route of intervention delivery; limited or absent evidence that the intervention has engaged the mechanistic target; and heterogeneity in postresuscitation care, prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Future trials must tailor their interventions to the subset of patients most likely to benefit and deliver this intervention at the appropriate time, through the appropriate route, and at the appropriate dose. The complexity of post-cardiac arrest brain injury suggests that monotherapies are unlikely to be as successful as multimodal neuroprotective therapies. Biomarkers should be developed to identify patients with the targeted mechanism of injury, to quantify its severity, and to measure the response to therapy. Studies need to be adequately powered to detect effect sizes that are realistic and meaningful to patients, their families, and clinicians.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Functional connectivity in resting-state networks relates to short-term global cognitive functioning in cardiac arrest survivors,"Long-term cognitive impairment is common in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening to identify patients at risk is recommended. Functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) holds potential to contribute to prediction of cognitive outcomes. In this study, we investigated the possible value of early changes in resting-state networks for predicting short and long-term cognitive functioning of cardiac arrest survivors. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in cardiac arrest survivors in three Dutch hospitals. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired within a month after cardiac arrest. We primarily focused on functional connectivity within the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), and additionally explored functional connectivity in seven other networks. Cognitive outcome was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during hospital admission and at 3 and 12 months, and by neuropsychological examination (NPE) at 12 months. We tested mixed effects models to evaluate the value of connectivity within the networks for predicting global cognitive outcomes at the three time points, and long-term cognitive outcomes in the memory, attention, and executive functioning domains. We included 80 patients (age 60 +/- 11 years, 72 (90%) male). MoCA scores increased significantly between hospital admission and 3 months (Delta MoCAhospital-3M = 2.89, p < 0.01), but not between 3 and 12 months (Delta MoCA3M-12M = 0.38, p = 0.52). Connectivity within the DMN, SN, and dorsal attention network (DAN) was positively related to global cognitive functioning during hospital admission (beta DMN = 0.85, p = 0.03; beta SN = 1.48, p < 0.01; beta DAN = 0.96, p = 0.01), but not at 3 and 12 months. Network connectivity was also unrelated to long-term memory, attention, or executive functioning. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN, SN, and DAN measured in the first month after cardiac arrest is related to short-term global, but not long-term global or domain-specific cognitive performance of survivors. These results do not support the value of functional connectivity within these RSNs for prediction of long-term cognitive performance after cardiac arrest.",HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,2024,"Verhulst, MMLH; Keijzer, HM; van Gils, PCW; van Heugten, CM; Meijer, FJA; Tonino, BAR; Bonnes, JL; Delnoij, TSR; Hofmeijer, J; Helmich, RC",10.1002/hbm.26769,,WOS:001369108400001,A

It has been proposed that interventions in the delivery room and/or hypothermia could trigger changes constitutive of chronic lung disease. New approaches in the first minutes of life using more gentle parameters of intervention are being studied. Thus, titrating inspiratory fraction of oxygen, the use of non-invasive ventilation to reduce trauma to the lung, the use of polyethylene/polyurethane wrapping to avoid hypothermia and delaying cord clamping altogether constitute promising initiatives. The first minutes of life are a valuable window for intervention. However, whilst these practice changes make sense and there are emerging data to support them, further evidence including long-term follow up is needed to definitively change resuscitation procedures in ELGANs.

Close monitoring, early identification and prompt intervention can mitigate early and late neurological morbidity. Neuromonitoring and neurocognitive/neurodevelopmental follow-up are critically important to optimize outcomes in both adults and children. Objective: To assess current practice of neuromonitoring during ECMO and neurocognitive/neurodevelopmental follow-up after ECMO across Europe and to inform the development of neuromonitoring and follow-up guidelines. Methods: The EuroELSO Neurological Monitoring and Outcome Working Group conducted an electronic, web-based, multi-institutional, multinational survey in Europe. Results: Of the 211 European ECMO centres (including non-ELSO centres) identified and approached in 23 countries, 133 (63%) responded. Of these, 43% reported routine neuromonitoring during ECMO for all patients, 35% indicated selective use, and 22% practiced bedside clinical examination alone. The reported neuromonitoring modalities were NIRS (n = 88, 66.2%), electroencephalography (n = 52, 39.1%), transcranial Doppler (n = 38, 28.5%) and brain injury biomarkers (n = 33, 24.8%). Paediatric centres (67%) reported using cranial ultrasound, though the frequency of monitoring varied widely. Before hospital discharge following ECMO, 50 (37.6%) reported routine neurological assessment and 22 (16.5%) routinely performed neuroimaging with more paediatric centres offering neurological assessment (65%) as compared to adult centres (20%). Only 15 (11.2%) had a structured longitudinal follow-up pathway (defined followup at regular intervals), while 99 (74.4%) had no follow-up programme. The majority (n = 96, 72.2%) agreed that there should be a longitudinal structured follow-up for ECMO survivors. Conclusions: This survey demonstrated significant variability in the use of different neuromonitoring modalities during and after ECMO. The perceived importance of neuromonitoring and follow-up was noted to be very high with agreement for a longitudinal structured follow-up programme, particularly in paediatric patients.

We reviewed our surgical experience with postinfarction LVFWR over 25 years to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality.METHODS Seventy-two consecutive patients with LVFWR who underwent surgical repair between 1994 and 2023 were retrospectively analysed. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality. The mean follow-up period was 3.9 +/- 5.4 years (maximum 25 years, 283 patient-years).RESULTS Thirty-five patients (49%) were directly transported to our centre, whereas 37 (51%) were initially taken to a local hospital. Prior to surgery, 30 (42%) developed out-of-hospital (n = 8, 11%) or in-hospital (n = 22, 31%) cardiac arrest. Upon entry to the operating room, 45 (63%) presented hypotensive shock, while 27 (38%) suffered cardiac arrest. LVFWR was oozing type in 42 patients (58%) and blow-out type in 30 patients (42%), for which sutureless repair (n = 27, 38%) or sutured repair (n = 45, 62%) was performed. The in-hospital mortality rate was 35%, in association with haemodynamic condition before surgery: 19% in patients without cardiac arrest, and 55% with in-hospital and 63% with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Patient age [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.2 per 10-year period, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-4.9, P = 0.044], out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.4-66, P = 0.020), in-hospital cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 6.6, 95% CI 1.6-33, P = 0.010) and initial ambulance transport to a local hospital (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.2-17, P = 0.020) were identified as independent risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The overall 5-year survival rate was 50%, while that for in-hospital survivors was 77%. When the present study period is split into 2 eras (1994-2010 and 2011-2023), the in-hospital mortality rate was comparable between them (41% vs 31%, P = 0.408). Notably, the in-hospital mortality of patients with a blow-out type left ventricular rupture was significantly lower in that latter study period (86% vs 39%, P = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS In surgically treated patients with LVFWR, the early mortality rate was high, while the long-term prognosis for in-hospital survivors was acceptable.

Whether EMS agencies can improve survival rates through efforts to focus on resuscitation on scene and optimize TOR rates is unknown. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine if an EMS agency's efforts to enhance on-scene resuscitation were associated with increased TOR and OHCA survival with favorable neurologic outcome. Methods: A single-city, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected 2017 quality assurance data was conducted. Patient demographics, process, and outcome measures were compared before and after an educational intervention to increase field TOR. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurologic status. Results: There were 320 cases that met inclusion criteria. No differences in age, gender, location, witnessed arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initial shockable rhythm, or presumed cardiac etiology were found. After the intervention, overall TOR rate increased from 39.6% to 51.1% (p = 0.06). Among subjects transported without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), average time on scene increased from 26.4 to 34.2 min (p = 0.02). Rates of sustained ROSC and survival to hospital admission were similar between periods. After intervention, there was a trend toward increased survival to hospital discharge rate (relative risk [RR] 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-5.91) and an increase in survival with favorable neurologic status rate (RR 5.96; 95% CI 0.80-44.47). Conclusion: This study described the association between an educational intervention focusing on optimization of resuscitation on scene and OHCA process and outcome measures.

Citicoline is necessary for the synthesis of cell membrane. We planned to assess the neuroprotective effect of citicoline in children after cardiac arrest. This randomized controlled trial was carried out at pediatric intensive care units (PICU) and surgical ICU at Tanta university hospital on 80 consecutive children surviving in-hospital cardiac arrest who were subdivided into two groups. Group I (citicoline group) included 40 children with post-cardiac arrest who received citicoline 10 mg /kg /12 h IV for 6 weeks plus other supportive measures and group II (control group) included 40 children with post-cardiac arrest who were managed with only supportive measures. All patients were evaluated for Glasgow coma score (GCS), modified Rankin scale (mRS) for children, seizures frequency, type and duration, and serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) before and 3 months after the treatment.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,A Narrative Review of Drug Therapy in Adult and Pediatric Cardiac Arrest,"Drugs are used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in association with chest compressions and ventilation. The main purpose of drugs during resuscitation is either to improve coronary perfusion pressure and myocardial perfusion in order to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The aim of this up-to-date review is to provide an overview of the main drugs used during cardiac arrest (CA), highlighting their historical context, pharmacology, and the data to support them. Epinephrine remains the only recommended vasopressor. Regardless of the controversy about optimal dosage and interval between doses in recent papers, epinephrine should be administered as early as possible to be the most effective in non-shockable rhythms. Despite inconsistent survival outcomes, amiodarone and lidocaine are the only two recommended antiarrhythmics to treat shockable rhythms after defibrillation. Beta-blockers have also been recently evaluated as antiarrhythmic drugs and show promising results but further evaluation is needed. Calcium, sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium are still widely used during resuscitation but have shown no benefit. Available data may even suggest a harmful effect and they are no longer recommended during routine CPR. In experimental studies, sodium nitroprusside showed an increase in survival and favorable neurological outcome when combined with enhanced CPR, but as of today, no clinical data is available. Finally, we review drug administration in pediatric CA. Epinephrine is recommended in pediatric CA and, although they have not shown any improvement in survival or neurological outcome, antiarrhythmic drugs have a 2b recommendation in the current guidelines for shockable rhythms.",REVIEWS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE,2023,"Jaeger, D; Marquez, AM; Kosmopoulos, M; Gutierrez, A; Gaisendrees, C; Orchard, D; Chouihed, T; Yannopoulos, D",10.31083/j.rcm2406163,,WOS:001025509200012,A

Identified research gaps include a lack of knowledge around what type of intervention is needed to best navigate recovery. In this study, we investigate the feasibility and patient acceptability of a new virtual psychoeducational group intervention for OHCA survivors and their relatives and compare it to a control group receiving a digital information booklet. Methods: V-CARE is a comparative, single-blind randomized pilot trial including participants at selected sites of the STEPCARE trial, in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Inclusion criteria are a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <= 3 at 30-day follow-up; no diagnosis of dementia; and not experiencing an acute psychiatric episode. One caregiver per patient is invited to participate optionally. The intervention group in V-CARE receives four semi-structured, one-hour-long, psychoeducational sessions delivered remotely via video call by a trained clinician once a week, 2-3 months after hospital discharge. The sessions cover understanding cardiac arrest; coping with fatigue and memory problems; managing low mood and anxiety; and returning to daily life. The control group receives an information booklet focused on fatigue, memory/cognitive problems, mental health, and practical coping strategies. Results: Primary: feasibility (number of patients consented) and acceptability (retention rate); secondary: satisfaction with care (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 item), self-management skills (Self-Management Assessment Scale) and, where available, health-related outcomes assessed in the STEPCARE Extended Follow-up sub-study including cognition, fatigue, mood, quality of life, and return to work. Conclusions: If preliminary insights from the V-CARE trial suggest the intervention to be feasible and acceptable, the results will be used to design a larger trial aimed at informing future interventions to support OHCA recovery.",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,2025,"Mion, M; Lilja, G; Bohm, M; Nordstroem, EB; Toeniste, D; Heimburg, K; Swindell, P; Dankiewicz, J; Skrifvars, MB; Nielsen, N; Jakobsen, JC; White, J; Wise, MP; Gorgoraptis, N; Keenan, M; Hopkins, P; Pareek, N; Maccaroni, M; Keeble, TR",10.3390/jcm14134429,,WOS:001526101500001,A

The etiologies and prognoses of OHCA Asian populations remain less established. This study aimed to investigate the etiologies and clinical characteristics of patients successfully resuscitated after OHCA and predictors of survival outcomes. Methods: Data were extracted from a South Korean multicenter prospective registry that included 64 tertiary hospitals from 2015 to 2018 (n=7,577). The primary outcome hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was a Cerebral Performance Category score of grade 1 at discharge. Results: Of the 7,577 patients, 2,066 achieved return of spontaneous circulation and were hospitalized. A total of 915 (44.2%) presented with ventricular arrhythmia as their initial rhythm or on admission. The leading cause was obstructive coronary disease (n=413; 20.0%). Sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) accounted for 67.5% survivors and was significantly less common in patients with VA (82.7% vs. 48.3%, p<0.001). VA was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.774; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.633-0.946; p=0.012) and the grade-1 CPC score at discharge (odds ratio, 2.822; 95% CI, 1.909-4.172; p<0.001). Other predictors of in-hospital mortality included age, diabetes mellitus, witnessed cardiac arrest, ROSC on arrival, total arrest time, alertness on admission, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, targeted temperature management, and coronary reperfusion. Conclusions: SUDS was common in patients with ROSC after OHCA. VA was independently associated with favorable survival outcomes at discharge.

Methods: This retrospective, single-center, observational study included adult patients who received ECMO treatment for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between February 2016 and March 2020. Factors associated with neurological and disability outcomes in these patients who underwent ECMO were assessed. Setting: Hamad General Hospital, Qatar. Main outcome measures: Neurological disability outcomes were assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale. Results: Among the 48 patients included, 37 (77 %) experienced OHCA, and 11 (23 %) had IHCA. The 28-day survival rate was 14 (29.2 %). Of the survivors, 9 (64.3 %) achieved a good neurological outcome, while 5 (35.7 %) experienced poor neurological outcomes. Regarding disability, 5 (35.7 %) of survivors had no disability, while 9 (64.3 %) had some form of disability. The results showed significantly shorter median time intervals in minutes, including collapse to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (3 vs. 6, P = 0.001), CPR duration (12 vs. 35, P = 0.001), CPR to extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) (20 vs. 40, P = 0.001), and collapse-toECPR (23 vs. 45, P = 0.001), in the good outcome group compared to the poor outcome group. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of minimizing the time between collapse and CPR/ECMO initiation to improve neurological outcomes and reduce disability in cardiac arrest patients. However, no significant associations were found between outcomes and other demographic or clinical variables in this study. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to validate these findings. Implications for clinical practice: The study underscores the significance of reducing the time between collapse and the initiation of CPR and ECMO.

It showed no difference between the two groups in the primary outcome of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 30 days/hospital discharge. This paper reports outcomes to 6 months. Methods: Paramedics from four ambulance services in England were randomised 1:1 to use an i-gel SGA (759 paramedics) or TI (764 paramedics) as their initial approach to AAM. Adults who had a non-traumatic OHCA and were attended by a participating paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent. Survivors were invited to complete questionnaires at three and six months after OHCA. Outcomes were analysed using regression methods. Results: 767/9296 (8.3%) enrolled patients survived to 30 days/hospital discharge and 317/767 survivors (41.3%) consented and were followed-up to six months. No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups in the primary outcome measure (mRS score: 3 months: odds ratio (OR) for good recovery (i-gel/TI, OR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.69-1.14; 6 months OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71-1.16). EQ-5D-5L scores were also similar between groups and sensitivity analyses did not alter the findings.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,What should a family physician know about nutrition and physical exercise rehabilitation' advices to communicate to 'long-term COVID-19' patients?,"In real practice, there is a paradox in the management of patients with 'long-term Covid-19.' Indeed, Family physicians (FPs) are on the front line in the management process of these patients. For 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and according to the World Health Organization guideline, the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) should be provided not only at tertiary- or secondary care but mainly at primary care with a real implication of FPs. However, specific guidelines/recommendations were addressed for FPs. Therefore, an alternative including the CPR minimal advice that an FP should provide to 'long-term Covid-19' patients, seems to be necessary to respond to the needs of FPs to face their involvement with 'long-term Covid-19' patients. Thus, this paper aimed to report the CPR 'minimal advice' that should be provided by FPs managing 'long-term Covid-19' patients with incapacity (i.e.; alteration of the cardiorespiratory and muscular chain). According to the authors, FPs should be more cautious in the prescription of exercise and nutrition program and informed about the minimal advices related to nutritional and physical exercise rehabilitation guidelines when taking care of 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and how these guidelines can relieve the mental and physical problems, improve immunity, and accelerate the recovery process of the patients.

MethodsThis retrospective study included adult non-traumatic OHCA with initial shockable rhythms between 2010 and 2019. Survivors at 12 months after arrest were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews. Outcomes were identified using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and living and work status-related questions. Results6050 patients had initial shockable rhythms, 3211 (53.1%) had a pulse on hospital arrival, while 1879 (31.1%) were discharged alive. Bystander defibrillation using the closest automated external defibrillator had the highest survival rate (52.8%), followed by dispatched first responders (36.7%) and paramedics (27.9%). 1802 (29.8%) patients survived to 12-month postarrest; of these 1520 (84.4%) were interviewed. 1088 (71.6%) were initially shocked by paramedics, 271 (17.8%) by first responders and 161 (10.6%) by bystanders. Bystander-shocked survivors reported higher rates of living at home without care (87.5%, 75.2%, 77.0%, p<0.001), upper good recovery (GOS-E=8) (41.7%, 30.4%, 30.6%, p=0.002) and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) >= 80 (64.9%, 55.9%, 52.9%, p=0.003) compared with first responder and paramedics, respectively.

Its association with clinical presentation following out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains understudied. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of phantom scanning in OHCA, stratified by clinical presentation and emergency department (ED) disposition. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of adult patients presenting with atraumatic OHCA. The primary outcome was phantom scanning among patients presenting with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in progress versus return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The secondary outcome compared phantom scanning between admitted patients versus those who died in the ED. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals evaluated associations. Results: Of 306 patients reviewed, 244 met inclusion criteria. POCUS was more likely with CPR in progress (OR = 3.58, 95% CI [2.08, 6.261, p < 0.001). Among patients who underwent POCUS, phantom scanning was more frequent with CPR in progress (OR = 3.15, 95% CI [1.49, 6.841, p = 0.002). POCUS was less likely among admitted patients (OR = 0.37, 95% CI [0.21, 0.661, p < 0.001), and phantom scanning was less common in this group (OR = 0.23, 95% CI [0.11, 0.471, p < 0.001). Differences in research should focus on strategies to reduce phantom scanning and promote adherence to POCUS best practices. (c) 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Methods We performed a retrospective review of cardiac and neurologic manifestations of patients with genetically confirmed desmin-related myopathy (January 1, 1999-January 1, 2020). Results Twenty-five patients in 20 different families were recognized. Median age at onset of symptoms was 20 (range 4-50) years; median follow-up time was 36 (range 1-156) months. Twelve patients initially presented with skeletal muscle involvement, and 13 presented with cardiac disease. Sixteen patients had both cardiac and skeletal muscle involvement. Clinically muscle weakness distribution was distal (n = 11), proximal (n = 4), or both (n = 7) in 22 patients. Skeletal muscle biopsy from patients with missense and splice site variants (n = 12) showed abnormal fibers containing amorphous material in Gomori trichrome-stained sections. Patients with cardiac involvement had atrioventricular conduction abnormalities or cardiomyopathy. The most common ECG abnormality was complete atrioventricular block in 11 patients, all of whom required a permanent pacemaker at a median age of 25 (range 16-48) years. Sudden cardiac death resulting in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks or resuscitation was reported in 3 patients; a total of 5 patients had ICDs.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Seconds Matter: Novel Transport Solutions in Urban Settings Reduce Transport Times,"Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requires immediate intervention to optimize survival and neurological outcomes. Rapid recognition and treatment are critical, especially in prehospital settings. Case Report: A 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest while riding a city bus. Bystanders activated Emergency Medical Services (EMS), who promptly initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Due to the patient's proximity to a tertiary care STEMI center, EMS made the unconventional decision to continue resuscitative efforts en route using the city bus, bypassing traditional ambulance transport. Upon arrival, she underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieved full neurological recovery. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: This case illustrates the importance of flexibility and innovation in prehospital care. However, it also highlights the need to balance innovation with adherence to EMS safety protocols and statutory requirements. Uninterrupted CPR, rapid defibrillation, and expedited transport-even via unconventional means-can dramatically impact outcomes in STEMI-related cardiac arrest, but such strategies must always be weighed against provider and patient safety.

This meta-analysis sought to systematically review the technical features of existing mobile applications and evaluate their impact on OHCA patient outcomes under various emergency response strategies. The findings aimed to guide the development and optimization of prehospital public emergency response systems. Methods A systematic search was conducted in databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to August 2023. The included studies involved notifying citizens via text messages or smartphone applications to act as first responders or volunteers in OHCA cases. Using a random effects model and subgroup analysis, we synthesized the results to identify sources of heterogeneity and assess outcomes. Results Thirteen mobile applications were included, with an average activation rate of 35.3% among patients and a volunteer arrival rate of 53.3%. Compared to traditional emergency medical services, mobile applications significantly improved survival to discharge or 30-day survival rates (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.44; P < 0.05), return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rates upon hospital admission (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40; P < 0.05), bystander CPR rates (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.13-1.37; P < 0.05), and bystander defibrillation rates (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00-1.51; P = 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent results for bystander CPR rates and survival outcomes, while variations in defibrillation rates and ROSC at admission were observed, indicating potential influences of application design and operational parameters. Conclusions This study highlighted the significant potential of mobile applications in enhancing bystander interventions and improving patient outcomes.

Previous studies have suggested that surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures could be beneficial in selected patients, although many experience persisting pain despite surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term outcome after surgical management of symptomatic non-union rib fractures. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study including adults (>= 18 years) managed surgically for symptomatic nonunion rib fractures with plate fixation during the period 2010-2020 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Patients operated for acute chest wall injury or injury due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded. Patients answered standardized questionnaires concerning remaining symptoms and satisfaction with surgery, quality of life (QoL, EQ-5D-5 L) and disability (Disability Rating Index, DRI). Lung function, movement of chest wall and thoracic spine, and shoulder function (Bostro center dot m index) were assessed. Results: Sixteen patients, 12 men and four women, with mean age 61.6 +/- 11.1 were included in the study. The mechanism of injury was trauma in 10 patients and cough -induced injuries in five patients. Lung disease was significantly more prevalent in cough -induced injuries compared to traumatic injuries, 5 vs 1 (p = 0.008). The mean follow-up time was 3.5 years. Ninety-four percent were satisfied with the surgery and reported that their symptoms had decreased, although 69 % had remaining symptoms, especially pain, from the chest wall. Quality of Life was decreased with EQ-5D-5 L index 0.819 (0.477-0.976) and EQ-VAS 69 (10-100). Disability Rating Index was 31.5 (1.3-76.7) with problems running, lifting heavy objects, and performing heavy work. Predicted lung function was decreased with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) 86.2 +/- 14.2 %, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) 79.1 +/- 10.7 % and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) 89.7 +/- 14.5 %.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Ethical Considerations for Patients Requiring Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation,"Immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can significantly improve survival chances. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during CPR (eCPR) could further enhance survival rates. Current evidence supports the implementation of eCPR as a part of the Advanced Life Support protocol, which may positively affect survival and long-term neurological outcomes and provide additional time for diagnosing and treating the underlying cause of cardiac arrest. Based on the patient's potential for recovery and neurological outcome, multidisciplinary teams can pursue weaning of the patient from mechanical support or withdrawal of care in the case of an unfavorable outcome. These decisions should align with the patient's values, prognosis, and ethical guidelines. A healthcare system that actively promotes eCPR as a standardized part of every Advanced Life Support protocol may face challenges, such as an increased number of patients requiring constant care in long-term care facilities. This could potentially lead to a reduced quality of life and create burdens on patients, families, the healthcare system, and society. Furthermore, in cases of potential organ donation, the principles of beneficence and autonomy may place healthcare providers in significant ethical dilemmas. Given the potential for eCPR to become a standard of care for eligible patients, this work focuses on the ethical and social implications, as well as the impact on the healthcare system.

Recent studies showed promising results after osteosynthesis of rib fractures in trauma patients with flail segments or multiple rib fractures. However, there is a paucity of data on rib fixation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study evaluated the outcomes of patients who received rib fixation after CPR. MethodsAdult patients who received surgical fixation of rib fractures sustained during CPR between 2010 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. Outcome measures included complications, quality of life (EQ 5D 5L) and level of dyspnea. ResultsNineteen patients were included with a mean age of 66.8 years. The mean number of fractured ribs was ten, seven patients additionally had a sternum fracture. Pneumonia occurred in 15 patients (74%), of which 13 were diagnosed preoperatively and 2 post-operatively. Six patients developed a postoperative pneumothorax, none of which required revision surgery. One patient showed persistent flail chest after rib fixation and required additional fixation of a concomitant sternum fracture. One infection of the surgical site of sternal plate occurred, while no further surgery related complications were reported. Mean EQ-5D-5L was 0.908 and the average EQ VAS was 80. One patient reported persisting dyspnea. ConclusionTo date, this is the largest reported cohort of patients who received rib fixation for fractures sustained during CPR. No complications associated with rib fixation were reported whereas one infection after sternal fixation did occur. Current follow-up demonstrated a good long-term quality of life after fixation, warranting further studies on this topic.

Visitor restriction policies enacted to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to long-term care residents requires advance care planning discussions to be conducted remotely. A structured approach can help guide discussions regarding the diagnosis, expected course, and care of individuals with COVID-19 in long-term care settings.

Scenario 1 involved an awareness campaign on OHCA, while Scenario 2 included implementing a CFR system with automated external defibrillator (AED) integration, dispatch centre linkage and training for citizen responders. The analysis covered survival to the emergency department, hospital, discharge and neurologically intact survival, with sensitivity analyses to test robustness.Results The awareness campaign and implementation of the CFR system resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>14,976 and <euro>16,442 per quality-adjusted life year gained for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Both scenarios showed improvements in survival rates at various stages, including hospital discharge and neurologically intact survival.Conclusion This study highlights the benefits of enhancing Belgium's CFR for OHCA patients. It suggests that accessible AEDs, trained CFRs and an integrated emergency response system could improve survival rates and quality of life. These findings can guide policy and resource decisions, potentially improving the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of OHCA emergency services. Additionally, this approach could serve as a model for other regions aiming to strengthen their response to time-sensitive emergencies.",OPEN HEART,2025,"de Greef, B; Genbrugge, C; Verma, S; Medic, G; Maurer, J; Kooy, TA; Hoogmartens, O; Sabbe, M",10.1136/openhrt-2024-003098,,WOS:001424907600001,A

Goals of modern paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management should focus on restoring long-term function of paediatric critical illness survivors. This review outlines our current knowledge on trajectories and risk factors of long-term morbidities in PICU survivors. Specifically, we aimed to identify current limitations and gaps in this area so as to identify opportunities for future investigations to reduce the burden of morbidities in these children. Materials and Methods: A review of primary studies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases in the last decade (2008-2017) describing long-term morbidities in PICU survivors was conducted. Results: Children surviving critical illness continue to experience morbidities after discharge. A set of risk factors modify their long-term trajectories of recovery, with some children achieving their premorbid level of function, while some others deteriorate or die. Limitations in current methodologies of morbidity research impair our understanding on the causes of these morbidities. Opportunities for future endeavours to reduce the burden of these morbidities include identifying patients who are more likely to develop morbidities, evaluating the efficacy of early rehabilitation, identifying patients who might benefit from tight glycaemic control, characterising the optimal nutritional intervention, and improving management of increased intracranial pressure. Conclusion: Survivors of paediatric critical illness experience differing trajectories of recovery from morbidities.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Variability in functional outcome and treatment practices by treatment center after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: analysis of International Cardiac Arrest Registry,"PurposeFunctional outcomes vary between centers after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and are partially explained by pre-existing health status and arrest characteristics, while the effects of in-hospital treatments on functional outcome are less understood. We examined variation in functional outcomes by center after adjusting for patient- and arrest-specific characteristics and evaluated how in-hospital management differs between high- and low-performing centers.MethodsAnalysis of observational registry data within the International Cardiac Arrest Registry was used to perform a hierarchical model of center-specific risk standardized rates for good outcome, adjusted for demographics, pre-existing functional status, and arrest-related factors with treatment center as a random effect variable. We described the variability in treatments and diagnostic tests that may influence outcome at centers with adjusted rates significantly above and below registry average. ResultsA total of 3855 patients were admitted to an ICU following cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation. The overall prevalence of good outcome was 11-63% among centers. After adjustment, center-specific risk standardized rates for good functional outcome ranged from 0.47 (0.37-0.58) to 0.20 (0.12-0.26). High-performing centers had faster time to goal temperature, were more likely to have goal temperature of 33 degrees C, more likely to perform unconscious cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention, and had differing prognostication practices than low-performing centers. ConclusionsCenter-specific differences in outcomes after OHCA after adjusting for patient-specific factors exist. This variation could partially be explained by in-hospital management differences.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Identification of Factors Associated with Return of Spontaneous Circulation after Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Natural Language Processing,"Introduction Prior studies examining prehospital characteristics related to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are limited to structured data. Natural language processing (NLP) could identify new factors from unstructured data using free-text narratives. The purpose of this study was to use NLP to examine EMS clinician free-text narratives for characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of patients ages 0-17 with OHCA in 2019 from the ESO Data Collaborative. We performed an exploratory analysis of EMS narratives using NLP with an a priori token library. We then constructed biostatistical and machine learning models and compared their performance in predicting ROSC. Results There were 1,726 included EMS encounters for pediatric OHCA; 60% were male patients, and the median age was 1 year (IQR 0-9). Most cardiac arrest events (61.3%) were unwitnessed, 87.3% were identified as having medical causes, and 5.9% had initial shockable rhythms. Prehospital ROSC was achieved in 23.1%. Words most positively correlated with ROSC were ""ROSC"" (r = 0.42), ""pulse"" (r = 0.29), ""drowning"" (r = 0.13), and ""PEA"" (r = 0.12). Words negatively correlated with ROSC included ""asystole"" (r = -0.25), ""lividity"" (r = -0.14), and ""cold"" (r = -0.14). The terms ""asystole,"" ""pulse,"" ""no breathing,"" ""PEA,"" and ""dry"" had the greatest difference in frequency of appearance between encounters with and without ROSC (p < 0.05). The best-performing model for predicting prehospital ROSC was logistic regression with random oversampling using free-text data only (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92). Conclusions EMS clinician free-text narratives reveal additional characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Incorporating those terms into machine learning models of prehospital ROSC improves predictive ability. Therefore, NLP holds promise as a tool for use in predictive models with the goal to increase evidence-based management of pediatric OHCA.",PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE,2023,"Harris, M; Crowe, RP; Anders, J; D'Acunto, S; Adelgais, KM; Fishe, JN",10.1080/10903127.2022.2074180,,WOS:000801217500001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Improving Survival after Cardiac Arrest,"Each year, approximately half a million people suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) in Europe: The majority die. Survival after CA varies greatly between regions and countries. The authors give an overview of the important elements necessary to promote improved survival after CA as a function of the chain of survival and formula for survival concepts. The chain of survival incorporates bystanders (who identify warning symptoms, call the emergency dispatch center, initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]), dispatchers (who identify CA, and instruct and reassure the caller), first responders (who provide high-quality CPR, early defibrillation), paramedics and other prehospital care providers (who continue high-quality CPR, and provide timely defibrillation and advanced life support, transport to CA center), and hospitals (targeted temperature management, percutaneous coronary intervention, delayed prognostication). The formula for survival concept consists of (1) medical science (international guidelines), (2) educational efficiency (e.g., low-dose, high-frequency training for lay people, first responders, and professionals; and (3) local implementation of all factors in the chain of survival and formula for survival. Survival rates after CA can be advanced through the improvement of the different factors in both the chain of survival and the formula for survival.

Patients with minor stroke are more likely to be discharged home. This paper compares early cognitive and emotional outcomes in patients discharged home after stroke versus patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation, and examines the effect of cognitive and emotional outcomes on long-term participation. Methods In this multicenter prospective cohort study, patients with stroke were assessed at two months with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Checklist for Cognitive and Emotional Consequences following Stroke (CLCE-24) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). One year post stroke, participation was assessed with the Restriction subscale of the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P Restriction). Results The study included 332 patients. Two months post stroke, anxiety and cognitive problems were equally prevalent among patients discharged home (n = 243; 73%) and patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (n = 89; 27%) (HADS-A = 4.8 +/- 3.9 versus 4.6 +/- 4.0,p = 0.747; MoCA < 26: 66.7% versus 70.8%,p = 0.477; CLCE-cognition = 3.0 +/- 2.9 versus 3.3 +/- 2.8,p = 0.499). Depressive symptoms were less severe in patients discharged home (HADS-D = 4.3 +/- 3.9 versus 5.5 +/- 3.8,p = 0.010). In patients discharged home, cognitive complaints were predictive of long-term participation (B = - 2.03; 95% CI - 3.15, - 0.90), while cognitive or emotional outcomes were not predictive in patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. Conclusions Cognitive and emotional problems at two months post stroke were comparable between patients discharged home and those discharged to inpatient rehabilitation.

Ten age- and sex-matched normal subjects, and 13 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients without ventricular arrhythmias formed the control groups. QT(cd)-values in the control groups never exceeded 80 ms and mean values of 30.1 +/- 10.1 ms and 44.1 +/- 7.9 ms respectively, were found.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,The role of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: what the evidence tells us,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a global public health problem. Lay bystanders witness almost half of OHCA, so early recognition is critical to allow immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by the bystander. The present investigation aims to analyze the most recent scientific evidence of the effect of bystander CPR on survival after an OHCA. A systematic literature review was carried out at the ""Web of Science,"" ""Scopus,"" and ""PubMed"" databases, including publications from the last 20 years. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 37 articles were identified. Results indicate that patients who receive CPR are more likely to survive than those who don't, and CPR is associated with a good quality of life post-OHCA. Emphasis should be placed on practicing chest compressions only when the bystander has not mastered the artificial ventilation technique. Finding an AED is the first step to using it in an OHCA situation. Correct use of an AED by laypeople is associated with nearly double the survival rate after an OHCA when compared to standard CPR. It is important to promote CPR and AED training to non-professionals, such as community residents and youth, as training is associated with higher success rates of effective CPR-AED. A mobile phone positioning system to recruit trained laypeople or text message alerts to send citizen volunteers as well as assistance through a mobile app appear to have significant advantages in practicing effective CPR.

While some non-governmental organisations support various patient groups, little is known about those dedicated to cardiac arrest survivors. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) conducted a survey to identify and understand these organisations' structures and activities. Methods: An internet survey developed by the ERC was disseminated through media channels, national resuscitation councils, and social networks. Responses were verified against publicly available information to confirm declared activities and sustained support efforts. Organisations were classified based on whether their primary focus was on cardiac arrest survivors or if support was a secondary activity. Results: Of fifty-six responses, eight organisations were identified as providing structured, continuous support. Six primarily focused on cardiac arrest survivors, while two had a broader scope. Most were established after 2000, with six in Europe and two in the United States. Membership ranged from 520 to 3000 survivors. Common activities included peer support and distributing information materials. Connections with healthcare systems varied, with three reporting none. Only two were represented in their national resuscitation councils (NRCs). Conclusions: Organisations supporting cardiac arrest survivors are scarce but address important unmet needs.

Setting: Centralized telephone follow-up interviews. Design: Retrospective report of data collected for Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest trials, and summary of strategies used to maximize follow-up completion. Patients: Twelve-month survivors (n = 251) from 39 Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest PICU sites in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Interventions: Not applicable. Measurements and Main Results: The 3- and 12-month telephone interviews included completion of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition data were available on 96% of 3-month survivors (242/251) and 95% of 12-month survivors (239/251) with no differences in demographics between those with and without completed Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition. At 12 months, a substantial minority of interviews were completed with caregivers other than parents (10%), after calls attempts were made on 6 or more days (18%), and during evenings/weekends (17%). Strategies included emphasizing the relationship between study teams and participants, ongoing communication between study team members across sites, promoting site engagement during the study's final year, and withholding payment for work associated with the primary outcome until work had been completed. Conclusions: It is feasible to use telephone follow-up interviews to successfully collect detailed neurobehavioral outcome about children following pediatric cardiac arrest.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following OHCA. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to July 3, 2021, for studies reporting the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among OHCA survivors. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by two authors independently, and a third resolved discrepancies. A single-arm meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool the proportion of patients with these conditions at the earliest follow-up time point in each study and at predefined time points. Meta-regression was performed to identify significant moderators that contributed to between-study heterogeneity. Results: The search yielded 15,366 articles. 13 articles were included for analysis, which comprised 186,160 patients. The pooled overall prevalence at the earliest time point of follow-up was 19.0% (11 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0-30.0%) for depression, 26.0% (nine studies; 95% CI = 16.0-39.0%) for anxiety, and 20.0% (three studies; 95% CI = 3.0-65.0%) for PTSD.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest: An 11-year experience from an university center,"Background: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent medical care and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given that in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still poorly investigated, data on health-associated quality of life thereafter remains scarce. The available evidence is mostly transferred from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies, but the epidemiology and determinants of success might be different. The aim of the study was to investigate the change in the quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify potential risk factors for a poor outcome. Material and methods: This retrospective analysis of data and prospective evaluation of quality of life included all patients surviving an IHCA and being treated by the emergency medical team between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint of the study was the quality of life after IHCA at the reference date. Secondary endpoints covered determination of risk factors and predictors of poor outcome after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results: In total 604 patients were resuscitated within the period of 11 years and 61 (10%) patients survived until the interview took place. Finally, 48 (79%) patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 31 (65%) were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest (EQ-5D-5L utility 0.79 vs. 0.78, p = 0.567) and in the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Conclusion: The quality of life before and after IHCA in survivors was good and comparable. The quality of life was mostly affected by reduced mobility and anxiety/depression. Future studies with larger patient samples should focus on potentially modifiable factors that could prevent, warn, and limit the consequences of in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Comparison of emergency department (ED) return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA in relation to emergency medical services (EMS) and non-EMS modes of transportation to the hospital was conducted to assess the impact points of the EMS system in Thailand. Methods This retrospective observational study enrolled all OHCA patients who visited the ED of Ramathibodi Hospital, a tertiary university hospital in Bangkok, between January 1, 2008, and May 31, 2020. Patients were differentiated into EMS and non-EMS groups according to mode of transportation to the ED. Patients' characteristics and comorbidities, witnessed arrests, bystander chest compression, initial rhythm, and resuscitation treatment were documented. ED-sustained ROSC, ED survival, 30-day survival, and 30-day survival with good cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were monitored and recorded. Multivariate logistic analyses were performed to assess factors influencing clinical outcomes. Results A total of 339 patients were enrolled, 117 (34.51%) of whom were in the EMS transport group. There were no differences between the EMS and non-EMS groups in ED-sustained ROSC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.70; P = 0.98), or ED survival (aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.57-1.71; P = 0.97). There were also no differences in 30-day survival or 30-day survival with good CPC score between the two groups. Conclusions In our cohort data of OHCA, ED-sustained ROSC and ED survival outcomes were not superior in the EMS transportation group. Evidence to show that EMS transportation affected 30-day survival and 30-day good CPC score was also lacking. Thus, public promotion of Thailand's EMS system is advocated with a simultaneous improvement of EMS response to enhance OHCA outcomes.",PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE,2023,"Sanguanwit, P; Sutthisuwan, K; Phattharapornjaroen, P; Phontabtim, M; Mankong, Y",10.1080/10903127.2022.2058131,,WOS:000781698600001,A

Methods: A computerized search of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, and Embase was conducted from the database's inception to May 1, 2023. The study included observational studies of patients who experienced OHCA and were successfully resuscitated using BCPR, following the predetermined criteria for inclusion and exclusion. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) used as effect size measures. The data were statistically analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 software. Results: Fourteen observational studies were included in this study, involving 253,247 cases of OHCA. The primary outcome measure was survival to discharge or survival at 30 days. A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the data from these 14 studies. The findings indicated that the no-BCPR group had a significantly reduced survival rate compared to the BCPR group (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.40-2.12, p < 0.05). Secondly, the study examined 14 studies that focused on prehospital return of spontaneous circulation and neurological recovery before they reached the hospital. The findings revealed that patients who received BCPR had a higher rate of prehospital ROSC (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.66-2.57, p < 0.05) and experienced better neurological recovery (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.67-2.47, p < 0.05) compared to those who did not receive BCPR. This difference was found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: BCPR can potentially enhance the likelihood of survival for patients experiencing OHCA. BCPR can offer patients an opportunity for both survival and favorable neurological recovery during the time when emergency medical services (EMS) respond.

The authors hypothesized that sedation would improve survival and neurologic outcomes in mice after cardiac arrest. Methods:Adult C57BL/6J mice of both sexes were subjected to potassium chloride-induced cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Starting at the return of spontaneous circulation or at 60 min after return of spontaneous circulation, mice received intravenous infusion of propofol at 40 mg center dot kg(-1) center dot h(-1), dexmedetomidine at 1 mu g center dot kg(-1) center dot h(-1), or normal saline for 2 h. Body temperature was lowered and maintained at 33 degrees C during sedation. Cerebral blood flow was measured for 4 h postresuscitation. Telemetric electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in freely moving mice from 3 days before up to 7 days after cardiac arrest. Results:Sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine starting at return of spontaneous circulation improved survival in hypothermia-treated mice (propofol [13 of 16, 81%] vs. no sedation [4 of 16, 25%], P = 0.008; dexmedetomidine [14 of 16, 88%] vs. no sedation [4 of 16, 25%], P = 0.002). Mice receiving no sedation exhibited cerebral hyperemia immediately after resuscitation and EEG power remained less than 30% of the baseline in the first 6 h postresuscitation. Administration of propofol or dexmedetomidine starting at return of spontaneous circulation attenuated cerebral hyperemia and increased EEG slow oscillation power during and early after sedation (40 to 80% of the baseline). In contrast, delayed sedation failed to improve outcomes, without attenuating cerebral hyperemia and inducing slow-wave activity. Conclusions:Early administration of sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine improved survival and neurologic outcomes in mice resuscitated from cardiac arrest and treated with hypothermia.

Minimizing ""time down"" without end-organ perfusion has always been a central pillar of ACLS. In many critically ill patients there is a prolonged phase of end-organ hypoperfusion preceding loss of palpable pulses and initiation of ACLS. Due to the relative infrequency of in-hospital cardiac arrest, NIRS has not previously evaluated the period immediately prior to hemodynamic collapse. Here we report a young man who suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest while cortical oxygenation was monitored using time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy. The onset of cortical deoxygenation preceded the loss of palpable pulses by 15 min, suggesting that TRS-NIRS monitoring might provide a means of preempting PEA arrest.

Results:We included 115 patients (81 derivation, 34 validation) with out-of-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Regional brain water content remained unchanged in patients with good outcome. In patients with poor neurological outcome, we found considerable regional water uptake with the strongest effect in the basal ganglia. NWU >8% in the putamen and caudate nucleus predicted poor outcome with 100% specificity (95%-CI: 86-100%) and 43% (moderate) sensitivity (95%-CI: 31-56%). Conclusion:This pilot study indicates that NWU derived from serial head CTs is a promising novel biomarker for outcome prediction after CA. NWU >8% in basal ganglia grey matter regions predicted poor outcome while absence of NWU indicated good outcome.

Objectives: To investigate post-in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survival prior to and after modification of the chain of survival in 2010, with subgroup analyses per age and concomitant coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: We retrospectively searched the National Health Insurance Research Database for the 2007-2015 period to collect case data coded as ""427.41"" or ""427.5"" per International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification, Ninth revision codes and analyzed the data with SPSS v22.0. Results: The 1-day survival rate in the 2011-2015 period was 2% higher than that in the 2007-2010 period (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.04). Moreover, in the 2011-2015 period, the survival-to-discharge rate was increased by 1% in patients under 65 years (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02) and 1% in CHD patients (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02) compared with that in the 2007-2010 period. Conclusion: For patients with IHCA, the overall short-term survival improved significantly after modification of the chain of survival. Younger patients and patients with CHD had better long-term survival. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Adult male rats were anesthetized and subjected to bilateral carotid arterial occlusion plus bleeding hypotension for 10 min. The rats were randomized to one of four protocols: ischemia/normoxia (21% oxygen for 1 h), ischemia/hyperoxia (100% oxygen for 1 h), sham/normoxia, and sham/hyperoxia. Hippocampal CA1 neuronal survival and activation of microglia and astrocytes were measured in the hippocampi of the animals at 7 and 30 days post-ischemia. Morris water maze testing of memory was performed on days 23-30. Compared to normoxic reperfusion, hyperoxic ventilation resulted in a significant decrease in normal-appearing neurons at 7 and 30 days, and increased activation of microglia and astrocytes at 7, but not at 30, days of reperfusion. Behavioral deficits were also observed following hyperoxic, but not normoxic, reperfusion. We conclude that early post-ischemic hyperoxic reperfusion is followed by greater hippocampal neuronal death and cellular inflammatory reactions compared to normoxic reperfusion. The results of these long-term outcome studies, taken together with previously published results from short-term experiments performed with large animals, support the hypothesis that neurological outcome can be improved by avoiding hyperoxic resuscitation after global cerebral ischemia such as that which accompanies cardiac arrest.",JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA,2010,"Hazelton, JL; Balan, I; Elmer, GI; Kristian, T; Rosenthal, RE; Krause, G; Sanderson, TH; Fiskum, G",10.1089/neu.2009.1186,,WOS:000276727000009,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Adenosine treatment delays postischemic hippocampal CA1 loss after cardiac arrest and resuscitation in rats,"Resuscitation from cardiac arrest results in reperfusion injury that leads to increased postresuscitation mortality and delayed neuronal death. One of the many consequences of resuscitation from cardiac arrest is a derangement of energy metabolism and the loss of adenylates, impairing the tissue's ability to regain proper energy balance. in this study, we investigated the effects of adenosine (ADO) on the recovery of the brain from 12 min of ischemia using a rat model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Compared to the untreated group, treatment with adenosine (7.2 mg/kg) initiated immediately after resuscitation increased the proportion of rats surviving to 4 days and significantly delayed hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss. Brain blood flow was increased significantly in the adenosine-treated rats 1 h after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Adeno sine-treated rats exhibited less edema in cortex, brainstem and hippocampus during the first 48 h of recovery. Adenosine treatment significantly lowered brain temperature during recovery, and a part of the neuroprotective effects of adenosine treatment could be ascribed to adenosine-induced hypothermia. With this dose, adenosine may have a delayed transient effect on the restoration of the adenylate pool (AXP = ATP + ADP + AMP) 24 h after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our findings suggested that improved postischemic brain blood flow and ADO-induced hypothermia, rather than adenylate supplementation, may be the two major contributors to the neuroprotective effects of adenosine following cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Although adenosine did not prevent eventual CA1 neuronal loss in the long term, it did delay neuronal loss and promoted long-term survival. Thus, adenosine or specific agonists of adenosine receptors should be evaluated as adjuncts to broaden the window of opportunity in the treatment of the reperfusion injury following cardiac arrest and resuscitation.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Neuroprotection after Cardiac Arrest: Reevaluating the Role of Therapeutic Hypothermia - A Narrative Review,"Therapeutic hypothermia, defined as lowering the core body temperature to 32 degrees C-34 degrees C, has emerged as a key intervention in post-cardiac arrest care, aimed at mitigating brain injury and improving neurological outcomes. The primary pathways underlying the potential neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia include the reduction of cerebral metabolic demand, the attenuation of excitotoxicity, and the suppression of inflammation. Early clinical studies, including the Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest (HACA) and the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest in Nonshockable Rhythm (HYPERION) trials, showed promising results and led to the endorsement of this approach in the post-cardiac arrest setting. However, more recent trials, such as the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM), the TTM2 and the HACA in-hospital studies, found no significant benefit in all-cause mortality or neurologic outcomes. These findings raised important questions about the ideal temperature range, the optimal timing of initiation, and the duration of cooling. Moreover, this approach is correlated with potential risks, like coagulopathy, increased infection risk, or electrolyte disturbances.

In the multicenter case-control study, nontraumatic OHCA adults with bacteremia episodes after achieving sROSC were defined as case patients, and non-OHCA patients with community-onset bacteremia in the emergency department were regarded as control patients. Initially, case patients had a higher bacteremia incidence than non-OHCA visits (231/2171, 10.6% vs. 10,430/314,620, 3.3%; p < 0.001). Compared with the matched control (2288) patients, case (231) patients experienced more bacteremic episodes due to low respiratory tract infections, fewer urosepsis events, fewer Escherichia coli bacteremia, and more streptococcal and anaerobes bacteremia. Antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, were frequently evident in case patients. Notably, each hour delay in AAT administration was associated with an average increase of 10.6% in crude 30-day mortality rates in case patients, 0.7% in critically ill control patients, and 0.3% in less critically ill control patients. Conclusively, the incidence and characteristics of bacteremia differed between the nontraumatic OHCA and non-OHCA patients.

Their rarity and complexity demand rapid, expert management, often complicated by associated multivisceral injuries. Case report: A 20-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department following a road traffic accident, presenting with severe cranial and abdominal impact trauma. Clinical examination revealed hemodynamic instability and abdominal distension with rigidity. Due to the patient's hemodynamic instability and the abdominal emergency, he was taken directly to the operating room without undergoing a CT scan. Urgent median laparotomy revealed a duodenal avulsion from D1 to D3 with partial detachment of the pancreatic head. The surgical intervention involved partial duodenal and pancreatic resection with complex reconstruction, including a jejunal patch and gastrojejunostomy. Postoperatively, the patient developed abdominal septic shock requiring intensive resuscitation measures. He was extubated on day 3, with continued monitoring in the ICU. Parenteral feeding was initiated on day 4, enteral feeding on day 17, and drains were removed on day 15. The patient was subsequently transferred to visceral surgery following favorable progression. Discussion: Duodenopancreatic traumas are rare surgical emergencies, representing 3-5 % of abdominal traumas, often complex due to associated injuries. Key challenges include difficult diagnosis due to initially subtle clinical signs, personalized surgical management (occasionally requiring post-traumatic pancreaticoduodenectomy, as in our case), frequent and potentially severe postoperative complications (e.g., fistulas, hemorrhages, abscesses), and significant long-term sequelae such as diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Long-term, multidisciplinary follow-up is essential to manage functional sequelae, including diabetes and steatorrhea. Conclusion: Duodenopancreatic injuries have a high mortality rate (5-30 %). Rapid intervention, specialized surgical expertise, and rigorous follow-up are crucial for optimizing outcomes and quality of life for patients.

Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest in the emergency department (ED) were included. Routine laboratory parameters were obtained from the first blood sample collected during CPR in the ED. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated by dividing the absolute number of neutrophils and platelets, respectively, by the absolute number of lymphocytes. The GPR was calculated as serum glucose divided by potassium levels. Results: The 30-day mortality rate was 82.2% (n = 291). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified lactate, NLR, PLR and GPR as independent predictors of mortality. Among these markers, lactate exhibited the highest predictive power for mortality, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.817, compared to NLR (AUC: 0.676), PLR (AUC: 0.679) and GPR (AUC: 0.688).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Systemic nicotinamide mononucleotide administration to mitigate post-cardiac arrest brain injury in mice,"Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is the leading cause of death and disability following cardiac arrest (CA). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion after CA contributes to neuronal injury, while nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) replenishes NAD+ and may provide neuroprotection via sirtuin activation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMN administration on neurological function, survival, and sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) levels in the brain post-CA. In adult male mice (C57BL/6NCrSlc, 10-15 weeks old), 10-min CA was induced by intravenous potassium chloride injection followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. NMN (60 mg/kg body weight) or normal saline (control) was randomly administered by intraperitoneal injection immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 24 and 48 h post-CA. Brain NAD+ and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, neurological function score (NFS), survival, histological neuronal injury, and brain gene expression and protein levels were measured. Brain NAD+ levels decreased at 2 h post-ROSC and NMN significantly increased brain NAD+ and ATP levels. At 48 h post-CA, surviving mice in the NMN group exhibited significantly higher NFS (control: 8 [IQR: 4-12] vs. NMN: 12 [IQR: 9-12], p = 0.03) and less severe hippocampal neuronal injury compared with controls. Moreover, the NMN group showed significantly higher 7-day survival rate (control: 22.2% [4/18] vs. NMN: 61.1% [11/18], p = 0.03) and brain SIRT3 levels (control: 17.7 +/- 3.6 vs. NMN: 34.5 +/- 4.4 pg/mg protein, p = 0.01). In conclusion, systemic NMN administration after ROSC attenuates PCABI. The increased brain ATP levels and SIRT3 upregulation may suggest the usefulness of NMN for improving mitochondrial function and contributing to neuroprotection.

Methods: Prospectively randomized groups of experiments in two phases. In phase 1 four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n =5) were resuscitated after 6 min VFCA with 2 and 6 min basic life support durations (BLS) with and without adrenaline. In phase 2 the most promising group regarding return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival was compared with a group of 8 min CA.

Diagnostic options are considered and the requirements for successful management defined. Chief amongst these is a multi-disciplinary approach with individualised patient management. Severe long-segment CTS represents the biggest challenge to clinicians and the worst problems for affected families. Near-death episodes are frequent in affected infants and some cannot be ventilated and require ECMO. Associated cardiovascular anomalies are frequent. Patients require immediate resuscitation and transfer to a specialist unit. After careful assessment, accurate diagnosis and discussion, primary resection and end-to-end repair with a slide technique should always be the first option, with concomitant repair of associated cardiac anomalies. If this is impossible because of the severity of the Lesion, some form of patch tracheoptasty will be indicated. Cardiopulmonary bypass is often required. Patches include pericardium, autograft trachea, carotid artery, cartilage, and allograft trachea. Mortality ranges from 0 to 30% in the literature, which Largely comprises single-centre long-term experience. Recurrence is common and can be managed by stenting and tracheal homograft implantation. Long-term quality of life of survivors is little reported but seems good. Physiological data are tacking. To improve results, we suggest a treatment algorithm to rationalise care.

We previously demonstrated that juvenile mice exhibit transient hippocampal synaptic dysfunction after GCI, associated with reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and partial endogenous recovery over time. In this study, we tested whether delayed treatment with fluoxetine (FLX)-a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) known to enhance BDNF-TrkB signaling-could accelerate synaptic recovery. Juvenile mice underwent cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, followed by in vivo FLX or vehicle administration from postinjury days 10-13. Electrophysiological recordings on day 14 revealed that FLX restored hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in males but not females. This effect was paralleled by an increase in hippocampal BDNF expression in FLX-treated males, whereas no change was observed in females. Paired ex vivo experiments further confirmed that acute FLX exposure rescued LTP in GCI-injured male slices. These findings suggest that FLX promotes synaptic recovery through BDNF-TrkB signaling in males, while recovery in females may proceed via alternate, hormone-dependent mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the long-term effect of SUA on SCA and the possible intermediate diseases. METHODS Based on the UK Biobank cohort, the Cox proportional hazard model was applied to explore associations between SUA and SCA. Chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were selected as intermediate conditions, and a multistate model was used for trajectory analysis. RESULTS Atotal of 468,427 participants were included. During a median follow-up of 14.5 years, 2972 participants developed SCA. The hazard ratios (HRs) for SCA were 1.12 (1.08-1.15) per 1 mg/dL increment of SUA. Restricted cubic spline demonstrated a significant positive and nonlinear correlation between SUA and risk of incident SCA (P for nonlinearity < .01). Most prominently, SUA and hyperuricemia could induce SCA by promoting transitions from baseline health to chronic kidney disease/acute kidney injury (HRs 1.10 and 1.29) and then to SCA (HRs 1.15 and 1.32). Less importantly, SCA could be developed through transitions from baseline health to MACE (HRs 1.05 and 1.14) and further to SCA (HRs 1.08 and 1.25). CONCLUSION This study provides novel and compelling evidence that the long-term effect of SUA could promote the develof SCA, with renal insufficiency emerging as a more significant intermediate condition than MACE.",HEART RHYTHM,2026,"Han, YD; Li, ZK; Yao, MH; Wu, J; Xie, TE; Zhao, H; Zhang, Y; Zeng, XJ",10.1016/j.hrthm.2025.08.020,,WOS:001681958500011,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Predictors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation utilization and survival during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out and in-hospital cardiac arrest,"Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promise in managing both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in -hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods: We analyzed hospital discharge records from the National Inpatient Sample of adult individuals who underwent ECPR between 2016 and 2020. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify fa ctors influencing ECPR utilization and survival. Results: Among 1,585,960 patients (901,470 OHCA, 684,490 IHCA), ECPR utilization rates were 1 % for OHCA and 1.4 % for IHCA, with inpatient mortality rates of 52 % and 67 %, respectively. In OHCA, ECPR was more likely in patients from higher-income areas, those with Medicaid/private insurance, systolic heart failure, shockable rhythms, and Hispanic/other races but less likely in those over 65, with patients with history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, or COPD. In IHCA, ECPR was more common in larger hospitals, higher-income areas, and those with private insurance but less frequent in Black patients, those over 65, or with prior cerebrovascular accidents, COPD, diabetes, or end-stage renal disease. In OHCA ECPR, Asian race (aOR: 2.31), diabetes (aOR: 1.29), and liver disease (aOR: 1.77) predicted mortality, while shockable rhythms (aOR: 0.75), systolic hear t failure (aOR: 0.67), and treatmentin southern states (aOR: 0.72) predicted survival. In IHCA ECPR, acute myocardial infarction (aOR: 0.73) and private insurance (aOR: 0.63) were associated with improved survival, whereas liver disease (aOR: 1.59) predicted higher mortality. Conclusion: We highlight the selective nature of ECPR utilization between OHCA and IHCA and the distinct survival predictors in each setting.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Diagnosis and management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to coronary artery spasm,"Objective: The clinical features of coronary artery spasm as a cause of cardiac arrest were determined in a prospective study on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods: Coronary angiography was performed at admission in 300 consecutive patients with no obvious non-cardiac cause of OHCA. In survivors with no or minimal coronary artery stenosis, a second angiography with provocation test and electrophysiological testing were performed at I month. Results: Spasm was demonstrated in ten patients. Diagnosis was based upon (1) spontaneous spasm on the admission angiogram (3 patients), (2) transient significative ST-segment elevation at follow-up in patients with no or non-significant coronary artery lesions (4 patients) and (3) spasm during the I month provocation test (3 patients). Six patients survived at I month; spasm occurred during a new provocation test in five despite treatment with high dosage calcium channel blockers leading to coronary stenting in two, an internal cardiovertor defibrillator in one. and increased drug therapy with prolonged hospitalization in the remainder. At a mean follow-up of 55+/-27 months, no recurrent cardiac arrest occurred. Conclusion: Systematic coronary angiograms and provocation tests in survivors of OHCA allow prompt diagnosis of coronary artery spasm. Residual spasm despite treatment with calcium channel blockers is frequent. Therapy should therefore be guided by repetitive provocation tests, and seems to avoid recurrence of cardiac arrest.

Method: A retrospective study of all hanging-related OHCA in Victoria, Australia, between 2000 and 2017 was conducted. Trends in incidence, characteristics, and outcomes were assessed using linear regression and a non-parametric test for trend, as appropriate. Predictors of survival to hospital discharge were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Between 2000 and 2017, emergency medical services (EMS)-attended 3,891 cases of hanging-related OHCA, of which 876 cases (23%) received an attempted resuscitation. The overall incidence rate of EMS-attended cases was 3.8 cases per 100,000 person-years increasing from 2.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2000 to 4.7 cases in 2017 (p for trend <0.001).

In the randomized ""STERoid for OHCA"" (STEROHCA) trial, prehospital high-dose glucocorticoid decreased interleukin (IL) 6 and C-reactive protein levels following resuscitated OHCA. The aim of this predefined sub-study was to assess the inflammatory response the first three days of admission. Methods: The STEROHCA trial enrolled 137 OHCA patients randomized to either a single prehospital injection of methylprednisolone 250 mg or placebo. Inflammatory markers, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, were analyzed in plasma samples, from 0-, 24-, 48-, and 72 h post-admission. Mixed-model analyses were applied using log-transformed data to assess group differences. Results: The 137 patients included in this sub-study had a median age of 67 years (57 to 74), and the 180-day survival rates were 75% (n = 51/68) and 64% (n = 44/69) in the glucocorticoid and placebo group, respectively.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Medical Guidelines for Airline Travel: Management of In-Flight Cardiac Arrest,"INTRODUCTION: Although cardiac arrest during airline flights is relatively uncommon, the unusual setting, limited resources, and the variability of the skills in medical volunteers present unique challenges. Survival in patients who suffer a witnessed arrest with a shockable rhythm who are treated promptly has improved since the advent of widely available automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In general, the chances of survival from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are greater when ventricular fibrillation (VF) is seen as the initial rhythm or if there is return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Not all in-flight cardiac arrests are witnessed because cabin crew or fellow passengers might simply assume that the victim is sleeping. Based upon a review of the literature on resuscitation after OHCA, we recommend that automatic external defibrillators be carried on all commercial airline flights, regardless of duration. Patients presenting with shockable rhythm (e.g.,VF, unstable ventricular tachycardia) have the best prognosis for survival and usually require diversion of the aircraft for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Because diversion may require interruption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and may impact flight safety, the volunteer rescuer, cabin crew, flight crew, and medical consultation services should discuss the possible outcome and operational considerations before recommending a diversion for a patient with a nonshockable rhythm.

Preliminary evidence suggests that the timing of shock relative to the amplitude of the VF ECG waveform may affect the likelihood of resuscitation. We investigated whether the VF waveform amplitude at the time of shock (instantaneous amplitude) predicts outcome independent of other validated waveform measures.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of VF-OHCA patients >= 18 old. We evaluated three VF waveform measures for each shock: instantaneous amplitude at the time of shock, and maximum amplitude and amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) over a 3-s window preceding the shock. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to determine whether instantaneous amplitude was associated with shock-specific return of organized rhythm (ROR) or return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) independent of maximum amplitude or AMSA.Results: The 566 eligible patients received 1513 shocks, resulting in ROR of 62.0% (938/1513) and ROSC of 22.3% (337/1513). In unadjusted regression, an interquartile increase in instantaneous amplitude was associated with ROR (Odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval] = 1.27 [1.11-1.45]) and ROSC (OR = 1.27 [1.14-1.42]). However, instantaneous amplitude was not associated with ROR (OR = 1.13 [0.97-1.30]) after accounting for maximum amplitude, nor with ROR (OR = 1.00 [0.87-1.15]) or ROSC (OR = 1.05 [0.93-1.18]) after accounting for AMSA. By contrast, AMSA and maximum amplitude remained independently associated with ROR and ROSC.Conclusions: We did not observe an independent association between instantaneous amplitude and shock-specific outcomes.

However, randomized data on long-term clinical outcomes of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest in the absence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are lacking. ObjectiveTo determine whether immediate coronary angiography improves clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients after cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI, compared with a delayed coronary angiography strategy. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA prespecified analysis of a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluated 552 patients who were enrolled in 19 Dutch centers between January 8, 2015, and July 17, 2018. The study included patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm who were successfully resuscitated without signs of STEMI. Follow-up was performed at 1 year. Data were analyzed, using the intention-to-treat principle, between August 29 and October 10, 2019. InterventionsImmediate coronary angiography and PCI if indicated or coronary angiography and PCI if indicated, delayed until after neurologic recovery. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSurvival, myocardial infarction, revascularization, implantable cardiac defibrillator shock, quality of life, hospitalization for heart failure, and the composite of death or myocardial infarction or revascularization after 1 year. ResultsAt 1 year, data on 522 of 552 patients (94.6%) were available for analysis. Of these patients, 413 were men (79.1%); mean (SD) age was 65.4 (12.3) years. A total of 162 of 264 patients (61.4%) in the immediate angiography group and 165 of 258 patients (64.0%) in the delayed angiography group were alive (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63-1.28). The composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or repeated revascularization since the index hospitalization was met in 112 patients (42.9%) in the immediate group and 104 patients (40.6%) in the delayed group (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.77-1.56). No significant differences between the groups were observed for the other outcomes at 1-year follow-up. For example, the rate of ICD shocks was 20.4% in the immediate group and 16.2% in the delayed group (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.66-2.64). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this trial of patients successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without signs of STEMI, a strategy of immediate angiography was not found to be superior to a strategy of delayed angiography with respect to clinical outcomes at 1 year.

A comprehensive and coordinated approach to in-hospital management, including PCI, targeted temperature management, critical care, and hemodynamic support represents a significant critical link in the chain of survival. OHCA complicated by ACS continues to be one of the most challenging disease states facing healthcare practitioners and maintains a high mortality rate despite substantial advancements in healthcare delivery.

Pre-ECMO, 20 (20%) had a pre-existing neurologic diagnosis, 40 (40%) had cardiac arrest, and 10 of 47 (21%) children with neuroimaging had acute abnormal findings. Of 50 children eligible for follow-up at 6 or 12 months, 40 (80%) returned for at least one visit.

Thirty-four comatose survivors of cardiac arrest were randomized to receive either craniocerebral hypothermia (n = 17) or peripheral surface cooling (n = 17). Target temperature management (32-34 degrees C) was initiated within 30-120 minutes of return of spontaneous circulation and maintained for 36-48 hours. Craniocerebral hypothermia demonstrated significantly faster cooling initiation (32.9 +/- 13.5 vs. 238 +/- 25.7 minutes, p < 0.001) compared with peripheral cooling, while both methods achieved similar target temperature maintenance. The craniocerebral group showed better preservation of renal function and electrolyte stability, with significantly lower increases in serum creatinine and urea levels (p < 0.001). Hospital stays were notably shorter in the craniocerebral group (13 +/- 7 vs. 24.29 +/- 31 days, p < 0.001). While both methods achieved comparable survival rates, the craniocerebral group exhibited a lower incidence of seizures (17.6% vs. 66.6%) and improved neurological outcomes based on Cerebral Performance Category scores though not reaching statistical significance. These findings suggest that craniocerebral hypothermia offers advantages in terms of rapid cooling initiation, physiological stability, and reduced hospital stay, representing a promising alternative for targeted temperature management in post-cardiac arrest care. The enhanced practicality and comparable efficacy of this approach warrant further investigation through larger multicenter trials.",THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT,2025,"Nadir, A; Sari, M",10.1089/ther.2025.0006,,WOS:001444294400001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Extended survival and re-hospitalisation among paediatric patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for primary cardiac dysfunction,"Background: Although survival to hospital discharge among children requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for medical and surgical cardio-circulatory failure has been reported in international registries, extended survival and re-hospitalisation rates have not been well described in the literature. Material and methods: This is a single-institution, retrospective review of all paediatric patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for primary cardiac dysfunction over a 5-year period. Results: A total of 74 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs in 68 patients were identified, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years from hospital discharge. Overall, 66% of patients were decannulated alive and 25 patients (37%) survived to discharge. There were three late deaths at 5 months, 20 months, and 6.8 years from discharge. Of the hospital survivors, 88% required re-hospitalisation, with 63% of re-admissions for cardiac indications. The median number of hospitalisations per patient per year was 0.62, with the first re-admission occurring at a mean time of 9 months after discharge from the index hospitalisation. In all, 38% of patients required further cardiac surgery. Conclusions: Extended survival rates for paediatric hospital survivors of cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for medical and post-surgical indications are encouraging. However, re-hospitalisation within the first year following hospital discharge is common, and many patients require further cardiac surgery. Although re-admission hospital mortality is low, longer-term follow-up of quality-of-life indicators is required.",CARDIOLOGY IN THE YOUNG,2013,"Erwin, N; Zuk, J; Kaufman, J; Pan, ZX; Carpenter, E; Mitchell, MB; da Cruz, EM",10.1017/S1047951112000777,,WOS:000318623000013,A

To date, the EuReCa ONE and EuReCa TWO studies have involved around 28 countries, with population covered increasing from the first to the second study. The aim of the EuReCa THREE study is to build on previous work and to support the promotion of quality data collection on OHCA throughout Europe. Methods/design: EuReCa THREE will be the third prospective cohort study on epidemiology of OHCA and will involve around 30 European coun-tries. The study will be conducted between 1st September and 30th November 2022. Data will be collected on cardiac arrest cases attended, resus-citation attempted, patient and cardiac arrest event characteristics and outcomes (including return of spontaneous circulation, status on hospital arrival and discharge). A particular focus for EuReCa THREE will be to describe key time intervals in OHCA management; time from call to EMS arrival on scene, time from cardiac arrest to start CPR, time from EMS arrival to delivery of patient to hospital. EuReCa THREE was registered with the German Registry of Clinical Trials Registration Number: DRKS00028591 searchable via WHO meta -registry (https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/).

However, ECPR requires specific materials and highly skilled personnel, and it is unclear whether increased survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) justify these costs.Methods and results This cost-effectiveness study was part of the INCEPTION study, a multi-centre, pragmatic randomized trial comparing hospital-based ECPR to conventional CPR (CCPR) in patients with refractory OHCA in 10 cardiosurgical centres in the Netherlands. We analysed healthcare costs in the first year and measured HRQOL using the EQ-5D-5L at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-effectiveness planes, and acceptability curves were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for per-protocol and as-treated subgroups as well as imputed productivity loss in deceased patients. In total, 132 patients were enrolled: 62 in the CCPR and 70 in the ECPR group. The difference in mean costs after 1 year was <euro>5109 (95% confidence interval -7264 to 15 764). Mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) after 1 year was 0.15 in the ECPR group and 0.11 in the CCPR group, resulting in an ICER of <euro>121 643 per additional QALY gained. The acceptability curve shows that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of <euro>80.000, the probability of ECPR being cost-effective compared with CCPR is 36%.

The objective of this study was to estimate the decline of insulin secretion in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (T2D-patients) by glucagon injection over an observation period of more than 10 years. Thirty-three T2D-patients were followed for 10.4 +/- 1.4 years. Fasting C-peptide immunoreactivity (FCPR), the 6 min value of CPR after glucagon injection (6MCPR), and the increment of CPR (Delta CPR) were measured at baseline and follow-up. FCPR, 6MCPR, Delta CPR were significantly lower at follow-up than at baseline (p<0.05, p<0.005, and p<0.0005, respectively). The annual change of Delta CPR was significantly (p<0.05) greater than the annual change of FCPR (-0.062 +/- 0.076 ng/mL/year and -0.025 +/- 0.067 ng/mL/year, respectively). In contrast, CPR-index (an index of beta-cell function) and SUIT-index (secretory units of islets in transplantation) calculated based on fasting blood samples were unaltered. The annual changes of FCPR, 6MCPR, and Delta CPR were negatively correlated with the FCPR, 6MCPR, and Delta CPR values at baseline, respectively. Duration of diabetes, BMI, diabetic retinopathy, and secondary sulfonylurea failure at baseline were not correlated with the annual changes of FCPR, 6MCPR, and Delta CPR. In conclusion, our longitudinal observations suggest that beta-cell function progressively declines in Japanese T2D-patients. The annual declines of Delta CPR were more prominent than the annual declines of FCPR. Delta CPR after glucagon injection may be more useful for estimating individual longitudinal insulin secretion than fasting blood samples.",ENDOCRINE JOURNAL,2013,"Fukui, T; Oono, K; Hara, N; Yamamoto, T; Nagashima, M; Naito, H; Hirano, T",10.1507/endocrj.EJ12-0357,,WOS:000321727300003,A

Establishing prompt vascular access facilitates resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). While intraosseous access may decrease the time to vascular access, the impact on clinical outcomes in OHCA is unclear. Therefore, we aim to compare the effect of intraosseous (IO) versus intravenous (IV) vascular access on clinical outcomes after OHCA resuscitation. Methods. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) obtained from PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science until January 2025. Using Stata MP v. 17, we used the fixed-effects model to report dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). PROSPERO ID: CRD42024627354. Results. Four RCTs and 9475 patients were included. There was no difference between both groups regarding the prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (RR: 0.97, 95% CI [0.91, 1.03], p = 0.33), maintained ROSC (RR: 0.94, 95% CI [0.87, 1.01], p = 0.09), survival to discharge (RR: 1.03 with 95% CI [0.88, 1.21], p = 0.71), 30-day survival (RR: 0.98, 95% CI [0.82, 1.17], p = 0.79), or favorable neurological recovery (RR: 1.07, 95% CI [0.90, 1.29], p = 0.44). However, IO access significantly increased first-attempt access (RR: 1.24, 95% CI [1.19, 1.29], p < 0.001), decreased time to vascular access (MD: -0.24 min with 95% CI [-0.48, -0.01], p = 0.04), and decreased time to drug administration (MD: -0.38, 95% CI [-0.66, -0.10], p = 0.01).

We investigated the effect of metformin pretreatment on brain injury and survival in a rat CA/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) model. Methods and results After 14 days of pretreatment with metformin, rats underwent 9 minutes of asphyxia CA/CPR. Survival was evaluated 7 days after restoration of spontaneous circulation; neurological deficit scale (NDS) score was evaluated at days 1, 3, and 7. Proteins related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and autophagy were measured using immunoblotting. Seven-day survival was significantly improved and NDS score was significantly improved in rats pretreated with metformin. Metformin enhanced AMPK-induced autophagy activation. AMPK and autophagy inhibitors removed the metformin neuroprotective effect. Although metformin inhibited the ER stress response, its inhibitory effect was weaker than 4-PBA. Conclusion In a CA/CPR rat model, 14-day pretreatment with metformin has a neuroprotective effect.

Two CPR approaches are commonly utilized, standard (S-CPR) with mouth-to-mouth breathing and compression-only (CO-CPR). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare clinical outcomes associated with S-CPR versus CO-CPR in OHCA. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Implementation of Basic Life Support training in schools: a randomised controlled trial evaluating self-regulated learning as alternative training concept,"Background The Kids save lives statement recommends annual Basic Life Support (BLS) training for school children but the implementation is challenging. Trainings should be easy to realise and every BLS training should be as effective as possible to prepare learners for lifesaving actions. Preparedness implies skills and positive beliefs in the own capability (high self-efficacy). Methods This randomized controlled cluster study investigates, if self-regulated learning promotes self-efficacy and long-term retention of practical BLS skills. Students in the age of 12 years participated in a practical training in BLS and a scenario testing of skills. In the control group the practical training was instructor-led. In the intervention group the students self-regulated their learning processes and feedback was provided by the peer-group. The primary outcome self-efficacy for helping in cardiac arrest after the training and 9 months later was analysed using a multilevel mixed model. Means and pass-rates for BLS skills were secondary outcomes. Results Contrary to the assumptions, this study could not measure a higher self-efficacy for helping in cardiac arrest of the students participating in the intervention (n = 307 students) compared to the control group (n = 293 students) after training and at the follow-up (mean difference: 0.11 points, 95% CI: - 0.26 to 0.04, P = 0.135). The odds to pass all items of the BLS exam was not significantly different between the groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.52, p = 0.533). Self-regulated learning was associated with a higher performance of male students in the BLS exam (mean score: 7.35) compared to females of the intervention (female: 7.05) and compared to males of the control (7.06). Conclusion This study could not resolve the question, if self-regulated learning in peer-groups improves self-efficacy for helping in cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Identifying patients at risk of futile resuscitation: palliative care indicators in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"Objectives Patients with indicators for palliative care, such as those with advanced life-limiting conditions, are at risk of futile cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Patients at risk of futile CPR could benefit from anticipatory care planning (ACP); however, the proportion of OHCA patients with indicators for palliative care is unknown. This study quantifies the extent of palliative care indicators and risk of CPR futility in OHCA patients. Methods A retrospective medical record review was performed on all OHCA patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) in Edinburgh, Scotland in 2015. The risk of CPR futility was stratified using the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool. Patients with 0-2 indicators had a 'low risk' of futile CPR; 3-4 indicators had an 'intermediate risk'; 5+ indicators had a 'high risk'. Results Of the 283 OHCA patients, 12.4% (35) had a high risk of futile CPR, while 16.3% (46) had an intermediate risk and 71.4% (202) had a low risk. 84.0% (68) of intermediate-to-high risk patients were pronounced dead in the ED or ED step-down ward; only 2.5% (2) of these patients survived to discharge. Conclusions Up to 30% of OHCA patients are being subjected to advanced resuscitation despite having at least three indicators for palliative care. More than 80% of patients with an intermediate-to-high risk of CPR futility are dying soon after conveyance to hospital, suggesting that ACP can benefit some OHCA patients.

Life situation of patients and families after treatment,"Background: About half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors experience secondary anoxic brain damage. Neurological outcome can be influenced by rehabilitative treatment approaches, but the nature and severity of persistent disabilities remain unclear. The aim of the study was to explore persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms, global function and life situation of these patients, and to evaluate quality of life in families. Methods: 25 months after inpatient rehabilitation, 12 individuals (mean age = 51 years; ten M: two F) attended a cross-sectional interdisciplinary follow-up assessment with their carers. Function was investigated by clinical rating scales, neuropsychological standard tests, and clinical psychological inventories. Family members were asked about quality of life and satisfaction with social support. Results: All patients had deficits in at least one or more cognitive areas such as orientation, memory, alertness, and awareness. Three different clinical syndromes were observed: very severe intellectual and physical impairment, (two), mild to moderate dementia, (five), and amnesic syndrome, (five). Prevalence of multiple disabilities, was high. A striking discrepancy was found between self and proxy rating of disabilities (P < 0.01). Family members faced dramatically altered life situations after CA; 60% of spouses suffered from psychosomatic problems, 50% complained of lack of social support. Conclusion: Despite optimal in-hospital treatment, severe anoxic brain damage resulted in permanent cognitive decline, impaired awareness and self care ability.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,A comprehensive description of self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors,"Background Self-reported health and life satisfaction are considered important outcomes in people surviving cardiac arrest. However, most previous studies have reported limited aspects on health, often based on composite scores, and few studies have focused on life satisfaction. Investigating health aspects with a broad and detailed perspective is important to increase the knowledge of life after cardiac arrest from the perspective of survivors. In addition, the knowledge of potential differences in health among survivors related to place of arrest (in-hospital cardiac arrest; IHCA or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; OHCA) is scarce. The aim was to describe and compare self-reported health and life satisfaction in IHCA and OHCA survivors. Methods This observational cross-sectional study included adult cardiac arrest survivors six months after resuscitation, treated at five Swedish hospitals between 2013 and 2018. Participants received a study specific questionnaire including Health Index (HI), EQ-5D 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Minimal Insomnia Sleeping Scale (MISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). In order to present characteristics descriptive statistics were applied. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fishers' exact test were used to compare differences in self-reported health and life satisfaction between in-hospital- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors Results In total, 212 survivors participated. Based on scale scores and general measures, the median scores of health and life satisfaction among survivors were high: HI total = 29, EQ VAS = 80, and SWLS = 20. According to HI, most problems were reported for tiredness (37.3 %) and strength (26.4 %), while pain/discomfort (57.5 %) and anxiety/depression (42.5 %) where most common according to EQ-5D-5L. Except for EQ-5D-5L mobility (p = 0.023), MSPSS significant other (p = 0.036), and MSPSS family (p = 0.043), no health differences in relation to place of arrest were identified. Conclusions Although general health and life satisfaction were good among cardiac arrest survivors, several prevalent health problems were reported regardless of place of arrest.

We aimed to evaluate prehospital CPR quality during scene evacuation and early ambulance transport in patients with OHCA according to the type of cardiac arrest location.Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study enrolled patients with non-traumatic adult OHCA in Seoul between July 2020 and March 2022. Prehospital CPR quality data extracted from defibrillators were merged with the national OHCA database. The location of cardiac arrest was categorized into two groups (residential and non-residential). CPR quality indices including no-flow (any pause >1.5 s) fraction were compared according to the type of arrest location at each minute of EMS scene evacuation and early ambulance transport (5 min prior to 5 min after ambulance departure).Results: A total of 1,222 OHCAs were enrolled in the final analysis after serial exclusion.

This new device enhances negative intrathoracic pressure during chest wall recoil or the decompression phase, leading to improved vital organ perfusion during both standard CPR and active compression-decompression CPR. With active compression-decompression CPR, addition of the impedance threshold valve results in sustained diastolic pressures of >55 mm Hg in patients in cardiac arrest, The new valve shows promise for patients in asystole or shock refractory ventricular fibrillation, when enhanced return of blood flow to the chest is needed to ""prime the pump.""

The possibility of brain cell death increases, and the likelihood of a ""good"" outcome decreases with time. The most prominent impairments involve memory and attentional difficulties. Limited research and few cases have shown positive cognitive results following an OHCA to the extent that this case study depicts. Method The current case study presents a right-handed male in his late 40s, with master's and law degrees, and a high-level functioning in the workplace who experienced an OHCA. He was treated for his OHCA and subsequently underwent neuropsychological testing less than 2 months following his hospital discharge. Results Expected results suggest impairments in key cognitive areas; however, a neuropsychological exam less than 2-months post-incident, testing pre-morbid IQ, overall cognitive ability, processing speed, attention, executive functioning, language, visuospatial abilities, and memory; each showing normal or better results. Additionally, self and collateral report questionnaires examining cognitive and emotional functioning reported no difficulties and no major changes since his cardiac arrest. Conclusions We speculate that this patient's exceptional outcome might be due to his cognitive reserve, and the immediateness of his intervention (5-10 min of CPR and return-of-spontaneous-circulation from an AED shock) and use of a saline cooling procedure upon arrival to the hospital. Overall, we highlight a patient with a remarkable cognitive outcome, utilizing data from neuropsychological testing within 2-months post-incident, and propose protective factors in neuropsychological functioning following an OHCA.",APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT,2023,"Bankert, MJ; Cole, RC; Puente, AN",10.1080/23279095.2021.2004145,,WOS:000720574500001,A

Nevertheless, the specific process and essential molecules responsible for its development are not fully understood. Profiling based on competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) has been implicated in the onset and progression of neurological disorders, yet its role in PCABI remains unclear. In this study, we performed RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in the rat model for cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR).

This narrative review synthesizes the current advancements and challenges in AI/ML-enhanced resuscitation science. Methods: A targeted literature search was conducted in Web of Science for the period 2018-2025 using the keywords ""artificial intelligence"" and ""cardiopulmonary resuscitation"". The search identified studies addressing AI/ML applications across the resuscitation pathway, which were reviewed and categorized according to the American Heart Association's Chain of Survival-prevention and preparedness, activation of the emergency response system, high-quality CPR including early defibrillation, advanced resuscitation interventions, post-cardiac arrest care, and recovery. Results: The literature demonstrates substantial promise for AI/ML in several domains: (1) early recognition and timely activation of emergency medical services through real-time detection algorithms; (2) optimization of high-quality CPR, including feedback systems, automated assessment of chest compressions, and prediction of defibrillation success; (3) support for advanced resuscitation interventions, such as rhythm classification, prognostication, and intra-arrest decision support; (4) post-cardiac arrest care, including outcome prediction and neuroprognostication; and (5) integrative and cross-domain approaches that link multiple phases of resuscitation into end-to-end AI-supported systems. Emerging work also highlights the role of AI in education and training, with applications in simulation, assessment, and skill reinforcement. Conclusions: AI/ML technologies hold significant potential to augment clinical performance across all links of the Chain of Survival.

However, CPR is often not provided, even by people with training. Low confidence, perceptions of risks and high emotion can prevent initiation of CPR. Behaviour-change techniques may be helpful in increasing CPR rates.Aim: To pilot a text-message behavioural intervention designed to increase intentions to initiate CPR, explore participant responses and pilot meth-ods for future randomised controlled trial of effectiveness.Methods: A 'before and after' pilot study plus qualitative interviews was undertaken. Participants were lay-people who had undertaken CPR training in previous 2 years.Participants were sent an intervention, comprising 35 text-messages containing 14 behaviour-change techniques, to their mobile phone over 4- 6 weeks.Primary outcome: intentions to initiate CPR assessed in response to 4 different scenarios.Secondary outcomes: theory-based determinants of intention (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy) and self -rated competence.Results: 20 participants (6 female, 14 male), aged 20-84 provided baseline data. 17 received the full suite of 35 text messages.15 provided follow-up data. Intentions to perform CPR in scenarios where CPR was indicated were high at baseline and increased (18.1 +/- 3.2-19.5 +/- 1.8/21) after the intervention, as did self-efficacy and self-rated competency. Self-efficacy, attitudes, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms were pos-itively correlated with intentions. Qualitative data suggest the intervention was perceived as useful.

We aimed to determine the incidence of VA-ECMO use after heart transplantation (HT), to assess early- and long-term outcomes and to assess risk factors for the need for VA-ECMO and early mortality in these patients. Methods: We included adults who underwent heart transplantation at 3 cardiac centres who met the most recent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation definition of graft dysfunction (GD) over a 10-year period. Pre-transplant, intraoperative and posttransplant characteristics of the heart recipients as well as donor characteristics were analyzed and compared among recipients with GD treated with and without VA-ECMO. Results: There were 135 patients with GD in this study, of whom 66 were treated with VA-ECMO and 69 were not. The mean follow-up averaged 81.2 months (standard deviation 36 mo, range 0-184 mo); follow-up was complete in 100% of patients. The overall incidence of GD (30%) and of VA-ECMO use increased over the study period. We did not identify any predictive pre-transplantation factors for VA-ECMO use, but patients who required VA-ECMO had higher serum lactate levels and higher inotropes doses after HT. The overall survival rates were 83% and 42% at 1 year and 78% and 40% at 5 years among patients who received only medical treatment and those who received VA-ECMO, respectively. Delayed initiation of VA-ECMO and postoperative bleeding were strongly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: The incidence of GD increased over the study period, and the need for VA-ECMO among patients with GD remains difficult to predict.

However, the use of long-term extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in this setting is not widely established, and rewarming is often achieved by short-term cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) treatment. Thus, we sought to add our experience with this means of support as a bridge-to-recovery or to-decision. This retrospective single-center study analyzes the outcome of 11 children (median 23 months, minimum-maximum 3 months-6.5 years) who experienced drowning and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between 2005 and 2016 and who were supported by veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), CPB, or first CPB then ECMO. All but one incident took place in sweet water. Submersion time ranged between 10 and 50 minutes (median 23 minutes), water temperature between 2 degrees C and 28 degrees C (median 14 degrees C), and body core temperature upon arrival in the emergency department between 20 degrees C and 34 degrees C (median 25 degrees C). Nine patients underwent ongoing CPR from the scene until ECMO or CPB initiation in the operating room. The duration of ECMO or CPB before successful weaning/therapy withdrawal ranged between 2 and 322 hours (median 19 hours). A total of four patients (36%) survived neurologically mildly or not affected after 4 years of follow-up. The data indicate that survival is likely related to a shorter submersion time and lower water temperature. Resuscitation of pediatric patients after drowning has a poor outcome.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Multi-centre implementation of an Educational program to improve the Cardiac Arrest diagnostic accuracy of ambulance Telecommunicators and survival outcomes for sudden cardiac arrest victims: the EduCATe study design and methodology,"Background Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of mortality in Canada, resulting in more than 35,000 deaths annually. Most cardiac arrest victims collapse in their own home (85% of the time) and 50% are witnessed by a family member or bystander. Survivors have a quality of life similar to the general population, but the overall survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) rarely exceeds 8%. Victims are almost four times more likely to survive when receiving bystander CPR, but bystander CPR rates have remained low in Canada over the past decade, not exceeding 15-25% until recently. Telecommunication-assisted CPR instructions have been shown to significantly increase bystander CPR rates, but agonal breathing may be misinterpreted as a sign of life by 9-1-1 callers and telecommunicators, and is responsible for as much as 50% of missed OHCA diagnoses. We sought to improve the ability and speed with which ambulance telecommunicators can recognize OHCA over the phone, initiate timely CPR instructions, and improve survival. Methods In this multi-center national study, we will implement and evaluate an educational program developed for ambulance telecommunicators using a multiple baseline interrupted time-series design. We will compare outcomes 12 months before and after the implementation of a 20-min theory-based educational video addressing barriers to recognition of OHCA while in the presence of agonal breathing. Participating Canadian sites demonstrated prior ability to collect standardized data on OHCA. Data will be collected from eligible 9-1-1 recordings, paramedic documentation and hospital medical records. Eligible cases will include suspected or confirmed OHCA of presumed cardiac origin in patients of any age with attempted resuscitation. Discussion The ability of telecommunication-assisted CPR instructions to improve bystander CPR and survival rates for OHCA victims is undeniable. The ability of telecommunicators to recognize OHCA over the phone is unequivocally impeded by relative lack of training on agonal breathing, and reluctance to initiate CPR instructions when in doubt. Our pilot data suggests the potential impact of this project will be to increase absolute OHCA recognition and bystander CPR rates by at least 10%, and absolute out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival by 5% or more.",BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2021,"Vaillancourt, C; Charette, M; Naidoo, S; Taljaard, M; Church, M; Hodges, S; Leduc, S; Christenson, J; Cheskes, S; Dainty, K; Feldman, M; Goldstein, J; Tallon, J; Helmer, J; Sibley, A; Spidel, M; Blanchard, I; Garland, J; Cyr, K; Brehaut, J; Dorian, P; Lacroix, C; Zambon, S; Thiruganasambandamoorthy, V",10.1186/s12873-021-00416-4,,WOS:000625461600001,A

Recent findings Two large clinical trials recently made the roles of adrenaline and antiarrhythmic drugs clearer. Adrenaline leads to a substantially higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation and a moderate increase in survival. Amiodarone and lidocaine increase short-term outcomes, and point estimates suggest a small but uncertain effect on long-term survival. There is still a lack of high-quality evidence for other drugs during cardiac arrest such as bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium, but small-scale randomized clinical trials show no effect. A promising entity may be the combination of vasopressin and glucocorticoids, but external validation of preliminary trials is needed. Data from observational studies and subgroup analyses of trials generally favor intravenous over intraosseous access, while the latter remains a reasonable alternative. Guidelines for the above-mentioned drugs have been updated yet remain largely unchanged over the last decades.

However, the long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis and cognitive and learning abilities are still uncertain. ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the neurodevelopment and learning abilities of 7-year-old children born prematurely, and their parents' feelings at 8 years of age. Patients and methodsData from children born before 33 weeks gestation in a level III maternity hospital and involved in a regional follow-up network were analyzed at 7 years of age. Neurodevelopmental abnormalities were defined as cerebral palsy, hearing or visual impairment, and/or behavioral abnormalities. School performance was evaluated by the EDA test. A parents' questionnaire assessed their feelings about the child's and family's quality of life at 8 years of age. ResultsAt 7 years of age, 51% of the 238 children presented neurodevelopmental abnormalities: 3.3% with cerebral palsy, 6.2% with hearing impairments, 50.7% with visual impairments, and 11.3% with behavioral disorders. The children with neurodevelopmental abnormalities had lower gestational age (29.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 30.0 +/- 2.1 weeks, p = 0.003) and more EEG abnormalities during the neonatal period (31.1% vs. 19.8%, p = 0.048) than the children without abnormalities. Ninety-four percent of the children with abnormalities were enrolled in normal schools, 33% with special support. In the overall cohort, 31% of the children had all academic performance scores in the normal range of the reference population. At 8 years old, 39% of the parents of children with neurodevelopmental abnormalities felt that their child's situation significantly impacted their quality of life compared to 14% of parents of children without neurodevelopmental abnormality (p = 0.022).

Prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) use are major contributors in the ""chain of survival "" for OHCA. the response of a community plays a key role in determining the outcomes in OHCA. The outcomes of OHCA are affected by health inequalities in bystander CPR and AED use, due to factors such as differences in sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status amongst others. Literature shows patients from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to have risk factors for a cardiac arrest and are therefore more likely to have OHCA. Studies have also reported lower rates of bystander AED use in females compared to males. Targeting deprived areas with tailored training and access to AEDs can be beneficial in improving CPR outcomes in communities. Due to the physical nature of CPR maneuvers, age and frailty of the patient can both impact the outcome of the resuscitation. Environmental factors affecting AED use include availability, visibility, accessibility, support, extra equipment, training materials, staffing, and awareness. Education should focus on areas such as conducting BLS on both male and female patients, recognizing cardiac arrest, tailoring BLS to difference ages as well as provision for training in different languages, including sign language.

Quality of life was then compared with reference values (patients with cardiovascular diseases, patients with ischemic heart disease, ICU-survivor patients at 36 months after discharge, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with V-A ECMO). Results: Among 45 survivors, 25 patients completed the SF-36 form with a mean time for assessing quality of life of 6.9 f 2.3 years. Sub-scores were globally comparable with those observed in referent cohorts. Discussion: Cardiac arrest marks the beginning of a medical journey that includes intensive care management and the onset of cardiac disease, often of ischemic origin. Our data suggest that quality of life of patients treated with V-A ECMO for cardiac arrest is comparable to those reported in referent cohorts (ICU-survivors, patients with cardiovascular diseases of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with mechanical circulatory support). Conclusion: Survivor patients who experienced cardiac arrest and treated with V-A ECMO presented a good long-term quality of life. Decision regarding V-A ECMO implantation should not be limited by concerns about patients' future quality of life. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Acute esophageal necrosis following cardiac arrest: A rare and lethal syndrome with diagnostic challenges,"Introduction and clinical relevance: Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is a condition characterized by the necrosis of the distal portion of the esophageal mucosa. Risk factors predisposing to this condition are associated to compromised vascular perfusion ( e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, advanced age, and hypertension, shock states). Complications of AEN can be severe including UGI stricture, perforation and overall increased mortality. The true incidence of AEN remains uncertain due to potential subclincal presentations and early resolution. Case presentation: The case outlined involves a 66 -years -old obese male with history of alcoholism and lymphedema of the left leg who presented to the emergency department with hematemesis, haemodynamic instability and impaired consciousness. Shortly after initial assessment, the patient went into cardiac arrest with pulse -less electrical activity (PEA). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved following instigation of ALS protocol, fluid resuscitation and the administration of a total of 5 mg of adrenaline. Following stabilization, a CT scan was performed which reported a moderately enlarged esophagus with a thickened wall, liquid hypodense material within the esophagus and stomach, and liver cirrhosis. The emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) revealed extensive mucosal findings indicative of diffuse necrosis with initial scarring, which was later diagnosed as AEN. The patient unfortunately deceased in ICU after developing progression of the AEN, post -cardiac arrest syndrome and liver failure. Clinical discussion: The presented case highlights several crucial clinical issues and management problems related to AEN. To diagnose AEN, EGDS is still the gold -standard since it allows direct inspection of the esophageal mucosal layer. The management of AEN necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that includes aggressive resuscitation, treatment of underlying comorbidities, and supportive care ( e.g. proton pump inhibitors). The mortality rate for AEN remains high despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment highlighting the need to recognize this condition early and intervene promptly in the patients affected. Moreover, long-term sequelae like stricture formation of the esophagus and impaired esophageal motility may contribute to morbidity requiring continuos monitoring. Therefore, to optimize outcomes while reducing complications among affected patients, prompt identification associated with appropriate medical measures are essential. More research needs to be done aiming to better understand the pathophysiology of AEN thereby identifying strategies for its prevention or cure. Conclusions: AEN is a rare syndrome characterized by upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hypoxic damage of the esophageal mucosa, often associated with ischemia, gastric outlet obstruction, and compromised protective barriers. Treatment involves aggressive resuscitation, proton pump inhibitors, and monitoring for infection or perforation. However, despite intensive efforts, the mortality rate for AEN remains high at 32 %.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS,2024,"Roman-Pognuz, E; Rigutti, S; Colussi, G; Lena, E; Bonsano, M; Lucangelo, U",10.1016/j.ijscr.2024.109751,,WOS:001248727500001,A

A prospective study,"Objective: To evaluate the quality of life of survivors of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and to correlate quality of life with clinically important parameters. Methods: Cohort followed at least six months after hospital discharge. Eligible patients had survived to hospital discharge after sudden cardiac arrest in 1) EDs, wards, and intensive care units of five university hospitals and 2) all locations outside hospitals in two midsized cities. Of 126 patients discharged alive, 30 died before they could be interviewed. Of the 96 patients remaining, 86 (90% of available patients, 68% of survivors to discharge) completed the interview. Quality of life was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, which describes health as a utility score on a scale from perfect health (equal to 1.0) to death (equal to 0.) Results: Mean age (+/-SD) of interviewed survivors was 65 +/- 14 years, and 47 (55%) were male; mean time between collapse and initiation of CPR was 2.2 +/- 2.6 minutes. Mean utility was 0.72 (+/-0.22). Utilities were significantly higher among patients who had a shorter duration of resuscitation (mean = 0.81 for those who received less than 2 minutes of CPR, 0.76 for those who received 3 to 10 minutes, and 0.65 for others, p = 0.05, r(2) = 0.07).

Methods: The REVIVAL study was designed as a multicenter cohort study of OHCA survivors in which survivors self-reported the IES-R. A subset of survivors underwent the clinician-rated Acute Stress Disorder Interview during hospitalization. Psychometric evaluation of the IES-R included reliability and validity testing. Structural validity was assessed using factor analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve were used to evaluate the discriminative ability of different IES-R thresholds in classifying probable Acute Stress Disorder, as determined by interview. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each cut-off value. The best performing IES-R threshold was applied to the total population to examine prevalence of probable Acute Stress Disorder. Results: Overall, 244 survivors completed the IES-R, out of which 106 completed the Acute Stress Disorder Interview. Good internal consistency and convergent validity of the IES-R were observed. Factor analysis supported the original three-factor structure of the IES-R. An IES-R total cut-off score of >= 30 showed the best sensitivity-to-specificity ratio; the scale correctly classified 77% of the survivors with a sensitivity rate of 100% and a specificity rate of 75% (n = 106).

Nevertheless, OHCA survivors have residual anoxia/reperfusion brain damage and associated neurological impairment resulting in poor quality of life. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or targeted temperature management has proven effective in improving post-cardiac arrest (CA) neurological outcomes, yet considering the substantial healthcare costs and resources involved, there is an urgent need for alternative treatment strategies that are crucial to alleviate brain injury and promote recovery of neurological function after CA. In this review, we searched PubMed for the latest preclinical or clinical studies (2016-2023) utilizing gas-mediated, pharmacological, or stem cell-based neuroprotective approaches after CA. Preclinical studies utilizing various gases (nitric oxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, argon, and xenon), pharmacological agents targeting specific CA-related pathophysiology, and stem cells have shown promising results in rodent and porcine models of CA. Although inhaled gases and several pharmacological agents have entered clinical trials, most have failed to demonstrate therapeutic effects in CA patients. To date, stem cell therapies have not been reported in clinical trials for CA. A relatively small number of preclinical stem-cell studies with subtle therapeutic benefits and unelucidated mechanistic explanations warrant the need for further preclinical studies including the improvement of their therapeutic potential.

Although advances in early recognition and evidence-based management have improved survival, many patients experience long-term cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments collectively known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These sequelae often extend to families and caregivers (PICS-F), resulting in lasting declines in quality of life. Recovery from sepsis represents a continuum that begins during intensive care and extends into survivorship. Decisions regarding analgesia, sedation, delirium prevention, mobilization, and family engagement shape this recovery trajectory. The ABCDEF bundle provides an evidence-based framework to mitigate these long-term effects through structured approaches to pain control, paired awakening and breathing trials, targeted sedation, early mobility, and family involvement. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on PICS in sepsis and septic shock and examines how implementation of the ABCDEF bundle across the continuum of care can reduce the incidence and severity of post-ICU impairments.

This study aimed at determining which geriatric and ICU parameters were associated with in-hospital and long-term mortality in this population. Methods We conducted a prospective multicentric observational cohort study, including patients aged 75 years and older requiring mechanical ventilation, admitted between September 2012 and December 2013 into ICU of 13 French hospitals. Comprehensive geriatric assessment at ICU admission and ICU usual parameters were registered in a standardized manner. Survival was recorded and comprehensive geriatric assessment was updated after 1 year during a dedicated home visit. Results 501 patients were analyzed. 108 patients (21.6%) died during the hospital stay. One-year survival rate was 53.8% (IC 95% [49.2%; 58.2%]). Factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality were higher acute illness severity score, resuscitated cardiac arrest as primary ICU diagnosis, perception of anxiety and low quality of life by the proxy, and living in a chronic care facility before ICU admission. Among patients alive at hospital discharge, factors associated with increased 1-year mortality in multivariate analysis were longer duration of mechanical ventilation, all primary ICU diagnoses other than septic shock, a Katz-activities of daily living (ADL) score below 5 and living in a chronic care facility before ICU admission. Among the 163 survivors at 1 year who received a second comprehensive geriatric assessment, the ADL score (functional abilities) showed a significant but moderate decline over time, whereas the Mini-Zarit score (family burden) improved. No significant change in patients' place of life was observed after 1 year, and quality of life was reported as happy-to-very-happy in 88% of survivors.

However, the combination of hypothermic target temperature management (TTM) and hydrogen inhalation on outcomes is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of hydrogen inhalation and hypothermic TTM on outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). DESIGN:Post hoc analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING:Fifteen Japanese ICUs. PATIENTS:Cardiogenic OHCA enrolled in the HYBRID II trial. INTERVENTIONS:Hydrogen mixed oxygen (hydrogen group) versus oxygen alone (control group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:TTM was performed at a target temperature of 32-34 degrees C (TTM32-TTM34) or 35-36 degrees C (TTM35-TTM36) per the institutional protocol. The association between hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 and 90-day good neurologic outcomes was analyzed using generalized estimating equations. The 90-day survival was compared between the hydrogen and control groups under TTM32-TTM34 and TTM35-TTM36, respectively. The analysis included 72 patients (hydrogen [n = 39] and control [n = 33] groups) with outcome data. TTM32-TTM34 was implemented in 25 (64%) and 24 (73%) patients in the hydrogen and control groups, respectively (p = 0.46). Under TTM32-TTM34, 17 (68%) and 9 (38%) patients achieved good neurologic outcomes in the hydrogen and control groups, respectively (relative risk: 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.66], p < 0.05). Hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 was independently associated with good neurologic outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 16.10 [95% CI, 1.88-138.17], p = 0.01). However, hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 did not improve survival compared with TTM32-TTM34 alone (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22 [95% CI, 0.05-1.06], p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS:Hydrogen + TTM32-TTM34 was associated with improved neurologic outcomes after cardiogenic OHCA compared with TTM32-TTM34 monotherapy.

The no and low-flow time (NLT), the interval from collapse to reperfusion to starting ECMO or to the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in CCPR, is associated with the neurological outcome of OHCA. Because the effects of target temperature management (TTM) on the outcomes of ECPR are unclear, we compared the neurological outcomes of OHCA between ECPR and CCPR without TTM. Methods We performed retrospective subanalyses of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry. Witnessed cases of adult cardiogenic OHCA without TTM were selected. We performed univariate, multivariable and propensity score analyses to compare the neurological outcomes after ECPR or CCPR in all eligible patients and in patients with NLT of > 30 min or > 45 min. Results We analysed 2585 cases. Propensity score analysis showed negative result in all patients (odds ratio 0.328 [95% confidence interval 0.141-0.761],P= 0.010).

Overall survival rates remain low, and most studies indicate that around 1 out 10 will survive to 30 days. Amongst the strongest factors associated with survival in OHCA is first recorded rhythm amendable to defibrillation, early defibrillation and prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Overall, CPR started prior to EMS arrival has repeatedly been shown to be associated with survival rates 2-3 times higher compared with no such initiation. The primary goal of CPR is to generate sufficient blood flow to vital organs, mainly the brain and heart, until restoration of spontaneous circulation can be achieved. Barriers to the initiation of CPR by bystanders in OHCA include fear of being incapable, causing harm, and transmission of infectious diseases. Partly due to these barriers, and low rates of CPR, the concept of CPR with compression only was proposed as a simpler form of resuscitation with the aim to be more widely accepted by the public in the 1990s. But how reliable is the evidence supporting this simpler form of CPR, and are the outcomes after CO-CPR comparable to standard CPR?",JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE,2021,"Riva, G; Hollenberg, J",10.1111/joim.13260,,WOS:000625998800001,A

Characteristics and outcomes of each OHCA were compared with logistic regression according to sex and time (defined in two-year periods).Results: 32,502 OHCAs were included (69.7% male). Both bystander CPR and defibrillation rates increased for females over time (p < 0.0001). There was no sex disparity in receipt of bystander CPR after adjustment for baseline differences. Females were less likely than males to receive bystander defibrillation, with sex disparity increasing from 2010 onwards (adjOR 0.26 (95%CI 0.09-0.80) in 2020-21 for females compared to males).Conclusion: Initiatives to increase bystander CPR and defibrillation have resulted in higher overall rates of bystander interventions in the last two decades and no significant sex differences in provision of bystander CPR.

However, the complexity and uncertainty of reactors, along with the high-dimensional and large-scale operating data, present challenges in capturing intricate dynamic behaviors and long-term de pendencies. This paper presents NPP-GPT, which for the first time investigates the potential of using pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to forecast long-term parameters from historical NPP data without explicit prompt engineering. Considering the modal disparity between textual pre-training data and numerical energy data, NPP-GPT employs a two-stage cross-modal transfer learning strategy that preserves the native next-token forecasting capability of LLMs while unlocking their potential for precise energy forecasting. First, the modal gap is bridged through input embedding reconstruction and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Second, domain-specific energy knowledge is integrated via LoRA fine-tuning. The framework was rigorously validated using data from an estab lished advanced nuclear energy research platform, focusing on a Chinese Pressurized Water Reactor (CPR-1000). Comprehensive experiments covering diverse operational scenarios, including normal and multiple fault condi tions, demonstrated that NPP-GPT outperforms both classical and advanced time-series forecasting models in accuracy and generalization, especially in long-term forecasting and under conditions with noise and missing data.

Both mechanical and electrical factors contribute to the occurrence of PCAMD. Prearrest ventricular function, the cause of cardiac arrest, global ischemia, resuscitation factors, ischemia/reperfusion injury and post-resuscitation treatments contribute to the severity of PCMAD. the pathophysiology of PCAMD is complex and include myocytes energy failure, impaired contractility, cardiac edema, mitochondrial damage, activation of inflammatory pathways and the coagulation cascade, persistent ischemic injury and myocardial stiffness. Hypotension and low cardiac output with vasopressor/inotropes need are frequent after resuscitation. However, clinical, hemodynamic and laboratory signs of shock are frequently altered by cardiac arrest pathophysiology and post-resuscitation treatment, potentially being misleading and not fully reflecting the severity of postcardiac arrest syndrome. Even if validated criteria are lacking, an extensive hemodynamic evaluation is useful to define a ""benign"" and a ""malign"" form of myocardial dysfunction and circulatory shock, potentially having treatment and prognostic implications. cardiac output is frequently decreased after cardiac arrest, particularly in patients treated with target temperature management (TTM); however, it is not independently associated with outcome. sinus bradycardia during TTM seems independently associated with survival and good neurological outcome, representing a promising prognostic indicator.

Most studies evaluating the effectiveness of ECPR include patients with an initial shockable rhythm. However, the effectiveness of ECPR for patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm remains unknown. This retrospective single-center study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ECPR for patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm, with reference to the outcomes of OHCA patients with an initial shockable rhythm. Methods Adult OHCA patients treated with ECPR at our center during 2011-2018 were included in the study. Patients were classified into the initial shockable rhythm group and the non-shockable rhythm group. The primary outcome was the cerebral performance category (CPC) scale score at hospital discharge. A CPC score of 1 or 2 was defined as a good outcome. Results In total, 186 patients were eligible. Among them, 124 had an initial shockable rhythm and 62 had an initial non-shockable rhythm. Among all patients, 158 (85%) were male, with a median age of 59 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-65) years, and the median low flow time was 41 (IQR, 33-48) min. Collapse was witnessed in 169 (91%) patients, and 36 (19%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) transiently. Proportion of female patients, presence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and collapse after the arrival of emergency medical service personnel were significantly higher in the non-shockable rhythm group. The rate of good outcomes at hospital discharge was not significantly different between the shockable and non-shockable groups (19% vs. 16%,p = 0.69). Initial shockable rhythm was not significantly associated with good outcome after controlling for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.66-3.81,p = 0.31). In the non-shockable group, patients with good outcomes had a higher rate of transient ROSC, and pulmonary embolism was the leading etiology.

However, pragmatic implementation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation does not necessarily lead to improved outcome of refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Centres that are performing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or aspire to do so should critically evaluate whether they are able to meet the pre-requisites that are needed to conduct an effective extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation programme.",EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE,2023,"Ubben, JFH; Heuts, S; Delnoij, TSR; Suverein, MM; Van de Koolwijk, AF; van der Horst, ICC; Maessen, JG; Bartos, J; Kavalkova, P; Rob, D; Yannopoulos, D; Belohlávek, J; Lorusso, R; Van de Poll, MCG",10.1093/ehjacc/zuad071,,WOS:001188846200001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Temperature management and its role in cardiac arrest patients-a review,"Thermoregulation constitutes one of the most important homeostatic systems of the human body. The human thermoregulatory system is highly complex and intertwined with other regulatory homeostatic systems. Different evolutionary adaptations have evolved to ensure a well-regulated body temperature, encompassing simple behavioural (e.g., seeking shelter. going underground) as well as physiological changes (e.g., vasodilatation. sweating). However, when the heat, cold or other stimuli cause a disruption in the thermoregulatory state and our adaptations can no longer cope with the additional stress. the body enters a pathological state. In such instances other measures must be undertaken. In medicine there are several pathological states associated with disruptions in temperature homeostasis. Consequently, these patients have to be, in broad terms, thermoregulated. Speaking specifically, the most common application of thermoregulation is therapeutic temperature management. A prominent example is the utilisation of this technique in post-cardiac arrest patients, who remain comatose after resuscitation. This technique has been in use for almost 20 years since the first major reports on its benefits in improving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest survival as well as improving neurological outcome. Recently, the findings from one of the biggest targeted temperature international and multicentre trials to date have been published (TTM2 trial; https://ttm2trial.org/). The study surprisingly showed no difference in mortality between patients after out of hospital cardiac arrest, who underwent normo- or hypothermia. Consequently, we might need to re-evaluate certain guidelines, recommendations, and perspectives. The aim of the current review is to present an overview of targeted temperature management in the field of intensive care medicine and cardiac arrest.",SIGNA VITAE,2022,"Markota, A; Gosak, M; Duh, M; Skok, K",10.22514/sv.2021.227,,WOS:000797491300001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Artificial neural networks improve early outcome prediction and risk classification in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care,"Background Pre-hospital circumstances, cardiac arrest characteristics, comorbidities and clinical status on admission are strongly associated with outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early prediction of outcome may inform prognosis, tailor therapy and help in interpreting the intervention effect in heterogenous clinical trials. This study aimed to create a model for early prediction of outcome by artificial neural networks (ANN) and use this model to investigate intervention effects on classes of illness severity in cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods Using the cohort of the TTM trial, we performed a post hoc analysis of 932 unconscious patients from 36 centres with OHCA of a presumed cardiac cause. The patient outcome was the functional outcome, including survival at 180 days follow-up using a dichotomised Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale with good functional outcome defined as CPC 1-2 and poor functional outcome defined as CPC 3-5. Outcome prediction and severity class assignment were performed using a supervised machine learning model based on ANN. Results The outcome was predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.891 using 54 clinical variables available on admission to hospital, categorised as background, pre-hospital and admission data. Corresponding models using background, pre-hospital or admission variables separately had inferior prediction performance. When comparing the ANN model with a logistic regression-based model on the same cohort, the ANN model performed significantly better (p = 0.029). A simplified ANN model showed promising performance with an AUC above 0.852 when using three variables only: age, time to ROSC and first monitored rhythm. The ANN-stratified analyses showed similar intervention effect of TTM to 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C in predefined classes with different risk of a poor outcome. Conclusion A supervised machine learning model using ANN predicted neurological recovery, including survival excellently, and outperformed a conventional model based on logistic regression. Among the data available at the time of hospitalisation, factors related to the pre-hospital setting carried most information. ANN may be used to stratify a heterogenous trial population in risk classes and help determine intervention effects across subgroups.",CRITICAL CARE,2020,"Johnsson, J; Björnsson, O; Andersson, P; Jakobsson, A; Cronberg, T; Lilja, G; Friberg, H; Hassager, C; Kjaergard, J; Wise, M; Nielsen, N; Frigyesi, A",10.1186/s13054-020-03103-1,,WOS:000557450000001,A

This study aimed to investigate the impact of myResponder on provision of bystander CPR, bystander AED, and patient survival outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis using the Singapore Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study between 2016 and 2019 that included adult non-traumatic OHCA patients. Patients were categorized into myResponder activated and non-activated groups. The primary outcomes were bystander CPR and bystander AED. The secondary outcome was survival at 30-days with favourable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance category 1-2). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and we reported adjusted odds ratio [aOR] and 95% confidence interval for the effect of activation. Results: 9,167 patients were included in this analysis. The median (Interquartile range, IQR) age was 71 (59-82) years. The activated group comprised 5,499 (60%) of cases. The activated group was associated with higher bystander CPR (aOR [95%CI]: 5.69 [4.89-6.62]) and bystander AED (aOR [95% CI]: 2.23 [1.82-2.74]) compared to non-activated group. The activated group was associated with better survival at 30 days with favourable neurological outcomes (aOR [95% CI]: 1.54 [1.11-2.15]).

Our organization implemented a novel Automated Code Blue Alert and Activation (ACBAA) system since 1st March 2018. Methods: We conducted a retrospective before-and-after ACBAA system implementation study in JurongHealth Campus (JHC) of National University Health system (NUHS), Singapore. In JHC, code blue can be activated by both manual activation and ACBAA system activation from 1st March 2018. The ACBAA system will be activated when any of the pre-defined peri-arrest criteria is met. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of IHCA. The secondary outcome included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of IHCA and in-hospital survival to home discharge of code blue activation. Outcomes: The incidence of IHCA per 1000 hospital admissions after-ACBAA system implementation was 14.6% lower than before-ACBAA system though not statistically significant [relative risk (RR): 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.34, P > 0.05]. Compared to the before-ACBAA system period, the after-ACBAA system period had a trend for higher rate of survival to home discharge after IHCA (RR: 2.13, 95% CI 0.65-6.93, P > 0.05) with good neurological outcome. Conclusions: Implementation of a novel ACBAA system has shown a trend in reducing IHCA incidence. In the era of digitalised healthcare system, the ACBAA system is practical and advisable to implement in order to reduce IHCA.

Our prior work demonstrated persistent disruption of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons, correlating with learning and memory deficits in a rodent model of cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Delayed inhibition of the Ca2+-permeable TRPM2 ion channel restored LTP post-CA/CPR, yet the mechanisms upstream of TRPM2 activation remain elusive. This study investigates CD38 as a potential regulator of TRPM2, highlighting a novel target to reverse hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits after ischemia. We observe elevated levels of CD38 in activated astrocytes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 7 days following CA/CPR in both male and female mice. Delayed inhibition of CD38 reverses hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairments at subacute timepoints after CA/CPR, phenocopying TRPM2 restoration of LTP. Our previous findings demonstrated that TRPM2 inhibition reverses the CA/CPR-induced enhancement of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) clustering, which contribute to ongoing LTP deficits. We, therefore, assessed the effect of CD38 on GABAergic inhibitory potentiation and find that inhibition of CD38 reverses GABAAR clustering in a TRPM2-dependent manner. In this study, we identify astroglial CD38 as a potential target and upstream regulator of the TRPM2 channel, offering a promising approach to restore hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairments following GCI through modulation of GABAergic signaling.",FRONTIERS IN STROKE,2024,"Burch, AM; Haas, A; Orfila, JE; Tiemeier, E; Gamboa, CD; Chalmers, N; Quillinan, N; Herson, PS",10.3389/fstro.2024.1423887,,WOS:001574461400001,A

Aminophylline is a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist capable of reversing ischemia-induced bradyasystole in a variety of settings. The hypothesis of this study was that aminophylline improves the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in atropine-resistant asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when used early in the resuscitation effort. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial set in an urban emergency medical services system serving a population of 250,000. All non-pregnant, normothermic adults suffering nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (February 1999 to August 2000) with asystole were eligible. Patients remaining in asystole after initial doses of epinephrine and atropine received either aminophylline 250 mg or matching placebo as a bolus injection through a peripheral intravenous line. All other aspects of the attempted resuscitation proceeded in accordance with standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines. A sample size of 102 patients was calculated to yield a power of 80% to show an absolute improvement of 25% in ROSC. The aminophylline and control groups were compared by calculating 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and the data were modeled using logistic regression. Results: The investigators enrolled 112 consecutive patients. One subject was dropped prior to analysis because of missing data. Data for 111 patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline characteristics were similar for the two groups. Comparing the control and aminophylline groups, ROSC was achieved in 15.6% (95% CI = 6% to 29%) and 22.7% (95% CI = 13% to 35%), while reversal of asystole occurred in 26.7% (95% CI = 15% to 42%) and 40.9% (95% CI = 29% to 54%), respectively. Group allocation had an odds ratio of 1.8 (95% CI = 0.6 to 5.3) for ROSC. Witnessed arrest was an independent predictor of outcome with an odds ratio of 3.8 (95% CI = 1.3 to 11.2).

Although survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have improved in recent decades, the prognosis for refractory OHCA remains poor. The use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is increasingly being considered to support rescue measures when conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) fails. ECPR enables immediate haemodynamic and respiratory stabilisation of patients with CA who are refractory to conventional CPR and thereby reduces the low-flow time, promoting favourable neurological outcomes. In the case of refractory OHCA, multiple studies have shown beneficial effects in specific patient categories.

A new isolate was characterized using culturing, biochemistry, high-throughput sequencing, microscopy (including electron microscopy), and functional genome analysis. Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 7Ba is able to grow on phenol and chlorophenols without losing its properties during long-term storage. It was shown that strain 7Ba is able to form viable but nonculturable (VBNC) forms during long-term storage under nutrient limitation, preserving both cell viability and the ability to degrade phenols. The ultrastructural organization of the vegetative forms of cells and VBNC forms was characterized. The following distinctive features were found: modifications (thickening) of cell membranes, cell size reduction, nucleoid condensation. Functional analysis of the genome showed the presence of genes for the degradation of alkanes, and two branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation of aromatic compounds. Also, the genome of strain 7Ba contains several copies of Rpf (resuscitation promoting factor) genes, a resuscitation factor of resting bacterial forms. The new isolate strain 7Ba is a promising biotechnological agent that can not only utilize toxic aromatic compounds but also remain viable during long-term storage.

Subsequent imaging and intraoperative findings revealed injury to the left circumflex artery (CX), likely caused by a left atrial appendage occluder (LAAO) that had penetrated the CX during resuscitation efforts. The tamponade was promptly identified through repeat extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST) imaging following hemodynamic deterioration, and the underlying cause was quickly confirmed using standardized postresuscitation imaging protocols. The frequency of this complication remains unclear and warrants further investigation, particularly as the use of LAAOs continues to increase. These devices, while beneficial, may pose a risk for life-threatening, resuscitation-related injuries such as PT. This case report highlights the complexity of managing critically ill nontraumatic OHCA patients, who are often elderly, have multiple comorbidities, and may be on anticoagulation therapy-all factors that can complicate acute care. It also underscores the challenges of post-CPR management, as chest compressions themselves can cause significant trauma, even after brief durations of CPR. Common resuscitation-related injuries must therefore be anticipated and promptly addressed. Prehospital eFAST plays a critical role in the initial management of critically ill patients but should never delay transport. Repeating eFAST imaging after hospital admission is essential. In cases of hemodynamic deterioration, the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure) approach including eFAST sonography should be revisited, and differential diagnoses that were previously excluded must be reconsidered. To ensure high-quality care in these complex scenarios, the search for the underlying cause of OHCA should include standardized postresuscitation imaging as an integral part of trauma bay management.",NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN,2025,"Adel, S; Drinhaus, H; Vollmer, M; Burst, V; Adler, C; Hackl, M",10.1007/s10049-025-01490-y,,WOS:001434831400001,A

Nogo-A signals inhibit axon outgrowth through the PirB receptor after ischemic reperfusion injury in central nervous system. We use TAT-PEP, a novel protein which could pass through the blood brain barrier, to block the function of PirB and identify the long-term neurological and behavioral recovery after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) in mice. We observed that TAT-PEP promoted neuron survival and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. TAT-PEP increased the expression of Tau, GAP43 and MAP-2 proteins. In addition, the short-term and long-term cognitive functions were also enhanced, indicating that TAT-PEP had a long-term neuroprotective effect, which reduced neurologic injury and neuron loss, promoted neurite outgrowth and enhanced functional recovery after ischemia. These studies reveal the mechanism of PirB on stroke and offer a potential therapeutic method for cerebral ischemia in humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Neurological function before and after an in-hospital cardiac arrest - A nationwide registry-based cohort study,"Background : According to the Utstein Registry Template for in -hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), a good neurological outcome is defined as either Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2 at discharge from hospital or unchanged CPC compared to baseline. However, the latter alternative has rarely been described in IHCA. This study aimed to examine CPC at admission to hospital, the occurrence of post -arrest neurological deterioration, and the factors associated with such deterioration. Methods : We studied adult IHCA survivors registered in the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2007 and 2022. The CPC was assessed based on information from admission and discharge from hospital. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and significance tests. Results : One in ten IHCA had a CPC score > 1 at admission to hospital. Out of 7,677 IHCA who survived until hospital discharge and had full CPC data, 6,774 (88%) had preserved CPC, 150 (2%) had improved CPC, and 753 (10%) had deteriorated CPC. Among the factors significantly associated with deteriorated neurological function are IHCA in a general ward or intensive care unit, non -shockable rhythm, no ECG surveillance, and a higher proportion of intra-arrest and post -resuscitation treatments (all p -values < 0,05). Conclusion : Most patients had preserved neurological function compared to admission. Factors associated with deteriorated neurological function are mainly concordant with established risk factors for adverse outcomes and are primarily intra-arrest and post -resuscitation, making deterioration hard to predict.

There are only a few large-scale studies analyzing prehospital process databases of the fire department. Study Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate whether characteristics of patients with FBAO were associated with prehospital factors and outcomes. Methods:In this retrospective observational study, patients transferred to the hospital by the Tokyo, Japan Fire Department for FBAO from 2017 through 2019 were included. The association between neurologically favorable survival among the characteristics of patients with FBAO and prehospital factors affecting the outcomes was evaluated. Results:Of the 2,429,175 patients, 3,807 (0.2%) patients had FBAO. The highest number of FBAO cases was 99 (2.6%), which occurred on January 1 (New Year's Day), followed by 40 cases (1.1%) on January 2, and 28 cases (0.7%) on January 3. The number of patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) caused by FBAO was 1,644 (43.2%). Comparing the OHCA and non-OHCA groups, there were significant differences in age, sex, time spent at the site, and distance between the site and hospital. Cardiac arrest was significantly lower in infants after FBAO (P < .001). In total, 98.2% of patients who did not have return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before hospital arrival died within 30 days, a significantly higher mortality rate than that in patients who had ROSC (98.2% versus 65.8%; P < .001). Conclusions:Among patients who did not have ROSC following FBAO upon arrival at the hospital, 98.2% died within 30 days.

We hypothesize that certain patient characteristics and treatments are associated with survival and long-term functional outcome following in-ICU cardiac arrest. Methods Over a 12-month period, cardiac arrests with resuscitation attempts were prospectively investigated in 45 French ICUs. Survivors were followed for 6 months. Results In total, 677 (2.16%) of 31,399 admitted patients had at least one in-ICU cardiac arrest with resuscitation attempt, 42% of which occurred on the day of admission. In 79% cases, one or more condition(s) likely to promote the occurrence of cardiac arrest was/were identified, including hypoxia (179 patients), metabolic disorders (122), hypovolemia (94), and adverse events linked to the life-sustaining devices in place (98). Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 478 patients, of whom 163 were discharged alive from ICU and 146 from hospital. Six-month survival with no or moderate functional sequel (118 of 125 patients alive) correlated with a number of organ failures <= 2 when cardiac arrest occurred (OR 4.17 [1.92-9.09]), resuscitation time <= 5 min (3.32 [2.01-5.47]), shockable rhythm cardiac arrests (2.13 [1.26-3.45]) or related to the life-sustaining devices in place (2.11 [1.22-3.65]), absence of preexisting disability (1.98 [1.09-3.60]) or disease deemed fatal within 5 years (1.70 [1.05-2.77]), and sedation (1.71 [1.06-2.75]).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Acute lung injury and post-cardiac arrest syndrome: a narrative review,"BackgroundPost-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) presents a multifaceted challenge in clinical practice, characterized by severe neurological injury and high mortality rates despite advancements in management strategies. One of the important critical aspects of PCAS is post-arrest lung injury (PALI), which significantly contributes to poor outcomes. PALI arises from a complex interplay of pathophysiological mechanisms, including trauma from chest compressions, pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, aspiration, and systemic inflammation. Despite its clinical significance, the pathophysiology of PALI remains incompletely understood, necessitating further investigation to optimize therapeutic approaches.MethodsThis review comprehensively examines the existing literature to elucidate the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic strategies for PALI. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify preclinical and clinical studies investigating PALI. Data from these studies were synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of PALI and its management.ResultsEpidemiological studies have highlighted the substantial prevalence of PALI in post-cardiac arrest patients, with up to 50% of survivors experiencing acute lung injury. Diagnostic imaging modalities, including chest X-rays, computed tomography, and lung ultrasound, play a crucial role in identifying PALI and assessing its severity. Pathophysiologically, PALI encompasses a spectrum of factors, including chest compression-related trauma, pulmonary IR injury, aspiration, and systemic inflammation, which collectively contribute to lung dysfunction and poor outcomes. Therapeutically, lung-protective ventilation strategies, such as low tidal volume ventilation and optimization of positive end-expiratory pressure, have emerged as cornerstone approaches in the management of PALI. Additionally, therapeutic hypothermia and emerging therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction hold promise in mitigating PALI-related morbidity and mortality.ConclusionPALI represents a significant clinical challenge in post-cardiac arrest care, necessitating prompt diagnosis and targeted interventions to improve outcomes. Mitochondrial-related therapies are among the novel therapeutic strategies for PALI.

The studies published between 2010 and 2024 examining outcomes of OHCA, interventions by bystanders, and variables linked to OHCA were included in this research. The inclusion process was done under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), where publications (n = 24) from various geographical locations, including a wide range of research methodologies, were included for this research. The thematic analysis used for the data analysis shows that bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) enhances the chances of survival. The effectiveness of the EMS system, the assistance offered by dispatchers, and the inclusion of doctors in ambulance services are essential components in the management of OHCA.

In severe cases of HoFH, clinical signs and symptoms cannot be controlled well by non-surgical treatments, liver transplantation (LT) currently represents the viable option.MethodTo assess the clinical efficacy, prognosis, and optimal timing of LT for HoFH, a retrospective analysis was conducted on the preoperative, surgical conditions, and postoperative follow-up of children who received an LT for HoFH at the Beijing Friendship Hospital over the period from December 2014 to August 2022.ResultsXanthoma and decreased activity tolerance were the primary clinical manifestations in the 7 HoFH children initially assessed (one child died suddenly prior to surgery due to cardiac arrest). Accompanying these symptoms were increased blood total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, along with severe cardiovascular diseases. HoFH was confirmed in all cases by genetic and biochemical assays. Initial treatments administered to these patients consisted of low-fat diets and lipid-lowering drugs with poor outcomes. Accordingly, all 6 patients received orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT), with the result that significant postoperative reductions were observed in levels of TC and LDL. The median follow-up of these six cases was 37.41 months (range: 19.40-94.10 months). Regular postoperative follow-ups revealed that all survived and showed significant improvements in their clinical symptoms.ConclusionSo far, LT is the only way to heal HoFH. LT before the appearance of obvious cardiovascular atherosclerotic lesions can significantly improve the quality of life and prognosis of patients.

While mechanical circulatory support devices, such as Impella (R) and left ventricular assist devices, are being increasingly used, initial ECPR often relies on V-A ECMO. Previous studies, including randomized controlled trials, reported the prognostic benefits of ECPR for shockable OHCA (SOHCA); however, its effectiveness for non-SOHCA (NSOHCA) remains unclear, with poorer neurological outcomes and the lower return of spontaneous circulation rates than for SOHCA being reported. The present study utilized data from the SOS-KANTO 2017 study to examine the impact of ECPR on the neurological outcomes of NSOHCA. Data from 2,502 OHCA cases were analyzed, with a focus on the relationship between ECPR and 90-day neurological outcomes. The results obtained showed significantly higher survival rates at 30 and 90 days and significantly better 90-day neurological outcomes in the ECMO attempt group than in the non-ECMO attempt group. A multivariate analysis identified ECPR as one of the significant independent predictors of favorable neurological outcomes. The prognosis of NSOHCA cases with CA was improved by ECPR using V-A ECMO, particularly in those where CPR was initiated within one minute of onset and the patient arrived at the hospital within 45 minutes. Factors associated with a favorable prognosis included a shorter time from onset to hospital arrival and the likelihood of acute coronary syndrome being the cause of CA. The present results suggest the potential of ECPR to improve the survival and the 90-day prognosis of NSOHCA, particularly when bystander CPR is initiated quickly and hospital arrival is prompt.",CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,2024,"Yoshida, T; Yoshida, M; Masui, Y; Naito, T; Tsukuda, J; Morisawa, K; Fujitani, S",10.7759/cureus.69305,,WOS:001317905200007,A

The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a form of heart-lung bypass, in the setting of cardiac arrest, termed extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), has promise in improving survival with good neurologic outcomes. The study objective was to determine the number of potential annual ECPR candidates among the OHCA population in a health region within the Atlantic Canadian province of Nova Scotia.Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted over a five-year period: January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016. Consecutive non-traumatic OHCA and emergency department (ED) cardiac arrests occurring in a pre-determined catchment area (20-minute transport to ECMO center) defined by a geographic bounding box were identified. Criteria for ECPR were developed to identify candidates for activation of a ""Code ECPR"": (1) age 16-70, (2) witnessed arrest, (3) no flow duration (time to CPR, including bystander) <10 minutes, (4) resuscitation >10 minutes without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), (5) emergency medical service (EMS) transport to hospital <20 minutes, (6) no patient factors precluding ongoing resuscitation (do not resuscitate status (DNR), palliative care involvement, or metastatic cancer), and (7) initial rhythm not asystole. Candidates were stratified by initial rhythm. Candidates were considered ultimately ED ECPR eligible if they failed conventional treatment, defined by death or resuscitation >30 minutes. Clinical data related to candidacy was extracted by an electronic query from prehospital and ED electronic records and manual chart review by three researchers.Results Our search yielded 561 cases of EMS-treated OHCA or in-ED arrests. Of those 204/561 (36%; 95% CI 33-40%) met the criteria for activation of a ""Code ECPR"". Ultimately 79/204 (34%; 95% CI 28-41%) of those who met activation criteria were considered ED ECPR eligible; which is 14% (95% CI 11-17%) of the total number of arrests-of the total number of arrests, the initial rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (PEA) 33/79 (42%; 95% CI 32-53%) and shockable 46/79 (58%; 95% CI 47-69%).Conclusion Of all cardiac arrests in the area surrounding our ECMO center, approximately 41 per year met the criteria for a Code ECPR activation, with 16 per year ultimately being eligible for ED ECPR. This annual estimate varies based on the inclusion of initial rhythm. This provides insight into both prehospital and hospital implications of an ED ECPR program and will help guide the establishment of a program within our Nova Scotian health region.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of POCT in the prehospital setting for OHCA management. Methods: In this cross-sectional study the management and outcomes of OHCA patients were compared before and after implementing the POCT for blood gas and electrolyte analysis by EMS in the prehospital setting of Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand. Results: 217 OHCA patients with a mean age of 61 +/- 17.07 (range: 58.72-63.28) years were studied (64.06 % male). 148 (68.2%) patients received POCT in the prehospital setting. Patients in the POCT group received higher administration of sodium bicarbonate (p <0.001) and calcium gluconate (p <0.001) compared to those without POCT. Sustained ROSC was achieved in 25% of the POCT group, compared to 11.59% in the no POCT group (p = 0.030).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,From crisis to recovery: A case report on nursing strategies for hepatitis E post-cardiac arrest,"Rationale:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-support technology for refractory cardiac arrest, but the massive blood transfusions required during treatment significantly increase the risk of transfusion-related infections. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) - traditionally linked to fecal-oral transmission - is increasingly recognized as a transfusion-transmitted pathogen, especially in emergency settings where urgent blood product infusion is common and routine HEV screening in blood banks is often lacking. However, nursing strategies for managing acute HEV infection after ECMO remain poorly defined, highlighting the need to address this clinical gap.Patient concerns:A 35-year-old female nurse developed sudden cardiac arrest due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and underwent ECMO. Post-ECMO, she received red blood cells and plasma transfusions. On postoperative day 15, she had worsening liver function (alanine aminotransferase 938 U/L, total bilirubin 69.3 mu mol/L) and abnormal coagulation function (prothrombin time [PT] 14.5 seconds), along with intermittent low-grade fever (37.3-38.0 degrees C); subsequent jaundice of the skin, sclera, and urine developed.Diagnoses:Next-generation sequencing confirmed acute HEV infection. The diagnosis was further supported by typical liver function abnormalities (marked elevation of transaminases and bilirubin), abnormal coagulation (PT 14.5 seconds), and clinical manifestations of HEV infection (fever, jaundice), with no evidence of other etiologies (e.g., viral hepatitis A/B/C, drug-induced liver injury).Interventions:Comprehensive nursing and clinical interventions were implemented. Daily monitoring: liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin), coagulation status (with focus on PT, e.g., baseline PT 14.5 seconds), and jaundice-related symptoms (skin/sclera color, pruritus, urine color); gastrointestinal management: Bacillus licheniformis (0.5 g twice daily) to regulate intestinal flora, and lactulose (15 mL twice daily) to promote bowel movement, maintaining gut-liver axis balance; personalized nutritional support: Collaboration with the nutrition department to provide a low-fat semi-liquid diet (1500-1600 kcal/d, 75-80 g branched-chain amino acid-rich protein, and adequate vitamins/minerals); and cardiac follow-up: planning and implementation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation on postoperative day 50 (after resolution of liver injury and stabilization of coagulation function).Outcomes:After 49 days of hospitalization, the patient's liver function normalized (total bilirubin within normal range, albumin increased from 31.3 to 35.1 g/L), coagulation function (PT) returned to normal, and jaundice resolved. She successfully underwent ICD implantation on postoperative day 50. A 3-month follow-up showed no chronic liver damage, and serum HEV-IgM turned negative at 6 months; no malignant arrhythmias or ICD discharges were recorded during follow-up.Lessons:This case emphasizes 3 key lessons: Firstly, for patients receiving ECMO and blood transfusions, close monitoring of liver function, coagulation indicators (e.g., PT), and clinical signs of HEV infection (fever, jaundice) is critical for early diagnosis; secondly, multimodal interventions - combining targeted monitoring (including coagulation tracking), gut-liver axis regulation, and personalized nutrition - are effective for managing acute HEV infection post-ECMO; and thirdly, timing of ICD implantation (e.g.",MEDICINE,2025,"Xu, R; Wu, JJ; Dong, LL; Ding, F; Wu, WL; Zheng, S",10.1097/MD.0000000000044325,,WOS:001568017700014,A

Machine learning and deep learning models show promise in improving these predictions. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates how effective these approaches are in predicting clinical outcomes at different time points using structured data. Methods: This study followed PRISMA guidelines, involving a comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until March 2024. Studies aimed at predicting ROSC, survival (or mortality), and neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest through the application of machine learning or deep learning techniques with structured data were included. Data extraction followed the guidelines of the CHARMS checklist, and the bias risk was evaluated using PROBAST tool. Models reporting the AUC metric with 95 % confidence intervals were incorporated into the quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis. Results: After extracting 2,753 initial records, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 97 machine learning and 16 deep learning models. The pooled AUC for predicting favorable neurological outcomes (CPC 1 or 2) at hospital discharge was 0.871 (95 % CI: 0.813 - 0.928) for machine learning models and 0.877 (95 % CI: 0.831-0.924) across deep learning algorithms. For survival prediction, this value was found to be 0.837 (95% CI: 0.757-0.916). Considerable heterogeneity and high risk of bias were observed, mainly attributable to inadequate management of missing data and the absence of calibration plots. Most studies focused on pre-hospital factors, with age, sex, and initial arrest rhythm being the most frequent features. Conclusion: Predictive models utilizing AI-based approaches, including machine and deep learning models exhibit enhanced effectiveness compared to previous regression algorithms, but significant heterogeneity and high risk of bias limit their dependability.

Hypothermia is well-known as an effective neuroprotective therapy, but its underlying mechanisms deserve further exploration. Previous study has demonstrated that hypothermia provides neuroprotection via increasing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, whether hypothermia can regulate both apoptosis and mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway or not. In this study, BV2 mouse microglial cells were cultured under oxygen-glucose deprivation for 6 h following reperfusion with or without hypothermia for 2-4 h. Cell viability was examined by trypan blue stain. Mitophagy was observed by transmission electron microscope. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were determined respectively by JC-1 staining and BBcellProbe M61 staining using a flow cytometer. Expression of mitophagy-related proteins (Cleaved PINK1, Parkin, SQSTM1/p62, Beclin-1, LC3B II/LC3B I), apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Cytochrome C, caspase-3, cleaved caspase3) and VDAC3 were assessed using western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. The interaction between Parkin and VDAC3 was confirmed by immunofluorescence colocalization. The results showed that hypothermia alleviated MMP damage, inhibited mPTP opening, then decreased cell apoptosis and activated mitophagy at 2 h after temperature intervention, which might be mediated by the PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway. Moreover, the effects of hypothermia were reduced or reversed at 4 h after temperature intervention. In conclusion, the potential mechanisms of hypothermia during oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery could be summarized as follows:1) At 2 h after temperature intervention, hypothermia provided neuroprotective effects via promoting mitophagy and reducing apoptosis through activating the PINK1/Parkin-VDAC3 signaling pathway. 2) The curative effect of hypothermia was timeliness. At 4 h after temperature intervention, hypothermia aggravated apoptosis through inhibiting Parkin recruitment to mitochondria and aggravating the release of Cyt C through open mPTP.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,"Zhang, LY; Yang, S; Cui, H; Hang, CC; Wang, XS; An, L; Shan, ZY; Liang, Z; Shao, R; Tang, ZR",10.1038/s41598-025-89176-w,,WOS:001416556400005,A

MethodsThe clinical data of eligible subjects diagnosed with CA was extracted from the MIMIC-IV database as the training cohort. Restricted cubic spline (RCS), Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve, and Cox regression analyses were conducted to elucidate the association between the INR and all-cause mortality of post-CA patients.

It should provide fewer interruptions of chest compressions (CC) for non-shockable organized rhythms (OR) and Asystole, or prompt CC stopping for early treatment of shockable ventricular fibrillation (VF). Major disturbing factors are strong CC artifacts corrupting raw ECG, which we aimed to analyze with optimized end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) without pre-filtering or additional sensors. The hyperparameter random search of 1500 CNN models with 2-7 convolutional layers, 5-50 filters and 5-100 kernel sizes was done on large databases from independent OHCA interventions for training (3001 samples) and validation (2528 samples). The best model, named CNN3-CC-ECG network with three convolutional layers (filters@kernels: 5@5,25@20,50@20) presented Sensitivity Se(VF) = 89%(268/301), Specificity Sp(OR) = 91.7%(1504/1640), Sp(Asystole) = 91.1%(3325/3650) on an independent test OHCA database. CNN3-CC-ECG's ability to effectively extract features from raw ECG signals during CPR was comprehensively demonstrated, and the dependency on the CPR corruption level in ECG was tested. We denoted a significant drop of Se(VF) = 74.2% and Sp(OR) = 84.6% in very strong CPR artifacts with a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR < -9 dB, p < 0.05.

Survival status was obtained from the Dutch Population Register. A time-stratified, case-crossover design examined if deceased participants more frequently participated in mass-participation sporting events 0-7 days before death compared with the reference period (14-21 days before death). Mortality risks during follow-up were compared between participants and non-participants from the general population using Cox regression.Results 546 876 participants (median (IQR) age 41 (31-50) years, 56% male, 72% runners) and 211 592 non-participants (41 (31-50) years, 67% male) were included.

A rapid resuscitation of the mainstream deammonification system was accomplished by controlling the front-end aeration rate of the PFBR. Results showed that the system was rapidly resuscitated in 44days eventually with the nitrogen removal rate and nitrogen removal efficiency of 0.1 kg N.(m(3). d)(-1) and 79.1%, respectively. Also, the efficient performance was secured by the proportionate approaching equilibrium of AnAOB and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity of 235 +/- 0.40 and 2.60 +/- 0.29 mg N.(g VSS.h)(-1), respectively. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that AnAOB abundance (detected Candidatus Kuenenia) negatively correlated with the AOB (mainly Nitrosomonas)/AnAOB abundance ratio, while correlated positively with the residual ammonium concentration of a region. Furthermore, long-term refrigeration probably reduced the cross-feed relationship between AnAOB and other symbiotic organisms (Armatimonadetes and Chloroflexi) to maintain the basic metabolism.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Usefulness of the R-Wave Sign as a Predictor for Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia in Patients With Brugada Syndrome,"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an autosomal dominant channelopathy which is responsible for a large number of sudden cardiac deaths in young subjects without structural abnormalities. The most challenging step in management of patients with BrS is identifying who is at risk for developing malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA). In patients with BrS, conduction delay in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) causes a prominent R wave in lead aVR. This electrocardiographic parameter can be useful to detect these high-risk patients. The goal of this study was to test the significance of R-wave elevation in lead aVR as a predictor for VTA in patients with BrS. In this retrospective study, we included 132 patients with BrS (47 15 years, 65% men) who visited the outpatient clinic for cardiogenetic screening. Patients' medical records were examined for the presence of a positive R-wave sign in lead aVR and VTA. A positive R-wave sign in lead aVR was observed in 41 patients (31%). This sign was more frequently observed in patients who experienced VTA (n = 24) before the initial diagnosis, during electrophysiological studies, or during follow-up (p <0.001). The positive R-wave sign occurred more frequently in symptomatic patients with a history of an out of hospital cardiac arrest, VTA, or syncope than asymptomatic patients (60% vs 26%; p = 0.002). During the follow-up period, this sign was more frequently detected in patients who developed either de novo (50%) or recurrent VTA (80%) (p = 0.017). Multivariable regression analysis showed that R-wave sign is an independent predictor for VTA development (odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.79 to 13.27). The presence of a positive R-wave sign in lead aVR is associated with the development of VTA. In conclusion, positive R-wave sign in lead aVR can be used to identify patients with BrS at risk for malignant VTA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Misplacement of a femoral venous catheter into the ascending lumbar vein: A case report and first use of balloon catheter compression hemostasis,"Rationale:This case report aims to highlight a rare but life-threatening complication of femoral venous catheterization and to describe a novel endovascular technique for its management. Non-tunneled femoral catheters provide rapid vascular access for emergency dialysis (e.g., arteriovenous graft [AVG] occlusion, hyperkalemia) but carry risks of vascular injury, potentially causing fatal bleeding. This is the first report of hemorrhagic shock due to ascending lumbar vein rupture from femoral catheter misplacement, successfully managed by balloon compression hemostasis.Patient concerns:A 48-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease presented with hyperkalemia and an occluded AVG. Following ultrasound-guided femoral vein catheterization, she developed recurrent hypotension during dialysis. Suspected anaphylactic shock or abdominal hemorrhage was refractory to anti-allergic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and arterial embolization.Diagnoses:Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the catheter tip had perforated the ascending lumbar vein, causing intraperitoneal hemorrhage. DSA clearly identified the injury site and ruled out other causes, confirming hemorrhagic shock secondary to catheter-induced venous rupture.Interventions:Immediate balloon catheter compression was applied under fluoroscopic guidance. The balloon was precisely positioned at the venous rupture site and inflated to apply direct pressure, sealing the breach for 15 to 20 minutes to promote endothelial repair. This avoided surgical intervention and was particularly suited to this deep, anatomically complex injury.Outcomes:Post-compression angiography confirmed complete hemostasis. The patient's hemodynamics stabilized immediately, with no further episodes of hypotension. Hemoglobin levels remained stable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization (post-procedure Hb: 65 g/L, discharged with Hb: 95 g/L). Subsequent dialysis sessions were successful without recurrent bleeding. The patient was successfully transitioned to long-term dialysis access. At 1-month postdischarge telephone follow-up, the patient reported no complications and had successfully undergone AVG thrombectomy at another facility.Lessons:This first report demonstrates the efficacy of interventional balloon compression for catheter-related deep vein rupture, offering a novel strategy for rapid hemostasis. Clinicians must be vigilant for vascular injury during non-tunneled catheter placement, especially in complex areas, and utilize DSA promptly for diagnosis.

It is unknown whether fever management with a feedback-controlled device impacts patient-centered outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. This trial aims to investigate fever management with or without a temperature control device after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.MethodsThe TEMP-CARE trial is part of the 2 x 2 x 2 factorial Sedation, TEmperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (STEPCARE) trial, a randomized, international, multicenter, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, superiority trial that will evaluate sedation strategies, temperature management, and blood pressure targets simultaneously in nontraumatic/nonhemorrhagic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients following hospital admission. For the temperature management component of the trial described in this protocol, patients will be randomly allocated to fever management with or without a feedback-controlled temperature control device. For those managed with a device, if temperature >= 37.8 degrees C occurs within 72 h post-randomization the device will be started targeting a temperature of <= 37.5 degrees C. Standard fever treatment, as recommended by local guidelines, including pharmacological agents, will be provided to participants in both groups. The two other components of the STEPCARE trial evaluate sedation and blood pressure strategies. Apart from the STEPCARE trial interventions, all other aspects of general intensive care will be according to the local practices of the participating site. A physician blinded to the intervention will determine the neurological prognosis following European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at six months post-randomization. To detect a 5.6% absolute risk reduction (90% power, alpha .05), 3500 participants will be enrolled.

However, apart from targeted temperature management (TTM), neuroprotective treatments are not included in current care of patients with postanoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. We aimed to review the clinical evidence of efficacy of neuroprotective strategies to improve recovery of comatose patients after cardiac arrest and to propose future directions. We performed a systematic search of the literature to identify prospective, comparative clinical trials on interventions to improve neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. We included 53 studies on 21 interventions. None showed unequivocal benefit. TTM at 33 or 36 degrees C and adrenaline (epinephrine) are studied most, followed by xenon, erythropoietin, and calcium antagonists. Lack of efficacy is associated with heterogeneity of patient groups and limited specificity of outcome measures. Ongoing and future trials will benefit from systematic collection of measures of baseline encephalopathy and sufficiently powered predefined subgroup analyses.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the characteristics and outcomes of patients with hypothermic cardiac arrest who underwent ECPR, using a multicenter out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) registry in Japan. Methods: Baseline characteristics of patients with hypothermic OHCA and body temperature below 32 degrees C were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality and neurological outcomes in these patients. Outcomes of hypothermic and cardiogenic OHCA cases were compared using propensity-score matching to investigate differences among subgroups. Results: We included 2,157 patients, with 102 and 1,646 in the hypothermic and cardiogenic groups, respectively. Higher age and longer low-flow time were independent risk factors for mortality, and higher age was an independent risk factor for unfavorable neurological outcomes in the hypothermic OHCA group. Eighty matched pairs were selected during propensity-score matching, and the mortality rate was lower in the hypothermic group than in the cardiogenic group (46.2% vs. 77.5%; p < 0.01). Unfavorable neurological outcome rate was lower in the hypothermic group than in the cardiogenic group (62.5% vs. 87.5%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: Increased age and prolonged low-flow time were identified as negative prognostic factors in patients with hypothermic OHCA who underwent ECPR.

Despite advances in pre and in-hospital care, OHCA survival remains low and is highly variable across systems and regions. The critical barrier to improving cardiac arrest outcomes is not a lack of knowledge about effective interventions, but rather the widespread lack of systems of care to deliver interventions known to be successful. The RAndomized Cluster Evaluation of Cardiac ARrest Systems (RACE-CARS) trial is a 7-year pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial of 62 counties (57 clusters) in North Carolina using an established registry and is testing whether implementation of a customized set of strategically targeted community-based interventions improves survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function in OHCA relative to control/standard care. The multifaceted intervention comprises rapid cardiac arrest recognition and systematic bystander CPR instructions by 9-1-1 telecommunicators, comprehensive community CPR training and enhanced early automated external defibrillator (AED) use prior to emergency medical systems (EMS) arrival. Approximately 20,000 patients are expected to be enrolled in the RACE CARS Trial over 4 years of the assessment period. The primary endpoint is survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic outcome defined as a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2. Secondary outcomes include the rate of bystander CPR, defibrillation prior to arrival of EMS, and quality of life.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,The combination of chest compression synchronized ventilation and aortic balloon occlusion improve the outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in swine,"AimThe primary mission of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is to provide adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery for restoring spontaneous circulation from cardiac arrest (CA) events. Previously, studies demonstrated that chest compression synchronized ventilation (CCSV) improved systemic oxygen supply during CPR, and aortic balloon occlusion (ABO) augments the efficacy of external CPR by increasing blood perfusion to vital organs. However, both them failed to make a significant improvement in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In this study, we investigated the effects of combined CCSV and ABO on the outcomes of CPR in swine. MethodsThirty-one male domestic swine were subjected to 8 min of electrically induced and untreated CA followed by 8 min of CPR. CPR was performed by continuous chest compressions and mechanical ventilation. At the beginning of CPR, the animals were randomized to receive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV, n = 10), CCSV (n = 7), IPPV + ABO (n = 7), or CCSV + ABO (n = 7). During CPR, gas exchange and systemic hemodynamics were measured, and ROSC was recorded. After resuscitation, the function and injury biomarkers of vital organs including heart, brain, kidney, and intestine were evaluated. ResultsDuring CPR, PaO2 was significantly higher accompanied by significantly greater regional cerebral oxygen saturation in the CCSV and CCSV + ABO groups than the IPPV group. Coronary perfusion pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and carotid blood flow were significantly increased in the IPPV + ABO and CCSV + ABO groups compared with the IPPV group. ROSC was achieved in five of ten (IPPV), five of seven (CCSV), six of seven (IPPV + ABO), and seven of seven (CCSV + ABO) swine, with the rate of resuscitation success being significantly higher in the CCSV + ABO group than the IPPV group (P = 0.044). After resuscitation, significantly improved myocardial and neurological function, and markedly less cardiac, cerebral, renal, and intestinal injuries were observed in the CCSV + ABO group compared with the IPPV group.

Traditional approaches rely on hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA), which remains associated with neurological and systemic complications. This study presents our initial experience with a normothermic frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique that eliminates circulatory arrest while maintaining continuous cerebral and systemic perfusion. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent FET without HCA at Polytechnic University of Marche from September 2019 to January 2025. The surgical strategy included femoral and innominate artery cannulation for extracorporeal circulation, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (ASCP), and retrograde stent graft deployment with balloon occlusion. Perioperative outcomes, complications, and mid-term follow-up data were evaluated. Results: Twenty-three patients (median age, 73 years) underwent FET without HCA. Indications included degenerative aneurysm (n=14), type I endoleak (n=4), acute aortic dissection (n=2), chronic penetrating ulcer (n=2), and Kommerell's diverticulum (n=1). Technical success was 100%. Two in-hospital deaths occurred due to septic shock and stroke. No cases of permanent spinal cord injury were reported. The median intensive care unit and hospital stays were 4 and 10 days, respectively. The median peak intraoperative lactate level was 1.8 mmol/L (range, 1-4.8 mmol/L). At a median follow-up of 27 months, three patients required distal aortic reintervention due to type Ib (n=2) and type II (n=1) endoleaks. Conclusions: Normothermic FET without circulatory arrest is a feasible and potentially advantageous alternative to traditional techniques, reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury while maintaining cerebral and systemic perfusion.

This study explored the neuroprotective potential of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LITUS) in mitigating brain damage after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using a murine model and in vitro assays. LITUS treatment improved 24-h survival rates and neurological recovery in cardiac arrest (CA) mice, as evidenced by behavioral assessments and reduced neurological deficit scores. Proteomic analyses revealed modulation of Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, characterized by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that LITUS enhanced Piezo1 and Dkk3 activation, promoting calcium influx and anti-inflammatory responses. The Piezo1 antagonist GsMTx4 abrogated these effects, underscoring Piezo1's specific role. Additionally, in vitro experiments using oxygen/glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated BV2 microglial cells confirmed that LITUS reduced inflammatory responses and enhanced cellular recovery via the Piezo1-Dkk3 axis. These findings highlight LITUS as a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy to ameliorate PCABI by modulating neuroinflammation through the Piezo1-Dkk3/PI3K-Akt pathway.

There is increasing recognition that posttraumatic stress may develop in the aftermath of an acute cardiac event. However, there has been little research on the longer-term prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Posttraumatic stress Symptoms were assessed at 12 months in 213 patients with ACS and in 179 patients at 36 months. Predictor variables included clinical, demographic, and emotional factors measured during hospital admission. Results: At 12 months post ACS, 26 (12.2%) patients qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD; 23 (12.8%) patients were identified with PTSD at 36 months. Posttraumatic symptoms at 12 months were associated with younger age, ethnic minority status, social deprivation, cardiac symptom recurrence, history of depression, depressed mood during admission, hostility, and Type D personality. In multiple regression, depressed mood during admission and recurrent cardiac symptoms were independent predictors of posttraumatic symptoms (R-2 = 0.507, p < .001). At 36 months, posttraumatic Stress symptoms were independently predicted by posttraumatic symptom levels at 12 months and depressed mood during admission (R 2 = 0.635, p < .001).

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a potential intervention for OHCA, but its effectiveness compared to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) needs further evaluation. Method: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials. gov for relevant studies from January 2010 to March 2023. Pooled meta-analysis was performed to investigate any potential association between ECPR and improved survival and neurological outcomes. Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included two randomized controlled trials enrolling 162 participants and 10 observational cohort studies enrolling 4507 participants. The pooled meta-analysis demonstrated that compared to CCRP, ECPR did not improve survival and neurological outcomes at 180 days following OHCA (RR: 3.39, 95% CI: 0.79 to 14.64; RR: 2.35, 95% CI: 0.97 to 5.67). While a beneficial effect of ECPR was obtained regarding 30-day survival and neurological outcomes. Furthermore, ECPR was associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications. Subgroup analysis showed that ECPR was prominently beneficial when exclusively initiated in the emergency department. Additional post-resuscitation treatments did not significantly impact the efficacy of ECPR on 180-day survival with favorable neurological outcomes. Conclusions: There is no high-quality evidence supporting the superiority of ECPR over CCPR in terms of survival and neurological outcomes in OHCA patients. However, due to the potential for bias, heterogeneity among studies, and inconsistency in practice, the non-significant results do not preclude the potential benefits of ECPR. Further high-quality research is warranted to optimize ECPR practice and provide more generalizable evidence.

In the present study, we challenged mice with an inducible endothelial-specific BMP4 deletion (referred to as EC-BMP4(-/-)mice) and their control littermates (EC-BMP4(+/+)) with thioglycollate i.p. and assessed extravasation of different leukocyte subsets during peritonitis. Peritoneal lavages were performed and peritoneal cells were counted. Total cell count in lavages of EC-BMP4(-/-)mice was markedly reduced compared with lavages of EC-BMP4(+/+)mice. FACS analyses of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal cells revealed that diverse leukocyte subsets were reduced in EC-BMP4(-/-)mice. Intravital microscopy of cremaster venules demonstrated that rolling and adhesion of leukocytes were significantly diminished in EC-BMP4(-/-)mice in comparison with control mice in response to TNF alpha. These observations indicate that endothelial BMP4 is essential for rolling, adhesion, and extravasation of leukocytesin vivo. To understand the underlying mechanisms, levels of endothelial adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 were quantified in EC-BMP4(-/-)and EC-BMP4(+/+)mice by quantitative PCR and Western blotting. Interestingly, ICAM-1 and E-selectin expressions were reduced in the hearts of EC-BMP4(-/-)mice. Next we confirmed pro-inflammatory properties of BMP4 in a gain of function experiments and found that administration of recombinant BMP4 in male C57BL/6 mice increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion in cremaster venulesin vivo. To assess the regulation of BMP4 in inflammatory disease in humans, we collected plasma samples of patients from day 0 to day 7 after survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA,n= 42). Remarkably, plasma of OHCA patients contained significantly higher BMP4 protein levels compared with patients with coronary artery disease (CAD,n= 12) or healthy volunteers (n= 11). Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated plasma BMP4 levels after ROSC are associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcome. Collectively, endothelial BMP4 is a potent activator of inflammationin vivothat promotes rolling, adhesion, and extravasation of leukocyte subsets by induction of E-selectin and ICAM-1. Elevation of plasma BMP4 levels in the post-resuscitation period suggests that BMP4 contributes to pathophysiology and poor outcome of post-cardiac arrest syndrome.",INFLAMMATION,2020,"Arnold, L; Weberbauer, M; Herkel, M; Fink, K; Busch, HJ; Diehl, P; Grundmann, S; Bode, C; Elsässer, A; Moser, M; Helbing, T",10.1007/s10753-020-01307-9,,WOS:000560266500002,A

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,First Results of Our Local Practice Guide Used During the Late Phase of Resuscitation in Patients with Refractory VF in Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"Objective: Treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation (rVF) is a clinical challenge. If rVF is still present after standard advanced life support (ALS) guideline care, including amiodaron administration, other therapeutic options might be necessary. Based on the available evidence and expertise, our Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) team developed a local practice guide for the prolonged resuscitation of patients in rVF and implemented this as standard HEMS care in March 2022. Methods: This database study contains all patients treated with our local practice guide during out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with rVF beyond the fifth regular ALS shock-block. This local practice HEMS treatment algorithm consisted of, among others, cessation of epinephrine and alternating administration of esmolol and norepinephrine combined with enoximone. Data were derived from the HEMS database and the treating hospitals. Primary outcome was the return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary outcome was defined as survival to hospital discharge and cerebral performance. This outcome was compared to the literature to analyze for inferiority of treatment. Results: In a 21-month period, HEMS was 761 times deployed for OHCA. Nineteen patients were treated with the local practice guide, nine patients (47%) were admitted to hospital with return of spontaneous circulation. Median resuscitation time was 22min. Hospital survival with good neurology was achieved in 42% vs 17% as expected. Exact Clopper-Pearson and logistic regression analysis revealed non-inferiority of the local practice guide. Withholding epinephrine was achieved in 84% of patients. A total of 79% and 90% of patients received esmolol and norepinephrine/enoximone mixture, respectively. Alternative defibrillation positions were indicated in 18 patients but applied in only 6 (33%). Conclusion: In patients with persisting VF despite prolonged advanced life support care, a multifaceted bundle of care approach shows promising results and warrants further research.

We perform the first economic evaluation alongside a full age of blood clinical trial with a large population assessing the impact of RBC storage duration on quality-of-life and costs in critically ill adults. Design: Quality-of-life was measured at 6 months post randomization using the EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level instrument. The economic evaluation considers quality-adjusted life year and cost implications from randomization to 6 months. A generalized linear model was used to estimate incremental costs (2016 U.S. dollars) and quality-adjusted life years, respectively while adjusting for baseline characteristics. Setting: Fifty-nine ICUs in five countries. Patients: Adults with an anticipated ICU stay of at least 24 hours when the decision had been made to transfuse at least one RBC unit. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either the freshest or oldest available compatible RBC units (standard practice) in the hospital transfusion service. Measurements and Main Results: EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level utility scores were similar at 6 months-0.65 in the short-term and 0.63 in the long-term storage group (difference, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.00 to 0.04; p = 0.10). There were no significant differences in resource use between the two groups apart from 3.0 fewer hospital readmission days (95% CI, -5.3 to -0.8; p = 0.01) during follow-up in the short-term storage group. There were no significant differences in adjusted total costs or quality-adjusted life years between the short- and long-term storage groups (incremental costs, -$2,358; 95% CI, -$5,586 to $711) and incremental quality-adjusted life years: 0.003 quality-adjusted life years (95% CI, -0.003 to 0.008).

Objectives: This study aims to examine the demographic characteristics, etiological factors, and survival outcomes of patients who underwent CPR in the emergency department of the Children's Medical Center. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we gathered data from 149 resuscitated cases over a 2-year period. All patients under 18 years old who underwent CPR in the emergency department of the Children's Medical Center Hospital for any reason from April 2021 to March 2023 were retrospectively assessed. Demographic information and information related to the factors causing resuscitation, underlying diseases, vital and clinical signs on arrival, and resuscitation results were obtained by reviewing archived patient records. Results: The median age of patients was 18.0 months (IQR 6.0-70.0), and 51% were boys. 64.4% of patients achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 53.7% survived for 24 hours after the event, and 24.2% survived until discharge. The analysis of the association between contributing factors and survival measures in pediatric resuscitation efforts reveals several insights. The reason for resuscitation is an important factor, with respiratory arrest being strongly associated with better outcomes at all stages, while cardiac and cardiopulmonary arrests show poorer prognoses (P < 0.001). The rhythm prior to chest compressions is also a significant predictor, with asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) being associated with lower chances of ROSC and survival (P < 0.001). The location of the arrest is a pivotal factor, with in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs) showing better outcomes compared to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) (P <0.001).

The stability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for minimizing secondary neurological damage and improving long-term prognosis. However, the precise mechanisms and regulatory pathways that contribute to BBB dysfunction after CPR remain elusive. GYY4137 is an innovative hydrogen sulfide slow-release agent with excellent properties as a hydrogen sulfide substitute. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of GYY4137 on CA/CPR and the underlying mechanisms of BBB protection. The effects of GYY4137 on systemic inflammation, BBB integrity, and autophagy were evaluated using a mouse CA/CPR model. The underlying mechanisms of occludin changes associated with GYY4137 were investigated using oxygen-glucose deprivation / reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. ELISA, neurological function and other tests showed that GYY4137 ameliorates systemic inflammation and neurological prognosis. Western blotting, transwell migration and tube formation assays showed that GYY4137 improves BBB function both in vivo and in vitro. The detection of autophagy flow and protein degradation pathways showed the inhibition of occludin reduction by GYY4137 was mainly achieved by suppressing autophagy mediated degradation. Taken together, GYY4137 may improve BBB dysfunction following CPR by increasing occludin content. This effect was achieved by inhibiting autophagic degradation rather than promoting synthesis. GYY4137 also mitigated systemic inflammation and improved neurological outcomes after CA/CPR. In summary, our study provides valuable insights into protecting the integrity of BBB and improving neurological outcomes after CPR.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,"Duan, PY; Li, XY; Bi, YH; Feng, WY; Jin, ZH; Zhang, XQ; He, GH; An, D; Wen, ZB; Zhang, B",10.1038/s41598-024-84948-2,,WOS:001392728800005,A

Vasoactive agents play an essential role in the supportive care of post cardiac arrest patients. The administration of these agents is associated with serious side-effects and therefore they should be used in the minimal dose necessary to achieve low-normal mean arterial pressure and adequate systematic perfusion. Careful and frequent serial evaluation of the patient is important primarily to assess volume status and adequacy of circulatory support. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and laboratory parameters is essential both to accurately titrate therapy and because inotropes and vasopressors have the potential to induce life-threatening side-effects. The clinical efficacy of inotropes and vasopressors has been largely investigated through examination of their impact on hemodynamic end points, and clinical practice has been driven in part by expert opinion, extrapolation from animal studies, and physician preference. Clearly these agents should all be considered as supportive measures to stabilize the patient prior to some form of definitive therapy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aims at summarizing the available evidence on the use of ECPR in adult patients with OHCA, clinically focusing on the factors most often associated with outcome in these patients. Even in the absence of randomized trials, there is growing evidence from ECLS centers documenting sound clinical benefits of ECPR in selected OHCA. According to the available evidence, three factors seem to contribute strongly to the favorable outcome of ECLS supported OHCA patients: (a) selection of patients (mainly definition of age range and a witnessed cardiac arrest); (b) the availability of an ECLS team, well skilled and experienced (to reduce time of implantation and incidence of complications); (c) a multifaceted approach to the OHCA patient (the so-called ECLS-bundle) to treat the reversible cause of CA (i.e. percutaneous coronary intervention), ensure neuroprotection (hypothermia), and maintain organ perfusion (till recovery). Taking into account the promising results of ECPR in selected OHCA patients, there is a clinical need for shared protocols to reduce differences related to the center experience and mostly to increase availability of ECLS as part of a multifaceted approach for these patients.",EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE,2016,"Lazzeri, C; Valente, S; Peris, A; Gensini, GF",10.1177/2048872615585517,,WOS:000389977100003,A

Many OHCA patients require repositioning to a firm surface. We examined the association between repositioning, chest compression (CC) delay, and patient outcomes.Methods: We used a quality improvement registry from review of 9-1-1 dispatch audio recordings of OHCA among adults eligible for telecommunicator-assisted CPR (T-CPR) between 2013 and 2021. OHCA was categorized into 3 groups: CC not delayed, CC delayed due to bystander physical limitations to reposition the patient, or CC delayed for other (non-physical) reasons. The primary outcome was the repositioning interval, defined as the interval between the start of positioning instructions and CC onset. We used logistic regression to assess the odds ratio of survival according to CPR group, adjusting for potential confounders.Results: Of the 3,482 OHCA patients eligible for T-CPR, CPR was not delayed in 1,223 (35%), delayed due to repositioning in 1,413 (41%), and delayed for other reasons in 846 (24%).

Most victims succumb to the oxidative and inflammatory damage sustained during cardiac arrest/resuscitation, but even survivors typically battle long-term neurocognitive impairment. Although extensive research has delineated the complex mechanisms that culminate in neuronal damage and death, no effective treatments have been developed to interrupt these mechanisms. Of importance, many of these injury cascades are also active in the aging brain, where neurons and other cells are under persistent oxidative and inflammatory stress which eventually damages or kills the cells. In light of these similarities, it is reasonable to propose that the brain essentially ages the equivalent of several years within the few minutes taken to resuscitate a patient from cardiac arrest. Accordingly, cardiac arrest-resuscitation models may afford an opportunity to study the deleterious mechanisms underlying the aging process, on an accelerated time course. The aging and resuscitation fields both stand to gain pivotal insights from one another regarding the mechanisms of injury sustained during resuscitation from cardiac arrest and during aging.

Over 50% of adult Queenslanders have been trained in CPR at some time in the past, however, little is known about the factors that affect their willingness to perform CPR. Method: A random survey of 4480 Queensland residents was conducted to address this question. Results: The survey indicated that the most common barriers to performing CPR were a fear of disease, visible blood and perceived danger. In contrast, respondents indicated that they were more likely to administer CPR if the respondent knew the victim, the victim would die if CPR was not administered, and respondents believed that they possessed the necessary skills to perform CPR. A majority (84%) of respondents indicated that they were at least likely to administer CPR. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the respondents most likely to perform CPR were males, those who were married or in a de facto relationship, those in paid employment, smokers, those recently trained in CPR, prospective organ donors, those who cited no barriers to CPR and those who cited one or more factors that would facilitate CPR. Conclusions: This study indicates that there is considerable variation in Queenslanders' willingness to perform bystander CPR. Public health education campaigns aimed at correcting inaccurate perceptions of risk and addressing other barriers to bystander CPR would promote its use in response to OHCA.

However, the association between delays in bystander CPR and OHCA survival is poorly understood. METHODS: In this observational study using a nationally representative US registry, we identified patients who received bystander CPR from a layperson for a witnessed OHCA from 2013 to 2021. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to estimate the association between time to CPR (<1 minute versus 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, and >= 10-minute intervals) and survival to hospital discharge and favorable neurological survival (survival to discharge with cerebral performance category of 1 or 2 [ie, without severe neurological disability]). RESULTS: Of 78 048 patients with a witnessed OHCA treated with bystander CPR, the mean age was 63.5 +/- 15.7 years and 25, 197 (32.3%) were women. The median time to bystander CPR was 2 (1-5) minutes, with 10% of patients having a >= 10-minute delay before initiation of CPR. Overall, 15 000 (19.2%) patients survived to hospital discharge and 13 159 (16.9%) had favorable neurological survival. There was a graded inverse relationship between time to bystander CPR and survival to hospital discharge (P for trend <0.001). Compared with patients who received CPR within 1 minute, those with a time to CPR of 2 to 3 minutes were 9% less likely to survive to discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.95]) and those with a time to CPR 4 to 5 minutes were 27% less likely to survive (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.77]). A similar graded inverse relationship was found between time to bystander CPR and favorable neurological survival (P for trend <0.001).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,"Evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of dispatching EMS volunteers via ""interconnected first-aid app"" on the outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: protocol for a type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness study","IntroductionOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) poses a critical public health challenge globally, with survival rates in China being significantly lower than that in high-income countries. Delayed emergency response, low bystander Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) rates, and limited AED accessibility contribute to poor outcomes. Leveraging smart technology to mobilize trained volunteers via mobile applications has emerged as a promising strategy to bridge these gaps. However, in urban contexts within China, there remains a scarcity of implementation evidence encompassing aspects such as adoption, contextual barriers, and sustainability. This shortage of evidence hinders the integration of policies and systems at the policy and system levels. This study aims to improve the survival rates of OHCA patients in China, by designing, implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of an optimized ""Interconnected First-Aid App"" dispatching EMS volunteers through a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.Methods and analysisA stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 24 streets/townships across three districts in Shaoguan, China. The 24 streets/townships will be randomly assigned to four clusters, and each cluster will receive staggered interventions over 18 months, including volunteer recruitment/training, app-AED-EMS integration, and community education step by step. The trial adopts the PEDALS framework (Problem, Evidence-based Practice, Determinants, Action, Long-term, Scale) to assess both implementation processes and clinical outcomes. Primary outcomes include survival rates, bystander CPR/AED utilization, and response times. Implementation outcomes will evaluate adoption, feasibility, and sustainability through surveys, interviews, and health system data analysis. Findings will inform scalable, context-adapted implementation strategies for community-based OHCA response, particularly leveraging digital health innovations to address inequities in emergency care access in low- and middle-income settings.Ethics and disseminationThis protocol was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital (2025R0017-0001).

The Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) is a surveillance system for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We describe results of the organized statewide implementation of Ohio CARES.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of CARES enactment in Ohio. Key elements included: establishment of statewide leadership, appointment of a dedicated coordinator, conversion to a statewide subscription, statewide dissemination of information, fundraising from internal and external stakeholders, and conduct of resuscitation academies. We identified all adult (>18 years) OHCA reported in the registry during 2013-2020. We evaluated OHCA characteristics before (2013-2015) and after (2016-2019) statewide implementation using chi-square test. We evaluated trends in OHCA outcomes using the Cochran-Armitage test of trend.Results: Statewide CARES promotion increased participation from 2 (urban) to 136 (129 urban, 7 rural) EMS agencies. Covered population increased from 1.2 M (10% of state) to 4.8 M (41% of state). After statewide implementation, OHCA populations increased male (58.1% vs 60.8%, p < 0.01), white (50.1% vs 63.7%, p < 0.01), bystander witnessed (26.9% vs 32.9%, p < 0.01) OHCAs.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Suppression of PCK1 attenuates neuronal injury and improves post-resuscitation outcomes,"Cardiac arrest (CA) is a critical medical emergency that can occur in both patients with preexisting conditions and otherwise healthy individuals. Despite successful resuscitation through cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), many survivors are at significant risk of developing post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), a complex systemic response to CA that includes brain injury as a major component. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the first rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, has been implicated in various diseases. However, its role in neuronal damage following CA/CPR remains unclear. To investigate the role of PCK1 in neuronal damage after CA/CPR, we established the CA/CPR animal model and hypoxia/re-oxygenation (H/R) cell model, manipulated PCK1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. We found increased expression of PCK1 in cortical neurons after CA/CPR. In vivo PCK1 overexpression exacerbated brain injury after CA/CPR via augmenting neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. RNA-sequencing suggested PCK1-OE disturbed the neuronal metabolism while immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (IP/MS) revealed that PCK1 contributed to the mitochondrial dysfunction via binding to Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1) and promoting its oligomerization and cytochrome c release. Besides, we confirmed that 3Mercaptopicolinic acid (3-MPA), the PCK1 inhibitor, could ameliorate the mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis of neurons both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time, we identified the detrimental role of PCK1 in post-CA brain injury. During CA/CPR, excessive PCK1 binds to VDAC1, promoting its oligomerization and cytochrome c release which leading to neuronal apoptosis and eventually PCAS. Utilization of 3-MPA during CPR could effectively improve the survival rate and prognosis of mice after CA, which may provide a novel strategy for CA/CPR treatment.",BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE,2025,"Xu, RC; Li, JW; Zhu, J; Guo, F; Zhang, C; Chen, KY; Xu, J",10.1016/j.bbadis.2025.167674,,WOS:001407231700001,A

BackgroundGuidelines advocate that the family should be offered the option to be present during resuscitation, but little is known about family-witnessed cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital and the impact on the patient and their family. DesignA qualitative design consisting of joint in-depth interviews with patients and family members. MethodsFamily interviews were conducted with seven patients and their eight corresponding family members (aged 19-85 years) 4-10 months after a family-witnessed in-hospital cardiac arrest. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The study followed the guidelines outlined in the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. ResultsThe participants felt insignificant and abandoned following the in-hospital cardiac arrest. Surviving patients and their close family members felt excluded, alone and abandoned throughout the care process; relationships, emotions and daily life were affected and gave rise to existential distress. Three themes and eight subordinate themes were identified: (1) the intrusion of death-powerless in the face of the fragility of life, highlights what it is like to suffer a cardiac arrest and to cope with an immediate threat to life; (2) being totally exposed-feeling vulnerable in the care relationship, describes how a lack of care from healthcare staff damaged trust; (3) learning to live again-making sense of an existential threat, pertaining to the family's reactions to a difficult event that impacts relationships but also leads to a greater appreciation of life and a positive view of the future. ConclusionSurviving and witnessing a cardiac arrest in-hospital is a critical event for everyone involved. Patients and family members are vulnerable in this situation and need to be seen and heard, both in the hospital and after hospital discharge. Consequently, healthcare staff need to show compassion and attend to the needs of the family, which involves continually assessing how family members are coping during the process, and providing support and information during and after resuscitation. Relevance to clinical practiceIt is important to provide support to family members who witness the resuscitation of a loved one in-hospital. Structured follow-up care is crucial for cardiac arrest survivors and their families. To promote person-centred care, nurses need interprofessional training on how to support family members during resuscitation, and follow-up care focusing on providing resources for multiple challenges faced by survivors (emotional, cognitive, physical) and families (emotional) is needed.

Between one-quarter (in-hospital CA) and two-thirds (out of hospital CA) of patients admitted comatose to intensive care die of neurological injury. Neuroprognostication determines an informed and timely withdrawal of life sustaining treatment (WLST), sparing the patient unnecessary suffering, alleviating family distress and allowing a more utilitarian use of resources. The latest Resuscitation Council UK (2015) guidance on post-resuscitation care provides the current multi-modal neuroprognostication strategy to predict neurological outcome. Its modalities include neurological examination, neurophysiological tests, biomarkers and radiology. Despite each of the current strategy's predictive modalities exhibiting limitations, meta-analyses show that three, namely PLR (pupillary light reflex), CR (corneal reflex) and N20 SSEP (somatosensory-evoked potential), accurately predict poor neurological outcome with low false positive rates. However, the quality of evidence is low, reducing confidence in the strategy's results. While infrared pupillometry (IRP) is not currently used as a prognostication modality, it can provide a quantitative and objective measure of pupillary size and PLR, giving a definitive view of the second and third cranial nerve activity, a predictor of neurological outcome.",SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,2019,"Monk, A; Patil, S",10.1186/s13643-019-1209-Z,,WOS:001053905400001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Telemedicine for the detection and management of in-hospital and out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest: Status quo and quo vadis,"Telemedicine has revolutionised healthcare by enabling the remote delivery of medical services through secure communication technologies. In cardiology, telemedicine has become invaluable for early diagnosis, emergency care, and chronic disease management, addressing challenges like cost and geographic barriers. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a leading cause of mortality, represents a potential area for telemedicine application, though evidence supporting its direct impact on survival remains limited. Despite resuscitation advancements, SCA survival remains under 5 %, primarily due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Emerging tools-such as wearable sensors, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence-show promise in early warning sign detection; however, most studies remain preliminary, and large-scale validation is lacking. In cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest, telemedicine supports real-time consultations with remote experts. It facilitates adherence to clinical protocols, reduces treatment delays, and integrates cognitive aids to optimize resuscitation efforts. However, existing trials have yielded mixed results, and questions remain regarding feasibility, staffing models, and effective integration during acute events. Telemedicine strengthens the ""chain of survival"" for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through telecommunicator cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), boosting bystander CPR rates and improving survival chances. Nevertheless, concerns about added delays, firstresponder coordination, and variability in system infrastructure remain critical barriers. Post-resuscitation, telemedicine networks enable evidence-based interventions such as targeted temperature management, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness in emergency settings. Moreover, remote monitoring of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators ensures timely care while reducing outpatient clinic burdens. Integrating artificial intelligence enhances telemedicine's potential by enabling personalized care and predictive analytics. However, limited physical examinations, technical issues, and data privacy concerns persist. Furthermore, restricted physical examinations, infrastructure limitations, and data privacy risks continue to hinder the broader adoption of telemedicine. While telemedicine holds potential to reduce mortality in high-risk scenarios like SCA, its current utility is constrained by technological, logistical, and systemic barriers. Continued research, targeted implementation strategies, and evidence-based integration into emergency care pathways are essential to realize its transformative promise.",AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL PLUS: CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,2025,"Goyal, A; Puttaswamy, D; Kadam, E; Maheshwari, S; Hurjkaliani, S; Goyal, P; Thakkar, K; Shah, V; Daoud, M; Mahalwar, G",10.1016/j.ahjo.2025.100600,,WOS:001568191900001,A

However, the true incidence may be much higher, as pulmonary embolism is often clinically underdiagnosed. Thrombolytic therapy is a recognized therapy for pulmonary embolism-associated cardiac arrest but is not routinely recommended during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Therefore, clinicians should attempt to identify patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Many point-of care ultrasound protocols suggest diagnosis of pulmonary embolism for cardiac arrest patients. Case presentation: We describe two male patients (60 years and 66 years, respectively) who presented to the emergency department with cardiac arrest within a period of 1 week. With administration of point-of care ultrasound during the ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation in both patients, fibrinolytic therapy was initiated under suspicion of cardiac arrest caused by pulmonary embolism. Both patients had return of spontaneous circulation; however, only the second patient, who received fibrinolytic therapy relatively early, was discharged with a good outcome. In this report, we discussed how to diagnose and manage patients with cardiac arrest-associated pulmonary embolism with the help of point-of care ultrasound. We also discuss the different clinical outcomes of the two patients based on the experience of the clinicians and the timing of thrombolytic agent application. Conclusions: If acute pulmonary embolism is suspected in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we recommend prompt point-of care ultrasound examination.

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using the American Heart Association's Get with The Guidelines-Resuscitation (R) registry, children with >= 1 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 2007 to 2022 with prearrest vital signs were included. Vital signs most proximate to CPR (10-120 min prior) were classified as abnormal (HR or RR >95th, SBP or DBP <5th percentile for age). Multivariable regression adjusted for age, illness category, prearrest conditions, and prearrest interventions assessed the associations between vital sign abnormalities and outcomes (primary: survival to hospital discharge, secondary: return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC]). Results: Of 2875 IHCA patients meeting inclusion criteria, 1790 (62.3 %) had at least one abnormal vital sign. Patients with vital sign abnormalities were older, had non-surgical illness categories, and higher prevalence of prearrest illnesses and interventions. Low SBP (<5%) was the vital sign with the lowest odds of survival to hospital discharge (aOR 0.56 [95 %CI 0.46-0.68], p < 0.01) and ROSC (aOR 0.63 [95 %CI 0.54-0.73], p < 0.01). There was a stepwise decrease in the adjusted odds of survival for each additional abnormal vital sign (1 vs 0: aOR 0.62 [95 %CI 0.51-0.76], p < 0.01; 2 vs 1: 0.72 [95 %CI 0.53-0.97] p = 0.03; 3 vs 2: 0.53 [95 %CI 0.33-0.86] p < 0.01).

Written information about COPD, CPR and ventilation was provided and consent obtained. The breathing problem-based quality-of-life questionnaire (BP-QoL) was completed. The following information was recorded: age, sex, spirometry, hospital admissions, and antidepressant and oxygen usage in the previous year. Patients were then asked to imagine a scenario in which they were admitted to hospital and their chest condition deteriorated in spite of standard treatment. 'Having reached that stage would you wish to have noninvasive ventilation (NIV), invasive ventilation (IV) or CPR?' Three months later patients were asked to complete a postal patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Of 100 patients 41 were male and the mean age was 74.1 years. Fifty four patients had a FEV1 < 40% and 37 had a FEV1 between 40 and 59% predicted. Twenty-four patients were on long-term oxygen therapy, eight had taken antidepressants and 56 had been admitted to hospital in the previous year. Forty-eight patients wanted all additional treatments to be attempted if needed and 12 wanted none. Nineteen patients said 'no' for CPR and 10 said 'no' for CPR and IV. There was no significant statistical difference between the groups answering 'yes' or 'no'. Seventy-six per cent of patient satisfaction questionnaires were returned. All patients were satisfied with the way they had been approached and the information received, and 98% of them thought that this issue should be discussed with all patients.

Design, setting: Retrospective review of patient care records in a pre-hospital and hospital setting. Participants: Adult patients with OHCA who left the scene and arrived with cardiopulmonary resuscitation in progress at 16 hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, between January 2016 and December 2019. Intervention: For selected patients transported to the ECPR centre, initiation of ECMO. Main outcome measures: Survival to hospital discharge and 12-month quality of life. Results: There were 223 eligible patients during the study period. Of 49 patients transported to the ECPR centre, 23 were commenced on ECMO. Of these, survival to hospital with good neurological recovery (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] score 1/2) occurred in 4/23 patients. Four other patients developed return of spontaneous circulation in the ECPR centre before cannulation of whom one survived, giving overall good functional outcome at 12 months survival of 5/49 (10.2%). There were 174 patients transported to the 15 non-ECPR centres and 3/174 (2%) had good functional outcome at 12 months. After adjustment for baseline differences, the odds ratio for good neurological outcome after transport to an ECPR centre compared with a non-ECPR centre was 4.63 (95% CI, 0.97- 22.11; P = 0.055). Conclusion: The survival rate of patients with refractory OHCA transported to an ECPR centre remains low.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Thrombolysis and cardiac arrest,"Cardiac arrest (CA) is a serious clinical condition that might be responsible in many cases for death, in other at least for development of irreversible multiple organ dysfunctions. During and after the CA a significant coagulopathy develops causing a decrease in proper tissue perfusion even if an early return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved (no-reflow phenomenon). Administration of thrombolytics can solve the problem by destructing the blood clot in both macrocirculation and microcirculation. Results of some clinical trials proving an effectiveness of thrombolysis were published in the literature. Generally, it was done by describing its positive influence on some important clinical outcome measures (24hour survival, number of hospital admissions, better neurological status etc.) without significant increase in the number of bleeding complications. However, recent pivotal evidence based medicine (EBM) trial represented by TROICA study did not confirm the expected positive results. Because of that and also for other reasons (cost, fear of adverse effects, little practice etc.) thrombolysis, although theoretically promising therapeutical intervention, is not overly recommended and used in routine clinical practice in both out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings (Fig. 2, Tab. 4, Ref. 24).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Practice Patterns and Trends in Temperature Control After Cardiac Arrest: A Multi-Specialty Survey,"Background/Objectives: Temperature control after cardiac arrest remains a recommended component of post-cardiac arrest care, yet substantial practice variability persists. Conflicting evidence regarding optimal temperature targets and mixed interpretations of recent trials, such as TTM2, may contribute to inconsistent bedside implementation. Understanding physician knowledge, attitudes, and practice patterns is essential for aligning post-cardiac arrest management with evolving evidence. This study aimed to characterize international physician perceptions of temperature control, patterns of use, understanding of neurologic injury, and the influence of emerging literature. Methods: A 39-item web-based survey was developed through iterative expert review and pilot testing and disseminated to members of critical care, neurology, and emergency medicine societies between September 2021 and January 2022. The instrument assessed demographics, temperature control practices, interpretation of new literature, and post-cardiac arrest management. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics in R Studio, with proportions reported for categorical variables and mode responses for ranked questions. Results: Among 501 respondents, 471 (94%) completed the survey. Most were attending-level physicians (73%), primarily practicing intensive care medicine (75%), and based in academic centers (60%). Targeted temperature management (TTM) was commonly initiated by the admitting intensivist (66%), most often because guidelines recommended it (67%). The most influential factors driving initiation were institutional protocols (21%), perceived neurologic prognosis (17%), and arrest etiology (14%). The most frequently selected temperature target was 36 degrees C (44%). Awareness of the TTM2 trial was high (70%), though only 31% reported altering their practice in response. Neurologists were more likely to individualize temperature targets and select lower temperatures, while physicians caring for higher cardiac arrest volumes also favored lower targets. Community clinicians more commonly selected lower temperature targets compared with those in academic settings. Conclusions: Substantial heterogeneity exists in the practice and rationale for temperature control after cardiac arrest. Physician specialty, cardiac arrest volume, and local practice environment influence the temperature target selection and attitudes toward emerging evidence. Despite awareness of new data, institutional protocols remain the dominant factor guiding implementation. Standardized, evidence-based institutional pathways may help reduce practice variability and promote consistent post-cardiac arrest care.",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,2025,"Carr, CT; Eckert, MB; Bhakta, N; Guirgis, FW; Hopson, C; Maciel, CB; Becker, TK",10.3390/jcm14238592,,WOS:001635029200001,A

This study used a recently developed ecological niche model to reanalyze data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey using 8 environmental variables to build, for the first time, a CPR-based 4D data set (longitude x latitude x depth x day) of plankton abundance. First, we analyzed spatio-temporal changes in the abundance of 4 plankton species daily from 1958 to 2022: 2 diatoms (Ephemera planamembranacea and Odontella sinensis) and 2 calanoid copepods (Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus). We validated our new CPR-based 4D data set with existing in situ data and found that modeled spatio-temporal changes in abundance reproduced observations well. Then, we showed pronounced phenological and biogeographical shifts for the 4 species. Long-term latitudinal shifts in C. finmarchicus and E. planamembranacea were observed and correlated with the Atlantic subarctic gyre state, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Our results also revealed a prominent positive influence of temperature on long-term changes in the abundance of E. planamembranacea, O. sinensis and C. helgolandicus, whereas they identified a negative influence of temperature on C. finmarchicus. Interestingly, our modeled data suggest a rise in the abundance of C. finmarchicus at greater depths during peak seasons, although this depth adjustment in response to changing conditions is unlikely to overcome the overall surface decline of the species.",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,2025,"Castant, J; Vantrepotte, V; Thibault, H; Beaugrand, G",10.3354/meps14945,,WOS:001605984300004,A

It is well recognized that the organic acidemias may be complicated by pancreatitis but less recognized are other metabolic disorders in which pancreatitis can occur. This study shows that long-term follow-up of patients with various metabolic disorders in Korea revealed several with episodes of isolated pancreatitis or diabetes concomitantly with pancreatitis. Results and discussion In this study, two patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), two with propionic acidemia (PPA), one with fatty acid oxidation disorder (FAOD), and one with hyperornithinemia, gyrate atrophy, and juvenile onset diabetes mellitus (DM) were clinically followed for up to 10 - 21 years. Two Korean siblings with MMA showed recurrent pancreatitis from the age of 15 and 19, respectively. The frequency of admission due to pancreatitis was up to 11 times. One patient with MMA developed diabetes mellitus at the age of 20. The other patient with MMA developed recurrent pancreatitis at 4 years and diabetes at 8 years of age. One of the patients with PPA presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. The other PPA patient died of cardiac arrest at age 10. The patient with FAOD presented with pancreatitis at 10 years and died at the age of 15 years due to cardiac arrest. A 35-year-old woman with hyperornithinemia/gyrate atrophy was diagnosed with juvenile onset diabetes at the age of 7 years. No pancreatitis occurred during the follow-up period. Conclusions We conclude that various metabolic disorders can trigger acute or chronic pancreatitis.

Survival in OHCA depends on early diagnosis, alerting Emergency Medical Service (EMS), high-quality bystander resuscitation, and prompt Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) use. Accelerating technological progress supports faster AED retrieval and use, but there are barriers in real-life OHCA situations. The study assesses 6th-year medical students' ability to locate AEDs using smartphones, revealing challenges and proposing solutions.Material & MethodsThe study was conducted in 2022-2023 at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland. Respondents completed a survey on AED knowledge and characteristics, followed by a task to find the nearest AED using their own smartphones. As common sources did not list the University AEDs, respondents were instructed to locate the nearest AED outside the research site.ResultsA total of 300 6th-year medical students took part in the study. Only 3.3% had an AED locating app. Only 32% of students claimed to know where the AED nearest to their home is. All 300 had received AED training, and almost half had been witness to a resuscitation. Out of the 291 medical students who completed the AED location task, the median time to locate the nearest AED was 58 s. Most participants (86.6%) found the AED within 100 s, and over half (53%) did so in under 1 min.ConclusionsNational registration of AEDs should be mandatory.

We aimed to study the trend of OHCA amongst elderly in a large Asian registry to identify if age is independently associated with NIS and factors associated with NIS. Methods: All adult OHCAs aged >= 18 years attended by emergency medical services (EMS) from April 2010 to December 2019 in Singapore was extracted from the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) registry. Cases pronounced dead at scene, non-EMS transported, traumatic OHCAs and OHCAs in ambulances were excluded. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared across four age categories (18-64, 65-79, 80-89, >= 90). Multivariable logistic regression analysis determined the factors associated with NIS. Results: 19,519 eligible cases were analyzed. OHCA incidence increased with age almost doubling in octogenarians (from 312/100,000 in 2011 to 652/100,000 in 2019) and tripling in those >= 90 years (from 458/100,000 in 2011 to 1271/100,000 in 2019). The proportion of patients with NIS improved over time for the 18-64, 65-79- and 80-89-years age groups, with the greatest improvement in the youngest group. NIS decreased with each increasing year of age and minute of response time. NIS increased in the arrests of presumed cardiac etiology, witnessed and bystander CPR.

Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been investigated for its cardioprotective properties in cardiac remodeling and ischemic heart disease, but less is known about its role in CA. The aim of this study was to learn whether Sal B improves cardiac and neurologic outcomes after CA/CPR in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to eight minutes of CA induced by an intravenous injection of potassium chloride (KCl), followed by CPR. After 30 seconds of CPR, mice were blindly randomized to receive either Sal B (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (normal saline) intravenously. Hemodynamic variables and indices of left ventricular function were determined before CA and within three hours after CPR, the early postresuscitation period. Sal B administration resulted in a remarkable decrease in the time required for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in animals that successfully resuscitated compared to the vehicle-treated mice. Myocardial performance, including cardiac output and left ventricular systolic (dp/dt(max)) and diastolic (dp/dt(min)) function, was clearly ameliorated within three hours of ROSC in the Sal B-treated mice. Moreover, Sal B inhibited CA/CPR-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and preserved mitochondrial morphology and function. Mechanistically, Sal B dramatically promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation through the downregulation of Keap1, which resulted in the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 and NQO1, thereby counteracted the oxidative damage in response to CA/CPR. The aforementioned antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects of Sal B were impaired in the setting of gene silencing of Nrf2 with siRNA in vitro model. These improvements were associated with better neurological function and increased survival rate (75% vs. 40%,p<0.05) up to 72 hours postresuscitation. Our findings suggest that the administration of Sal B improved cardiac function and neurological outcomes in a murine model of CA via activating the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CA.",OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY,2020,"Ji, QQ; Li, YJ; Wang, YH; Wang, Z; Fang, L; Shen, L; Lu, YQ; Shen, LH; He, B",10.1155/2020/1605456,,WOS:000552764700001,A

Despite aggressive supportive care and use of targeted temperature management, half of adults do not live to hospital discharge and nearly one-third of survivors have significant neurologic injury. Development of neuroprotective therapeutics is critical to improving outcomes. One promising readily available agent that has shown benefit is carbon monoxide (CO). Methods: We utilize a swine model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest to assess the therapeutic effect of CO on cellular measures. All animals underwent VF arrest followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation until achievement of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or the 20 min mark. One hour following ROSC, animals were randomized to the Cardiac Arrest group (VF alone) versus the CO group (VF treated with CO). Animals in the CO group were administered low dose CO of 200 ppm for two hours. At three hours post-ROSC period, all animals were euthanized for tissue and blood collection for mitochondrial respiration (cortical and hippocampal tissue) and the downstream biomolecular analysis.

Many initiatives have been implemented to increase the engagement of communities in early basic life support (BLS) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially of lay people with no duty to respond. A better knowledge of the most effective initiatives might help improve survival and health system organization. Aim of the scoping review: To assess the impact of specific interventions involving lay communities on bystander BLS rates and other consistent clinical outcomes, and to identify relevant knowledge gaps. Methods: This scoping review was part of the continuous evidence evaluation process of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), and was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We performed a literature search using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until 1 February 2021. The screening process was conducted based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and for each included study, we performed data extraction focusing on the type of intervention implemented, and the impact of these interventions on the specific OHCAs outcomes. Results: Our search strategy identified 19 eligible studies, originating mainly from the USA (47.4%) and Denmark (21%). The type of intervention included in 57.9% of cases was a community CPR training program, in 36.8% bundled interventions, and in 5.3% mass-media campaigns. The most commonly reported outcome for OHCAs was bystander CPR rate (94.7%), followed by survival to hospital discharge (36.8%), proportion of people trained (31.6%), survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome (21%), and Return of Spontaneous Circulation (10.5%). Community training programs and bundled interventions improved bystander CPR in most of the included studies.

GBI (16 min) resulted in severe neurologic deficit (monkeys unable to sit, stand, walk or feed themselves), but with long term survival. Brain histopathological analyses revealed a combination of cortical and brainstem lesions. Most severe changes were observed in the occipital (calcarine) cortex with less severe damage in the frontal and temporal regions.

Late presentations, ranging from asymptomatic cases to sudden cardiac arrest, are exceptionally rare. This unique case highlights the complexity of managing ALCAPA in adulthood and underscores the necessity of a comprehensive surgical approach addressing both coronary and valvular issues.PresentationA 34-year-old female patient, who had been diagnosed with ALPACA in her early childhood, suffered sudden cardiac arrest at work, followed by out-of-hospital resuscitation. The patient had been followed-up regularly until adolescence, however, she had refused surgery. In the diagnostic work-up following successful resuscitation severe mitral valve regurgitation was additionally revealed. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgery, involving coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), using bilateral internal mammary arteries, and mitral valve repair, with an excellent postsurgical result. At 16-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and quality of life had significantly improved.ConclusionThis rare case initially presented as silent myocardial ischemia, resulting in reduced left ventricular function and secondary mitral incompetence. Surgical treatment of ALCAPA in adults poses greater challenges and a higher risk than in children.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show promise in TBI treatment through their secretome (conditioned media, CM). A low-molecular-weight (<700 Da) CM fraction with neuroprotective effects comparable to total CM after acute brain injury in vitro is previously identified. Here, it is aimed at identifying key bioactive factors, reconstituting them into a synthetic cocktail (SYNT), and evaluating its efficacy in TBI models. Metabolomic profiling identified three prostaglandins and kynurenine, which are used to create SYNT. The SYNT formulation reduced cell death, neuronal damage, and induced protective gene expression changes associated with neuronal protection and microglia modulation toward beneficial phenotype after TBI in vitro. In vivo, SYNT conferred similar long-term functional benefits as CM, improving sensorimotor function up to 6 months and memory preservation at 4 months compared to saline-treated animals, though only CM reduced contusion volume at 5 months. Both treatments modulated neuroinflammation, evidenced by reduced microglial activation and astrogliosis in the pericontusional tissue at 6 months. These findings demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of MSC-secretome treatment in TBI and highlight prostaglandins and kynurenine as key mediators of this response.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,A REVIEW OF CHEST COMPRESSION INTERRUPTIONS DURING OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST AND STRATEGIES FOR THE FUTURE,"Background: It has been known for many years that interrupting chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) leads directly to negative outcomes. Interruptions in chest compressions occur for a variety of reasons, including provider fatigue and switching of compressors, performance of ventilations, placement of invasive airways, application of CPR devices, pulse and rhythm determinations, vascular access placement, and patient transfer to the ambulance. Despite significant resuscitation guideline changes in the last decade, several studies have shown that chest compressions are still frequently interrupted or poorly executed during OHCA resuscitations. Indeed, the American Heart Association has made great strides to improve outcomes by placing a greater emphasis on uninterrupted chest compressions. As highly trained health care providers, why do we still interrupt chest compressions? And are any of these interruptions truly necessary? Objectives: This article aims to review the clinical effects of both high-quality chest compressions and the effects that interruptions during chest compressions have clinically on patient outcomes. Discussion: The causes of chest compression interruptions are explored from both provider and team perspectives. Current and future methods are introduced that may prompt the provider to reduce unnecessary interruptions during chest compressions. Conclusions: New and future technologies may provide promising results, but the greatest benefit will always be a well-directed, organized, and proactive team of providers performing excellent-quality and continuous chest compressions during CPR.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Quantitative effects of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices in rural American emergency medical services: a retrospective cohort study,"BackgroundEmergency medical service agencies increasingly utilize medical devices which perform external chest compressions during cardiac arrest. Due to the unique staffing and budget considerations of the rural emergency medical services environment, an investigation of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this setting is warranted. Studying the effects of new technologies in the rural environment promotes improvement of the standard of rural prehospital care. This study evaluated the effect of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation use on rural out-of-hospital cardiac arrest performance measures.MethodsFive hundred eighty-five rural cardiac arrests were assessed from National Emergency Medical Services Information System 2017-2019 data. Using both linear and logistic multivariate regression analysis, the effect of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the incidence of a return of spontaneous circulation, the first defibrillation interval, and the first cardiac epinephrine administration interval was assessed.ResultsIn rural cardiac arrest with initial presentation of a shockable rhythm, the use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices delayed initial defibrillation by 21.5% (p < 0.05). A 15.1% (p < 0.05) delay in first administration of epinephrine was also found when mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation was used. Incidence of return of spontaneous circulation was unchanged between manual and mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation conditions.ConclusionsCurrent rural mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation device use can have a negative effect on prompt delivery of vital interventions. Our findings suggest that improvements to equipment training may help remedy improper utilization of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices. Delaying application of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices until time-sensitive interventions are complete may result in a better standard of care.

This study aimed to identify distinct sub-phenotypes among patients with OHCA who undergo ECPR and to investigate their association with clinical outcomes.MethodsThis multi-center, retrospective, observational study used the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry from 83 hospitals that performed ECPR among 91 participating centers between June 2014 and December 2020. We included adult patients with OHCA who received ECPR during cardiac arrest. Three-class latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to identify sub-phenotypes based on 15 variables, including pre- and in-hospital factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between sub-phenotypes and 30-day survival and neurological outcomes.ResultsA total of 1528 patients were included. The median low-flow time was 47 min (interquartile rage: 38-58 min). The 30-day survival rate for eligible patients was 20.9%. LCA identified three distinct sub-phenotypes: Standard ECPR Group (n = 702), Delayed ECPR Group (n = 457), and Non-shockable Rhythm Group (n = 369). The variables with high discriminative power in the LCA was low-flow time, followed by pre-hospital shock delivery and initial cardiac rhythm. Thirty-day survival rates varied significantly among the sub-phenotypes (p = 0.001): Standard ECPR Group (26.9%), Delayed ECPR Group (17.1%), and Non-shockable Rhythm Group (14.1%). Favorable neurological outcomes at 30 days also differed significantly (p = 0.004), with the Standard ECPR Group showing the highest rate (12.1%). After adjusting for covariates, both the Delayed ECPR Group (adjusted OR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.82) and Non-shockable Rhythm Group (adjusted OR: 0.47, 95% CI 0.32-0.68) had significantly lower odds of 30-day survival compared to the Standard ECPR Group.ConclusionsThree clinically meaningful sub-phenotypes were identified using simple pre-hospital and in-hospital factors, with low-flow time emerging as the most critical discriminating factor. The sub-phenotypes showed significant associations with clinical outcomes and provide a practical framework for ECPR patient stratification. These findings suggest that timing optimization may be as important as rhythm characteristics for ECPR patient selection and support the development of sub-phenotype-specific treatment strategies.",CRITICAL CARE,2025,"Kashiura, M; Kishihara, Y; Tamura, H; Amagasa, S; Yasuda, H; Moriya, T",10.1186/s13054-025-05575-5,,WOS:001535191000002,A

In this study, we aim to (i) investigate the extraction level of forest resources under short and long-term property rights, and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of introducing mechanisms that leverage reputation and feelings of guilt in promoting cooperation among CPR users with short-term property rights to reduce over-harvesting. We develop a simple theoretical model to predict the optimal extraction level of a shared forest resource and validate the predictions using data from a framed field experiment conducted in rural Ethiopia. Our findings demonstrate that extraction levels under short-term property rights are higher compared to long-term property rights, aligning with the model predictions. Leveraging reputation and feelings of guilt is effective in bridging the gap in extraction intensity between shortand long-term property rights. However, as implementing reputation requires reliable monitoring that can be costly and challenging in the study context, we propose extending the duration of property rights over shared forest resources as a preferred strategy for curtailing over-extraction.",FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,2024,"Tegenie, YA; Sparrow, R; Bulte, E; Bongers, F",10.1016/j.forpol.2024.103280,,WOS:001345491600001,A

Timely identification, resuscitation, and aggressive surgical management have significantly decreased inpatient mortality. However, reduced inpatient mortality has shifted the burden of disease to long-term mortality associated with persistent organ dysfunction. METHODS We performed a combined analysis of NSTI patients from the AB103 Clinical Composite Endpoint Study in Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections randomized-controlled interventional trial (ATB-202) and comprehensive administrative database (ATB-204) to determine the association of persistent organ dysfunction on inpatient and long-term outcomes. Persistent organ dysfunction was defined as a modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) score of 2 or greater at Day 14 (D14) after NSTI diagnosis, and resolution of organ dysfunction defined as mSOFA score of 1 or less. RESULTS The analysis included 506 hospitalized NSTI patients requiring surgical debridement, including 247 from ATB-202, and 259 from ATB-204. In both study cohorts, age and comorbidity burden were higher in the D14 mSOFA >= 2 group. Patients with D14 mSOFA score of 1 or less had significantly lower 90-day mortality than those with mSOFA score of 2 or higher in both ATB-202 (2.4% vs. 21.5%; p < 0.001) and ATB-204 (6% vs. 16%: p = 0.008) studies. In addition, in an adjusted covariate analysis of the combined study data sets D14 mSOFA score of 1 or lesss was an independent predictor of lower 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.53; p = 0.001). In both studies, D14 mSOFA score of 1 or less was associated with more favorable discharge status and decreased resource utilization. CONCLUSION For patients with NSTI undergoing surgical management, persistent organ dysfunction at 14 days, strongly predicts higher resource utilization, poor discharge disposition, and higher long-term mortality.

A prognostic scoring tool for adults, The Brain Death After Cardiac Arrest (BDCA) score, was recently developed and validated. We aimed to validate this score in pediatric patients.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients admitted to 5 PICUs after OHCA between 2011 and 2021. We extracted BDCA score elements for those who survived at least 24 hours but died as a result of their OHCA. We assessed score discrimination for the definitive outcome of brain death.

Patients with ARDS have higher hospital mortality rates and reduced long-term pulmonary function and quality of life. It is, therefore, important to prevent ALI converting to ARDS. This study evaluated 17 risk factors potentially associated with the conversion from ALI to ARDS in severe multiple trauma. The results indicate that the impact of pulmonary contusion, APACHE II score, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation may help to predict conversion from ALI to ARDS in the early phase after multiple-trauma injury. Trauma duration, in particular, strongly impacted the short- and long-term development of ALI.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,A Motorcycle Paramedic Increases the Survival Rate of Patients after OHCA,"Background and Objectives: Despite advancements in modern medicine, the survival rate of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains low. The proportion of OHCA patients who could be saved under ideal circumstances is unknown. A significant portion of patients experience cardiac arrest due to irreversible conditions. The survival of patients with reversible causes depends on the prompt initiation of basic life support (BLS) and early defibrillation. In order to increase the chances of survival, the motorcycle paramedic (MP) project was implemented in Ljubljana in 2003. The MP is equipped with an AED. In the case of OHCA with a shockable rhythm, he performs defibrillation before the arrival of the emergency medical team (EMT). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the MP, by reducing response times to OHCA patients, increases the survival and outcome of these patients compared to the EMT. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of OHCA cases within the area covered by Ljubljana Emergency Medical Service (EMS) was conducted for the period from January 2003 to December 2022. Instances where the MP arrived at the scene before the EMT were considered MP interventions and classified as the MP group; all other interventions were classified as the EMT group. Results: Between January 2003 and December 2022, the EMT performed resuscitation on 3352 patients. In 316 cases, the MP was simultaneously activated and arrived at the scene before the EMT. The response time in the MP group was shorter compared to the EMT group (7.7 +/- 4.1 min vs. 9.9 +/- 6.5 min, p < 0.001). In 16 patients, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved before the arrival of the EMT. The MP group had a higher ROSC rate, a larger proportion of patients were discharged from the hospital and there were more patients with a good neurological outcome compared to the EMT group (44.3% vs. 36.9%, p = 0.009; 18.7% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.005; 15.9% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.004, respectively).

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Predicting neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with cumulative information; development and internal validation of an artificial neural network algorithm,"BackgroundPrognostication of neurological outcome in patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest resuscitation is complex. Clinical variables, as well as biomarkers of brain injury, cardiac injury, and systemic inflammation, all yield some prognostic value. We hypothesised that cumulative information obtained during the first three days of intensive care could produce a reliable model for predicting neurological outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) using artificial neural network (ANN) with and without biomarkers.MethodsWe performed a post hoc analysis of 932 patients from the Target Temperature Management trial. We focused on comatose patients at 24, 48, and 72 h post-cardiac arrest and excluded patients who were awake or deceased at these time points. 80% of the patients were allocated for model development (training set) and 20% for internal validation (test set). To investigate the prognostic potential of different levels of biomarkers (clinically available and research-grade), patients' background information, and intensive care observation and treatment, we created three models for each time point: (1) clinical variables, (2) adding clinically accessible biomarkers, e.g., neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and (3) adding research-grade biomarkers, e.g., neurofilament light (NFL). Patient outcome was the dichotomised Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at six months; a good outcome was defined as CPC 1-2 whilst a poor outcome was defined as CPC 3-5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for all test sets.ResultsAUROC remained below 90% when using only clinical variables throughout the first three days in the ICU. Adding clinically accessible biomarkers such as NSE, AUROC increased from 82 to 94% (p<0.01). The prognostic accuracy remained excellent from day 1 to day 3 with an AUROC at approximately 95% when adding research-grade biomarkers. The models which included NSE after 72 h and NFL on any of the three days had a low risk of false-positive predictions while retaining a low number of false-negative predictions.ConclusionsIn this exploratory study, ANNs provided good to excellent prognostic accuracy in predicting neurological outcome in comatose patients post OHCA.

Methods: National level OHCA registry data from 2012 through to 2020, relating to unwitnessed, and bystander witnessed OHCA were interrogated. Logistic regression models were built by including predictors through stepwise variable selection and enhancing the models by adding pair wise interactions that improved fit. Missing data sensitivity analyses were conducted using multiple imputation. Results: The data included 18,177 cases. The final model included seventeen variables. Of these nine variables were involved in pairwise interactions. The COVID-19 period was associated with reduced survival (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.43, 0.87), as were increasing age in years (OR 0.96,95% CI 0.96, 0.97) and call response interval in minutes (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96, 0.99). Amiodarone administration (OR 3.91, 95% CI 2.80, 5.48), urban location (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.12, 1.77), and chronological year overtime (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08, 1.20) were associated with increased survival. Conclusions: National survival from OHCA has significantly increased incrementally over time in Ireland. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased survival even after accounting for potential disruption to key elements of bystander and EMS care.

This case series aims to describe the number, type, etiology, and outcome of OHCAs treated by a UK-based specialist sports medicine provider over a period of 8 y.Methods-The medical records of a UK-based sports medicine provider were reviewed from 2014 to 2022. Anonymized information from OHCAs during this time was recorded. This included type of event, patient demographics, details of OHCA, and patient outcomes. Results-Ten OHCAs were identified during the course of 110 sporting events. These included the cases of 9 participants and 1 spectator. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved on site in all patients. Eight survived beyond 24 h and achieved a full neurological recovery. Seventy percent of these patients achieved ROSC within 4 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation being initiated.

Fortunately, compared with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent spikes in COVID-19 inci-dence seem to show an increase of lesser magni-tude of cardiac arrest despite an overall increase in COVID-19 infections. As health care systems have adapted, experience gained from the first wave may have led to better management of patients with COVID-19, allocation of resources, and eval-uation of non-COVID medical issues. Efforts at mass vaccination continue and will reduce the severity of disease leading to less severe compli-cations for those with COVID-19.

Universally available ECG character-istics such as QRS duration (QRSd) and heart rate (HR) may develop differently in patients who obtain ROSC or not. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively how QRSd and HR as biomarkers predict the immediate outcome of patients with PEA.Method: We investigated 327 episodes of IHCA in 298 patients at two US and one Norwegian hospital. We assessed the ECG in 559 segments of PEA nested within episodes, measuring QRSd and HR during pauses of compressions, and noted the clinical state that immediately followed PEA. We investigated the development of HR, QRSd, and transitions to ROSC or no-ROSC (VF/VT, asystole or death) in a joint longitudinal and com-peting risks statistical model.Results: Higher HR, and a rising HR, reflect a higher transition intensity (""hazard"") to ROSC (p < 0.001), but HR was not associated with the tran-sition intensity to no-ROSC. A lower QRSd and a shrinking QRSd reflect an increased transition intensity to ROSC (p = 0.023) and a reduced tran-sition intensity to no-ROSC (p = 0.002).Conclusion: HR and QRSd convey information of the immediate outcome during resuscitation from PEA.

Our objective was to estimate the time needed to perform resuscitation with a drone-delivered AED and to measure cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality. METHODS: Mock out-of-hospital cardiac arrest simulations that included a 9-1-1 call, CPR, and drone-delivered AED were conducted. Each simulation was timed and video-recorded. CPR performance metrics were recorded by a Laerdal Resusci Anne Quality Feedback System. Multivariable regression modeling examined factors associated with time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock and CPR quality metrics (compression rate, depth, recoil, and chest compression fraction). Comparisons were made among those with recent CPR training (<= 2 years) versus no recent (>2 years) or prior CPR training. RESULTS: We recruited 51 research participants between September 2019 and March 2020. The median age was 34 (Q1-Q3, 23-54) years, 56.9% were female, and 41.2% had recent CPR training. The median time from 9-1-1 call to initiation of CPR was 1:19 (Q1-Q3, 1:06-1:26) minutes. A median time of 1:59 (Q1-Q3, 01:50-02:20) minutes was needed to retrieve a drone-delivered AED and deliver a shock. The median CPR compression rate was 115 (Q1-Q3, 109-124) beats per minute, the correct compression depth percentage was 92% (Q1-Q3, 25-98), and the chest compression fraction was 46.7% (Q1-Q3, 39.9%-50.6%). Recent CPR training was not associated with CPR quality or time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock. Younger age (per 10-year increase; beta, 9.97 [95% CI, 4.63-15.31] s; P<0.001) and prior experience with AED (beta, -30.0 [95% CI, -50.1 to -10.0] s; P=0.004) were associated with more rapid time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock. Prior AED use (beta, 6.71 [95% CI, 1.62-11.79]; P=0.011) was associated with improved chest compression fraction percentage. CONCLUSION: Research participants were able to rapidly retrieve an AED from a drone while largely maintaining CPR quality according to American Heart Association guidelines.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Association of Histones With Coagulofibrinolytic Responses and Organ Dysfunction in Adult Post-cardiac Arrest Syndrome,"BackgroundPatients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest often develop organ dysfunction caused by systemic inflammation and increased coagulation, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The involvement of histones in DIC and organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis and trauma has been previously reported, raising the probability that histones may also be associated with pathophysiology in patients after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. This study evaluated the relationship between histones and organ dysfunction related to coagulofibrinolytic changes in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). MethodsThis prospective single-center observational study assessed 35 adult patients with PCAS who were divided into two groups, i.e., 15 patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and 20 patients without MODS. MODS was defined as a sequential organ failure assessment score of >= 12. The plasma levels of histones and coagulofibrinolytic markers, including soluble fibrin, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), and soluble thrombomodulin, were measured in patients with PCAS immediately after admission to the emergency department, and 3 and 24 h after arriving at the hospital. ResultsPCAS patients with MODS had higher DIC scores [4 (3.0-5.0) vs. 1 (0.0-3.0), p = 0.012] and higher mortality rates (66.7% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.013) than those without MODS. Moreover, patients with MODS exhibited higher histone levels than those without MODS during the early phase of the post-resuscitation period. Severe endothelial injury and higher thrombin and plasmin generation were observed in the MODS group. Plasma levels of histones were positively correlated with those of soluble fibrin immediately after resuscitation (rho = 0.367, p = 0.030) and PIC 3 h after arriving at the hospital (rho = 0.480, p = 0.005). This correlation was prominent in the patient population with MODS (soluble fibrin: rho = 0.681, p = 0.005, PIC: rho = 0.742, p = 0.002). ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that elevated histone levels were associated with increased levels of thrombin, and subsequent plasmin generation in PCAS patients, especially those with MODS.

ARCAPA is a rare congenital anomaly that is associated with possible long-term complications including myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction. Clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic murmur to angina, dyspnea, fatigue, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and even cardiac arrest. Case Description: We present a case of a 52-year-old male who presented to the hospital for intermittent chest pain. The patient was vitally stable and examination was unremarkable. Upon workup, electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission showed no acute ischemic changes and troponin were <0.03 ng/mL. The patient was evaluated by cardiology and had a dobutamine stress echocardiogram (ECHO) for ischemic evaluation. During the recovery phase of dobutamine stress ECHO, the patient reported having 10/10 chest pain with a drop in blood pressure to 90 mmHg systolic. He was subsequently given sublingual nitroglycerin and fluids. Pain did resolve and blood pressure improved after treatment. No wall motion abnormalities were noted on ECHO, but there were inferior ST depressions on EKG during the stress portion of the test. The patient had repeated blood work after the stress test which showed an elevated troponin level of 0.08 ng/mL. The patient was taken to the catheterization lab for diagnostic coronary angiogram. Cardiac catheterization showed a right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the pulmonary artery and diagnosis of isolated ARCAPA was made because of his intermittent chest pain. No intervention was performed as no significant lesions were found. The patient was started on medical therapy including aspirin, beta blocker and statin. The patient did not want to pursue surgery at that point and he did not want any further intervention. He was discharged home with instructions to follow up with cardiology in an outpatient setting to be referred for surgical repair.

The recognition of cardiac arrest by dispatcher is a key factor for successful DA-CPR. In this study, we evaluated the association between pediatric age and dispatcher recognition. Methods: A retrospective observational study was designed using a nationwide OHCA registry. Patients under 19 years of age were enrolled. Patients were categorized into four groups according to age (<1 year, 1-6 years, 7-13 years, and 14-18 years). The primary outcome was cardiac arrest recognition by dispatcher. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: A total of 2754 pediatric OHCA patients were enrolled. A negative trend was observed between age and dispatcher performance (p < 0.01). The rate of cardiac arrest recognition was highest in patients under one year of age (61.5%) and lowest in patients ages 14-18 years old (47.1%). Patients in the 7-13 years and 14-18 years age groups were both associated with a decreased rate of recognition (adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval: 0.55 (0.41-0.74) and 0.44 (0.34-0.57), respectively). In the interaction analysis, the association between age and outcomes was more prominent in patients with non-medical causes.Conclusion: Patients ages 7-18 years old were negatively associated with cardiac arrest recognition and DA-CPR instruction provision within optimal timeframes compared to those younger than one year old.

Upon admission, echocardiography revealed ventricular septal rupture (VSR). The patient was promptly supported via venoarterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and Impella CP before surgical VSR repair on the 12th day of admission. Following surgery, the patient decided to be transferred to the intensive care unit under new VA-ECMO assistance. Subsequently, Impella CP removal and arterial cannula reinsertion were performed at the ipsilateral site, with no pulsatile bleeding observed from the arterial cannulation site. Emergency aortography revealed a contrast defect at the terminal aorta. Owing to the possibility of acute thrombotic occlusion, the Fogarty procedure was performed through the bilateral common femoral artery (CFA); however, no thrombus retrieved. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed complete occlusion of the bilateral common iliac arteries, extending to the abdominal aorta. The uncontrollable, rapid progression of acidemia resulted in sudden cardiac arrest. Acute arterial occlusion leading to fatal outcomes can occur because of thrombosis following long-term Impella CP use. Impella-associated thrombi can form around the shaft of a mixed area of blood flow caused by the interaction between Impella and ECMO and often develop distal to the aortic arch, which is often overlooked during routine examinations. Therefore, planning for long-term Impella with ECMO support must utilize various imaging modalities to search for thrombi and prepare several means of revascularization during Impella removal.",JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS,2025,"Kishimoto, S; Hiraoka, A; Chikazawa, G; Yoshitaka, H",10.1007/s10047-025-01499-7,,WOS:001441583200001,A

The aim of this study was to develop a reliable pulse detection algorithm using the electrocardiogram (ECG) and thoracic impedance (TI), the signals available in most defibrilators. The dataset used in the study consisted of 1140 ECG and TI segments from 187 OHCA patients, whereof 792 were labelled as pulse-generating rhythm (PR) and 348 as pulseless electrical activity (PEA) by a pool of experts in OHCA. First, an adaptive filtering scheme was used to extract the impedance circulation component and its first derivative from the TI. Then, the wavelet decomposition of the ECG was carried out to obtain the different subband components and the denoised ECG. Pulse/no-pulse (PR/PEA) discrimination features were extracted from those signals and fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that made the pulse/no-pulse decision. A quasi-stratified and patient wise nested cross validation procedure was used to select the best feature subset and to tune the SVM hyperparameters. This procedure was repeated 50 times to estimate the statistical distributions of the performance metrics of the method. The optimal solution consisted in a five feature classifier that yielded a mean (standard deviation) sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy and total accuracy of 92.4% (0.7), 93.0% (0.8), 92.7% (0.5) and 92.6% (0.5), respectively.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,The Chemistry of Lyophilized Blood Products,"With the development of new biologics and bioconjugates, storage and preservation have become more critical than ever before. Lyophilization is a method of cell and protein preservation by removing a solvent such as water from a substance followed by freezing. This technique has been used in the past and still holds promise for overcoming logistic challenges in safety net hospitals with limited blood banking resources, austere environments such as combat, and mass casualty situations where existing resources may be outstripped. This method allows for long-term storage and transport but requires the bioconjugation of preservatives to prevent cell destabilization. Trehalose is utilized as a bioconjugate in platelet and red blood cell preservation to maintain protein thermodynamics and stabilizing protein formulations in liquid and freeze-dried states. Biomimetic approaches have been explored as alternatives to cryo- and lyopreservation of blood components. Intravascular hemostats such as PLGA nanoparticles functionalized with PEG motifs, topical hemostats utilizing fibrinogen or chitosan, and liposomal encapsulated hemoglobin with surface modifications are effectively stored long-term through bioconjugation. In thinking about the best methods for storage and transport, we are focusing this topical review on blood products that have the longest track record of preservation and looking at how these methods can be applied to synthetic systems.",BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY,2018,"Fernandez-Moure, J; Maisha, N; Lavik, EB; Cannon, JW",10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00271,,WOS:000439531800003,A

Despite intensive efforts the outcome has remained relatively poor over many years. In specific situations, new technologies, such as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) could significantly improve survival with a good neurological outcome. Objective Does the immediate restoration of circulation and reoxygenation via eCPR influence the survival rate after OHCA? Is eCPR the new link in the chain of survival? Material and methods Discussion of current study results and guideline recommendations. Results The overall survival rates after OHCA have remained at 10-30% over many years. Despite low case numbers more recent retrospective studies showed that an improved outcome can be achieved with eCPR. In selected patient collectives survival with a favorable neurological outcome is possible in 38% of the cases. Conclusion Survival after cardiac arrest and the subsequent quality of life dependent on many different factors. The time factor, i.e. the avoidance of a no-flow phase and reduction of the low-flow phase is of fundamental importance. The immediate restoration of the circulation and oxygen supply by eCPR can significantly improve survival; however, large randomized, controlled trials are currently not available.",ANAESTHESIST,2020,"Lotz, C; Muellenbach, RM; Meybohm, P; Rolfes, C; Wulf, H; Reyher, C",10.1007/s00101-020-00787-6,,WOS:000535261700001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Immediate post-ECPR management strategies in the prehospital and critical care transport medicine environments,"Despite advancements in care, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has a low survival rate. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown improved outcomes in select cases, notably in the ARREST trial. However, ECPR is resource-intensive and limited to specialized centers, restricting access in many regions. Estimates suggest only 2-10% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients are ECPR candidates. Advanced systems initiating ECPR in prehospital environments or non-ECMO-capable centers have shown promise. As ECPR utilization increases, so does the need for transport to ECMO-capable centers. Unlike conventional out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care, high-quality evidence for post-resuscitation management of ECPR patients is lacking. This review provides suggestions for the immediate post-resuscitation management (4-6 h) of ECPR patients in prehospital settings, the critical care transport medicine environment, and at non-ECMO-capable centers. Goals include treating the precipitating cause of cardiac arrest, maintaining end-organ perfusion, optimizing oxygen delivery, promoting myocardial recovery, and preventing complications associated with V-A ECMO.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Prognostic factors associated with favourable functional outcome among adult patients requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), has demonstrated promise in the management of refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, evidence from observational studies and clinical trials are conflicting and the factors influencing outcome have not been well established. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the association between pre-ECPR prognostic factors and likelihood of good functional outcome among adult patients requiring ECPR for OHCA. We searched Medline and Embase databases from inception to February 28, 2023 and screened studies with two independent reviewers. We performed meta-analyses of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, adjusted hazard ratios and mean differences separately. We assessed risk of bias using the QUIPS tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Findings: We included 29 observational and randomized studies involving 7,397 patients. Factors with moderate or high certainty of association with increased survival with favourable functional outcome include pre-arrest patient factors, such as younger age (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.99) and female sex (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.70), as well as intra-arrest factors, such as shockable rhythm (OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.04 to 3.80), witnessed arrest (OR 1.68 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.42), bystander CPR (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.01), return of spontaneous circulation (OR 2.81, 95% CI 2.19 to 3.61) and shorter time to cannulation (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.69 per 10 minutes). Interpretation: The findings of this review confirm several clinical concepts wellestablished in the cardiac arrest literature and their applicability to the patient for whom ECPR is considered - that is, the impact of pre-existing patient factors, the benefit of timely and effective CPR, as well as the prognostic importance of minimizing low-flow time. We advocate for the thoughtful consideration of these prognostic factors as part of a risk stratification framework when evaluating a patient's potential candidacy for ECPR.",RESUSCITATION,2023,"Tran, A; Rochwerg, B; Fan, E; Belohlavek, J; Suverein, MM; van de Poll, MCG; Lorusso, R; Price, S; Yannopoulos, D; MacLaren, G; Ramanathan, K; Ling, RR; Thiara, S; Tonna, JE; Shekar, K; Hodgson, CL; Scales, DC; Sandroni, C; Nolan, JP; Slutsky, AS; Combes, A; Brodie, D; Fernando, SM",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.110004,,WOS:001109594500001,A

Hyperglycemia is common in the early period following resuscitation from cardiac arrest and has been shown to be a predictor of neurologic outcome in retrospective studies. Objective. To evaluate neurologic outcome and early postarrest hyperglycemia in a swine cardiac arrest model. Methods. Electrically induced ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest was induced in 22 anesthetized and instrumented swine. After 7 minutes, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support were initiated. Twenty-one animals were resuscitated and plasma glucose concentration was measured at intervals for 60 minutes after resuscitation. The animals were observed for 72 hours and the neurologic score was determined at 24-hour intervals. Results. Ten animals had a peak plasma glucose value >= a parts per thousand yen226 mg/dL during the initial 60 minutes after resuscitation. The neurologic scores at 72 hours in these animals (mean score == 0, mean overall cerebral performance category == 1) were the same as those in the animals with a peak plasma glucose value < 226 mg/dL. The end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) values measured during CPR, times to restoration of spontaneous circulation, and epinephrine doses were not significantly different between the animals with a peak glucose concentration >= a parts per thousand yen226 mg/dL and those with lower values. The sample size afforded a power of 95%% to detect a 50-point difference from the lowest score (0 points) of the porcine neurologic outcome scale. Conclusion. In this standard porcine model of witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, early postresuscitation stress hyperglycemia did not appear to affect neurologic outcome.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training of the next of kin of at-risk patients is thus potentially beneficial. The aim of our study was to document the prevalence of appropriate training among cardiac patients' cohabitants, as well as the motivations or obstacles to seeking training. 153 cohabitants of 127 patients who were hospitalized 1 year prior for confirmed coronary disease in a cardiology department (Paris, France) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire between October 2013 and March 2014. 38 % of interrogated cohabitants had received CPR training, and in two-thirds of the cases, their training was undertaken prior to the onset of the patient's heart disease. The training received was often a single instruction session. Half took place more than 5 years prior to the interview. For two-thirds of interrogated families, the reasons they sought training were related to professional or military duties. Training undertaken solely due to cohabitation with a patient affected by coronary disease represented only 3.5 % of the trained respondents. A lack of information regarding existing training programs and a lack of concrete propositions were given as the main barriers to seeking training. The families of patients who are at-risk for cardiac arrests that were interrogated in our study are inadequately trained in CPR.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Current and Future Status of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"Numerous series, propensity-matched trials, and meta-analyses suggest that appropriate use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) for in-hospital cardiac arrest (INCA) can be lifesaving. Even with an antecedent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) duration in excess of 45 minutes, 30-day survival with favourable neurologic outcome using E-CPR is approximately 35%-45%. Survival may be related to age, duration of CPR, or etiolcigy. Associated complications include sepsis, renal failure, limb and neurologic complications, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. However, methodological biases including small sample size, selection bias, publication bias, and inability to control for confounders-in these series prevent definitive conclusions. As such, the 2015 American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines update recommended E-CPR as a Level of Evidence IIb recommendation in appropriate cases. The absence of high-quality evidence presents an opportunity for clinician/scientists to generate practice-defining data through collaborative investigation and prospective trials. A multidisciplinary dialogue is required to standardize the field and promote multicentre investigation of E-CPR with data sharing and the development of a foundation for high-quality trials.

MethodsWe performed a cohort study that examined adult patients who underwent VA-ECMO support in our center between February 2010 and April 2021. These patients were retrospectively assigned to the ""with MNM group"" and the ""without MNM group"" based on the presence or absence of MNM-guided precision management. The differences in ECMO-related characteristics, evaluation indicators (precision, sensitivity, and specificity) of the MNM-guided protocol, and the long-term outcomes of the surviving patients were measured and compared between the two groups. ResultsA total of 63 patients with VA-ECMO support were retrospectively assigned to the without MNM group (n = 35) and the with MNM group (n = 28). The incidence of neural impairment in the without MNM group was significantly higher than that in the with MNM group (82.1 vs. 54.3%, P = 0.020). The MNM group exhibited older median ages [52.5 (39.5, 65.3) vs. 31 (26.5, 48.0), P = 0.008], a higher success rate of ECMO weaning (92.8 vs. 71.4%, P = 0.047), and a lower median duration of building ECMO [40.0 (35.0, 52.0) vs. 58.0 (48.0, 76.0), P = 0.025] and median ECMO duration days [5.0 (4.0, 6.2) vs. 7.0 (5.0, 10.5), P = 0.018] than the group without MNM.

Both knowledge and skills (competence) decline with time after training but the optimal duration for refresher training among frontline-skilled birth attendants in low-resource settings is unknown. Objectives We assessed the effect of an innovative Helping-Babies-Breathe simulation-based teaching method using video-debriefing compared to standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training on 1) neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills attainment and 2) competence retention among skilled birth attendants in Northern Uganda. Methods A total of 26 health facilities with 86 birth attendants were equally randomised to intervention and control arms. The 2nd edition of the American Association of Pediatrics Helping-Babies-Breathe curriculum was used for training and assessment. Knowledge and skills were assessed pre- and post-training, and during follow-up at 6 months. A mixed effects linear regression model for repeated measures was used to assess the short and long-term effects of the intervention on neonatal resuscitation practices while accounting for clustering. Results Eighty-two (95.3%) skilled birth attendants completed follow-up at 6 months. Approximately 80% of these had no prior Helping-Babies-Breathe training and 75% reported practicing neonatal resuscitation routinely. Standard Helping-Babies-Breathe training with video-debriefing improved knowledge and skills attainment post-training [adjusted mean difference: 5.34; 95% CI: 0.82-10.78] and retention [adjusted mean difference: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.52-4.41] over 6 months post-training compared to standard training after adjusting for confounding and clustering. Factors that reduced knowledge and skills retention among birth attendants were monthly resuscitation of one neonate or more and being in service for more than 5 years.

However, little is known about paramedics' ethical concerns in these decision-making processes. Objective To develop an understanding of how paramedics experience ethical concerns in OHCA decision-making processes, and how this relates to the ethical concerns of patients' relatives. Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with paramedics and relatives of OHCA non-survivors. Setting Two ambulance trusts in England. Participants Thirty-one paramedics, identified as decision-makers in adult OHCA events in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had been initiated, were interviewed. Fourteen interviews with relatives of OHCA non-survivors were also conducted. Analysis The interviews were analysed thematically, using a coding framework and following an empirical ethics approach. Results Four themes were developed: preventing harm to patients, best interests, caring for the patient's family and moral distress. Paramedics conceptualised preventing harm both as saving lives and as preventing an undignified death or a life with severe brain damage. Paramedics' and relatives' views of best interests were influenced by values such as patient dignity and assumptions about age and quality of life. Paramedics expressed a duty of care towards the patient's family. Relatives conveyed the importance of clear communication and acts of care performed by the ambulance crew, underscoring the ethical commitment that paramedics had towards patients' families. Paramedics described decision-making processes that relied on clinical guidelines, rather than personal values and beliefs; this sometimes led to moral distress. Conclusion Non-protocolised ethical considerations are important in paramedic decision-making about terminating CPR in OHCA events.

However, a substantial proportion of severe trauma and sepsis survivors will develop protracted organ dysfunction termed chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as >= 14 days requiring intensive care unit (ICU) resources with ongoing organ dysfunction. A subset of CCI patients will develop the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and these individuals are predisposed to a poor quality of life and indolent death. We propose that CCI and PICS after trauma or sepsis are the result of an inappropriate bone marrow response characterized by the generation of dysfunctional myeloid populations at the expense of lympho- and erythropoiesis. This review describes similarities among CCI/PICS phenotypes in sepsis, cancer, and aging and reviews the role of aberrant myelopoiesis in the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS. In addition, we characterize pathogen recognition, the interface between innate and adaptive immune systems, and therapeutic approaches including immune modulators, gut microbiota support, and nutritional and exercise therapy. Finally, we discuss the future of diagnostic and prognostic approaches guided by machine and deep-learning models trained and validated on big data to identify patients for whom these approaches will yield the greatest benefits.

Methods: Data from 193 OHCA survivors was derived from the Danish multicenter REVIVAL cohort study. At three months, four subtests of the performance-based Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) (Trail making, Color-word interference, Verbal fluency, and Figure design), the patient-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A), and the observer-reported 16-item Short Form (SF) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline after Cardiac Arrest (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) were collected. Spearman's rank coefficient correlation analysis was performed to examine correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A, and SF-16 IQCODE-CA. Results: Overall, 21% of survivors exhibited impairment in executive functioning using the D-KEFS subtest Color-word interference, while only 9% self-reported executive impairment (BRIEF-A) and 7% of relatives reported cognitive decline (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) in survivors at three months postarrest. All correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A and SF-16 IQCODE-CA were negligible to low.

Early initiation of Basic Life Support and defibrillation through a Community First Responder (CFR) system can markedly improve survival rates and neurological outcomes. Methods: A decision tree and Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness of three scenarios against standard care by estimating costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Scenario 1 involved raising public awareness and educating on the 30:2 CPR protocol. Scenario 2 added equipping blue-light service vehicles with Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) and training personnel. Scenario 3 implemented a full CFR system with integrated AEDs, dispatch centers, and trained citizen responders. The analysis included survival to hospital discharge, with sensitivity analyses assessing robustness. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were <euro>15,221 for Scenario 1, <euro>30,659 for Scenario 2, and <euro>16,205 for Scenario 3 per QALY gained-all below the threshold of <euro>50,197. Improvements were observed in all stages, including survival to hospital discharge and neurologically intact survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: Implementing a CFR system in Poland is a cost-effective strategy that enhances survival rates after OHCA at an acceptable cost per QALY. The study emphasizes the importance of AED accessibility, trained CFRs, and streamlined emergency responses to improve survival and quality of life for OHCA patients.

These deficits suggest that synaptic dysfunction may underlie such disabilities. The hypothesis of the present study was that synaptic dysfunction occurs following CA and that this precedes cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used histopathological and electrophysiological markers in the hippocampus of rats subjected to CA. Evoked potentials (EP) were determined in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices harvested from animals subjected to CA or sham-operated rats by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals and recording in the CA1 pyramidal region. EP amplitudes were significantly attenuated by approximately 60% in hippocampal slices harvested from animals subjected to CA. Hippocampal slices harvested from sham rats exhibited normal long-term potentiation (LTP). In contrast, hippocampal slices harvested 24 h after CA exhibited no LTP response, even when no histopathological abnormalities were observed. These data suggest that synaptic dysfunction occurs before and without overt histopathology.

Patients with cancer reportedly have poor outcomes from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and patient care costs of CPR applied to patients already receiving life support in an ICU. The medical records of patients who developed cardiac arrest and underwent CPR in the ICU of a comprehensive cancer center between 1993 and 2000 were reviewed. ICU charges after the first episode of CPR were analyzed. There were 5,196 admissions to the ICU during this time; 406 (8%) of the patients underwent CPR; 67% had hematologic malignancies or had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: 256 patients (63%) died at the time of the arrest, and in 150 (37%) spontaneous circulation was restored. There were 104 patients (26%) who survived more than 24 hours but ultimately died during their hospitalization; their mean time to death was 4.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-5.6), and mean ICU charges were $45,877 (95% Cl $24,802-$66,952). Seven patients (2%) survived to be discharged. Patients who survived after CPR and were discharged from the hospital were those who had acute ventricular dysrhythmias and were resuscitated promptly. The application of CPR to cancer patients receiving life support is costly and typically does not lead to long-term survival.

This article focuses on the neurologic care of patients after they have been resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Maximizing neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest requires attention to prevention of primary and secondary brain injury. Primary brain injury such as hypoperfusion and hypoxic injury should be avoided by optimizing hemodynamic goals to maximize cerebral perfusion and maintain normoxia and normocarbia. Secondary brain injury mediated by excitotoxicity and the inflammatory cascade may be mitigated by therapeutic hypothermia. Other strategies that may be beneficial include the treatment of seizures and maintaining normoglycemia. Finally, accurate and timely prognostication is crucial because it influences withdrawal of care and overall mortality. With the adoption of therapeutic hypothermia, the classic prognostic paradigm that was previously used needs to be reexamined. The application of our knowledge of risk factors for poor outcome, serial physical examinations, neurophysiological tests, neuroimaging, and biochemical markers may need to be delayed until after rewarming.

Our study is a randomized and blinded preclinical assessment of the efficacy of the Mn porphyrin compound, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BMX-001), commonly known as a superoxide dismutase mimic, in both mouse and rat models of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our study indicates that MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ improves survival, neurologic function recovery, and behavioral performance in animals suffering from cardiac arrest. The results support the development of Mn Porphyrin-based therapeutics for the treatment of heart failure and cardiac arrest. Introduction Cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation induces global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, causing neurologic deficits or death. Manganese porphyrins, superoxide dismutase mimics, are reportedly able to effectively reduce ischemic injury in brain, kidney, and other tissues. This study evaluates the efficacy of a third generation lipophilic Mn porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, Mn(III) ortho meso-tetrakis (N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnBuOE, BMX-001), in both mouse and rat models of CA. Methods Forty-eight animals were subjected to 8 min of CA and resuscitated subsequently by chest compression and epinephrine infusion. Vehicle or MnBuOE was given immediately after resuscitation followed by daily subcutaneous injections. Body weight, spontaneous activity, neurologic deficits, rotarod performance, and neuronal death were assessed. Kidney tubular injury was assessed in CA mice. Data were collected by the investigators who were blinded to the treatment groups. Results Vehicle mice had a mortality of 20%, which was reduced by 50% by MnBuOE. All CA mice had body weight loss, spontaneous activity decline, neurologic deficits, and decreased rotarod performance that were significantly improved at three days post MnBuOE daily treatment. MnBuOE treatment reduced cortical neuronal death and kidney tubular injury in mice (p < 0.05) but not hippocampus neuronal death (23% MnBuOE vs. 34% vehicle group, p = 0.49). In rats, they had a better body-weight recovery and increased rotarod latency after MnBuOE treatment when compared to vehicle group (p < 0.01 vs. vehicle). MnBuOE-treated rats had a low percentage of hippocampus neuronal death (39% MnBuOE vs. 49% vehicle group, p = 0.21) and less tubular injury (p < 0.05) relative to vehicle group. Conclusions We demonstrated the ability of MnBuOE to improve post-CA survival, as well as functional outcomes in both mice and rats, which jointly account for the improvement not only of brain function but also of the overall wellbeing of the animals.

Our goal was to compare the efficacy of two left ventricular assist devices on resuscitation and hemodynamic supply in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest. Methods: Seventeen anaesthetized pigs had 12 min of untreated VF followed by 6 min of chest compression and boluses of epinephrine. Next, a first defibrillation was attempted and pigs were randomized to any of the three groups: control (n = 5), implantation of an percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella, n = 5) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 7). Hemodynamic and myocardial functions were evaluated invasively at baseline, at return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), after 10-30-60-120-240 min post-resuscitation. The primary endpoint was the rate of ROSC. Results: Only one of 5 pigs in the control group, 5 of 5 pigs in the Impella group, and 5 of 7 pigs in the ECMO group had ROSC (p < 0.05). Left ventricular ejection fraction at 240 min post-resuscitation was 37.5 +/- 6.2% in the ECMO group vs. 23 +/- 3% in the Impella group (p = 0.06).

The utilization of MRI in neurological outcome prognostication post-cardiac arrest is growing and various classifications has been proposed; however a consensus has yet to be established. MRI, though valuable, is resource-intensive, time-consuming, costly, and not universally available. This study aims to validate a MRI lesion pattern score in a cohort of out of hospital cardiac arrest patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Switzerland.MethodsThis cohort study spanned twelve months from February 2021 to January 2022, encompassing all unconscious patients aged >= 18 years who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of any cause and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. We included patients who underwent the neuroprognostication process, assessing the performance and validation of a MRI scoring system.ResultsOver the twelve-month period, 137 patients were admitted to the ICU, with 52 entering the neuroprognostication process and 47 undergoing MRI analysis. Among the 35 MRIs indicating severe hypoxic brain injury, 33 patients (94%) experienced an unfavourable outcome (UO), while ten (83%) of the twelve patients with no or minimal MRI lesions had a favourable outcome. This yielded a sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.83 for predicting UO with the proposed MRI scoring system. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.53 and 0.07, respectively, resulting in an accuracy of 91.49%.ConclusionWe demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLP scoring scheme in predicting neurological outcome in patients following cardiac arrest. However, to ensure a comprehensive neuroprognostication, MRI results need to be combined with other assessments.

Immediate detection and treatment are of paramount importance for survival and good quality of life. The first link in the 'chain of survival' after OHCA - the early recognition and alerting of emergency medical services - is at the same time the weakest link as it entirely depends on witnesses. About one half of OHCA cases are unwitnessed, and victims of unwitnessed OHCA have virtually no chance of survival with good neurologic outcome. Also in case of a witnessed cardiac arrest, alerting of emergency medical services is often delayed for several minutes. Therefore, a technological solution to automatically detect cardiac arrests and to instantly trigger an emergency response has the potential to save thousands of lives per year and to greatly improve neurologic recovery and quality of life in survivors. The HEART-SAFE consortium, consisting of two academic centres and three companies in the Netherlands, collaborates to develop and implement a technical solution to reliably detect OHCA based on sensor signals derived from commercially available smartwatches using artificial intelligence.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Temperature Control in Acute Brain Injury: An Update,"Temperature control in severe acute brain injury (SABI) is a key component of acute management. This manuscript delves into the complex role of temperature management in SABI, encompassing conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and hypoxemic/ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest. Fever is a common complication in SABI and is linked to worse neurological outcomes due to increased inflammatory responses and intracranial pressure (ICP). Temperature management, particularly hypothermic temperature control (HTC), appears to mitigate these adverse effects primarily by reducing cerebral metabolic demand and dampening inflammatory pathways. However, the effectiveness of HTC varies across different SABI conditions. In the context of post-cardiac arrest, the impact of HTC on neurological outcomes has shown inconsistent results. In cases of TBI, HTC seems promising for reducing ICP, but its influence on long-term outcomes remains uncertain. For AIS, clinical trials have yet to conclusively demonstrate the benefits of HTC, despite encouraging preclinical evidence. This variability in efficacy is also observed in ICH, aSAH, bacterial meningitis, and status epilepticus. In pediatric and neonatal populations, while HTC shows significant benefits in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, its effectiveness in other brain injuries is mixed. Although the theoretical basis for employing temperature control, especially HTC, is strong, the clinical outcomes differ among various SABI subtypes. The current consensus indicates that fever prevention is beneficial across the board, but the application and effectiveness of HTC are more nuanced, underscoring the need for further research to establish optimal temperature management strategies. Here we provide an overview of the clinical evidence surrounding the use of temperature control in various types of SABI.",SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY,2024,"Lin, V; Tian, C; Wahlster, S; Castillo-Pinto, C; Mainali, S; Johnson, NJ",10.1055/s-0044-1785647,,WOS:001198845700001,A

This is a retrospective study of patients treated for OHCA from April 2011 to August 2013 in a regional cardiac system. Patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are directed to designated cardiac receiving centers with established TH protocols. The decision to initiate TH is determined by the treating physician. All patients 65 years or older were identified. Patients were excluded if awake and responsive in the emergency department, died before hospital admission, or had preexisting coma. The adjusted odds ratio for survival with good neurologic outcome (defined as cerebral performance category [CPC] 1 or 2) was calculated for patients who received TH compared to a reference group without TH. There were 1612 patients, of whom 552 (34%) received TH. Median age was 78 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 71-85); 56% was male. 493 (31%) patients survived to hospital discharge, 266 (17%) with CPC of 1 or 2.

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), as adjunct to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR), is a promising technique for IHCA treatment. Evidence pertaining to neurological outcomes after ECPR is still scarce.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive systematic search of all studies up to December 20, 2019. Our primary outcome was neurological outcome after ECPR at any moment after hospital discharge, defined by the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score. A score of 1 or 2 was defined as favourable outcome. Our secondary outcome was post-discharge mortality. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed.ResultsOur search yielded 1215 results, of which 19 studies were included in this systematic review. The average survival rate was 30% (95% CI 28-33%, I-2 =0%, p=0.24). In the surviving patients, the pooled percentage of favourable neurological outcome was 84% (95% CI 80-88%, I-2 =24%, p=0.90).ConclusionECPR as treatment for in-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with a large proportion of patients with good neurological outcome. The large proportion of favourable outcome could potentially be explained by the selection of patients for treatment using ECPR. Moreover, survival is higher than described in the conventional CPR literature. As indications for ECPR might extend to older or more fragile patient populations in the future, research should focus on increasing survival, while maintaining optimal neurological outcome.",CRITICAL CARE,2020,"Gravesteijn, BY; Schluep, M; Disli, M; Garkhail, P; Dos Reis Miranda, D; Stolker, RJ; Endeman, H; Hoeks, SE",10.1186/s13054-020-03201-0,,WOS:000563513400001,A

For common yet severe pathologies such as the comatose state after cardiac arrest, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), critical medical decisions are made on the basis of the neurologic injury. Decisions regarding active intensive care management, need for neurosurgical intervention, and withdrawal of care, depend on a reliable, high-quality assessment of the true state of neurologic injury, and have traditionally relied on limited assessments such as intracranial pressure monitoring and electroencephalogram. However, even within TBI there exists a spectrum of disease that is likely not captured by such limited monitoring and thus a more directed effort towards obtaining a more robust biophysical signature of the individual patient must be undertaken. In this review, multimodal monitoring including the most promising serum markers of neuronal injury, cerebral microdialysis, brain tissue oxygenation, and pressure reactivity index to access brain microenvironment will be discussed with their utility among specific pathologies that may help determine a more complete picture of the neurologic injury state for active intensive care management and long-term outcomes.

Eleven patients (8 males and 3 females), mean age of 63 years (range, 49-74 years), with Boerhaave's syndrome were treated surgically. A history of vomiting (10/11) and/or chest pain (11/11) was elicited in most cases, but only 3 of 11 cases were diagnosed correctly at presentation. From the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, the median delay was 30 hours (range, 6-1440 hours), and in 8 of 11 cases, the diagnosis was made >24 hours after the onset of symptoms. In all 11 cases, site of rupture was the lower one-third of the esophagus (9 to the left pleural cavity and 2 to the right pleural cavity). All cases were treated surgically after active initial resuscitation. The repair was further augmented by either a diaphragmatic flap (n = 1), bovine pericardial patch (n = 2), or Grillo pleural wrap (n = 8). A feeding jejunostomy was used in every case. Although the mean postoperative intensive care unit stay was only 1.8 days, the mean hospital stay was 37.5 days (range, 15-70 days). There were two hospital deaths (18%). After a mean follow-up of 12.5 years (range, 5-20 years), 7 of 11 patients (63%) are alive and asymptomatic. There was one death that was unrelated to the esophageal surgery.

We evaluated the biokinetics and examined the prognostic performance of serum NfL and GFAP in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. Furthermore, we compared the prognostic performance to that of serum Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE).Methods: This is a sub-study of the ""Targeted temperature management for 48 vs 24 hours"" (NCT01689077) trial. NfL and GFAP serum values from 82 patients were examined in blood samples collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours (h) after reaching target temperature of 33 +/- 1 degree celsius. This temperature was reached within a median of 281-320 minutes after intensive care unit admission. GFAP was analysed at 48 and 72 h.

Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, which activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and increases cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production by promoting influx of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on post-resuscitation neurological injury in an asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model. Asphyxial cardiac arrest was established by endotracheal tube clamping. A total of 111 rats were randomized into three groups: Sham group, Control group, and DCA intervention group. Animals in DCA intervention group were intraperitoneally administered DCA with a loading dose of 80 mg/kg at 15 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whereas rats in the Control group received equivalent volume of saline. DCA treatment increased 3-day survival time, and reduced neurologic deficit scores at 24, 48, and 72 h after ROSC. It also attenuated cellular apoptosis and neuronal damage in the hippocampal cornuammonis one region by hematoxylin-eosin staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. In addition, DCA reduced the messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin 1 beta in brain hippocampus and cortex after ROSC. Furthermore, DCA treatment significantly increased ATP production, PDH activity, and decreased blood glucose, lactate, and brain pyruvate levels after ROSC.

Presepsin (soluble CD14 subtype), an emerging inflammation- and infection-related biomarker, has gained increasing attention due to its potential association with post-CPR neurological injury and functional recovery. To address the lack of a systematic synthesis of evidence in this field, this narrative review aims to summarize the biological characteristics of presepsin, its role in neurological prognostic assessment post-CPR, and the underlying mechanisms linking presepsin to neuroinflammation and brain injury. We conducted a narrative synthesis of clinical studies retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to (December 2025, focusing on studies correlating presepsin levels with validated neurological outcome scales. Core findings from synthesized evidence indicate that elevated presepsin levels, particularly within 24-72 hours after return of ROSC, show a consistent and significant association with poor neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 3-5) and higher mortality, and presepsin may serve as an independent prognostic factor complementary to existing tools. Major clinical implications include presepsin's potential utility in multimodal prognostic protocols, aiding in early and more accurate outcome prediction. However, significant research gaps persist, including a lack of large-scale, multicenter validation studies, standardized measurement timepoints, and consensus on optimal cutoff values. In conclusion, current evidence supports presepsin as a promising inflammatory biomarker for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest (CA). Future research must prioritize prospective validation in diverse cohorts and investigate its dynamic changes to establish its definitive role in clinical decision-making.",JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION RESEARCH,2026,"Liu, M; Shao, R; Liu, B; Tang, ZR",10.2147/JIR.S571744,,WOS:001682523200001,A

Currently, commercialized quality-monitored chest pads and single-angle cameras are being used to monitor prehospital the resuscitation quality in patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, both these methods have drawbacks. In New Taipei City, we introduced the panoramic video camera as a novel method to assess the resuscitation quality of OHCA patients to monitor both technical skills and teamwork. The panoramic video camera enabled a comprehensive evaluation of prehospital resuscitation, thereby allowing team members to evaluate their performance by reviewing the video after resuscitation. This is the first step toward improving the evaluation of prehospital resuscitation. Using this panoramic video camera and a high-speed internet connection, real-time resuscitation feedback from the dispatch center or medical directors can be provided promptly, thus, making prehospital resuscitation safe and efficient.",PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE,2023,"Huang, HK; Chen, HH; Chen, YL; Yiang, GT; Chiang, WC",10.1080/10903127.2021.2015025,,WOS:000746758700001,A

Design Economic evaluation within a comparative effectiveness research design. Setting Primary care (2016-2017) and community settings (2011-2013) in the Netherlands. Participants Persons who suffered from ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or a transient ischaemic attack and were discharged home after visiting the emergency department, hospitalisation or inpatient rehabilitation. Interventions Nurse-led stroke aftercare at 6 months post stroke addressing psychosocial functioning by providing screening, psycho-education, emotional support and referral to specialist care when needed. Care-as-usual concerned routine follow-up care including secondary prevention programmes and a consultation with the neurologist at 6 weeks post stroke. Primary and secondary outcome measures Main outcome measure of cost-effectiveness was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated by the quality of life measured by the five-dimensional, three-level EuroQol. Costs were assessed using a cost-questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and social participation (Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation) restrictions subscale. Results Health outcomes were significantly better in stroke aftercare for QALYs (Delta=0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09) and social participation (Delta=4.91; 95% CI 1.89 to 7.93) compared with care-as-usual. Total societal costs were euro1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95% CI -euro3881 to euro6057). Healthcare costs were in total euro1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95% CI -euro3881 to euro6057). Average costs of stroke aftercare were euro91 (SD=euro3.20) per person. Base case cost-effectiveness analyses showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro24 679 per QALY gained. Probability of stroke aftercare being cost-effective was 64% on a euro50 000 willingness-to-pay level.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Cerebral oxygenation monitoring in patients during and after cardiac arrest-- a narrative review of current methods and evidence,"Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is a leading cause of mortality in post-cardiac arrest (post-CA) patients who successfully survive the initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but later die in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Therefore, a key priority of post-resuscitation ICU care is to prevent and limit the impact of HIBI by optimizing the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and demand. Traditionally, an optimal systemic oxygen balance is considered to ensure the brain's oxygen balance. However, the validity of this assumption is uncertain, as the brain constitutes only 2% of the body mass while accounting for approximately 20% of basal oxygen consumption at rest. Hence, there is a real need to monitor cerebral oxygenation realistically. Several imaging and bedside monitoring methods are available for cerebral oxygenation monitoring in post-CA patients. Unfortunately, each of them has its limitations. Imaging methods require transporting a critically ill unstable patient to the scanner. Moreover, they provide an assessment of the oxygenation state only at a particular moment, while brain oxygenation is dynamic. Bedside methods, specifically near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2), and jugular venous oxygen saturation monitoring (SjvO2), have not often been used in studies involving post-CA patients. Hence there is ambiguity regarding clear recommendations for using these bedside monitors. Presently, the most promising option seems to be using the NIRS as an indicator of effective CPR.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Contemporary Practices in Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Narrative Review,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains a major cause of adult mortality worldwide, with survival to hospital discharge rates around 10%. Despite advances in prehospital care, rapid recognition and high-quality chest compressions are the primary interventions, while early defibrillation is one of the few measures shown to improve survival. This literature review examines novel interventions for patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, focusing on double sequential defibrillation, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Evidence suggests that double sequential defibrillation may improve survival to discharge in refractory ventricular fibrillation, but consensus and large-scale validation are lacking. Beta-blockers show promise for increasing the rates of return of spontaneous circulation and favourable neurological outcomes, yet robust evidence is still needed. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, particularly when initiated rapidly in selected patients, can enhance survival and neurological outcomes, though studies show mixed results and highlight the importance of patient selection and system readiness. Overall, while these interventions offer potential, their widespread adoption requires further high-quality research to determine efficacy, optimal protocols, and resource implications in both prehospital and emergency department settings.",MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,2025,"Jezersek, J; Strnad, M",10.3390/medicina61061053,,WOS:001515954700001,A

However, its potential beneficial effects in cardiac arrest have not been characterized. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of canagliflozin pretreatment on postresuscitation-induced cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Methods Male C57/BL6 mice were randomized to vehicle (sham and control) or canagliflozin treatment groups. All mice except for the sham-operated mice were subjected to potassium chloride-induced cardiac arrest followed by chest compressions and intravenous epinephrine for resuscitation. Canagliflozin therapy efficacies were evaluated by electrocardiogram, echocardiography, histological analysis, inflammatory response, serum markers of myocardial injury, protein phosphorylation analysis, and immunohistological assessment. Results Canagliflozin-pretreated mice exhibited a higher survival rate (P < 0.05), a shorter return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) time (P < 0.01) and a higher neurological score (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001) than control mice after resuscitation. Canagliflozin was effective at improving cardiac arrest and resuscitation-associated cardiac dysfunction, indicated by increased left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening (P < 0.001). Canagliflozin reduced serum levels of LDH, CK-MB and alpha-HBDH, ameliorated systemic inflammatory response, and diminished the incidence of early resuscitation-induced arrhythmia. Notably, canagliflozin promoted phosphorylation of cardiac STAT-3 postresuscitation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of STAT-3 by Ag490 blunted STAT-3 phosphorylation and abolished the cardioprotective actions of canagliflozin. Conclusions Canagliflozin offered a strong cardioprotective effect against cardiac arrest and resuscitation-induced cardiac dysfunction. This canagliflozin-induced cardioprotection is mediated by the STAT-3-dependent cell-survival signaling pathway.",CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS AND THERAPY,2024,"Ju, F; Abbott, GW; Li, JX; Wang, QF; Liu, T; Liu, QH; Hu, ZY",10.1007/s10557-022-07419-8,,WOS:000910827800001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Intranasal post-cardiac arrest treatment with orexin-A facilitates arousal from coma and ameliorates neuroinflammation,"Cardiac arrest (CA) entails significant risks of coma resulting in poor neurological and behavioral outcomes after resuscitation. Significant subsequent morbidity and mortality in post-CA patients are largely due to the cerebral and cardiac dysfunction that accompanies prolonged whole-body ischemia post-CA syndrome (PCAS). PCAS results in strong inflammatory responses including neuroinflammation response leading to poor outcome. Currently, there are no proven neuroprotective therapies to improve post-CA outcomes apart from therapeutic hypothermia. Furthermore, there are no acceptable approaches to promote cortical or cognitive arousal following successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hypothalamic orexinergic pathway is responsible for arousal and it is negatively affected by neuroinflammation. However, whether activation of the orexinergic pathway can curtail neuroinflammation is unknown. We hypothesize that targeting the orexinergic pathway via intranasal orexin-A (ORXA) treatment will enhance arousal from coma and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in improved functional outcome after resuscitation. We used a highly validated CA rat model to determine the effects of intranasal ORXA treatment 30-minute post resuscitation. At 4hrs post-CA, the mRNA levels of proinflammatory markers (IL1 beta, iNOS, TNF-alpha, GFAP, CD11b) and orexin receptors (ORX1R and ORX2R) were examined in different brain regions. CA dramatically increased proinflammatory markers in all brain regions particularly in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Post-CA intranasal ORXA treatment significantly ameliorated the CA-induced neuroinflammatory markers in the hypothalamus. ORXA administration increased production of orexin receptors (ORX1R and ORX2R) particularly in hypothalamus. In addition, ORXA also resulted in early arousal as measured by quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) markers, and recovery of the associated behavioral neurologic deficit scale score (NDS). Our results indicate that intranasal delivery of ORXA post-CA has an anti-inflammatory effect and accelerates cortical EEG and behavioral recovery. Beneficial outcomes from intranasal ORXA treatment lay the groundwork for therapeutic clinical approach to treating post-CA coma.",PLOS ONE,2017,"Modi, HR; Wang, Q; Sahithi, GD; Sherman, D; Greenwald, E; Savonenko, AV; Geocadin, RG; Thakor, NV",10.1371/journal.pone.0182707,,WOS:000411985200005,A

Advances in resuscitation science, new insights into important predictors of outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and lessons learned from methodological research prompted this review and update of the 2004 Utstein guidelines. Representatives of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation developed an updated Utstein reporting framework iteratively by meeting face to face, by teleconference, and by Web survey during 2012 through 2014. Herein are recommendations for reporting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data elements were grouped by system factors, dispatch/recognition, patient variables, resuscitation/postresuscitation processes, and outcomes. Elements were classified as core or supplemental using a modified Delphi process primarily based on respondents' assessment of the evidence-based importance of capturing those elements, tempered by the challenges to collect them. New or modified elements reflected consensus on the need to account for emergency medical services system factors, increasing availability of automated external defibrillators, data collection processes, epidemiology trends, increasing use of dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emerging field treatments, postresuscitation care, prognostication tools, and trends in organ recovery. A standard reporting template is recommended to promote standardized reporting. This template facilitates reporting of the bystander-witnessed, shockable rhythm as a measure of emergency medical services system efficacy and all emergency medical services system-treated arrests as a measure of system effectiveness. Several additional important subgroups are identified that enable an estimate of the specific contribution of rhythm and bystander actions that are key determinants of outcome.

Recently, fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) tailored to jointly measure VF amplitude and regularity has been shown to be an efficient defibrillation success predictor. In this study, 734 shocks from 296 OHCA patients (50 survivors) were analyzed, and the embedding dimension (m) and matching tolerance (r) for FuzzyEn and sample entropy (SampEn) were adjusted to predict defibrillation success and patient survival. Entropies were significantly larger in successful shocks and in survivors, and when compared to the available methods, FuzzyEn presented the best prediction results, marginally outperforming SampEn. The sensitivity and specificity of FuzzyEn were 83.3% and 76.7% when predicting defibrillation success, and 83.7% and 73.5% for patient survival. Sensitivities and specificities were two points above those of the best available methods, and the prediction accuracy was kept even for VF intervals as short as 2s.

Automated real-time feedback devices have been explored to enhance CPR skills, but few devices currently ensure proper chest recoil. This study aimed to assess whether a double-click metronome could improve chest compressions (CC) metrics and particularly CC release velocity (CCRV) during CPR manikin simulation. Methods: We developed and tested a double-click metronome for CPR, where the first click signals the compression and the second click marks the end of chest release. We performed a multicenter non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial including volunteers with different levels of CPR expertise. Three CC metrics-depth, rate, and CCRV-were measured using an automated external defibrillator equipped with pads for CPR quality analysis. Results: 503 volunteers participated in the study, with 54% being male and a mean age of 34 +/- 12 years. The median CCRV and CC depth achieved with the double-click metronome were significantly higher compared to the standard metronome (median difference 6 mm/s, IQR-15.2, 28.5, +1.5%, p < 0.001; median difference 0.1 cm, +2.5%, IQR -0.1, 0.4, p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Compared to a standard metronome, the double-click metronome significantly enhances CPR quality.

Aims The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of miR-191-5p in the neurological outcome of patients recovering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods A total of 260 patients undergoing the target temperature management trial were analyzed. The expression level of serum miR-191-5p was detected by qRT-PCR at 48 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). ROC curve was established to evaluate the ability of miR-191-5p as a biomarker for predicting adverse neurological outcomes after OHCA. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were used for survival analysis. Results One hundred eighteen patients (45%) had poor neurological outcomes at 6 months. The expression level of serum miR-191-5p in patients with poor neurological outcomes was significantly lower than that in patients with good neurological prognosis (P < 0.001) and was not associated with TTM trial. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the ROC curve were 0.899, 84.7%, and 82.4%, respectively, suggesting that the level of miR-191-5p had the ability to predict neurological outcome. By the end of the experiment, 88 patients (34%) were dead. Results of survival analysis showed that lower miR-191-5p expression level was significantly associated with lower survival rate (HR: 0.344, 95% CI = 0.208-0.567, P < 0.001).

In this systematic review, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Methods: We searched PubMed, BioMedCentral, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during the pandemic and a non-pandemic period. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints were bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favourable neurological outcome. Results: We identified six studies. In two studies, rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge decreased significantly during the pandemic. Especially in Europe, bystander-witnessed cases, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation attempted by emergency medical services were reduced during the pandemic. Also, ambulance response times were significantly delayed across all studies and patients presenting with non-shockable rhythms increased in two studies. In 2020, 3.9-5.9% of tested patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4.8-26% had suggestive symptoms (fever and cough or dyspnoea). Conclusions: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had worse short-term outcomes during the pandemic than a non-pandemic period suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from lockdown and disruption of healthcare systems.

LVADs are being used increasingly and now have expanded indications. Health care providers across specialties will therefore not only encounter LVAD patients but play an integral role in their care. To accomplish that, they need to understand the elements of LVAD function, physiology and clinical use. This article provides a concise overview of the medical management of LVAD patients for nonexpert clinicians. Our presentation includes the basics of LVAD physiology, design, and operation, patient selection and assessment, medical management, adverse event identification and management, multidisciplinary care, and management of special circumstances, such as noncardiac surgery, cardiac arrest, and end-of-life care. The clinical examination of LVAD patients is unique in terms of blood pressure and heart rate assessment, LVAD ""hum"" auscultation, driveline and insertion site inspection, and device parameter recording. Important potential device-related adverse events include stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematologic disorders, device infection, LVAD dysfunction, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Special considerations include the approach to the unconscious or pulseless patient, noncardiac surgery, and palliative care.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Evaluation of Confidence and Knowledge Regarding Chest Compression Training Among Children at a Health Promotion Event,"Introduction Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) significantly increases out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates. Early CPR implementation and public education are essential for everyone, including children. Despite challenges such as ensuring proper chest compression depth in children, early CPR training at school is beneficial and supported by various studies. However, few studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CPR training for children in environments outside of school, such as health festivals. We conducted chest compression training for children under 15 years who attended a hospital festival and evaluated the changes in their confidence and knowledge of the training. Methods This study evaluated chest compression training in children under 15 years old at a hospital festival. Participants included preschoolers to junior high school students. Training effectiveness was assessed using pre- and post-training questionnaires to measure confidence in and knowledge of chest compressions. Data were analyzed using the chi 2 test to compare responses before and after training, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The training involved a 10-minute hands-only session using CPR mannequins conducted by paramedics, doctors, and nursing students. Results The study included 180 children (51% male, 49% female). Only 14% had prior CPR training. After CPR training, significant improvements in confidence and knowledge regarding chest compressions were observed among preschool and elementary school students. The overall correct response rate increased from 51% to 97% for the location and from 59% to 92% for the depth of chest compressions. Discussion This study evaluated CPR training for children at a hospital festival and showed that few children have experience with CPR training. Our CPR training improved children's confidence and knowledge of chest compressions. Despite concerns about the strength of younger children in effective chest compressions, preschool, and elementary school children showed high motivation and capability. This study highlights the importance of early CPR education supported by both school and health festival initiatives. The limitations include the short training duration and lack of automated external defibrillator instructions. Conclusion We confirmed that CPR training at a hospital festival improves children's knowledge and confidence.

Here we present the protocol of the mean arterial pressure after cardiac arrest and resuscitation (MAP-CARE) trial aiming to investigate the influence of MAP targets on patient outcomes.MethodsMAP-CARE is one component of the Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation (STEPCARE) 2 x 2 x 2 factorial randomized trial. The MAP-CARE trial is an international, multicenter, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, superiority trial designed to test the hypothesis that targeting a higher (>85 mmHg) (intervention) versus a lower (>65 mmHg) (comparator) MAP after resuscitation from cardiac arrest reduces 6-month mortality (primary outcome). Trial participants are adults with sustained return of spontaneous circulation who are comatose following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The two other components of the STEPCARE trial evaluate sedation and temperature control strategies. Apart from the STEPCARE trial interventions, all other aspects of general intensive care will be according to the local practices of the participating site. Neurological prognostication will be performed according to European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines by a physician blinded to allocation group. The sample size of 3500 participants provides 90% power with an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 5.6 absolute risk reduction in 6-month mortality, assuming a mortality of 60% in the control group. Secondary outcomes will be poor functional outcome 6 months after randomization, patient-reported overall health 6 months after randomization, and the proportion of participants with predefined severe adverse events.ConclusionThe MAP-CARE trial will investigate if targeting a higher MAP compared to a lower MAP during intensive care of adults who are comatose following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest reduces 6-month mortality.",ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA,2025,"Niemelae, VH; Reinikainen, M; Nielsen, N; Bass, F; Young, P; Lilja, G; Dankiewicz, J; Hammond, N; Haestbacka, J; Levin, H; Moseby-Knappe, M; Saxena, M; Tiainen, M; Ceric, A; Holgersson, J; Kamp, CB; Tirkkonen, J; Oksanen, T; Kaakinen, T; Bendel, S; Duering, J; Lybeck, A; Johnsson, J; Unden, J; Lundin, A; Kahlin, J; Grip, J; Lotman, E; Romundstad, L; Seidel, P; Stammet, P; Graf, T; Mengel, A; Leithner, C; Nee, J; Druwe, P; Ameloot, K; Wise, MP; Mcguigan, PJ; White, J; Govier, M; Maccaroni, M; Ostermann, M; Hopkins, P; Proudfoot, A; Handslip, R; Pogson, D; Jackson, P; Nichol, A; Haenggi, M; Hilty, MP; Iten, M; Schrag, C; Nafi, M; Joannidis, M; Robba, C; Pellis, T; Belohlavek, J; Rob, D; Arabi, Y; Buabbas, S; Woon, CY; Aneman, A; Stewart, A; Arnott, C; Ramanan, M; Panwar, R; Delaney, A; Reade, M; Venkatesh, B; Navarra, L; Crichton, B; Knight, D; Williams, A; Friberg, H; Cronberg, T; Jakobsen, JC; Skrifvars, MB",10.1111/aas.70040,,WOS:001518749700032,A

Urinary dysfunction was evaluated using the Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis and Female Urinary Symptom Score at one, three, six and 12 months postoperatively. Results Fifty-eight patients (mean age, 43.2 years) were included, with motor-vehicle collisions being the most common cause for pelvic-ring injuries (74.1%). Most injuries (84.5%) were classified as Type B. Nearly half of the patients reported urinary symptoms one month post-surgery, which significantly improved over 12 months (P < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, greater injury severity was independently associated with urinary dysfunction at six months (adjusted odds ratio: 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.12, p = 0.049), while no other clinical or procedural factors, including age, arterial embolisation, or surgical approach, stayed significant. Functional recovery correlated with reduced symptoms over time. Conclusion Urinary dysfunction is a frequent but under-recognised complication after pelvic-ring injuries. Although most patients experience gradual improvement over time, greater injury severity is independently associated with early urinary symptoms. Continuous monitoring and timely rehabilitation may help optimise long-term functional recovery.",INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS,2026,"Hsu, CC; Lai, CY; Chen, IJ; Hsu, YH; Chou, YC; Lo, TS; Yu, YH",10.1007/s00264-025-06681-3,,WOS:001608329400001,A

Methods: Multiple methods study consisting of a questionnaire at baseline and 3-month follow-up and focus groups. Results: Ninety-nine ICs (67.6 +/- 11.7 years) completed the baseline questionnaire, eighty-two ICs the follow-up questionnaire, ten ICs (70.6 +/- 12.6 years) participated in two focus groups. ICs perceived that identifying them as discussion partners and addressing patients' daily lives were least discussed with professionals (26.3 %; 59.6 %). Most ICs (63.9 %) preferred a collaborative decision-making (DM) role. The level of perceived SDM was positively associated with baseline QOL social relations (p = .038), and follow-up QOL psychological health (p = .048) and environment (p = .024). ICs experienced three roles in SDM: supporters in DM, stimulators in clarifying patient's personal context, and DM partners. Conclusion: ICs play valuable roles in SDM for severe AS, but feel professionals do not consistently identify them as discussion partners. Practice implications: Professionals should involve ICs in SDM for discussing older patient's QOL and personal context, which can inform personalized decisions regarding severe AS treatment.",PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING,2025,"van Beek-Peeters, JJAM; Faes, MC; Habibovic, M; van der Meer, JBL; Pel-Littel, RE; van Geldorp, MWA; van den Branden, B; van der Meer, NJM; Minkman, MMN",10.1016/j.pec.2024.108554,,WOS:001363583300001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Carbon monoxide as a cellular protective agent in a swine model of cardiac arrest protocol,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects over 360,000 adults in the United States each year with a 50-80% mortality prior to reaching medical care. Despite aggressive supportive care and targeted temperature management (TTM), half of adults do not live to hospital discharge and nearly one-third of survivors have significant neurologic injury. The current treatment approach following cardiac arrest resuscitation consists primarily of supportive care and possible TTM. While these current treatments are commonly used, mortality remains high, and survivors often develop lasting neurologic and cardiac sequela well after resuscitation. Hence, there is a critical need for further therapeutic development of adjunctive therapies. While select therapeutics have been experimentally investigated, one promising agent that has shown benefit is CO. While CO has traditionally been thought of as a cellular poison, there is both experimental and clinical evidence that demonstrate benefit and safety in ischemia with lower doses related to improved cardiac/neurologic outcomes. While CO is well known for its poisonous effects, CO is a generated physiologically in cells through the breakdown of heme oxygenase (HO) enzymes and has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. While CO has been studied in myocardial infarction itself, the role of CO in cardiac arrest and post-arrest care as a therapeutic is less defined. Currently, the standard of care for post-arrest patients consists primarily of supportive care and TTM. Despite current standard of care, the neurological prognosis following cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) remains poor with patients often left with severe disability due to brain injury primarily affecting the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, investigations of novel therapies to mitigate post-arrest injury are clearly warranted. The primary objective of this proposed study is to combine our expertise in swine models of CO and cardiac arrest for future investigations on the cellular protective effects of low dose CO. We will combine our innovative multi-modal diagnostic platform to assess cerebral metabolism and changes in mitochondrial function in swine that undergo cardiac arrest with therapeutic application of CO.",PLOS ONE,2024,"Greenwood, JC; Morgan, RW; Abella, BS; Shofer, FS; Baker, WB; Lewis, A; Ko, TS; Forti, RM; Yodh, AG; Kao, SH; Shin, SS; Kilbaugh, TJ; Jang, DH",10.1371/journal.pone.0302653,,WOS:001224551000024,A

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, interventions, and survival outcomes of patients with out -ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) related to FBAO in comparison to patients with non-FBAO OHCA. Methods : In this population -based cohort study, we included all OHCAs in Denmark from 2016 to 2022. Cases related to FBAO were identified and linked to the patient register. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors potentially influencing survival. Results : A total of 30,926 OHCA patients were included. The incidence rate of FBAO-related OHCA was 0.78 per 100,000 person -years. Among FBAO cases, 24% presented with return of spontaneous circulation upon arrival of the emergency medical services. The 30 -day survival rate was higher in FBAO patients (30%) compared to non-FBAO patients (14%). Bystander interventions were recorded in 26% of FBAO cases. However, no statistically significant association between bystander interventions or EMS personnels' use of Magill forceps and survival was shown, aOR 1.47 (95 % CI 0.6-3.6) and aOR 0.88 (95% CI 0.3-2.1). Conclusion : FBAO-related OHCA was rare but has a higher initial survival rate than non-FBAO related OHCA, with a considerable proportion of patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation upon arrival of the emergency medical service personnel.

However, the burden now lies with post-cardiac arrest cognitive impairment in CA/CPR survivors. Based on our previous study, we aimed to further confirm the correlation between the long noncoding RNA-promoting ShcA (lncRNA-PS)/Src homology and collagen A (ShcA) axis and CA/CPR-induced cognitive impairment in molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Methods and Results: The in vivo experiments were based on a mouse model of CA/CPR, while oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation was used as a cell model in vitro. Conditional ShcA suppression in neurons of the hippocampal CA1 region was achieved by cyclization recombinase of bacteriophage P1 recognizing DNA fragment locus of x-over P1 site (Cre/LoxP recombination system). Genetic manipulation of HT22 was achieved by lentivirus targeting lncRNA-PS and ShcA. Neurological function score was remarkably decreased, and cognitive function was affected after restoration of spontaneous circulation. LncRNA-PS and ShcA overexpression after CA/CPR, mainly happened in neurons of hippocampal CA1 region, was observed by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. Neuronal ShcA knockdown in hippocampal CA1 region before CA/CPR attenuated cognitive impairment after CA/CPR. ShcA deficiency protected HT22 cell line against oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation by inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis. In vitro upregulation of lncRNA-PS elevated ShcA expression, which was reversed by knockdown of ShcA. Conclusions: This study revealed that lncRNA-PS/ShcA axis is critically involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment after CA/CPR. By inhibiting ShcA expression in neurons of the hippocampal CA1 region could improve the survival outcomes in mice after CA/CPR.",SHOCK,2022,"Zhang, YH; Peng, F; Zhang, L; Kang, K; Yang, M; Chen, C; Yu, H",10.1097/SHK.0000000000001964,,WOS:000860033500010,A

This study aimed to identify call-taker strategies to address callers' perceptions of CPR 'inappropriateness' (perceiving the patient as dead and beyond help, or as showing signs of life). Methods: Using a linguistic approach, we analysed 31 calls previously identified as having an inappropriateness barrier to CPR initiation or continuation. In Phase 1, we listened to call recordings and studied call transcripts to identify the strategies and linguistic features used by call-takers. Phase 2 was a discourse analysis of transcript extracts to describe how certain strategies, identified in Phase 1, were used in the caller-call-taker interactions. Results: Call-takers used various strategies when responding to callers who considered CPR inappropriate. Calltakers rarely used a single strategy or linguistic feature in isolation, tending to use combinations of minimal tokens of alignment (e.g. caller name or encouragements statements), with deontics (including directives/ commands and statements of obligation e.g. ""do this for me"") and provision of either context (e.g. ""the ambulance is on its way"") or a rationale (""he's not breathing effectively so we need to perform CPR to help him""). Most call-taker attempts were successful, with callers overcoming 71% of initiation barriers and 88% of continuation barriers. Conclusions: Call-takers used a combination of linguistic features (minimal/symbolic tokens, deontics) and strategies (providing unscripted statements about the context or a rationale for CPR) to overcome barriers of perceived inappropriateness to CPR.",RESUSCITATION,2025,"Aldridge, ES; Perera, N; Ball, S; Whiteside, A; Bray, J; Finn, J",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2024.110459,,WOS:001465606800001,A

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common way to identify a shockable rhythm, but it can miss patients with clinically significant ventricular fibrillation (vfib). We sought to determine the percentage of non- shockable OHCA patients that demonstrated vfib on echo. Methods: Secondary analysis of echo images recorded from a prior study from our group, Real-Time Evaluation and Assessment for Sonography-Outcomes Network (REASON), a multicenter, observational study of OHCA patients presenting to the emergency department with nonshockable rhythms. Using ECG and echocardiogram images recorded during the initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) pause, 2 independent emergency physicians determined the presence of vfib. Two experienced emergency physicians (R.G. and T.G.) reviewed echo images with adjudication by a third if necessary. ECG interpretation was unblinded to patient information. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in occult vfib. Results: During the first CPR pause, reviewers noted occult vfib in 22/685 (3.2%; 95% CI, 2.1%-4.8%) subjects. Patients with ECG vfib (n = 55) were defibrillated immediately during the first pause in CPR, but no patients with occult vfib during the first pause in CPR were defibrillated. Subsequently, 50% (11 of 22) of occult vfib patients were defibrillated when ECG vfib was recognized during an ensuing pause in CPR.

Methods: The neurocognitive screening that was evaluated included the performance-based Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the patient-reported Two Simple Questions (TSQ) and the observer-reported Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest (IQCODE-CA). These instruments were administered at 6-months in the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM2) trial. We used a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery from a TTM2 trial sub-study as a gold standard to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the neurocognitive screening. Results: In our cohort of 108 OHCA survivors (median age = 62, 88% male), the most favourable cut-off scores were: MoCA < 26; SDMT z <=-1; IQCODE-CA >= 3.04. The MoCA (sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.85) and SDMT (sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.83) had a higher classification accuracy than the TSQ (sensitivity 0.28, specificity 0.74) and IQCODE-CA (sensitivity 0.42, specificity 0.60).

In particular, very few patients with type II Floyd tracheal agenesis experience long-term survival. We present the case of a male infant who was diagnosed with type II disease, underwent staged reconstruction and was discharged home with a tolerance for oral intake.Case presentationThe patient was delivered via emergency cesarean section at 33 week gestation due to fetal distress. Initial attempts to intubate the trachea failed, but ventilation was successfully achieved through esophageal intubation, prompting suspicion of tracheal agenesis with a tracheoesophageal fistula. The diagnosis was confirmed via CT and laryngoesophagoscopy. On the same day, abdominal esophageal banding and gastrostomy were performed. For long-term management, staged operations, including pseudotracheostomy, internal and external stenting of the trachealized esophagus, and reconstruction of the alimentary tract, were performed.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,An insight regarding the article 'Predictors and rate of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.',"Advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have led to a remarkable reduction in the morbidity and mortality rates associated with a variety of diseases. In the context of acute ischemic heart disease, significant milestones have been achieved, beginning with the establishment of cardiac ICUs. These were pivotal in providing specialized care for patients with severe heart conditions. Subsequent to this development, methods to restore blood flow in areas compromised by arterial blockages were introduced. Initially, systemic thrombolysis was the primary method used, but it has since been largely supplanted by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as primary coronary angioplasty, which is now the preferred treatment due to its effectiveness and safety. The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) where resuscitation attempts have been made, whether successful or not, is significant and presents a considerable challenge. Unfortunately, the mortality rate among these patients remains distressingly high, and efforts to reduce it are fraught with difficulty. It is crucial to acknowledge that survival from an OHCA does not automatically equate to a favorable clinical outcome, as serious neurological impairments are common sequelae of such events. In addition to mortality rates, the term ""survival with favorable neurologic outcome"" has emerged as another critical measure of the success of resuscitation efforts. This parameter underscores the importance of not only saving lives but also preserving the quality of life for survivors. The ability to restore both life and cognitive function is a testament to the comprehensiveness of care provided to OHCA patients.",CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY,2025,"Li, JF; Bao, L; Gu, MY; Wang, MM; Zhong, H",10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2024.102946,,WOS:001370499400001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Rewarming Young Children After Drowning-Associated Hypothermia and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Analysis Using the CAse REport Guideline,"OBJECTIVES:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is recommended in adults with drowning-associated hypothermia and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Our experience of managing a drowned 2-year-old girl with hypothermia (23 & DEG;C) and cardiac arrest (58 min) prompted this summary using the CAse REport (CARE) guideline to address the question of optimal rewarming procedure in such patients.DESIGN/PATIENTS:Following the CARE guideline, we identified 24 reports in the ""PubMed database"" describing children less than or equal to 6 years old with a temperature less than or equal to 28 & DEG;C who had been rewarmed using conventional intensive care & PLUSMN; ECMO. Adding our patient, we were able to analyze a total of 57 cases.MAIN RESULTS:The two groups (ECMO vs non-ECMO) differed with respect to submersion time, pH and potassium but not age, temperature or duration of cardiac arrest. However, 44 of 44 in the ECMO group were pulseless on arrival versus eight of 13 in the non-ECMO group. Regarding survival, 12 of 13 children (92%) undergoing conventional rewarming survived compared with 18 of 44 children (41%) undergoing ECMO. Among survivors, 11 of 12 children (91%) in the conventional group and 14 of 18 (77%) in the ECMO group had favorable outcome. We failed to identify any correlation between ""rewarming rate"" and ""outcome.""CONCLUSIONS:In this summary analysis, we conclude that conventional therapy should be initiated for drowned children with OHCA. However, if this therapy does not result in return of spontaneous circulation, a discussion of withdrawal of intensive care might be prudent when core temperature has reached 34 & DEG;C. We suggest further work is needed using an international registry.",PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2023,"Andre, MC; Vuille-Dit-Bille, RN; Berset, A; Hammer, J",10.1097/PCC.0000000000003254,,WOS:001062302500002,A

This study evaluated the impact of novel drone-specific dispatch instructions (DSDI) on bystanders' ability to interact effectively with a medical drone and provide prompt, safe, and high-quality treatment in a simulated emergency scenario.1 We hypothesized DSDI would improve bystanders' performance and facilitate safer bystander-drone interactions. Methods: Twenty-four volunteers were randomized to receive either DSDI and standard Medical Priority Dispatch (MPD) instructions or MPD alone in a simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) or pediatric anaphylaxis.,23 Participants in the DSDI group received detailed instructions on locating and interacting with the drone and its enclosed medical kit. The simulations were video recorded. Participants completed a semi Results: The addition of DSDI did not lead to statistically significant changes to the overall time to provide care in either the anaphylaxis or OHCA simulations. However, DSDI did have an impact on bystander safety. In the MPD only group, 50% (6/12) of participants ignored the audio and visual safety cues from the drone instead of waiting for it to be declared safe compared to no DSDI participants ignoring these safety cues.

Correction of the sudden death risk in these patients creates a new clinical condition in need of a careful assessment. Should all-cause mortality be affected by the expected reduction in sudden death rate associated with ICD therapy, issues of critical importance such as the time extent of life prolongation and the associated quality of life, still remain to established. To investigate the potential benefit of ICD therapy compared with antiarrhythmic drug treatment, 4 prospective studies-the Dutch trial, the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) study, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH), and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS)-have been conducted in which patients with documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia were randomized to 1 of these 2 treatment strategies. The enrollment criteria differed in these 4 studies: (1) in the Dutch trial, they included cardiac arrest secondary to a ventricular arrhythmia, old (>4 weeks) myocardial infarction, and inducible ventricular arrhythmia; (2) in AVID and CIDS, ventricular fibrillation or poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia; and (3) in CASH, cardiac attest secondary to a ventricular arrhythmia regardless of the underlying disease. With regard to the antiarrhythmic drugs, the Dutch trial tested class I and III agents, whereas AVID and CIDS compared ICD therapy with class III agents (mostly amiodarone). In CASH, 3 drug subgroups were investigated: propafenone, amiodarone, and metoprolol. All trials used all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint. Data from these trials provide support for ICD as a therapy superior to antiarrhythmic drugs in prolonging survival in patients meeting the entry criteria.

This retrospective study aimed to clarify the individual characteristics, short-term and mid-term outcomes, and prognostic factors of patients who underwent surgical repair of ATAAD with preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods Between January 2007 and January 2020, 656 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution; 22 (3.4%) of these patients underwent CPR prior to surgery. Patients who underwent preoperative CPR were classified as the survivor group (n = 9) and non-survivor group (n = 13), according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. Clinical features, surgical information, and postoperative complications were analyzed and compared. Three-year cumulative survival rates and cerebral performance categories (CPC) scores are presented. Results In patients undergoing CPR prior to ATAAD surgery, the in-hospital mortality rate was 59.1%. A total of 72.7% of patients underwent concomitant surgical resuscitation procedures during CPR such as emergent subxiphoid pericardiotomy and/or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass. The survivor group had a higher rate of return of spontaneous heartbeat (ROSB) compared to the non-survivor group (100% versus 53.8%;P= 0.017). The 3-year cumulative survival rates were 35.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.6%-42.6%) and 85.7% (95% CI, 81.9%-88.8%) for overall patients and for survivors, respectively.

The winter of 2017 saw the highest ever incidence and lowest survival rate of OHCA recorded in Victoria at the time. Seasonal variation of OHCA has not previously been examined in Australia and there may be a significant effect. We aimed to describe the seasonal incidence of OHCA and examine seasonal differences in survival to discharge and 12-month quality of life outcomes. In addition, we investigated whether recent respiratory infection or pre existing respiratory disease influenced OHCA outcomes. Methods: The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) was used to identify OHCA occurring in Victoria between 2008 and 2017. We examined OHCA characteristics and outcomes between seasons. We then used multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for the Utstein factors, to examine if season, recent respiratory infection or preexisting respiratory disease is associated with survival to discharge and 12-month quality of life. Results: There were 44 973 OHCA cases of which 22 209 received an attempted resuscitation (49.4%). The incidence of OHCA was highest during winter (22 per 100 000 vs. 18 per 100 000 in summer). In winter, survival to discharge was lower for OHCA patients (12.2% vs. 15.9% in summer). Both recent respiratory infection (AOR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52 - 0.87) and OHCA occurring during winter (AOR: 0.79 95% CI: 0.70 - 0.91) were associated with lower odds of survival to discharge. Preexisting respiratory disease was associated with lower odds of moderate to good recovery at 12 months (AOR:0.60 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.89). Conclusion: In winter the incidence of OHCA was at its highest and survival to discharge was at its lowest compared to other seasons.

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Cerebral resuscitation from cardiac arrest: Treatment potentials,"In 1961, in Pittsburgh, PA, ''cerebral'' was added to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation system (CPR --> CPCR). Cerebral recovery is dependent on arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation times, and numerous factors related to basic, advanced, and prolonged life support. Postischemic-anoxic encephalopathy (the cerebral postresuscitation disease or syndrome) is complex and multifactorial. The prevention or mitigation of this syndrome requires that there be development and trials of special, multifaceted, combination treatments. The selection of therapies to mitigate the postresuscitation syndrome should continue to be based on mechanistic rationale. Therapy based on a single mechanism, however, is unlikely to be maximally effective. For logistic reasons, the limit for neurologic recovery after 5 mins of arrest must be extended to achieve functionally and histologically normal human brains after 10 to 20 mins of circulatory arrest. This goal has been approached, but not quite reached. Treatment effects on process variables give clues, but long-term outcome evaluation is needed for documentation of efficacy and to improve clinical results. Goals have crystallized for clinically relevant cardiac arrest-intensive care outcome models in large animals. These studies are expensive, but essential, because positive treatment effects cannot always be confirmed in the rat forebrain ischemia model. Except for a still-elusive breakthrough effect, randomized clinical trials of CPCR are limited in their ability to statistically document the effectiveness of treatments found to be beneficial in controlled outcome models in large animals. Clinical studies of feasibility, side effects, and acceptability are essential. Hypertensive reperfusion overcomes multifocal no-reflow and improves out come. Physical combination treatments, such as mild resuscitative (early postarrest) hypothermia (34 degrees C) plus cerebral blood flow promotion (e.g., with hypertension, hemodilution, and normocapnia), each having multiple beneficial effects, achieved complete functional and near complete histologic recovery of the dog brain after 11 mins of normothermic, ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Calcium entry blockers appear promising as a treat ment for postischemic anoxic encephalopathy. However, the majority of single or multiple drug treatments explored so far have failed to improve neurologic outcome. Assembling and evaluating combination treatments in further animal studies and determining clinical feasibility inside and outside hospitals are challenges for the near future. Treatments without permanent beneficial effects may at least extend the therapeutic window. All of these investigations will require coordinated efforts by multiple research groups, pursuing systematic, multilevel research-from cell cultures to rats, to large animals, and to clinical trials.

While it clearly reduces the incidence of-death from recurrent arrhythmia, little is known about the impact on patients' quality-of-life. In this prospective study, quality-of-life was assessed by questionnaire before and after ICD implantation. The ''Sickness Impact Profile'' (SIP), which evaluates physical, psychosocial, and other activities, as well as functions of daily life, was used. Employment and rehospitalization rates were also examined. Twenty-one of 23 consecutive patients, aged 58 +/- 11 years, undergoing ICD implantation at Royal Perth Hospital were studied. During the 14 +/- 8 month follow-up, 4 patients died. Functional capacity was unchanged in all but one of the survivors in whom it improved from New York Heart Association Class III to II. Four of 8 survivors employed before implant have since retired. Six patients required rehospitalization on 23 occasions, problems related to arrhythmias or the ICD. Overall SIP scores preimplant (22.2 +/- 9.3; P < 0.05) were significantly worse at 6-month follow-up (21.7 +/- 18.2), but returned to preimplant levels by 12-month follow-up (8.8 +/- 10.8; NS). This was primarily due to transient problems in the areas of emotional behavior, alertness, and social interaction. SIP psychosocial dimension scores: preimplant: 7.2 +/- 9.0; 6-month: 17.8 +/- 28.2 (P < 0.05); and 12-month: 8.6 +/- 10.3 (NS).

However, the effects of anticoagulation on the distal false lumen and unfavorable remodeling of the distal aorta after aortic valve replacement remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to assess the impact of anticoagulation following aortic valve replacement on medium and long-term vascular remodeling outcomes in DeBakey type I aortic dissection.Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk for DeBakey Type I aortic dissection from September 2013 to December 2024. Seventy-two patients with preoperative and at least six months postoperative aortic computed tomography angiography images were included and stratified into a valve replacement group (n = 30) and a non-valve replacement group (n = 42). Various parameters of the residual dissected aorta were analyzed at six specific levels to evaluate late aortic remodeling, aortic diameter, and false lumen thrombosis.Results The median follow-up period was 17 (interquartile range IQR = 9-27) months. Preoperative characteristics and complications did not significantly differ between the two groups, except for body mass index, blood pressure, and severity of aortic regurgitation. The valve replacement group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamping time, cardiac arrest time, larger trunk diameter, and higher intraoperative red blood cells transfusion volume compared to the non-valve replacement group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in concomitant procedures, postoperative complications, or length of hospital stay. Regarding postoperative changes in the diameter of aortic lumen and true lumen, there were statistically significant difference in the true lumen on level 1 and the aortic lumen on level 3-5 of the valve replacement group. Additionally, the aortic lumen and true lumen on level 1 and true lumen on level 2 of the non-valve replacement group were statistically difference. There were no significant differences in the rate of aortic remodeling at each level or overall between the two groups. The postoperative false lumen thrombosis rate was higher in the mid-descending thoracic aorta and lower in the distal abdominal aorta.Conclusions Anticoagulation following aortic valve replacement for Debakey I aortic dissection has been shown to influence aortic diameter and the false lumen thrombosis rate, but it does not significantly affect the aortic remodeling rate.

Survival variability from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests can be explained by a range of factors. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education quality-improvement programs focusing on identified elements of basic life support provision in concert with resuscitation system interventions have been associated with significant improvements in survival after cardiac arrest. Surf Life Saving Australia members respond to approximately 65 cardiac arrests per year in the community while on duty and have successfully resuscitated many beachgoers over the years. In addition to this, members frequently respond to cardiac arrest events in community settings as first responders. Objective: The objective of this research was to measure CPR improvements in Australian surf lifesavers after a targeted education intervention. Methods: Recruiting Australian surf lifesavers, we conducted a multicenter before-and-after educational intervention, consisting of theory and practical CPR instruction with quantitative measurement, cohort study of those who had previously been trained in CPR. Results: Statistically significant improvements in quality of CPR by laypersons were observed as measured by the chest compression fraction, depth, and release, as well as a reduction in time off the chest, improved ventilation, and a reduction in the longest pause during 2 min of CPR. Conclusions: This study was the first to evaluate the impact of a targeted CPR quality-improvement educational initiative on a sample of volunteer CPR providers from a large national first responder organization. The results showed that focused education using evidence-based interventions supports substantial improvement in most CPR metrics measured. A targeted education intervention has the potential to improve laypersons CPR performance. The results should prompt community CPR training providers to evaluate the quality of CPR being provided by the staff members they train and consider implementing a quality-improvement program if results are below the desired thresholds.

Therefore, we hypothesized that ECPR with TTM could have the effectiveness to improve the neurological outcomes for adults following witnessed OHCA, in comparison to ECPR without TTM. Methods We performed retrospective subanalyses of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry. We focused on adults who underwent ECPR for witnessed OHCA.

Methods: In 21 domestic swine (16-23 kg) open chest cardiac massage was initiated after 10 min of ventricular fibrillation. With the onset of CPR animals randomly received HS (7.2%; 2 ml/kg per 10 min or 4 ml/kg per 20 min) or normal saline ((NS); 2 ml/kg per 10 min).

We aim to describe contemporary utilization and predictors of survival of patients receiving ECPR for OHCA. Methods The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify hospital discharge records of patients aged >= 18 years who underwent ECPR from 2012 to 2017. Patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of cardiac arrest, admitted urgently and placed on ECMO on Day 0 of hospitalization, were selected. Patients with a primary diagnosis indicative of veno-venous ECMO were excluded. Predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariable analyses. Results There were 1675 cases of ECPR, increasing from 185 cases in 2012 to 400 in 2017 (p < .001). Overall mortality was 63.3%, which remained stable over time (p = .441). Common diagnoses included ST-elevation myocardial infarction (39.1%), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (9.3%), and pulmonary embolism (13.7%). Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 495 patients (29.6%); coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 125 patients (7.5%).

There is increasing evidence that tumor necrosis factor -like weak apoptosis-inducing factor (TWEAK) is associated with the brain injury diseases. This study was aimed to investigate the modulation mechanism of TWEAK involved in brain injury after cardiac arrest/subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR).Materials and Methods: For in vivo experiments, healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were applied to establish CA/CPR model, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-stimulated neurons model was established in vitro. TWEAK short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were injected into the lateral ventricle of CA/CPR rats or transfected into OGD/R cell culture to analyze the consequent alteration in neurological scores, behavioral tests, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and neuroinflammation through immunofluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: There were high expressions of TWEAK and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) in the cerebral cortex of CA/CPR rats and OGD/R-stimulated neuronal cells. TWEAK knockdown attenuated cell apoptosis, inflammation and showed better behavioral tests in CA/CPR rats. Furthermore, TWEAK shRNAs obviously facilitated cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis and inflammation after OGD/R injury. Western blotting results stated that TWEAK silencing promoted phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) expressions.Conclusions: TWEAK might be involved in the pathogenesis of CA/CPR through inhibiting p38 MAPK/NF-?B pathway.",DISCOVERY MEDICINE,2023,"Zhang, HF; Wang, R",10.24976/Discov.Med.202335177.51,,WOS:001064947000006,A

Transthoracic echocardiography, has issues with image quality and by increasing hands-off times during resuscitation. We assessed the feasibility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which does not have both problems, at out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) emergency scenes. Included were 10 adults with non-traumatic OHCA in Vienna, Austria. An expert in emergency ultrasound was dispatched to the scenes in addition to the resuscitation team. Feasibility was defined as the ability to collect specific items of information by TEE within 10 min. Descriptive statistics were compiled and hands-off times were compared to a historical control group. TEE examinations were feasible in 9 of 10 cases and prompted changes in clinical management in 2 cases (cardiac tamponade: n = 1; right ventricular dilatation: n = 1). Their mean time requirement was 5.1 +/- 1.7 (2.8-8.0) min, and image quality was invariably rated as excellent or good during both compressions and pauses. No TEE-related complications, or interferences with activities of advanced life support were observed. The hands-off times during resuscitation were comparable to a historical control group not involving ultrasound (P = 0.24).

We report a case of neonatal coxsackievirus B (CVB) fulminant myocarditis successfully treated with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). Case presentation A previously healthy 7-day-old boy presented with fever for 4 days. Progressive cardiac dysfunction (weak heart sounds, hepatomegaly, pulmonary edema, ascites, and oliguria), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS), transient ventricular fibrillation, dramatically elevated creatine kinase-MB (405.8 U/L), cardiac troponin I (25.85 ng/ml), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP > 35,000 ng/L), and positive blood CVB ribonucleic acid indicated neonatal CVB fulminating myocarditis. It was refractory to mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, inotropes, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and diuretics during the first 4 days of hospitalization (DOH 1-4). The deterioration was suppressed by V-A ECMO in the next 5 days (DOH 5-9), despite the occurrence of bilateral grade III intraventricular hemorrhage on DOH 7. Within the first 4 days after ECMO decannulation (DOH 10-13), he continued to improve with withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, LVEF > 60%, and FS > 30%. In the subsequent 4 days (DOH 14-17), his LVEF and FS decreased to 52% and 25%, and further dropped to 37%-38% and 17% over the next 2 days (DOH 18-19), respectively. There was no other deterioration except for cardiomegaly and paroxysmal tachypnea. Through strengthening fluid restriction and diuresis, and improving cardiopulmonary function, he restabilized. Finally, notwithstanding NT-proBNP elevation (>35,000 ng/L), cardiomegaly, and low LVEF (40%-44%) and FS (18%-21%) levels, he was discharged on DOH 26 with oral medications discontinued within 3 weeks postdischarge. In nearly three years of follow-up, he was uneventful, with interventricular septum hyperechogenic foci and mild mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. Conclusions Dynamic cardiac function monitoring via real-time echocardiography is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of NM/NEM. As a lifesaving therapy, ECMO may improve the survival rate of patients with NM/NEM. However, the ""honeymoon period"" after ECMO may cause the illusion of recovery.

PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies from inception to October 2023. STATA SE 14.0 software was used for statistical analysis. A total of 2036 reports were identified with 14 studies meeting pre-designed inclusion criteria. Three long-term outcomes were investigated. In patients with HF, the increase of BCR level indicated a greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.38-2.00; I2 = 90.8%, P = 0.000). The acute HF (AHF) subgroup demonstrated a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.15-2.79; I2 = 93.9%, P = 0.000) as did the non-AHF subgroup (HR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.34-1.71; I2 = 37.1%, P = 0.122).

In addition, this study did not support the predictive value of BCR in CVD mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 0.91-2.43; I2 = 63%, P = 0.100) and HF hospitalization (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.73-2.24; I2 = 77.5%, P = 0.035). Sensitivity analysis showed that all the results were robust. In summary, the results showed that the blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio (BCR) had a significant predictive value for all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure and was a fairly promising predictor obviously.

A paucity of objective measurements preclude secure protocols for sequencing of interventions and, even more, when to initiate and discontinue cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The preparedness of both physicians and nursing professionals to implement the published guidelines has itself been questioned. Whereas early access defibrillation with automated external defibrillators may be of benefit in out-of-hospital settings, there has as yet been no secure evidence that automated external defibrillators have had a favorable impact on in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation when used on infrequent occasions by first responders.

Copeptin, a surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, has shown promising prognostic features in small observational studies and is used clinically for early rule out of acute coronary syndrome. The objective of this study was to explore the association between early measurements of copeptin, circulatory status, and short-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods Serial blood samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h as part of the target temperature management at 33 degrees C versus 36 degrees C after cardiac arrest trial, an international multicenter randomized trial where unconscious survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were allocated to an intervention of 33 or 36 degrees C for 24 h. Primary outcome was 30-day survival with secondary endpoints circulatory cause of death and cardiovascular deterioration composite; in addition, we examined the correlation with extended the cardiovascular sequential organ failure assessment (eCvSOFA) score. Results Six hundred ninety patients were included in the analyses, of whom 203 (30.3%) developed cardiovascular deterioration within 24 h, and 273 (39.6%) died within 30 days. Copeptin measured at 24 h was found to be independently associated with 30-day survival, hazard ratio 1.17 [1.06-1.28], p = 0.001; circulatory cause of death, odds ratio 1.03 [1.01-1.04], p = 0.001; and cardiovascular deterioration composite, odds ratio of 1.05 [1.02-1.08], p < 0.001. Copeptin at 24 h was correlated with eCvSOFA score with rho 0.19 [0.12-0.27], p < 0.001.

Re-oxygenation triggers a cascade of biochemical events for restoring function at the cost of improper homeostasis. The effects observed long after perinatal asphyxia (PA) have been explained by over-expression of sentinel proteins, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), competing for NAD(+) during re-oxygenation, leading to the idea that sentinel protein inhibition constitutes a therapeutic strategy. We studied the effects of nicotinamide and theophylline on PARP-1 activity assayed in brain and peripheral (heart) rat tissue 1-24 h after birth, as well as on changes in behaviour and monoamine neurotransmission in adult rats. PA was induced by immersing rat foetuses into a water bath for 0 or 21 min. After resuscitation, the pups were treated with nicotinamide (0.8 mmol/kg, i.p.), theophylline (0.14 mmol/kg, i.p.) or saline (0.9% NaCl) and nurtured by surrogate dams, pending behavioural and microdialysis experiments, or euthanised after birth for assaying PARP-1 activity. To estimate the in vivo distribution of a single dose of nicotinamide or theophylline into brain and peripheral compartment, a series of animals were implanted with microdialysis probes, one into the brain and other subcutaneously, 1 h after birth, assaying the drugs with a HPLC-UV system. Nicotinamide, but not theophylline prevented the long-term effects induced by PA. Only nicotinamide produced a consistent decrease in PARP-1 activity in brain and heart, whether assayed in control or asphyxia-exposed pups.

The animals were subjected to 5 min non-interventional circulatory arrest followed by 7 min closed chest CPR and received either 1 mmol/kg of sodium bicarbonate, I mmol/kg of tris buffer mixture, or the same volume of saline (n = 15 in all groups), adrenaline (epinephrine) boluses and finally external defibrillatory shocks. Systemic haemodynamic variables, cerebral cortical blood flow, arterial, mixed venous, and internal jugular bulb blood acid-base status and blood gases as well as cerebral tissue pH and PCO2 were monitored. Cerebral tissue acidosis was recorded much earlier than arterial acidaemia. After restoration of spontaneous circulation, during and after temporary arterial hypotension, pH in internal jugular bulb blood and in cerebral tissue as well as cerebral cortical blood flow was lower after saline than in animals receiving alkaline buffer. Buffer administration during CPR promoted cerebral cortical reperfusion and mitigated subsequent post-resuscitation cerebral acidosis during lower blood pressure and flow in the reperfusion phase. The arterial alkalosis often noticed during CPR after the administration of alkaline buffers was caused by low systemic blood flow, which also results in poor outcome.

However, it could induce microorganisms into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, posing a potential risk to food safety and public health. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effect of various preliminary stresses including cold, heat, osmosis, acidity and oxidation on HPCD-induced VBNC formation. The results indicated that there was no effect of preliminary stresses on VBNC Staphylococcus aureus induction. However, heat, acidity and long-term (24 h) cultivation preadaptation could significantly increase the VBNC E. coli production induced by HPCD. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes involved in ATP production were significantly decreased in these three stress-treated cells, and further ATP levels determination revealed that the ATP levels of the cell were significantly decreased after heat, acidity and long-term cultivation preadaptation, implying the decrease of ATP level caused by these stresses might be the reason for increasing VBNC production. To further study the relationship between ATP level and VBNC cell ratios after preadaptation. We artificially decreased the ATP levels, and detect their VBNC ratios after HPCD treatment. We found that with the ATP concentration decreasing after exposure to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP), the VBNC ratios were increased after HPCD treatment, indicating that the ATP contents were highly negatively correlated with VBNC ratios. This study proved that the preadaptation of heat, acidity and long-term cultivation could promote VBNC induction by decreasing the intracellular ATP level.

This study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis and novel biomarkers for monitoring the progression and early prognostication of PCABI. Methods: Mouse model of PCABI was induced by hyperkalemia-induced asystole and successful resuscitation. Young adult male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into sham-operation or asystole/resuscitation. The sham-operated mice were selected as control. Neurological examinations were performed at 24 h after resuscitation, and three groups were set: control (n = 4), severe PCABI (n = 3), and mild PCABI (n = 3). Cerebral cortexes were collected for data-independent acquisition-proteomic analyses. The pathogenesis and potential biomarkers were identified through the pairwise comparisons of three subgroups and subsequent bioinformatics analyses. Human serum proteomes profiles, extracted from a published work of the second analysis of TTM-trial, were used for joint analyses to identify the common and clinically relevant biomarkers at the same timepoint. Experimental and external validation were performed to verify the association between novel biomarkers and neural death in PCABI. Results: The proteomic analysis identified and quantified 7,745 proteins. The most prominent proteomic changes were related to response to external stimulus, stress response, regulation of biological and metabolic process, endomembrane system, and inflammatory response in the PCABI progression. 10 potential biomarkers were identified by the pairwise comparisons of three groups, and lipocalin-2 and angiotensinogen are common biomarkers with human studies at 24 h after resuscitation. Experimental validation verified that lipocalin-2 was closely associated with neurodegeneration in PCABI.

Our aim was to study survival and neurologic outcome associated with targeted temperature management strategy in postarrest patients with initial shockable rhythm. DESIGN: Observational substudy of the Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest without ST-segment Elevation trial. SETTING: Nineteen hospitals in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: The Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest trial randomized successfully resuscitated patients with shockable rhythm and absence of ST-segment elevation to a strategy of immediate or delayed coronary angiography. In this substudy, 459 patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia (32.0-34.0 degrees C) or targeted normothermia (36.0-37.0 degrees C) were included. Allocation to targeted temperature management strategy was at the discretion of the physician. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 90 days, 171 patients (63.6%) in the mild therapeutic hypothermia group and 129 (67.9%) in the targeted normothermia group were alive (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.62-1.18]; log-rank p = 0.35; adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.45-1.72). Patients in the mild therapeutic hypothermia group had longer ICU stay (4 d [3-7 d] vs 3 d [2-5 d]; ratio of geometric means, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51), lower blood pressures, higher lactate levels, and increased need for inotropic support.

Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting a scoping study was followed.ResultsThe search yielded 174 articles, with 16 meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Initially, 14 articles were selected, and 2 additional articles were identified through references. Themes extracted from these 16 articles include the need for support and information, emotional challenges, and acceptance of a new reality.ConclusionCardiac arrest survivors often experience loss of control, vulnerability, and insecurity. These emotional changes can be significant and may include physical challenges, cognitive impairments, and psychological distress, which can cause individuals to reevaluate their perspectives on life and accept a new reality, potentially leading to changes in their future outlook.",JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING,2025,"El Hussein, MT; Dhaliwal, S; Hakkola, J",10.1097/JCN.0000000000001119,,WOS:001626365600016,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,A Meta-ethnography of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survivors' Meanings on Life and Death,"Background: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors' physiological outcomes have been addressed, less is known on the holistic needs of individuals after OHCA, which hinders our ability to prioritize care around what really matters to survivors. Aim: The aim of this study was to interpretatively synthesize qualitative findings on OHCA survivors' perceptions and meanings of life and death and existential issues. Methods: We used a meta-ethnographic synthesis of published qualitative studies addressing the experiences of OHCA survivors based on a systematic literature search (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed). Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The identified studies were subjected to a quality appraisal based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Results: Based on eligibility criteria, 6 phenomenological studies were included, of overall medium to high quality. One core theme, ""the reality of death,"" and 4 main themes were identified: ""redefining existence""; ""revaluing death""; ""being familiar with, yet oblivious of death""; and ""living consciously."" Emerging from the realization of death, the themes appeared to describe a gradual progression toward living consciously. Conclusions: An existential trajectory and a need for meaning are central in the experience of OHCA survivors. When existential issues are not addressed, the ongoing suffering may interfere with survivors' recovery and quality of life. Future research needs to address specific needs and ways to support survivors' meaning-making.",JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING,2018,"Aristidou, M; Vouzavali, F; Karanikola, MN; Lambrinou, E; Papathanassoglou, E",10.1097/JCN.0000000000000467,,WOS:000440243400002,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Transvenous versus subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators in young cardiac arrest survivors,"Secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are indicated in young patients presenting with aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) because of ventricular arrhythmias. Transvenous-ICDs (TV-ICDs) are effective, established therapies supported by evidence. The significant morbidity associated with transvenous leads led to the development of the newer subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD). This review discusses the clinical considerations when selecting an ICD for the young patient presenting with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The major benefits of TV-ICDs are their ability to pace (antitachycardia pacing [ATP], bradycardia support and cardiac resynchronisation therapy [CRT]) and the robust evidence base supporting their use. Other benefits include a longer battery life. Significant complications associated with transvenous leads include pneumothorax and tamponade during insertion and infection and lead failure in the long term. Comparatively, S-ICDs, by virtue of having no intravascular leads, prevent these complications. S-ICDs have been associated with a higher incidence of inappropriate shocks. Patients with an indication for bradycardia pacing, CRT or ATP (documented ventricular tachycardia) are seen as unsuitable for a S-ICD. If venous access is unsuitable or undesirable, S-ICDs should be considered given the patient is appropriately screened. There is a need for further randomised controlled trials to directly compare the two devices. TV-ICDs are an effective therapy for preventing SCD limited by significant lead-related complications. S-ICDs are an important development hindered largely by an inability to pace. Young patients stand to gain the most from a S-ICD as the cumulative risk of lead-related complications is high. A clinical framework to aid decision-making is presented.",INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL,2023,"Morton, MB; Mariani, JA; Kistler, PM; Patel, H; Voskoboinik, A",10.1111/imj.16259,,WOS:001094761900001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Delayed versus immediate defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,Background: Human studies over the last decade have indicated that delaying initial defibrillation to allow a short period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may promote a more responsive myocardial state that is more likely to respond to defibrillation and result in increased rates of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and/or survival. Out-of-hospital studies have produced conflicting results regarding the benefits of CPR prior to defibrillation in relation to survival to hospital discharge. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of delayed defibrillation preceded by CPR with immediate defibrillation on survival to hospital discharge.,RESUSCITATION,2010,"Simpson, PM; Goodger, MS; Bendall, JC",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.04.016,,WOS:000280946600002,A

wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Psychological and behavioral dimensions in cardiac arrest survivors and their families: A state-of-the-art review,"This article aims to highlight high-quality observational and intervention studies focused on promoting psychological well-being among cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and their families. Following CA, many patients experience significant psychological distress, including depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Recent studies indicate that this distress can narrow patients' focus, resulting in heightened awareness of cardiac signals-such as fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure-that lead to constant monitoring and increased anxiety. This anxiety, compounded by behavioral avoidance toward cardioprotective behaviors and physiological hyperarousal, may elevate the risk of secondary cardiovascular diseases and adversely affect the quality of life. Current research is exploring behavioral interventions aimed at reducing this psychological distress, strategies to enhance coping mechanisms, and improving overall health in the survivor-family dyad. Unlike other cardiovascular conditions, no clinical practice guidelines exist for assessing or treating the psychological consequences of CA. Future research should prioritize identifying and treating modifiable psychological factors using targeted therapies and behavioral interventions.",NEUROTHERAPEUTICS,2025,"Agarwal, S; Wagner, MK; Mion, M",10.1016/j.neurot.2024.e00509,,WOS:001421729700001,A
wos,WoS-queryA1.ris,JOUR,Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) Retrospective analysis of a load and go strategy under the aspect of golden hour of eCPR,"Background Survival rates after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remain low. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) has been introduced as an attempt to increase survival in selected patients and observational studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, inclusion criteria and timing of eCPR remain undefined. Objective The current study analyzed a load and go strategy with respect to the golden hour of eCPR as a cut-off time for survival and favorable neurological outcome. Material and methods This retrospective cohort study included 32 patients who underwent eCPR treatment due to an OHCA between January 2017 and September 2019. Routinely taken patient demographic data (age, BMI, sex) were analyzed. The main focus was set on processing times in the preclinical and clinical setting. Time intervals including OHCA until ambulance arrival, time on scene, transportation times and door to eCPR were extracted from emergency medical service (EMS) and resuscitation protocols. Low-flow times, survival and neurological outcome were analyzed. Results The use of eCPR in OHCA was associated with survival to hospital discharge in 28% and a good neurological outcome in 19% of the cases. Both groups (survivor and nonsurvivor) did not differ in patient demographics except for age. Survivors were significantly younger (47 (30-60) vs. 59 (50-68) years, p = 0.035). Processing times as well as low-flow times were not significantly different (OHCA-eCPR survivor 64 (50-87) vs. non-survivor 74 (51-85) min; p-value 0.64); however, median low-flow times were outside the golden hour of eCPR (69 (52-86)). Conclusion Despite low-flow times of more than 60 min, eCPR was associated with survival in 28% after OHCA. Hence, exceeding the golden hour of eCPR cannot act as a definitive exclusion criterion for eCPR.",ANAESTHESIST,2021,"Reyher, C; Karst, SR; Muellenbach, RM; Lotz, C; Peivandi, AA; Boersch, V; Weber, K; Gradaus, R; Rolfes, C",10.1007/s00101-020-00896-2,,WOS:000598986600002,A
