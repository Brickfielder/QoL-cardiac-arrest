wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Validation of the Padova Prognostic Score for Colitis in Predicting Long-Term Outcome After Restorative Proctocolectomy,"Background: In 10%-20% of cases it is impossible to make a differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis. A 50% failure rate of J pouch ilea-anal anastomosis is observed in Crohn's colitis. In 2009, we created the Padua Prognostic Score for Colitis (PPSC) to predict the long-term clinical and functional outcome and quality of life of patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with J pouch. The aim of the present study is to establish and validate the accuracy of a prognostic score for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Patient population and methods: The PPSC was created in 2009 by integrating clinical and histological information of patients undergoing RPC. It included preoperative perianal abscess or fistula, rectal sparing, terminal ileum involvement, skip lesions and histological diagnosis of indeterminate colitis or Crohn's colitis on the operative specimen. The validity of this score was tested in predicting postoperative abscess or fistula, anal canal disease, pouchitis, pouch failure and new diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Correlation analysis, ROC curve analysis and survival analysis were used to validate the PPSC in a different cohort from the previous one. Results: We retrospectively enrolled in this study 138 consecutive patients undergoing CPR for ulcerative colitis (n = 127) or indeterminate colitis (n = 11) in our institution since 2005 to 2020. In this period, we observed 11 patients with postoperative abscess or fistula, 3 with anal canal disease, 40 with pouchitis, 6 with pouch failure and 6 with new diagnosis of Crohn's disease. In the new validation cohort, the PPSC confirmed to have a good accuracy in predicting the onset of postoperative CD (AUC = 74.5%, p = 0.018). Kaplan Meier curves demonstrate how a PPSC over 1 can reliably predicts the long-term onset of, pouchitis (p = 0.002) and anal abscess or fistulae (p = 0.04). Conclusions: In this validation study we confirmed the accuracy of the PPSC in predicting postoperative fistulas or abscesses and pouchitis. Therefore, we believe that in clinical practice patients with a PPSC score greater than 1 should be warned of this risk of possible Crohn's disease diagnosis and pouch failure.",FRONTIERS IN SURGERY,2022,"Angriman, I; Colangelo, A; Mescoli, C; Fassan, M; D'Inca, R; Savarino, E; Pucciarelli, S; Bardini, R; Ruffolo, C; Scarpa, M",10.3389/fsurg.2022.911044,,WOS:000838163200001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Neuroprotective-Neurorestorative Effects Induced by Progesterone on Global Cerebral Ischemia: A Narrative Review,"Progesterone (P4) is a neuroactive hormone having pleiotropic effects, supporting its pharmacological potential to treat global (cardiac-arrest-related) cerebral ischemia, a condition associated with an elevated risk of dementia. This review examines the current biochemical, morphological, and functional evidence showing the neuroprotective/neurorestorative effects of P4 against global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Experimental findings show that P4 may counteract pathophysiological mechanisms and/or regulate endogenous mechanisms of plasticity induced by GCI. According to this, P4 treatment consistently improves the performance of cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, impaired by GCI. This functional recovery is related to the significant morphological preservation of brain structures vulnerable to ischemia when the hormone is administered before and/or after a moderate ischemic episode; and with long-term adaptive plastic restoration processes of altered brain morphology when treatment is given after an episode of severe ischemia. The insights presented here may be a guide for future basic research, including the study of P4 administration schemes that focus on promoting its post-ischemia neurorestorative effect. Furthermore, considering that functional recovery is a desired endpoint of pharmacological strategies in the clinic, they could support the study of P4 treatment for decreasing dementia in patients who have suffered an episode of GCI.",PHARMACEUTICS,2023,"Montes, P; Ortíz-Islas, E; Rodríguez-Pérez, C; Ruiz-Sánchez, E; Silva-Adaya, D; Pichardo-Rojas, P; Campos-Peña, V",10.3390/pharmaceutics15122697,,WOS:001131296200001,A

For scholars, research into digital technologies in cardiovascular care has been relatively recent, thus it is important to understand the history of digital health technology in cardiovascular research-its emergence, rate of growth, hot topics, and its temporal evolution. The aim of this study was to analyse more than 16,000 articles in this domain based on their scientometric indicators. Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was accessed and searched at several levels, including titles, abstracts, keywords, authors, sources and individual articles. Analysis examined the temporal shifts in research and scholarly focus based on keywords, networks of collaboration, topical divisions in relation to digital technologies, and influential publications. Findings showed this research area is growing exponentially. Co-citation analysis revealed twenty prominent research streams and identified variation in the magnitude of activities in each stream. A recent emergence of research activities in digital technology in cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and arrythmia research was also demonstrated. Conversely, wearable technologies, activity tracking and electronic medical records research are now past their peak of reported research activity. With increasing amounts of novel technologies becoming available and more patients taking part in remote health care monitoring, further evaluation and research into digital technologies, including their long-term effectiveness, is needed.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Knowledge, attitude, and proficiency of healthcare providers in cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a public primary healthcare setting in Qatar","IntroductionEarly and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases both survival rate and post-cardiac arrest quality of life. This study aims to assess the current knowledge and ability of physicians and nurses in health centers (HCs) operated by the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) in Doha, Qatar, to perform CPR. MethodologyThis study consists of two parts. The first part is a descriptive cross-sectional survey using an online form targeting physicians and nurses working in all HCs to assess their CPR knowledge and attitude. The second part is a direct observation of CPR drills to evaluate the skills and competencies of code blue team members in a convenient sample of 14 HCs. A multivariate model was employed to test the independent effect of explanatory variables on the total knowledge score. ResultsA total of 569 physicians and nurses responded to the survey. Only one-half (48.7%) formally received training on basic life support within the last year. Furthermore, 62.7% have tried to revive a dying person with no pulse. All the participants recognize the importance of knowing how to revive a dying adult or child as part of their job. The study showed that being a nurse was the most important predictor of a higher knowledge score in both components. Attending more resuscitation courses (3-6 courses in the last 3 years) ranked second in importance, and a longer experience in clinical practice (5-10 and >10 years) ranked third in predictive power. In addition, the direct observation of CPR drill performance revealed a satisfactory outcome. ConclusionThe level of CPR knowledge and skills practice among healthcare providers in PHCC is deemed satisfactory as most providers reported having performed CPR in the past. Considering that PHCC is the first step to people's healthcare in Qatar, clinical staff should be certified and assessed regularly to ensure retention of resuscitation knowledge and skills.",FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE,2023,"Veettil, ST; Anodiyil, MS; Khudadad, H; Kalathingal, MA; Hamza, AH; Ummer, FP; Alnuaimi, AS",10.3389/fcvm.2023.1207918,,WOS:001040309800001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Whole Blood Selective Aortic Arch Perfusion for Exsanguination Cardiac Arrest: Assessing Myocardial Tolerance to the Duration of Cardiac Arrest,"Introduction: Selective aortic arch perfusion (SAAP) is an endovascular technique that consists of aortic occlusion with perfusion of the coronary and cerebral circulation. It been shown to facilitate return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after exanguination cardiac arrest (ECA), but it is not known how long arrest may last before the myocardium can no longer be durably recovered. The aim of this study is to assess the myocardial tolerance to exsanguination cardiac arrest before successful ROSC with SAAP. Methods: Male adult swine (n = 24) were anesthetized, instrumented, and hemorrhaged to arrest. Animals were randomized into three groups: 5, 10, and 15 min of cardiac arrest before resuscitation with SAAP. Following ROSC, animals were observed for 60 min in a critical care environment. Primary outcomes were ROSC, and survival at 1-h post-ROSC. Results: Shorter cardiac arrest time was associated with higher ROSC rate and better 1-h survival. ROSC was obtained for 100% (8/8) of the 5-min ECA group, 75% (6/8) of the 10-min group, 43% (3/7) of the 15-min group (P = 0.04). One-hour post-ROSC survival was 75%, 50%, and 14% in 5-, 10-, and 15-min groups, respectively (P = 0.02). One-hour survivors in the 5-min group required less norepinephrine (1.31 mg +/- 0.83 mg) compared with 10-SAAP (0.76 mg +/- 0.24 mg), P = 0.008. Conclusion: Whole blood SAAP can accomplish ROSC at high rates even after 10 min of unsupported cardiac arrest secondary to hemorrhage, with some viability beyond to 15 min. This is promising as a tool for ECA, but requires additional optimization and clinical trials.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Assessing student paramedics' measurements of fatigue and quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a simulated cardiac arrest case,"Objective: The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and the Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) recommend that high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the key to performance outcomes, emphasising compression and rotation through this process. The proposed study has a two-stage approach to evaluating cardiopulmonary resuscitations effectiveness by out-of-hospital practitioners. The first stage aimed to evaluate the influence of providing real-time biofeedback using the Q-CPR system on the provision of CPR by student paramedics. Secondly, the study quantified the effects of physical fatigue on maintaining quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed by paramedic students.Methods: Forty paramedic students completed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an instrumented manikin with and without audio-visual biofeedback (Q-CPR within the Phillips MRx defibrillator) in a balanced cross-over fashion. To quantify the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation concerning the percentage of applied compressions that meet the current ARC guidelines in terms of rate, depth, and recoil time, a manikin feedback system (SimMan 3 G; Laerdal, Norwegian) was used.Results: When using the Q-CPR prompt with bio-feedback, overall, the depth and fatigue levels increased significantly, highlighting a correlation between correct depth and increased fatigue.Conclusions: Audio prompts improved compression depth; however, fatigue levels increased. The depth during manual compression compared to the Q-CPR prompt was not statistically significant.(c) 2022 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To address this, we adapted a resilience intervention for survivors and their caregivers, entitled Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest (RT-CA). Methods: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of RT-CA between 09/2024-03/2025. We enrolled dyads of consecutively admitted CA survivors at Massachusetts General Hospital and their primary family caregivers. Inclusion criteria: adult English speakers, survivors must have ability to meaningfully participate (Short Form Mini Mental State Exam >= 5), one dyad member must have emotional distress (>= 8 on either subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]). Procedure: Dyads participated in six weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist focused on building mindfulness and coping skills. Feasibility outcomes were feasibility of recruitment, assessments, adherence; acceptability outcomes were satisfaction, credibility, expectancy. Dyads completed pre-and post-test psychosocial measures and participated in exit interviews. We calculated frequencies and proportions of our outcomes, conducted exploratory paired t-tests to examine initial signals of changes in psychosocial measures, and performed explanatory-sequential mixed methods to integrate data sources. Results: We screened 12 dyads and enrolled 7. RT-CA exceeded most feasibility and acceptability benchmarks (>70 % on 7 of 8). In exploratory analyses, participants experienced preliminary, yet meaningful reductions in emotional distress (HADS anxiety survivors: mean [95 % CI] = 5.4 [ 3.4, 7.5], p < 0.001; depression survivors = 5.1 [ 2.2, 8], p < 0.01; anxiety caregivers = 3.1 [ 0.8, 5.5], p < 0.05; depression caregivers = 3.5 [ 8, 1.1], p > 0.05).

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Shorter Interval from Witnessed Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest to Reaching the Target Temperature Could Improve Neurological Outcomes After Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation with Target Temperature Management: A Retrospective Analysis of a Japanese Nationwide Multicenter Observational Registry,"Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a more promising treatment for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) than conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). However, previous studies that compared ECPR and CCPR included mixed groups of patients with or without target temperature management (TTM). In this study, we compared the neurological outcomes of OHCA between ECPR and CCPR with TTM in all patients. We performed retrospective subanalyses of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA registry. Witnessed adult cases of cardiogenic OHCA treated with TTM were eligible for this study. We used univariate and multivariable analyses in all eligible patients to compare the neurological outcomes after ECPR or CCPR. We also conducted propensity score analyses of all patients and according to the interval from witnessed OHCA to reaching the target temperature (IWT) of <= 600, <= 480, <= 360, <= 240, and <= 120 minutes. We analyzed 1146 cases. The propensity score analysis did not show a significant difference in favorable neurological outcomes (defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2 at 1 month after collapse) between EPCR and CCPR (odds ratio: OR 4.683 [95% confidence interval: CI 0.859-25.535], p = 0.747). However, ECPR was associated with more favorable neurological outcomes in patients with IWT of <= 600 minutes (OR 7.089 [95% CI 1.091-46.061], p = 0.406), <= 480 minutes (OR 10.492 [95% CI 1.534-71.773], p = 0.0168), <= 360 minutes (OR 17.573 [95% CI 2.486-124.233], p = 0.0042), <= 240 minutes (OR 38.908 [95% CI 5.045-300.089], p = 0.0005), and <= 120 minutes (OR 200.390 [95% CI 23.730-1692.211], p < 0.001).

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Fatal late cardiovascular sequelae of previously unrecognized Kawasaki disease in 12-year-old child,"BackgroundKawasaki disease (KD), previously termed mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is a childhood vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. It primarily affects children under five years of age. If left untreated, KD can lead to serious cardiovascular complications, particularly coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) and thrombosis. Incomplete KD presents with fewer clinical criteria, making it more difficult to diagnose. Importantly, long-term sequelae such as CAA may remain clinically silent for years. This case highlights the critical need for awareness that even minimal or transient symptoms can be the only warning sign of life-threatening complications in adolescents with a remote history of incomplete or unrecognized KD.Case presentationWe describe a fatal case of a 12-year-old boy with a history of presumed myocarditis at age five, which retrospectively fulfilled criteria for incomplete KD but remained undiagnosed. From age five to twelve, he was asymptomatic except for occasional, brief chest tightness. At twelve, he presented with mild chest pain followed by rapid clinical deterioration, cardiac arrest, and death. Post-mortem imaging and autopsy revealed a thrombosed giant aneurysm of the left anterior descending coronary artery, consistent with chronic coronary disease.ConclusionThis case illustrates the potentially fatal long-term cardiovascular sequelae of unrecognized and untreated incomplete KD. Early recognition and treatment with IVIG are critical to reduce coronary complications. Healthcare providers must maintain clinical vigilance for patients with a history of KD. Even subtle or transient symptoms in patients with a history of KD should prompt immediate evaluation to prevent fatal outcomes.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2025,"Fremuthová, T; Huml, M; Kotková, A; Sykora, J; Baxa, J; Hanácek, L; Fremuth, J",10.1186/s12245-025-01079-9,,WOS:001654500200001,A

We assessed a new device, the CPR-Ezy(TM) (Medteq Innovations Pty Ltd., Brisbane, Australia), to aid timing and effectiveness of external cardiac compressions (ECC), by 32 subjects who had prior community-based training in CPR. ECC was performed on a manikin for 4 min by all subjects without and with the device. There was a statistically significant improvement in timing of ECC. Effectiveness of compressions was also improved over the whole time period, especially so in the last minute. We conclude that the CPR-Ezy can improve timing and effectiveness of ECC, and reduce the effects of resuscitator fatigue, in community-trained subjects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Association of hyperfibrinolysis with poor prognosis in refractory circulatory arrest: implications for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Background: Identifying candidates for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) is challenging, and novel predictive markers are urgently needed. Hyperfibrinolysis is linked to tissue hypoxia and is associated with poor outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) can detect or rule out hyperfibrinolysis, and could, therefore, provide decision support for initiation of eCPR. We explored early detection of hyperfibrinolysis in patients with refractory OHCA referred for eCPR. Methods: We analysed ROTEM results and resuscitation parameters of 57 adult patients with ongoing OHCA who presented to our ICU for eCPR evaluation. Results: Hyperfibrinolysis, defined as maximum lysis > 15%, was present in 36 patients (63%) and was associated with higher serum lactate, lower arterial blood pH, and increased low-flow intervals. Of 42 patients who achieved return of circulation, 28 had a poor 30-day outcome. The incidence of hyperfibrinolysis was higher in the poor outcome group compared with patients with good outcomes (75% [21 of 28] vs 7.1% [1 of 14]; P<0.001). < 0.001). The ratio of EXTEM A5 to lactate concentration showed good predictive value in detecting hyperfibrinolysis (AUC of 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.8-1]). Conclusions: Hyperfibrinolysis was common in patients with refractory cardiac arrest, and was associated with poor prognosis. The combination of high lactate with early clot firmness values, such as EXTEM A5, appears promising for early detection of hyperfibrinolysis.

Therefore, we started this prospective longitudinal study to investigate the impact of liver cysts on QOL. Methods We grouped the 111 included ADPKD patients into 4 groups (control group A; < 25%, group B; 25-49%, group C; 50-75%, group D; > 75%) according to liver cysts-parenchyma ratio (CPR). QOL was measured by FANLTC + FACT-Hep scores. We compared QOL scores and several clinical parameters amongst these groups for 3 years. Results The number of patients in group A, B, C, and D was 31, 14, 14, and 23, respectively. Although there were no significant differences in AST (p = 0.107), ALT (p = 0.925), and serum albumin (p = 0.212) between the four groups, platelet count was significantly decreased along with the extension of cyst volume (p = 0.030). Overall, the mean FANLTC and FACT-Hep scores were 71.8 +/- 12.5, and 32.4 +/- 5.8, respectively. FANLTC (p = 0.017) and FACT-Hep scores (p = 0.003) were significantly decreased with increasing cyst volume. From the data collected at the time of registration, multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that the CPR had a significant influence on FANLTC and FACT-Hep scores.

Today it is universally agreed that successful and gentle initial bladder closure is decisive for favorable long-term outcome with regard to bladder capacity, renal function and continence. Due to a number of reasons, including a lack of comparable multicenter studies, a range of concepts is currently used to achieve successful primary closure. We review the literature of the last 15 years on the current concepts of bladder exstrophy repair with regard to the time of primary closure (initial vs. delayed closure), the concepts of primary closure (single-stage vs. staged approach; without osteotomy vs. osteotomy) and their outcomes. There is a worldwide lack of multicenter outcome studies with adequate patient numbers and precisely defined outcome parameters, based on the use of validated instruments. The modern staged repair (MRSE) in different variations, the complete primary reconstruction of exstrophy (CPRE), and the radical soft-tissue mobilization (RSTM) had been the most extensively studied and reported procedures. These major concepts are obligatory stable now for more than 20 years. Nevertheless, there are still a lot of open-ended questions e.g., on the potential for development of the bladder template, on continence, on long-term orthopedic outcome, on sexuality and fertility and on quality of life.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,An improved thermal-compositional simulator for gas extraction from hydrate-bearing sediments at the field-scale,"Natural gas hydrate (NGH) is considered a highly promising clean energy resource, whose production involves complex multi-field processes. Field-scale simulation provides valuable insights for the economic development of hydrate. However, accurate and robust numerical simulators capable of capturing complex processes specific to hydrate production modeling have remained limited. In this study, a fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-chemical model for gas extraction from hydrate-bearing sediments (HBS) was developed based on a flexible thermalcompositional framework. The model enables simulating the non-isothermal, multi-phase, multi-component flow with hydrate kinetics in the sediments. Furthermore, several strategies were employed to improve the computational efficiency and robustness of field-scale simulations. To achieve this, an isenthalpic flash procedure for phase transition was proposed to ensure local mass and energy conservation. Also, phase-based variable reduction and CPR-preconditioning techniques were incorporated in the hydrate-related linear system. A fully implicit numerical procedure was finally implemented in a three-dimensional simulator named HydrateSys V1.0. The reliability of the enhanced simulator was validated through comparisons with three typical cases. The merit of the isenthalpic flash procedure proposed in this study was demonstrated through a numerical performance comparison. Further, a field-scale case was established to predict gas production and reservoir responses in a long-term simulation. The results demonstrated an improvement in computational performance, highlighting the CPR preconditioner's potential in large-scale hydrate model. Finally, a case for the SHSC2-4 well in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea was conducted under depressurization, demonstrating the applicability of this simulator.",COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS,2025,"Tang, ZC; Lei, G; Gao, XW; You, ZG; Sun, JX; Ning, FL",10.1016/j.compgeo.2025.107521,,WOS:001547124700001,A

The combination of therapeutic nihilism and the refractoriness of seizures in a setting where pessimistic prognostic impressions prevail is likely the main driver of such poor outcomes. The resulting pervasive vicious cycle perpetuates this knowledge gap, whereby hypoxic-ischemic insults as the etiology for seizures remain a ubiquitous exclusion criterion for clinal trials in status epilepticus. Effective therapies targeting hyperexcitability resulting from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury are urgently needed. Early inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase with vigabatrin holds potential as an effective adjunctive therapy for PASE. This scientific premise is based on the resulting halted GABA catabolism thereby promoting synergistic augmentation of GABAergic pathway when used in combination with positive GABAergic allosteric modulators.

Sepsis survivors are more frequently discharged from hospital and often experience long-term outcomes such as late mortality, immune dysfunction, secondary infections, impaired quality of life, and unplanned readmissions. Early recognition and management of sepsis have challenged emergency care and critical care physicians and nurses. New sepsis definitions were produced and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2016 was updated recently. Although hospital readmissions after sepsis are common, associated risk factors and how to manage patients who survive an episode of sepsis still need clarification. The immune dysfunction caused by sepsis/septic shock is complex, persistent, affects inflammatory and anti-inflammatory systems, and might be associated with long-term outcomes of sepsis. Several randomized controlled trials (RCT) that analyzed new (and old) interventions in sepsis/septic shock are discussed in this review in parallel with the SSC 2016 recommendations and other guidelines when relevant. RCTs addressing incidence, treatment, and prevention of important sepsis-associated organ dysfunction such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and brain dysfunction are highlighted.

Methods: 120 patients with pelvic fracture complicated by multiple injuries admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to January 2023 were selected and divided into a damage control group (early temporary reduction after resuscitation, n = 60) and a control group (no reduction and resuscitation only, n = 60) by treatment methods. The control group was treated with conventional methods, while the damage control group was treated with the damage control strategy combining pre-hospital emergency treatment combined with inhospital treatment in addition to conventional methods. The mortality rate, complication rate, fracture reduction quality, long-term efficacy, and patient satisfaction of the two groups were compared. Results: The mortality rate of the damage control group was lower than that of the control group, and the difference has statistical significance (P<0.05); the incidence of infection, DIC, and MODS of the damage control group were lower than that of the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (P<0.05); the incidence of ARDS in the two groups is not that different (P>0.05); the fracture reduction quality and long-term therapeutic effect of patients in the two groups were statistically different, with the damage control group outperforming the control group in both aspects; the difference between the two groups in terms of patient satisfaction was statistically significant (P<0.05), with the patient satisfaction of the damage control group being higher than that of the control group. Conclusion: For patients with pelvic fracture, the application of the damage control strategy combining prehospital emergency treatment and in-hospital treatment is a boon to the standardization of the treatment process, the improvement of the treatment success rate and fracture reduction quality and the reduction of complications, and therefore is worth promoting in clinical practice. the early application of external fixation has helped with the definitive reduction at a time when the patuent was stable.",INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED,2024,"Chen, BJ",10.1016/j.injury.2024.111391,,WOS:001199248600001,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Surgical stabilization of severe chest wall injury following cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) contributes to significant chest wall injury similar to blunt trauma. With benefits realized for surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRFs) for flail injuries and severely displaced fractures following trauma, SSRF for chest wall injury following CPR could be advantageous, provided good functional and neurologic outlook. Experience is limited. We present a review of patients treated with SSRF at our institution following CPR. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing SSRF following CPR was performed between 2019 and 2020. Perioperative inpatient data were collected with outpatient follow-up as able. RESULTS Five patients underwent SSRF over the course of the 2-year interval. All patients required invasive ventilation preoperatively or had impending respiratory. Mean age was 59 +/- 12 years, with all patients being male. Inciting events for cardiac arrest included respiratory, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, pulseless electrical activity, and anaphylaxis. Time to operation was 6.6 +/- 3 days. Four patients demonstrated anterior flail injury pattern with or without sternal fracture, with one patient having multiple severely displaced fractures. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture was performed appropriately to restore chest wall stability. Mean intensive care unit length of stay was 9.8 +/- 6.4 days and overall hospital length of stay 24.6 +/- 13.2 days. Median postoperative ventilation was 2 days (range, 1-15 days) with two patients developing pneumonia and one requiring tracheostomy. There were no mortalities at 30 days. One patient expired in hospice after a prolonged hospitalization. Disposition destination was variable. No hardware complications were noted on outpatient follow-up, and all surviving patients were home. CONCLUSION Chest wall injuries are incurred frequently following CPR. Surgical stabilization of these injuries can be considered to promote ventilator liberation and rehabilitation. Careful patient selection is paramount, with surgery offered to those with reversible causes of arrest and good functional and neurologic outcome.

Recently completed clinical trials have provided a rationale for treatment recommendations in some specific settings. Beta-blocking therapy is recommended for postinfarction patients with frequent or complex ventricular premature beats. In contrast, calcium antagonist therapy is not helpful in these cases, and Class I antiarrhythmic therapy is actually harmful. Early indications of benefit from Class m antiarrhythmic therapies, particularly amiodarone, are under evaluation in large trials. Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) occuring late after myocardial infarction require therapy. Viable therapeutic methods include individualized antiarrhythmic therapy selected by the noninvasive approach, individualized antiarrhythmic therapy selected by the invasive approach, empiric amiodarone therapy, transcatheter or surgical ablative therapy (for VT), and use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Clinical trial data have yet to determine which of these approaches is most effective under which circumstances. Postinfarction patients with nonsustained VT are the focus of several ongoing treatment trials. Early data suggest that risks requiring specific therapy are reached only by those patients who also have significant left ventricular dysfunction. The presence of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia at an electrophysiologic study may further risk stratify such patients. High-risk patients with nonsustained ventricular tacycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia should participate in ongoing clinical trials. In the absence of this opportunity, intensive treatment should be considered.",ANNUAL REVIEW OF MEDICINE,1994,"MITCHELL, LB",,,WOS:A1994NF16800011,A

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be a promising strategy for post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral protection in rat, but its effectiveness in the clinically relevant swine model and the potential protective mechanism remain unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether MSCs administration could alleviate post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral injuries through the inhibition of cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis in swine. Twenty-four male domestic swine were randomly divided into three groups: sham, CPR, and MSC. A dose of 2.5x10(6)/kg of MSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells was intravenously infused at 1.5, and 3 days prior to CA. The animal model was established by 8 min of CA and then 8 min of CPR. After resuscitation, cardiac, cerebral function and injury biomarkers were regularly evaluated for a total of 24 h. At 24 h post-resuscitation, pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-18), ferroptosis-related proteins (ACSL4, GPX4) and iron deposition in the heart, cortex and hippocampus were measured. Consequently, significantly greater cardiac, cerebral dysfunction and injuries after resuscitation were observed in the CPR and MSC groups compared with the sham group. However, the severity of cardiac and cerebral damage were significantly milder in the MSC group than in the CPR group. In addition, the expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD and ACSL4, the contents of IL-1 beta and IL-18, and the level of iron deposition were significantly higher while the expression level of GPX4 was significantly lower in the heart, cortex and hippocampus in all resuscitated animals compared with the sham group. Nevertheless, MSCs administration significantly decreased post-resuscitation cardiac, cerebral pyroptosis and ferroptosis compared to the CPR group. Our results showed that the administration of MSCs significantly alleviated post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral injuries in swine, in which the protective effects were related to the inhibition of cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis.",FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY,2021,"Xu, JF; Zhang, MH; Liu, F; Shi, L; Jiang, XK; Chen, C; Wang, JA; Diao, MY; Khan, ZU; Zhang, M",10.3389/fphar.2021.793829,,WOS:000738325700001,A

A narrative literature review was conducted on the effectiveness of mobile CPR applications for smartphones. Studies published between 2014 and 2024 were included to ensure that new technological advances were examined. Our findings revealed that guided CPR applications significantly improve most critical parameters for efficacious resuscitation. Application users demonstrated that they achieved performance comparable to or even better than CPR-certified individuals. However, these tools have limitations, mostly related to familiarity, which may result in a delay in activating the application and, therefore, in initiating CPR. While smartphone applications are promising tools for enhancing bystander CPR, their integration into emergency medical response requires careful consideration. To fully take advantage of these applications, they should be incorporated into public health campaigns and standard CPR training. This would be even more successful if the application's functionality were standardized across different regions. Our research indicates that a combination of education and technology will likely play a major role in CPR training in the future, improving the efficacy and accessibility of life-saving measures.

Up to now, the latter approach, which causes neuropathologic changes and neurological abnormalities, has not provided unequivocal data on pharmacological measures to ameliorate post-anoxic brain damage, because of logistical difficulties and many extracranial complicating factors. As tracheotomy and oral intubation in rats proved impractical in studies on recovery from asphyxia transtracheal jet ventilation was tested in 14 rats as a measure for effective prolonged and reversible control of airway and ventilation. Subsequently, in 37 other rats studied, during the 1st postinsult week, the effects of anesthesia, with or without 6 min asphyxia, on behavior, i.e., unrestrained spontaneous locomotor activity and 2 sessions of 1-trail passive avoidance. Transtracheal jet ventilation proved a reliable method for reversible and prolonged controlled ventilation in rats. Spontaneous locomotor activity was affected for at least 48 h after anesthesia and differently so after asphyxia. Passive avoidance was affected only after asphyxia. The recovery of behavior was delayed for days, whereas the recovery of neurologic deficits was only delayed for several post-asphyxia hours. The asphyxiated rats showed hyperexcitability for at least 2 wk. The existence of abnormal behavior during recovery from mild anoxic-ischemic insults to the brain provides parameters for evaluation of therapies of the post-resuscitation disease in a model without the difficulties encountered in models with severe insults, which made post-insult intensive care necessary.

Nursing students often struggle to transfer classroom-acquired knowledge into real-world clinical environments, resulting in decreased confidence, impaired decision-making, and compromised patient care. Clinical simulation has emerged as a promising pedagogical tool to address this longstanding theory-practice gap by recreating realistic scenarios in a controlled setting.MethodThis systematic review synthesized studies published from 2010 to 2025 concerning the use of clinical simulation in nursing education. Five databases were searched using defined keywords to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies focused on simulation-based interventions aimed at enhancing nursing students' clinical competence, decision-making, confidence, and knowledge transfer. Data extraction was independently performed by reviewers, and methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2, CASP, and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) checklists. A thematic synthesis approach was employed to analyze both qualitative and quantitative findings.ResultsOf the fifteen included studies, twelve reported significant improvements in nursing students' clinical decision-making, judgment, or self-confidence, involving over 1,100 participants. High-fidelity simulation and structured scenario-based interventions were particularly effective in enhancing core competencies such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), infection control, and diagnostic reasoning. Thematic synthesis categorized findings into six domains: clinical decision-making, clinical judgment, learner self-confidence, empathy development, experiential learning, and learner satisfaction.

A blended learning approach is effective for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with AED usage, and regular hands-on CPR refresher training is recommended. The objective was to test if provision of CPR-training equipment and learning resources combined with a contract to recruit volunteer CPR trainers could facilitate regular refresher CPR-training in Norwegian football clubs and to increase the number and accessibility of AEDs by providing clubs with AEDs and heated cabinets and mandate registration in the national AED registry. Methods: Non-randomized pilot study (2020-2023). Clubs signed contracts that they would perform CPR training with the use of AEDs for 70% of football players/coaches/staff/volunteers each year and place their received AED outdoors in heated cabinets and register their AED in the Norwegian national AED registry.

The HYPERION trial included ICU-treated non-shockable cardiac arrest patients. The AWARE study included ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We compared the 3-months HRQOL of these patients to those of a large sample of the French general population. Physical and mental dimension were compared. Multivariable linear regression was used to pick up factors associated with HRQOL. Results: 72 and 307 patients of the HYPERION and the AWARE studies were compared to 20,574 French controls. ICU patients evidenced lower scores in all the SF-36 dimensions compared to the controls. Similar scores were observed in both HYPERION and AWARe trials. The physical component score was lower in patients from the HYPERION trial compared to those from the AWARE trials and to controls (38.6 [29.6-47.8], 35.4 [27.5-46.4] vs. 53.0 [46.0-56.7], p < 0.001).

Methods: Online databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsychINFO) from inception-August 23, 2024. Included articles evaluated measurement properties, interpretability (assigning meaning to scores), and/or feasibility (ease of application) of multidomain instruments for screening neurocognitive function among OHCA survivors.

Monitoring the cardiovascular system has been an important clinical issue in intensive care unit (ICU). On the other hand, the rhythms of the heart rate variability following CA are still not fully understood, and there are limited number of literatures reporting the cardiovascular function recovery following CA. In this paper, we studied the scaling properties of heart rate variability (HRV) after CA by centered-moving-average-based detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Our results showed that the scaling factor of the baseline HRV is close to that of Brownian motion, and after a CA event it shifts to a 1/f noise-like rhythm. DFA could be a promising tool in evaluating the cardiovascular long term recovery following CA injury. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Organ injury caused by ischemia and hypoxia during prolonged cardiac arrest is compounded by reperfusion injury that occurs when a spontaneous circulation is restored. A bundle of procedures, which may need to be administered simultaneously, is required. The procedures include prompt identification and treatment of the cause of cardiac arrest, as well as a definitive airway and ventilation together. Additional benefit is possible with appropriate forms of early goal-directed therapy and achieving therapeutic hypothermia within the first few hours, followed by gradual rewarming and ensuring glycaemic control to be within a range of 6 to 10mmol/L. All these would be important and need to be continued for at least 24 hours. Previous studies have showed that the effects of Shen-Fu injection (SFI) are based on aconitine properties, supplemented by ginsenoside, which can scavenge free radicals, improve energy metabolism, inhibit inflammatory mediators, suppress cell apoptosis, and alleviate mitochondrial damage.

Here we examine these two dominant Rpf antigens in more detail and define the nature of the responding T-cell subsets. Multiparameter cytokine profiling showed that Rv2389c and, to a lesser extent, Rv0867c were recognized by mycobacterium-responsive healthy Dutch individuals; peptide-scanning revealed several epitopes, including a single immunodominant epitope in Rv2389c.

Despite their effectiveness, their use in OHCA has not yet become common practice. Unfortunately, in 18-59% of cases, public access AEDs were deemed to be in poorly accessible areas or not available all of the time. Objective: We present the existing literature on the implementation of drone delivery of AEDs to improve the response time of the emergency medical services. Discussion: Test flights and mathematical/geographic models have been used to assess the effectiveness of drones in delivering AEDs to patients with OHCA. The results of those studies showed promising outcomes given that drone usage led to improved delivery times of AEDs compared with emergency medical services delivery. Conclusions: While drones have the potential to dramatically improve cardiac arrest patient care, further studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness in real-life clinical scenarios.

Despite advances in traditional resuscitation measures, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) mortality remains high. In the context of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), VA-ECMO therapy offers a promising approach by providing circulatory support during cardiac arrest, allowing time for diagnostic evaluation and targeted therapy. However, patient selection for ECPR remains a challenge, relying on various factors including initial rhythm, duration of no-flow and low-flow states, as well as presence of reversible causes. Recent studies such as the ARREST, Prague OHCA and INCEPTION trials have investigated the efficacy of ECPR in OHCA patients, yielding mixed results. While the ARREST trial demonstrated a survival benefit with ECPR, the Prague OHCA and INCEPTION trials showed varying outcomes, reflecting the complexity of patient selection and treatment strategies. Despite inherent risks and complications associated with ECPR, it may offer a potential survival advantage under optimal conditions. Future directions in ECPR involve the development of innovative treatment protocols such as the CARL therapy, which incorporates specialized ECMO systems and tailored perfusion solutions. Early studies indicate promising outcomes with CARL therapy, emphasizing the importance of a well-coordinated and structured approach to ECPR implementation.

In patients with an im-plantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), ES is best defined as 3 appropriate VT detections in 24 h, treated by antitachycardia pacing, shock or eventually untreated but sustained in a VT monitoring zone. The number of shocks and inappropriate detections are irrelevant for the definition. ES occurs in approximately 25% of ICD patients within 3 years, with typically 5-55 individual VTs within one storm. Potential triggers can be found in approximately 66% of patients and include new/worsened heart failure, changes in antiarrhythmic medication, context with other illness, psychological stress, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. In most patients, ES consists of monomorphic VT indicating the presence of reentry while ventricular fibrillation indicating acute ischemia is rare. ES seems to have a low immediate mortality (1%) but frequently (50-80%) leads to hospitalization. Long-term prognostic implications of ES are unclear. The key intervention in ES is reduction of the elevated sympathetic tone by beta blockers and frequently benzodiazepines. Anniodarone i.v. has also been successful and azimilide seems promising while class I antiarrhythmic drugs are usually unsuccessful. Substrate mapping and VT ablation may be useful in treatment and prevention of ES.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a geolocation application for locating automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in the urban area of a medium-sized city in southern Brazil. Methods A mobile application was developed to locate AEDs in public places, indicating the best route to the nearest AED with an intuitive design for emergency use. The app provides information on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial care, and AED use. The research steps included a literature review on the double diamond design process, prototyping, expert validation, and simulation tests. Results The Local DEA app, developed for Android and iOS, offers features such as route calculation to the nearest AED and emergency services. In an evaluation conducted by 30 experts, the app was well accepted for its ease of use and efficiency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92).

Despite shortage of resources, adapting protocol-based care has reduced sepsis-related deaths but survivors of pediatric sepsis are at risk of poor functional outcomes. ObjectivesTo perform a scoping review of the literature on functional outcomes of pediatric sepsis survivors after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) and discuss the implications for patients in LMICs. The outcomes include prevalence of survival with reduced functional outcomes or quality of life (QoL) and changes over time during follow-up or recovery, and these outcomes were compared with other groups of children. MethodsWe searched major medical electronic databases for relevant literature from January 2005 until November 2021, including Medline (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases. We included observational studies and follow-up data from clinical trials involving children/adolescents (<= 18 years) who were admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and got discharged finally. Major focus was on survivors of sepsis in LMIC. We followed PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISM-ScR). ResultsWe included eight papers reporting data of functional outcomes in 2,915 children (males = 53%, and comorbidity present in 56.6%). All included studies were either a prospective or retrospective cohort study. Studies were classified as Level II evidence. Disabilities affecting physical, cognitive, psychological, and social function were reported in children following discharge. Overall disability reported ranged between 23 and 50% at hospital discharge or 28 days. Residual disability was reported at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up with an overall improving trend. Failure to recover from a baseline HRQL on follow-up was seen in one-third of survivors. Organ dysfunction scores such as pSOFA, PeLOD, vasoactive inotrope score, neurological events, immunocompromised status, need for CPR, and ECMO were associated with poor functional outcome. ConclusionsThe research on functional outcomes in pediatric sepsis survivors is scarce in LMIC. Measuring baseline and follow-up functional status, low-cost interventions to improve management of sepsis, and multidisciplinary teams to identify and treat disabilities may improve functional outcomes.",FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,2022,"Ravikumar, N; Sankar, J; Das, RR",10.3389/fped.2022.762179,,WOS:000777208600001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Discrepancies between Retrospective Review of ""Real-Time"" Electronic Health Record Documentation and Prospective Observer Documentation of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Quality Metrics in an Academic Cardiac Intensive Care Unit","Background: Every year, approximately 200,000 patients will experience in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in the United States. Survival has been shown to be greatest with the prompt initiation of CPR and early interventions, leading to the development of time-based quality measures. It is uncertain how documentation practices affect reports of compliance with time-based quality measures in IHCA. Methods: A retrospective review of all cases of IHCA that occurred in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) at an academic quaternary hospital was conducted. For each case, a member of the code team (observer) documented performance measures as part of a prospective cardiac arrest quality improvement database. We compared those data to those abstracted in the retrospective review of ""real-time"" documentation in a Resuscitation Narrator module within electronic health records (EHRs) to investigate for discrepancies. Results: We identified 52 cases of IHCA, all of which were witnessed events. In total, 47 (90%) cases were reviewed by observers as receiving epinephrine within 5 min, but only 42 (81%) were documented as such in the EHR review (p = 0.04), meaning that the interrater agreement for this metric was low (Kappa = 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.36). Four (27%) eligible patients were reported as having defibrillation within 2 min by observers, compared to five (33%) reported by the EHR review (p = 0.90), and with substantial agreement (Kappa = 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.79). There was almost perfect agreement (Kappa = 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88) for the initial rhythm of cardiac arrest (25% shockable rhythm by observers vs. 29% for EHR review, p = 0.31).

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Hydrocortisone improves post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting the NF-KB pathway,"Myocardial dysfunction is a major cause of early mortality after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following cardiac arrest (CA). Following the return of spontaneous circulation, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury can activate the NF-kappa B pathway, leading to the transcription of inflammatory genes that impair myocardial function. While clinical studies show hydrocortisone (HC) improves outcomes in CA patients during CPR, its specific role in modulating the NF-kappa B pathway is unclear. In this study, we established an in vitro model by inducing hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in H9C2 cardiomyocytes using Na2S2O4, followed by HC treatment. The results showed that HC treatment of H/R-injured cardiomyocytes promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and suppressed the NF-kappa B pathway, thereby reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. Moreover, inhibition of the NF-kappa B pathway enhanced the proliferative capacity of H/R cardiomyocytes, decreased apoptosis rates, and reduced IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha expression levels, with these effects being further amplified by HC treatment. These findings were further supported by in vivo experiments. In conclusion, our study suggests that HC may promote H/R cardiomyocyte proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and alleviate inflammatory responses by suppressing the NF-kappa B pathway, providing new evidence to support its potential clinical application in CA management.",BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY,2025,"Fang, YQ; Song, FL; Gao, CY; Wang, ZM",10.1139/bcb-2024-0162,,WOS:001376684000001,A

We compared ventilations during manual and mechanical (load-distributing band - LDB) CPR, which gives ventilation prompts. Our primary objective was to compare the ventilation rate between manual CPR and LDB-CPR. Method: This was a phased, non-randomised study at a tertiary hospital emergency department. All out-of-hospital, non-traumatic cardiac arrest adult patients during the study period from February 2007 till July 2008 were eligible. Pregnant females and patients aged less than 18 years of age were excluded. Ventilation rates in the first and second 5 minutes segments were recorded. Over-ventilation was defined as ventilation rate above 12 breaths per minute. All data analyses were performed with SPSS, version 17.0. Mean differences with 95% confidence interval (CI) were compared between the 2 treatment groups. Results: From February 2007 till August 2007, there were 29 patients with manual CPR; and from September 2007 till July 2008, there were 62 with LDB-CPR. In the first 5 minutes of CPR, the proportion of patients that were over-ventilated, was 27.6% (manual) and 4.8% (LDB) (difference = 22.7%; 95% CI: 3.5-46.4%).

However, its efficacy in promoting survival has not been evaluated. We compared survival of pediatric cardiac surgery patients suffering in-hospital cardiac arrest who were resuscitated with extracorporeal CPR (E-CPR) to those resuscitated with conventional CPR (C-CPR) using propensity matching. DESIGN: Retrospective study using multicenter data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry (2008-2020). SETTING: Multicenter cardiac arrest database containing cardiac arrest and CPR data from U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: Cardiac surgical patients younger than 18 years old who suffered in-hospital cardiac arrest and received greater than or equal to 10 minutes of CPR. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1223 patients, 741 (60.6%) received C-CPR and 482 (39.4%) received E-CPR. E-CPR utilization increased over the study period (p < 0.001). Duration of CPR was longer in E-CPR compared with C-CPR recipients (42 vs. 26 min; p < 0.001). In a propensity score matched cohort (382 E-CPR recipients, 382 C-CPR recipients), E-CPR recipients had survival to discharge (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% CI, 1.7-2.9; p < 0.001). E-CPR survival was only higher when CPR duration was greater than 18 minutes. Propensity matched analysis using patients from institutions contributing at least one E-CPR case (n = 35 centers; 353 E-CPR recipients, 353 C-CPR recipients) similarly demonstrated improved survival in E-CPR recipients compared with those who received C-CPR alone (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.6-2.8; p < 0.001).

This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics and predictors of immediate survival among ED cardiac arrest patients in Ethiopian hospitals. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 215 adult patients who experienced IHCA in the EDs of Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College and Addis Ababa Burn, Emergency, and Trauma Hospital between January 2022 and December 2023. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of immediate survival, defined as returns of spontaneous circulation sustained for at least one hour. Results: Among 215 patients, the mean age was 50.7 years, and 58.6 % were male. The overall immediate survival rate was 46.5 % (n = 100). Independent predictors of survival included male sex (AOR 2.20; 95 % CI 1.06-2.89), respiratory failure as the cause of arrest (AOR 15.04; 95 % CI 2.34-95.13), continuous cardiac monitoring (AOR 4.94; 95 % CI 1.59-15.39), and initial shockable rhythms-ventricular fibrillation (AOR 37.93; 95 % CI 2.20-655.58) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (AOR 25.64; 95 % CI 5.08-129.47). Admission for sepsis was associated with lower survival (AOR 0.05; 95 % CI 0.01-0.68). Conclusion: Nearly half of patients with ED cardiac arrest in Ethiopia achieved immediate survival.

Methods; Single center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase II trial of thiamine in adults within 4.5 hours of return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), with coma and lactate >= 3 mmol/L. Participants received 500 mg IV thiamine or placebo twice daily for 2 days. Randomization was stratified by lactate > 5 or <= 5 mmol/L. The primary outcome of lactate was checked at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 hours, and compared using a linear mixed model to account for repeated measures. Secondary outcomes included SOFA score, pyruvate dehydrogenase, renal injury, neurological outcome, and mortality. Results: Of 93 randomized patients, 76 were enrolled and included in the analysis. There was no difference in lactate over 24 hours (mean difference 0.34 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.82, 2.50), p = 0.43). There was a significant interaction between randomization lactate subgroup and the effect of the intervention on mortality (p = 0.01) such that mortality was higher with thiamine in the lactate > 5 mmol/L group and lower with thiamine in the < 5 mmol/L group. This subgroup difference prompted the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend the study be terminated early. PDH activity increased over 72 hours in the thiamine group.

Healthcare systems may choose to start eCPR in the prehospital setting to optimize time to eCPR initiation and decrease low-flow time. We used geospatial modeling to evaluate different eCPR catchment strategies for a forthcoming prehospital eCPR program in Houston, Texas. Methods: We studied OHCAs treated by the Houston Fire Department from 2013 to 2021. We included OHCA patients aged 18-65 years old with an initial shockable rhythm that did not have prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Based on the geolocation that each OHCA occurred, we used geospatial modeling to identify eCPR candidates using four mapping strategies based on distance/drive time from the eCPR center: 1) 15-minute drive time, 20-minute drive time, 10-mile drive distance, and 15-mile drive distance. Results: Of 18,501 OHCAs during the study period, 881 met the eCPR inclusion criteria.

Despite decades of intensive research and several technological advancements, survival rates remain low. The integration of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has been recognized as a promising approach in refractory OHCA. However, evidence from recent randomized controlled trials yielded contradictory results, and the criteria for selecting eligible patients are still a subject of debate. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of refractory OHCA patients treated with ECPR. All adult patients who received ECPR, according to the hospital algorithm, from 2013 to 2021 were included. Two different algorithms were used during this period. A ""permissive"" algorithm was used from 2013 to mid-2016. Subsequently, a revised algorithm, more ""restrictive"", based on international guidelines, was implemented from mid-2016 to 2021. Key differences between the two algorithms included reducing the no-flow time from less than three minutes to zero minutes (implying that the cardiac arrests must occur in the presence of a witness with immediate CPR initiation), reducing low-flow duration from 100 to 60 min, and lowering the age limit from 65 to 55 years. The aim of this study is to compare these two algorithms (permissive (1) and restrictive (2)) to determine if the use of a restrictive algorithm was associated with higher survival rates. Results: A total of 48 patients were included in this study, with 23 treated under Algorithm 1 and 25 under Algorithm 2. A significant difference in survival rate was observed in favor of the restrictive algorithm (9% vs. 68%, p < 0.05). Moreover, significant differences emerged between algorithms regarding the no-flow time (0 (0-5) vs. 0 (0-0) minutes, p < 0.05).

The patient was successfully treated with cardiopulmonary bypass rewarming, but the clinical course was further complicated by a liver injury from device-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), necessitating exploratory laparotomy. A 30-year-old man was found roadside in-15 degrees C weather and suffered pre-hospital cardiac arrest, witnessed by emergency medical personnel. Rewarming treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass was performed at our level-1 trauma center after the patient presented with a core temperature of 20 degrees C and underwent 195 minutes of CPR.

Exploratory laparotomy was performed showing hemoperitoneum from a liver laceration secondary to CPR with a Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System (LUCAS) device. Delayed sternal and abdominal closure was performed with definitive closure occurring on hospital day 3. The patient experienced full neurologic recovery and was discharged home on hospital day 23. Extracorporeal rewarming is a definitive treatment for cardiac arrest from accidental severe hypothermia and can be accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Anxiety is a psychologic stressor, including physiologic components that may lead to adrenergic excitation triggering new arrhythmias and ICD therapies. This often requires concomitant antiarrhythmic medication to reduce the frequency of shocks and symptomatic arrhythmias treated by antitachycardia pacing. Although published studies have documented the efficacy of currently available antiarrhythmics, they have limitations in patients with heart failure, may affect the defibrillation threshold, and/or have been associated with major side-effects.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,FACTORS ANALYSIS OF CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION OUTCOMES IN THE ELDERLY IN TAIWAN,"Performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can save countless lives, but its use is rather controversial in elderly patients. Some researchers believe that there is an inverse ratio between the success of CPR and the age of the patient, while others believe that the uniqueness of each case and existing comorbidities are more important factors. CPR can result in severe injury for patients. Therefore, physicians often face a dilemma between rational and moral decisions when dealing with older patients suffering from cardiac arrest. The solution to this problem rests on the determination of whether CPR will benefit the patient. This analysis, supported by a literature review and a review of the outcomes of CPR, considered different factors in elderly patients, including age, sex, prehospital emergency medical service, preexisting disease, witnessed cardiac arrest, initial arrest electrocardiogram rhythm, CPR locations, and ethics. Quality of life and the cost of medical care for the elderly affect the benefit analysis of CPR. Indeed, a large amount of money is spent on elderly CPR patients who remain in critical condition before finally dying in the hospital. Factors contributing to decisions to resuscitate also include post-resuscitation quality of life, and the will of patients, families and doctors. In short, patient age is not a barrier to performing CPR. However, to achieve the best outcome of CPR, one must consider the disease diagnosis of elderly patients as a useful reference to help improve medical care for this group.

Methods The AMplitude Spectrum Area (AMSA) trial is an open-label, multicenter randomized controlled study reporting the first in-human use of AMSA analysis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The primary efficacy endpoint was the termination of VF for an AMSA = 15.5 mV-Hz. Adult shockable OHCAs randomly received either an AMSA-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or a standard-CPR. Randomization and allocation to trial group were carried out centrally. In the AMSA-guided CPR, an initial AMSA = 15.5 mV-Hz prompted for immediate defibrillation, while lower values favored chest compression (CC). After completion of the first 2-min CPR cycle, an AMSA < 6.5 mV-Hz deferred defibrillation in favor of an additional 2-min CPR cycle. AMSA was measured and displayed in real-time during CC pauses for ventilation with a modified defibrillator.Findings The trial was early discontinued for low recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemics. A total of 31 patients were recruited in 3 Italian cities, 19 in AMSA-CPR and 12 in standard-CPR, and included in the data analysis. No difference in primary outcome was observed between the two groups. Termination of VF occurred in 74% of patients in the AMSA-CPR compared to 75% in the standard CPR (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.18-4.90]).

We examined the role of nurses in resuscitation, contrasting higher versus lower performing hospitals in IHCA survival. Methods We conducted a descriptive qualitative study at nine hospitals in the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry, purposefully sampling hospitals that varied in geography, academic status, and risk-standardised IHCA survival. We conducted 158 semistructured interviews with nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, quality improvement staff, and administrators. Qualitative thematic text analysis followed by type-building text analysis identified distinct nursing roles in IHCA care and support for roles. Results Nurses played three major roles in IHCA response: bedside first responder, resuscitation team member, and clinical or administrative leader. We found distinctions between higher and lower performing hospitals in support for nurses. Higher performing hospitals emphasised training and competency of nurses at all levels; provided organisational flexibility and responsiveness with nursing roles; and empowered nurses to operate at a higher scope of clinical practice (eg, bedside defibrillation). Higher performing hospitals promoted nurses as leaders-administrators supporting nurses in resuscitation care at the institution, resuscitation team leaders during resuscitation and clinical champions for resuscitation care. Lower performing hospitals had more restrictive nurse roles with less emphasis on systematically identifying improvement needs. Conclusion Hospitals that excelled in IHCA survival emphasised mentoring and empowering front-line nurses and ensured clinical competency and adequate nursing training for IHCA care.

To determine whether the interval between the arrival of basic life support (BLS) providers and the arrival of advanced life support (ALS) providers is associated with patient outcome after cardiac arrest. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all witnessed, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrests between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2007. Eligible patients (n = 1,781) received full resuscitation efforts from both BLS and ALS providers. Results. The BLS-to-ALS arrival interval was a significant predictor of survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-0.99); the likelihood of survival decreased by 4% for every minute that ALS arrival was delayed following BLS arrival. Other significant predictors of survival were whether the arrest occurred in public (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19-1.85), whether a bystander administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68), and the interval between the 9-1-1 call and BLS arrival (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.83). Conclusions. We found that a shorter BLS-to-ALS arrival interval increased the likelihood of survival to hospital discharge after a witnessed, out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest. We conclude that ALS interventions may provide additional benefits over BLS interventions alone when utilized in a well-established, two-tiered emergency medical services (EMS) system already optimized for rapid defibrillation.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,The SLANT Score Predicts Poor Neurologic Outcome in Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: An External Validation Using a Retrospective Cohort,"Background Hypoxic brain injury is the leading cause of death in comatose patients following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Neurological outcome can be difficult to prognosticate following resuscitation, and goals of care discussions are often informed by multiple prognostic tools. One tool that has shown promise is the SLANT score, which encompasses five metrics including initial nonshockable rhythm, leukocyte count after targeted temperature management, total adrenaline dose during resuscitation, lack of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. This cohort study aimed to provide an external validation of this score by using a database of comatose cardiac arrest survivors from our institution. Methods We retrospectively queried our database of cardiac arrest survivors, selecting for patients with coma, sustained return of spontaneous circulation, and use of targeted temperature management to have a comparable sample to the index study. We calculated SLANT scores for each patient and separated them into risk levels, both according to the original study and according to a Youden index analysis. The primary outcome was poor neurologic outcome (defined by a cerebral performance category score of 3 or greater at discharge), and the secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Univariable and multivariable analyses, as well as a receiver operator characteristic curve, were used to assess the SLANT score for independent predictability and diagnostic accuracy for poor outcomes. Results We demonstrate significant association between a SLANT group with increased risk and poor neurologic outcome on univariable (p = 0.005) and multivariable analysis (odds ratio 1.162, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.346, p = 0.046). A receiver operating characteristic analysis indicates that SLANT scoring is a fair prognostic test for poor neurologic outcome (area under the curve 0.708, 95% confidence interval 0.536-0.879, p = 0.024). Among this cohort, the most frequent SLANT elements were initial nonshockable rhythm (84.5%) and total adrenaline dose >= 5 mg (63.9%). There was no significant association between SLANT score and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.064). Conclusions The SLANT score may independently predict poor neurologic outcome but not in-hospital mortality.

There is a high prevalence of CHD among premature neonates, with prematurity and low birth weight compounding the risks associated with CHD and leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in diagnosis, surgery, and intensive care, outcomes for preterm infants with CHD remain guarded, particularly in the earliest gestational age groups. These infants face heightened risks of neonatal decompensation, cardiac arrest, and early mortality, but also long-term complications including neurodevelopmental impairment. The interplay between maternal-fetal factors, perinatal environment, and the complex physiology of both prematurity and CHD underscores the need for multidisciplinary care. Prenatal diagnosis, careful delivery planning, specialized postnatal management, and tailored surgical timing are critical to optimizing outcomes. Neonatal and cardiac intensivists, cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and allied professionals must collaborate closely to address diverse challenges including hemodynamic instability, respiratory support, nutrition, neuroprotection, and social disparities. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of neonates with CHD with a focus on prematurity. We highlight evolving models of interdisciplinary care and outline priorities for research.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Altered neurodevelopmental DNA methylation status after fetal growth restriction with brain-sparing,"It is under debate how preferential perfusion of the brain (brain-sparing) in fetal growth restriction (FGR) relates to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Epigenetic modification of neurotrophic genes by altered fetal oxygenation may be involved. To explore this theory, we performed a follow-up study of 21 FGR children, in whom we prospectively measured the prenatal cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) with Doppler sonography. At 4 years of age, we tested their neurodevelopmental outcome using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. In addition, we collected their buccal DNA to determine the methylation status at predefined genetic regions within the genes hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), erythropoietin (EPO), EPO-receptor (EPOR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2 (NTRK2) by pyrosequencing. We found that FGR children with fetal brain-sparing (CPR <1, n = 8) demonstrated a trend (0.05 < p < 0.1) toward hypermethylation of HIF1A and VEGFA at their hypoxia-response element (HRE) compared with FGR children without fetal brain-sparing. Moreover, in cases with fetal brain-sparing, we observed statistically significant hypermethylation at a binding site for cyclic adenosine monophophate response element binding protein (CREB) of BDNF promoter exon 4 and hypomethylation at an HRE located within the NTRK2 promoter (both p <0.05). Hypermethylation of VEGFA was associated with a poorer Performance Intelligence Quotient, while hypermethylation of BDNF was associated with better inhibitory self-control (both p <0.05). These results led us to formulate the hypothesis that early oxygen-dependent epigenetic alterations due to hemodynamic alterations in FGR may be associated with altered neurodevelopmental outcome in later life.

Half of the early admission group were admitted in response to emergency 999 calls and 435 of them traveled in resuscitation ambulances, where surveillance for arrhythmias was instituted. Pulmonary edema occurred in 130 patients (26%), cardiogenic shock supervened in 60 (12%) and 115 (23%) died in hospital. Ventricular fibrillation was observed in 98 patients (20%). Of them, 42 survived to be discharged, including 20 of 24 with primary fibrillation which had occurred first in hospital. In only 1 case did primary ventricular fibrillation occur after the 1st 10 h of onset of illness. Sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation were all observed more frequently in patients admitted within 1 h after the onset of symptoms than in those admitted later. An element of selection is inevitable when early admission is encouraged by the existence of a resuscitation ambulance system; this will depend in part on the early recognition of risk and the geographical location of the attack. These factors may bias the group towards relatively high risk.

Perinephric hematoma is a rare but potentially serious complication that requires prompt recognition and appropriate management. Case presentation: We report a case of a 58-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes, and long-term anticoagulation who developed a massive perinephric hematoma one week after undergoing ESWL for bilateral renal stones. He presented with severe left flank pain and a significant hemoglobin drop, with imaging confirming a large perinephric hematoma. He was managed conservatively in the intensive care unit (ICU) with close monitoring, bed rest, fluid resuscitation, pain control, and temporary cessation of anticoagulation. Over 10 days, his condition improved without the need for invasive intervention, and he was discharged on oral medications with a planned follow-up for renal function assessment and anticoagulation resumption. Clinical discussion: This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis using CT imaging in patients presenting with post-ESWL flank pain and anemia. Conservative management, including strict monitoring, supportive care, and temporary anticoagulation withdrawal, was successful in achieving hemodynamic stability without invasive intervention. This underscores the need for individualized treatment strategies based on patient risk factors and clinical presentation. Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of early recognition of ESWL-associated hemorrhagic complications, particularly in high-risk patients. It also highlights the effectiveness of conservative management as a viable approach to achieving successful recovery without the need for surgical or interventional procedures.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS,2025,"Eid, A; Hassouneh, A; Bishawi, S; Milhem, A; Dibas, J; Baradia, S",10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111626,,WOS:001532226100003,A

Although the association of body mass index (BMI) categories with sudden cardiac death was reported, dynamic changes of BMI and the risk of cardiac arrest remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurrence within a year and the percent changes of BMI preceding the OHCA. Methods: This population-based nested case-control study used the National Health Insurance Service Data of Korea. In all, 24,465 patients with non-traumatic OHCA between 2010 and 2018, who underwent national health check-up twice (one within a year and the other within 2-4 years before OHCA) and 32,434 controls without OHCA, were matched for age and sex. The association between the risk of OHCA and BMI percent change stratified by sex was investigated. Results: All the BMI percent changes of >= 5% significantly increased the OHCA occurrence with a reverse J-shaped association. Compared to individuals with a stable weight, those with severe (> 15%) BMI decrease had the highest odds ratio (OR) of 4.29 (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 3.72-4.95) for OHCA occurrence followed by those with moderate (10-15%) weight loss (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.55-3.08) and those with severe (> 15%) weigh gain (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.96-2.57), respectively. The impact of weight loss on the cardiac arrest occurrence was more prominent in men, while the impact of weight gain was more prominent in women.

Objective We piloted values clarification exercises to inform resuscitation decision making and qualitatively assess perceptions of QOL. Methods We conducted a mixed-method study of women with threatened periviable delivery (22 0/7-24 6/7 weeks) and their important others (IOs). Participants engaged in three values clarification activities as part of a semi-structured interview-(a) Card sorting nine conditions as an acceptable/unacceptable QOL for a child; (b) Rating/ranking seven common concerns in periviable decision making (scale 0-10, not at all to extremely important); and (c) ""Agreed/disagreed"" with six statements regarding end-of-life treatment, disability, and QOL. Participants were also asked to define ""QOL"" and describe their perceptions of a good and poor QOL for their child. Analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.4 and NVivo 12. Results All mild disabilities were an acceptable QOL, while two-thirds of participants considered long-term mechanical ventilation unacceptable. Although pregnant women rated ""Impact on Your Physical/Mental Health"" (average 5.6) and IOs rated ""financial Concerns"" the highest (average 6.6), both groups ranked ""financial Concerns"" as the most important concern (median 5.0 and 6.0, respectively). Most participants agreed that ""Any amount of life is better than no life at all"" (pregnant women 62.1%; IOs 75.0%) and disagreed that resuscitation would cause ""Too much suffering"" for their child (pregnant women 71.4%; IOs 80.0%). Half were familiar with the phrase ""QOL"".

The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger Isoform-1 Inhibition: A Promising Pharmacological Intervention for Resuscitation from Cardiac Arrest,"Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with an overall survival of less than 5%. Upon cardiac arrest, cessation of coronary blood flow rapidly leads to intense myocardial ischemia and activation of the sarcolemmal Na+-H+ exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1). NHE-1 activation drives Na+ into cardiomyocytes in exchange for H+ with its exchange rate intensified upon reperfusion during the resuscitation effort. Na+ accumulates in the cytosol driving Ca2+ entry through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, eventually causing cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and worsening myocardial injury by compromising mitochondrial bioenergetic function. We have reported clinically relevant myocardial effects elicited by NHE-1 inhibitors given during resuscitation in animal models of ventricular fibrillation (VF). These effects include: (a) preservation of left ventricular distensibility enabling hemodynamically more effective chest compressions, (b) return of cardiac activity with greater electrical stability reducing post-resuscitation episodes of VF, (c) less post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, and (d) attenuation of adverse myocardial effects of epinephrine; all contributing to improved survival in animal models. Mechanistically, NHE-1 inhibition reduces adverse effects stemming from Na+-driven cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. We believe the preclinical work herein discussed provides a persuasive rationale for examining the potential role of NHE-1 inhibitors for cardiac resuscitation in humans.",MOLECULES,2019,"Gazmuri, RJ; Radhakrishnan, J; Ayoub, IM",10.3390/molecules24091765,,WOS:000469518100124,A

Anomalous left coronary artery connected to the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease. Adaptive development of sufficient heterocoronary collaterality in the newborn may allow survival to a later age. In older children or adults, malignant ventricular arrhythmias can reveal the disease. Case Report. A 15-year-old girl was referred to the local hospital after a resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. CT scan and coronary angiography revealed an ALCAPA. Direct aortic reimplantation of the left coronary artery was performed. Postoperative ECG monitoring showed short episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI revealed subendocardial fibrosis of the anterolateral papillary muscle. Beta-blockade therapy was initiated at first intention. After hospital discharge, the patient reported several fainting without loss of consciousness. Considering sudden death nonrelated to effort, episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and areas of myocardial fibrosis, the patient underwent subcutaneous cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. 6-month follow-up is satisfactory without clinical or rhythmic abnormalities. Discussion. Indication for surgical correction of ALCAPA is well defined, but rhythmic secondary prevention after resuscitated cardiac arrest is less consensual.

The ECG signals of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients of cardiac aetiology were analysed just prior to, and immediately after, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to assess the likelihood of successful defibrillation at these time points. The cardioversion outcome prediction (COP) measure previously developed by our group was used to quantify the probability of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after countershock and was used as a measure of the efficacy of CPR. An initial validation study using COP to predict shock outcome from the patient data set resulted in a performance of 60% specificity achieved at 100% sensitivity on a blind test of the data. This is comparable with previous studies and provided confidence in the robustness of the technique across hardware platforms. Significantly, the COP marker also displayed an ability to stratify according to outcomes: asystole, ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), normal sinus rhythm (NSR). We then used the validated COP marker to analyse the ECG data record just prior to and immediately after the chest compression segments. This was initially performed for 87 CPR segments where VF was both the pre- and post-CPR waveform. An increase in the mean COP values was found for both CPR types. A signed rank sum test found the increase due to manual CPR not to be significant (p > 0.05) whereas the automated CPR was found to be significant (p < 0.05). This increase was larger for the automated CPR (1.26, p = 0.024) than for the manual CPR (0.99, p = 0.124). These results indicate that the application of CPR does indeed provide beneficial. preparation of the heart prior to defibrillation therapy whether manual or automated CPR is applied. The COP marker shows promise as a definitive, quantitative determinant of the immediate positive effect of both types of CPR regardless of the details of use. In work of a more exploratory nature we then used the validated COP marker to analyse the ECG pre- and post-CPR for all rhythm types (212 traces). We show a significant increase in the COP measure (p < 0.001 in both cases) as indicated by a shift in the median COP marker distribution values. This increase was more pronounced for automated ACD-CPR than for manual CPR. However, a detailed statistical analysis carried out between the groups adjusted for pre-CPR value showed no significant difference between the two methods of CPR (p = 0.20). Similarly, adjusting for length of CPR showed no significant difference between the groups. Secondary, subgroup analysis of the ECG according to the length of time for which CPR was performed showed that both types of CPR led to an increase in the likelihood Of Successful defibrillation after increasing durations of CPR, however results were less reliable after longer periods of continuous CPR.

While sleep deprivation (SD) is recognized to aggravate neurological outcomes, its role in PCABI pathogenesis remains underexplored. This study investigated the mechanisms by which SD exacerbates PCABI and evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA). A CA model was established in SD rats, followed by RNA sequencing and molecular analyses to assess brain injury biomarkers, synaptic plasticity, and calcium signaling pathways. SD disrupted circadian rhythms, amplified neuronal apoptosis, and suppressed glutamate transporter Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2) expression post-CA, correlating with worsened cognitive deficits. EA treatment significantly attenuated these effects, restoring EAAT2 levels, mitigating calcium overload, and enhancing synaptic integrity. Mechanistically, EA modulated the EAAT2/calcium signaling axis and rebalanced autonomic nervous activity, thereby reducing oxidative stress and neuronal excitotoxicity. These findings identify EAAT2 downregulation as a key mediator of SD-aggravated PCABI and establish EA as a dual-target intervention that rectifies glutamatergic dysregulation and autonomic dysfunction. The study provides translational insights into EA's therapeutic potential for PCABI, particularly in populations with comorbid sleep disturbances.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,"Fu, WC; Hu, C; Ma, C; Lv, SH; Zeng, XZ; Li, TT; Chen, JH; Han, X; Tan, X; Li, XF; Li, WZ",10.1038/s41598-025-15563-y,,WOS:001549888700024,A

More than 380,000 patients suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest annually in the USA. Induced cooling of comatose patients markedly improved neurological and functional outcomes in pivotal randomized clinical trials, but the optimal duration of therapeutic hypothermia has not yet been established. Methods This study is a multi-center randomized, response-adaptive, duration (dose) finding, comparative effectiveness clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. We investigate two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest to ascertain the shortest duration of cooling that provides the maximum treatment effect. The design is based on a statistical model of response as defined by the primary endpoint, a weighted 90-day mRS (modified Rankin Scale, a measure of neurologic disability), across the treatment arms. Subjects will initially be equally randomized between 12, 24, and 48 h of therapeutic cooling. After the first 200 subjects have been randomized, additional treatment arms between 12 and 48 h will be opened and patients will be allocated, within each initial cardiac rhythm type (shockable or non-shockable), by response adaptive randomization. As the trial continues, shorter and longer duration arms may be opened. A maximum sample size of 1800 subjects is proposed. Secondary objectives are to characterize: the overall safety and adverse events associated with duration of cooling, the effect on neuropsychological outcomes, and the effect on patient-reported quality of life measures. Discussion In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having a good outcome. If the treatment effect of cooling is increasing across duration, for at least some set of durations, then this provides evidence of the efficacy of cooling itself versus normothermia, even in the absence of a normothermia control arm, confirming previous RCTs for OHCA survivors of shockable rhythms and provides the first prospective controlled evidence of efficacy in those without initial shockable rhythms.",TRIALS,2024,"Meurer, WJ; Schmitzberger, FF; Yeatts, S; Ramakrishnan, V; Abella, B; Aufderheide, T; Barsan, W; Benoit, J; Berry, S; Black, J; Bozeman, N; Broglio, K; Brown, J; Brown, K; Carlozzi, N; Caveney, A; Cho, SM; Chung-Esaki, H; Clevenger, R; Conwit, R; Cooper, R; Crudo, V; Daya, M; Harney, D; Hsu, CY; Johnson, NJ; Khan, I; Khosla, S; Kline, P; Kratz, A; Kudenchuk, P; Lewis, RJ; Madiyal, C; Meyer, S; Mosier, J; Mouammar, M; Neth, M; O'Neil, B; Paxton, J; Perez, S; Perman, S; Sozener, C; Speers, M; Spiteri, A; Stevenson, V; Sunthankar, K; Tonna, J; Youngquist, S; Geocadin, R; Silbergleit, R",10.1186/s13063-024-08280-w,,WOS:001275303700001,A

Administration of loop diuretics is the predominant treatment of fluid overload, but evidence for its benefit is very uncertain when assessed in a systematic review of randomised clinical trials. The GODIF trial will assess the benefits and harms of goal directed fluid removal with furosemide versus placebo in ICU patients with fluid overload. Methods An investigator-initiated, international, randomised, stratified, blinded, parallel-group trial allocating 1000 adult ICU patients with fluid overload to infusion of furosemide versus placebo. The goal is to achieve a neutral fluid balance. The primary outcome is days alive and out of hospital 90 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at day 90 and 1-year after randomisation; days alive at day 90 without life support; number of participants with one or more serious adverse events or reactions; health-related quality of life and cognitive function at 1-year follow-up. A sample size of 1000 participants is required to detect an improvement of 8% in days alive and out of hospital 90 days after randomisation with a power of 90% and a risk of type 1 error of 5%. The conclusion of the trial will be based on the point estimate and 95% confidence interval; dichotomisation will not be used. identifier: NCT04180397.

Between 1995 and 2002, consecutive, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from Amsterdam and the surrounding areas were included in this study. A total of 227 patients (12%) survived to hospital discharge and 174 were definitive survivors who were available for assessment at 6 months. Quality of life was measured with the 136-item Sickness Impact Profile (SIP); cognitive functioning was assessed through the Mini Mental State Examination. SIP, profiles were compared with profiles of an open Dutch population of the elderly and patients who experienced a stroke. Time intervals of the chain of survival were calculated from the estimated moment of collapse and related to outcome using regression analysis. The SIP profile of survivors was a little above the reference profile, indicating a slightly poorer quality of life, and below the profile of patients after stroke, indicating a better quality of life. Impaired cognitive function was associated with delay in the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 19). Absence of the need for advanced cardiopulmonary life support was. associated with, better cognitive functioning (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1, to 0.9). Female gender and older age were associated with impaired physical functioning. Trends were found for better outcomes after early access, immediate resuscitation, early defibrillation, and early advanced care.

This study aimed to describe the functional outcomes of a cohort of patients that suffered an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and survived to hospital discharge in a regional Australian hospital.Methods: This is a single-centre retrospective observational cohort study conducted in a regional Australian hospital. All adult patients that had an IHCA in the study hospital between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2019 and survived to hospital discharge were included in the study. Functional outcomes were reported using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a six-point scale for which increasing scores represent increasing disability. Scores were assigned through a retrospective review of medical notes.Results: Overall, 102 adult patients had an IHCA during the study period, of whom 50 survived to hospital discharge. The median age of survivors was 68 years, and a third had a shockable initial arrest rhythm. Of survivors, 47 were able to be assigned both mRS scores. At discharge, 81% of patients achieved a favourable functional outcome (mRS 0-3 or equivalent function at discharge equal to admission).Conclusions: Most survivors to hospital discharge following an IHCA have a favourable functional outcome and are discharged home.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proven to be a promising treatment for regional renal and intestinal ischemia reperfusion injuries. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs on renal and intestinal injuries after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in a porcine CA model. Methods: Twenty-two male pigs were randomly assigned to the sham (n = 6), CA/CPR (n = 8), and CA/CPR + MSC (n = 8) groups. Mesenchymal stem cells were differentiated from human embryonic stem cells and then intravenously administered at a dose of 2.5 x 10(6)/kg at 1.5 and 3 d before the CA/CPR procedure. The experimental model was established by 8 min of untreated CA, followed by 8 min of CPR. Renal and intestinal injuries were evaluated based on the serum levels of creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and diamine oxidase at 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after resuscitation. At the end of the experiment, pathological damage was determined by cell apoptosis and ferroptosis in the renal and intestinal tissues. Results: During CPR, five pigs in the CA/CPR group and seven pigs in the CA/CPR + MSC group were successfully resuscitated. After resuscitation, the serum levels of creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and diamine oxidase were significantly increased in the CA/CPR and CA/CPR + MSC groups compared with those in the sham group. However, MSC administration significantly decreased the levels of renal and intestinal injury biomarkers compared with those in the CA/CPR group. Cell apoptosis and ferroptosis, which were indicated by the levels of apoptotic cells, iron deposition, lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and ferroptosis-related proteins, were observed in renal and intestinal tissues after resuscitation in the CA/CPR and CA/CPR + MSC groups. Nevertheless, both were significantly milder in the CA/CPR + MSC group than in the CA/CPR group. Conclusions: MSC administration was effective in alleviating postresuscitation renal and intestinal injuries possibly through inhibition of cell apoptosis and ferroptosis in a porcine CA model.",SHOCK,2023,"Chen, C; Ma, SS; Liao, LZ; Xiao, Y; Dai, HW",10.1097/SHK.0000000000002107,,WOS:000975611100015,A

The external validation set containing 856 cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang Province. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms were utilized to establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost model exhibited the best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately selected as key features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a compact model. The final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in the internal validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation.

In critically ill children, intraosseous (IO) administration of a medicine provides an alternate Vascular access route when IV access is not readily available. We investigated the short and long-term efficacy and safety of a totally intraosseously implantable device. Procedure. This study was undertaken in micropigs (i) to compare serum levels achieved by equal bolus dosages of two antibiotics (amikacin and vancomycin) administered through an intratibial needle, an intraosseous implantable device and central IV routes to determine whether standard parenteral dosing guidelines for antibiotics may be applied without modification for IO injection, and (ii) to show the efficiency of the implantable device over a prolonged period, as a permanent access to intraosseous space. Results. The area under the plasma concentration time curves were similar for IV, intratibial and through the intraosseous implantable device, for intermittent administrations of amikacin and vancomycin, over a period of 6 months. However, vancomycin did not reach therapeutic levels via both IO routes. We did not find any alteration of amikacin and vancomycin pharmacokinetics over a period of 6 months using the implantable device. No complication occurred. Conclusions. Long-term administration of antibiotics through a totally implantable intraosseous device is feasible and safe in micropigs.

TRM (5 ml/kg) restored the hippocampal LTP formation and normalized the anxiety-related behavior. TRM also improved the decreased tissue oxygen partial pressure in the 2VO rat hippocampus, possibly due to oxygen delivery to ischemic regions.

Although HbV suspensions are structurally and physicochemically stabile for least 1-year at room temperature, based on in vitro experiments, the issue of whether the use of long-term stored HbV after a massive hemorrhage can be effective in resuscitations without adverse, post-transfusion effects remains to be clarified. We report herein on a comparison of the systemic response and the induction of organ injuries in hemorrhagic shock model rats resuscitated using 1-year-stored HbV, freshly packed RBC (PRBC-0) and by 28-day-stored packed RBC (PRBC-28). The six-hour mortality after resuscitation was not significantly different among the groups. Arterial blood pressure and blood gas parameters revealed that, using HbV, recovery from the shock state was comparable to that when PRBC-0 was used. Although no significant change was observed in serum parameters reflecting liver and kidney injuries at 6 hours after resuscitation among the three resuscitation groups, results based on Evans Blue and protein leakage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the lung wet/dry weight ratio and histopathological findings indicated that HbV as well as PRBC-0 was less predisposed to result in a post-transfusion lung injury than PRBC-28, as evidenced by low levels of myeloperoxidase accumulation and subsequent oxidative damage in the lung.

Although exercise is beneficial for cardiovascular health, it is also associated with increased risk of OHCA during and immediately after exertion. Golf courses present the fifth most frequent location for OHCA in public settings. Bystander interventions, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) use, are crucial for improving survival rates. Despite recommendations from organizations like the Professional Golfers' Association of America recommending AEDs at golfing facilities, AED availability and utilization on golf courses prior to Emergency Medical Services arrival remain unknown. Objectives: This investigation aimed to determine the incidence of OHCA on golf courses and to examine patient demographics, event and golf course characteristics, and their association with bystander CPR provision, AED use, and survival outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study utilized data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival from 2020 to 2023. Addresses of cardiac arrests in recreational facilities were spatially linked to a comprehensive list of golf course addresses using ArcGIS. Cases identified as occurring in a recreational location, within 400 m of both the incident address and a nearby golf course, were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the frequency of bystander interventions for either CPR or AED use. Secondary outcomes included survival to hospital admission and discharge, and a favorable neurologic outcome (cerebral performance category 1 or 2). Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were employed to examine patient demographics, golf course characteristics, bystander interventions, and patient outcomes. Multi-variable regression analysis was also used to assess these associations. Results: A total of 476 OHCA cases were identified on golf courses during the study period. The patients were predominantly male (91.4%, n = 435) and White (85.1%, n = 330), with a mean age of 64.6 (SD 15.5). Most patients (61.8%) had an initial shockable rhythm. Distribution of cases was not different by course geographic region, course size, or public vs private course. Overall survival to discharge was 30.5% (n = 145), with almost all survivors (97.2%, n = 141) having a good neurologic outcome. For patients with Utstein characteristics (witnessed, shockable rhythm) and who had an AED placed, survival to discharge was 63.8%. AED use was associated with significantly increased survival to hospital discharge (37.9% vs 18.7% ORadj 1.9 (95% CI, 1.1, 3.3, P <.05), with AEDs being used more frequently on private courses (32.1% vs 19.7%, P = .003). Conclusion: Patients experiencing OHCA on golf courses frequently receive bystander interventions, including both CPR and AED use.

In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the effectiveness of CPR by delivering realtime feedback, supporting clinical decision-making, and enabling individualized resuscitation strategies. This narrative review summarizes the current applications of AI in CPR, including rhythm interpretation, quality monitoring, and post-resuscitation care. In addition, it discusses major challenges related to data privacy, system interoperability, algorithmic fairness, and ethical governance. Future directions emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous model validation, and structured training for clinical users.

Patient characteristics, care processes, and other contextual factors may mediate the association between SES and survival after OHCA. Interventions that target these mediating factors may reduce disparities in OHCA outcomes across the socioeconomic spectrum. This systematic review identi fi ed and quanti fi ed mediators of the SES - survival after OHCA association. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science) and grey literature sources were searched from inception to July or August 2023. Observational studies of OHCA patients that conducted mediation analyses to evaluate potential mediators of the association between SES (de fi ned by income, education, occupation, or a composite index) and survival outcomes were included. A total of 10 studies were included in this review. Income (n = 9), education (n = 4), occupation (n = 1), and composite indices (n = 1) were used to de fi ne SES. The proportion of OHCA cases that had bystander involvement, presented with an initial shockable rhythm, and survived to hospital discharge or 30 days increased with higher SES. Common mediators of the SES-survival association that were evaluated included initial rhythm (n = 6), emergency medical services response time (n = 5), and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n = 4). Initial rhythm was the most important mediator of this association, with a median percent excess risk explained of 37.4% (range 28.6%-40.0%; n = 5; 1 study reported no mediation) and mediation proportion of 41.8% (n = 1). To mitigate socioeconomic disparities in outcomes after OHCA, interventions should target potentially modi fi able mediators, such as initial rhythm, which may involve improving bystander awareness of OHCA and the need for prompt resuscitation.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,2024,"Grubic, N; Hill, B; Allan, KS; Maximova, K; Banack, HR; del Rios, M; Johri, AM",10.1016/j.cjca.2024.01.002,,WOS:001251978800001,A

Promoting bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (B-CPR) is a key element in improving the survival rate of OHCA. The security guard is a specific population in China that plays a significant role as bystanders in public settings. However, less is known about their experiences regarding B-CPR intention and performance. This study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of Chinese security guards regarding B-CPR and identify barriers to its performance.MethodsFifteen in-depth interviews were conducted with security guards in various public settings, including hospitals, residential living areas, office buildings, and public transportation stations. All interviews were audio recorded. Two researchers independently analyzed the transcripts through deductive and inductive content analysis. Informed by the ""Intention-focused"" model of B-CPR performance, deductive content analysis was initially performed to identify categories that align with the theoretical framework and thereby validate the theory. Subsequently, inductive content analysis was applied to code newly discovered content, therefore enriching the theory.ResultsAn ""intention & performance-focused"" model of B-CPR was developed. It was revealed that security personnel were more inclined to perform CPR without hesitation when the victim was a trusted individual. However, when faced with unfamiliar individuals, they tended to shrink back due to various barriers. Specifically, four layers of barriers to CPR performance were identified, encompassing security personnel factors, victim-related factors, organizational factors, and societal factors. Participants also shared their perspectives on the desired CPR training, including trainers, training contents, training formats, and training incentives.ConclusionSecurity guards should receive comprehensive CPR training to maximize their occupational value. In addition to strengthening CPR-related training, which includes theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice, psychological coping skills for managing overwhelming emotions and understanding relevant laws are also essential training elements that cannot be overlooked. When developing relevant intervention strategies, policies, and regulations, it's critical to consider the country's context and the cooperation of the organization where the security guard is employed. The model developed in this study can provide a reference for designing interventions and policy to improve the B-CPR intention and performance for other specific groups.",BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,2024,"Yang, MZ; Song, JY; Jin, YY; Peng, YQ",10.1186/s12889-024-20888-w,,WOS:001381014300018,A

Current health services do not address their complex and evolving needs once they return home, leaving them to navigate (co-)survivorship on their own with limited support. In this study, we describe the process of developing user-centered requirements for a digital healthcare intervention, called Cadre. The goals were to address the limitations of equitably providing services and support to cardiac arrest survivors. In Phase I, user journey mapping and Scenario-Based Design methods, supported by Actor-Network Theory, were used to analyze focus group interview data and develop user personas and problem scenarios. Phase II involved the ideation of application features for Cadre. Phase I results include the emergence of a new theme - every cardiac arrest survivor experience is unique - and the creation of personas and scenarios that reflect this theme. The identified needs (validation, guidance, and lack of emotional support) were translated into a vision for Cadre that will be evaluated via iterative prototype development and usability testing in the future. This project addresses a critical opportunity in the field of SCA survivorship as it not only advances the design of a comprehensive support solution for survivors and their families but also represents a crucial move toward equitable post-discharge care for all.","HCI INTERNATIONAL 2024 POSTERS, PT VI, HCII 2024",2024,"Jean-Pierre, GM; Rajotia, A; Montague, E; Wah, DHL; Lohani, R; Pham, Q; Dainty, KN",10.1007/978-3-031-61966-3_32,,WOS:001267657300032,A

We aimed to investigate barriers for responding to POHCA during emergency medical calls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all POHCA calls (aged 0-18 years) from the emergency dispatch center in the Capital Region of Denmark between 2018 and 2021 and excluded POHCAs with no resuscitation order, found dead, where trained health professionals were on site, or where there was no possibility for initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A qualitative analysis was undertaken. POHCA calls were divided according to the speed of telecommunicator-recognition into 3 groups: POHCA recognition within 90 seconds (group 1), POHCAs recognition >90 seconds (group 2), and POHCAs recognized by the emergency medical services at ambulance arrival (group 3). A total of 20 calls were included. We identified 3 major barriers to telecommunicator recognition of POHCA. First, prolonged conversations between callers and telecommunicators focusing on the cause of the child's condition rather than adherence to the assessment of consciousness and breathing. Second, challenges in assessing breathing such as cases where the child had agonal or unregular breathing or gasping breaths. Finally, callers who were unable to communicate or follow instructions from the telecommunicator. CONCLUSIONS: Telecommunicator recognition of POHCA is challenged by factors such as prolonged conversations focusing on causes rather than initiating bystander interventions, barriers in assessing breathing, as well as callers' abilities to partake in communication with telecommunicators.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Effect of intermediate airway management on ventilation parameters in simulated paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a multicentre randomised crossover trial,"INTRODUCTION: Paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates remain low despite advancements in resuscitation science. Prompt restoration of oxygenation is crucial for achieving return of spontaneous circulation. Delays in airway management are associated with decreased survival rates. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether early i-gel (R) insertion, without prior bag-valve-mask, could enhance ventilation parameters in comparison with a bag-valve-mask-only approach. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised crossover study used a simulated paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest model to compare standard American Heart Association guidelines with an intermediate airway management approach using an i-gel (R) device. Paramedics and emergency medical technicians from eight participating emergency medical service centres were randomised into teams and performed two 10-minute simulations. Each team employed one of the airway management strategies. Data was automatically collected by a high-fidelity manikin. The primary outcome was alveolar ventilation per minute. Secondary outcomes included metrics for ventilation quality and timing, chest compression performance and timing of adrenaline administration. Statistical analysis involved paired tests suitable for the crossover design. RESULTS: From 30 January 2023 to 13 June 2023, 68 participants formed 34 resuscitation teams. Minute alveolar ventilation was similar between intermediate airway management and bag-valve-mask strategies (difference: 36 ml [95% CI-28 to 99]). A sensitivity analysis showed comparable results. Intermediate airway management delivered more ventilations, but bag-valve-mask enabled quicker ventilation initiation and more ventilations within the target volume. Chest compression fraction was higher with intermediate airway management, although chest recoil was better with bag-valve-mask. Adrenaline administration rates and times were similar in both strategies. Minor protocol deviations were observed but did not introduce significant bias. The study was underpowered due to an error in the sample size calculation, limiting the robustness and generalisability of the findings. CONCLUSION: In a simulated paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest model, immediate use of intermediate airway management did not show relevant differences compared to bag-valve-mask. Intermediate airway management devices cannot be recommended as first-line choice but may be considered when bag-valve-mask is challenging. Whichever device is used, the focus should remain on providing high-quality ventilations.",SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY,2025,"Stuby, L; Bourgeois, L; Tinembart, JM; Thurre, D; Siebert, JN; Suppan, L",10.57187/s.4079,,WOS:001502641000001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Application of Entropy-Based Features to Predict Defibrillation Outcome in Cardiac Arrest,"Prediction of defibrillation success is of vital importance to guide therapy and improve the survival of patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Currently, the most efficient methods to predict shock success are based on the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) during ventricular fibrillation (VF), and recent studies suggest the efficacy of waveform indices that characterize the underlying non-linear dynamics of VF. In this study we introduce, adapt and fully characterize six entropy indices for VF shock outcome prediction, based on the classical definitions of entropy to measure the regularity and predictability of a time series. Data from 163 OHCA patients comprising 419 shocks (107 successful) were used, and the performance of the entropy indices was characterized in terms of embedding dimension (m) and matching tolerance (r). Six classical predictors were also assessed as baseline prediction values. The best prediction results were obtained for fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn) with m = 3 and an amplitude-dependent tolerance of r = 80 mu V. This resulted in a balanced sensitivity/specificity of 80.4%/76.9%, which improved by over five points the results obtained for the best classical predictor. These results suggest that a FuzzEn approach for a joint quantification of VF amplitude and its non-linear dynamics may be a promising tool to optimize OHCA treatment.",ENTROPY,2016,"Chicote, B; Irusta, U; Alcaraz, R; Rieta, JJ; Aramendi, E; Isasi, I; Alonso, D; Ibarguren, K",10.3390/e18090313,,WOS:000382259200005,A

Methods:This systematic review assesses current literature about BLS training with VR and its possible effect on CPR-quality parameters, self-efficacy, perceived learning, and learners' satisfaction and short and long-term patients' outcome. We screened the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and included only clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies published from inception to October 1, 2021, which analyzed adult laypersons' BLS training with the use of VR. Primary outcomes were CPR parameters (chest compression rate and depth, Automated External Defibrillator use). Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, perceived learning and learners satisfaction, and patients' outcomes (survival and good neurologic status). The risk of bias of included study was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions tool to evaluate randomized control trials and the transparent reporting of evaluations with nonrandomized designs checklist for nonrandomized studies. Results:After full article screening, 6 studies were included in the systematic review (731 participants) published between 2017 and 2021. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies, we focused on describing the studies rather than meta-analysis. The assessment of the quality of evidence revealed overall a very low quality. Training with VR significantly improved the rate and depth of chest compressions in 4 out of 6 articles. VR was described as an efficient teaching method, exerting a positive effect on self-efficacy, perception of confidence, and competence in 2 articles. Conclusion:VR in BLS training improves manual skills and self-efficacy of adult laypersons and may be a good teaching method in a blended learning CPR training strategy. VR may add another way to divide complex parts of resuscitation training into easier individual skills.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Negotiating grey areas: an interview-based analysis of paramedic uncertainty and decision-making in cardiac arrest events,"BackgroundParamedics are responsible for critical resuscitation decisions when attending Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA). Existing research indicates that a range of clinical and non-clinical factors moderate their decision-making. Within the United Kingdom (UK), there is little evidence on how and why paramedics make their decisions at actual OHCA events.MethodsWe explored the experiences of UK paramedics using individually recalled OHCA events as catalysts for discussion. Pen portraits developed from semi-structured interviews with 31 paramedics across two UK ambulance services were thematically analysed, enabling cross-participant comparisons whilst retaining depth and context.ResultsWe identified four themes: uncertainties encountered in resuscitation guidelines, influences on decision-making, holistic perspectives, and indirect moderators. We found that paramedics experienced uncertainty at all stages of the resuscitation process. Uncertainties arose from indeterminate, ambiguous or complex information and were described as having both clinical and ethical dimensions. Whilst guidelines drove paramedics' decisions, non-clinical personal, practical and relational factors moderated their assessments of survivability and decision-making, with attitudes to interactions between patient age, frailty and quality of life playing a substantial role. Coping strategies such as uncertainty reduction, assumption-based reasoning and weighing pros and cons were evident from interviews.ConclusionsThe complexity of interactions between clinical and non-clinical factors points to an element of variability in paramedics' responses to uncertainty. Exploring UK paramedics' uncertainties and decision-making during specific OHCA events can help acknowledge and address uncertainties in resuscitation guidelines and paramedic training, providing paramedics with the tools to manage uncertainty in a consistent and transparent way.",BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2024,"Gardiner, G; Eli, K; Huxley, CJ; Fothergill, R; Perkins, GD; Smyth, MA; Griffiths, F; Slowther, AM",10.1186/s12873-024-01057-z,,WOS:001299846000002,A

Outcome for cardiac arrest associated with other rhythms has been poor: when asystole was the first rhythm recorded, only 1% of patients survived; when electromechanical dissociation was initially present, only 6% survived. For cases of electromechanical dissociation, neither the  type of rhythm nor the rate appear to influence outcome. Survival from ventricular fibrillation can be improved by shortening the delay to initiation of CPR and to defibrillation. When outcome in 244 witnessed arrests was related to the times to beginning CPR and to initial defribillation, mortality increasd 3% each minute until CPR was begun and 4% a minuted until the first shock was delivered.

This study aimed to develop a model for identifying predictors of survival over time in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during their stay in the emergency department, using ensemble-based machine learning. A total of 26 013 patients from the Korean nationwide out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry were enrolled between January 1 and December 31, 2019. Our model, comprising 38 variables, was developed using the Survival Quilts model to improve predictive performance. We found that changes in important variables of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were observed 10 minutes after arrival at the emergency department. The important score of the predictors showed that the influence of patient age decreased, moving from the highest rank to the fifth.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Enhancing Safety and Quality of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation During Coronavirus Pandemic,"Background: Professional knowledge and experience of healthcare organization went through continuous change and development with the progression of COVID-19 pandemic waves. However, carefully developed guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remained largely unchanged regardless of the epidemic situation, with the largest change being a more prominent bioethical approach. It would be possible to further improve the quality of CPR by systematic data collection, the facilitation of prospective studies, and further development of the methodology based on this evidence, as well as by providing information and developing provisions on interventions with expected poor outcomes, and ultimately by refusing resuscitation. Methods: This study involved the critical collection and analysis of literary data originating from the Web of Science and PubMed databases concerning bioethical aspects and the efficacy of CPR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: According to the current professional recommendation of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), CPR should be initiated immediately in case of cardiac arrest in the absence of an exclusionary circumstance. One such circumstance is explicit refusal of CPR by a well-informed patient, which in practice takes the form of a prior declaration. ERC prescribes the following conjunctive conditions for do-not-attempt CPR (DNACPR) declarations: present, real, and applicable. It is recommended to take the declaration as a part of complex end-of-life planning, with the corresponding documentation available in an electronic database. The pandemic has brought significant changes in resuscitation practice at both lay and professional levels as well. Incidence of out-of-hospital resuscitation (OHCA) did not differ compared to the previous period, while cardiac deaths in public places almost halved during the epidemic (p < 0.001) as did the use of AEDs (p = 0.037). The number of resuscitations performed by bystanders and by the emergency medical service (EMS) also showed a significant decrease (p = 0.001), and the most important interventions (defibrillation, first adrenaline time) suffered a significant delay. Secondary survival until hospital discharge thus decreased by 50% during the pandemic period. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic provided a significant impetus to the revision of guidelines. While detailed methodology has changed only slightly compared to the previous procedures, the DNACPR declaration regarding self-determination is mentioned in the context of complex end-of-life planning. The issue of safe environment has come to the fore for both lay and trained resuscitators. Future Directions: Prospective evaluation of standardized methods can further improve the patient's autonomy and quality of life. Since clinical data are controversial, further prospective controlled studies are needed to evaluate the real hazards of aerosol-generating procedures.",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE,2025,"Pálok, D; Kiss, B; Élo, LG; Dósa, A; Zubek, L; Élo, G",10.3390/jcm14124145,,WOS:001517109500001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Prehospital extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in goat with severe primary blast lung Injury-a pilot study,"BackgroundAlthough extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promise for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA), limited data exist regarding its application in cases involving severe primary blast lung injury (PBLI). This study evaluated the feasibility, indications, complications, and early management of ECPR for refractory out-of-hospital CA in goats with severe PBLI.MethodsTwenty adult goats (30.47 +/- 4.74 kg) were randomly divided into five groups based on their distance from an 8 kg TNT-equivalent explosive: 2.5 m (n = 3), 3 m (n = 5), 4 m (n = 4), 5 m (n = 4), and 6 m (n = 4). Goats were positioned in concentric circles and fixed in special iron frames in the same direction (with the right chest facing the core of the explosion). Following detonation, all animals were transported 500 m to a field rescue unit. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated 1 min after CA. Two of the twenty goats were used for gross lung pathology assessment. Four goats underwent neck vessel cannulation and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Crystalloid and blood transfusions were administered, and animals were monitored for 4 h.ResultsAll goats within 3 m suffered severe lung damage and CA after the explosion. Despite effective chest compression support, six of the eight goats within 3 m of the explosion died due to progressive circulatory failure. Four goats received ECPR. Among them, two were successfully resuscitated using VA - ECMO, with perfusion pressures restored to 65 mmHg (range: 60-70 mmHg) at 25 and 30 min post-CA. In the remaining two, large thrombi in the carotid arteries prevented effective flow initiation. No complications such as hemorrhage or failed vascular access were observed during cannulation. The ECMO circuit was established via an open carotid artery and the jugular vein cannula started, leading to the return of spontaneous circulation in the two successfully treated animals. All goats in the 4-, 5-, and 6-meter groups survived.ConclusionsPrehospital ECPR improved the restoration of spontaneous circulation and hemodynamic stability in goats with severe PBLI-induced CA. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and early efficacy of ECPR in austere conditions. Further investigations in larger animal cohorts and human trials are warranted to validate its potential as a life-saving intervention for blast-induced CA.",JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY,2025,"Wu, ZB; Wang, YL; Shao, SF",10.1186/s13019-025-03593-6,,WOS:001594096700001,A

BACKGROUND LCSD is still underutilized because clinicians are often uncertain whether to use it versus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). METHODS We performed LCSD in 125 patients with LQTS (58% women, mean QT interval corrected for frequency [QTc] 527 +/- 60 ms, 90% on beta blockers) with a follow-up of 12.9 +/- 10.3 years. They were retrospectively divided into 4 groups according to the clinical/genetic status: very high risk (n =18, symptomatic in the first year of life or with highly malignant genetics), with aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) (n = 31), with syncope and/or ICD shocks on beta blockers (n = 45), in primary prevention (n = 31). RESULTS After LCSD, 17% in the very high risk group remained asymptomatic, compared with 52%, 47%, and 97% in the other 3 groups (P < 0.0001), with an overall 86% decrease in the mean yearly cardiac event rate (P < 0.0001). Among 45 patients with only syncope/ICD shocks before LCSD, none had ACA/sudden death as first symptom after LCSD and a 6-month post-LCSD QTc <500 ms predicted excellent outcome. Patients with a QTc $500 ms have a 50% chance of shortening it by an average of 60 ms. LCSD results are not affected by common genotypes. CONCLUSIONS We provide definitive evidence for the long-term efficacy of LCSD in LQTS. The degree of antiarrhythmic protection is influenced by patient's specificity and amount of QTc shortening. This novel approach to the analysis of the outcome allows cardiologists to rationally decide and tailor their management strategies to the individual features of their patients.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,At the border: out-of-hospital resuscitation of the elderly,"Epidemiologic data suggests that emergency medicine will be increasingly affected by the aging population. Since death is more common among the elderly emergency physicians and paramedics more often will encounter patients experiencing cardiac arrest. In elderly patients cardiac arrest might be not a sudden event but the end of the process of dying and to withhold or to abandon CPR might be appropriate. Can we define patients with no chance of survival? Recent studies suggest that age is associated with survival? Recent studies suggest that age is associated with survival, being lower among the elderly. In particular in nursing homes the benefits of resuscitation attempts are very limited. However, age seems to be only a relatively weak independent predictor of outcome. If there is any doubt about the appropriateness of resuscitation attempt, standard of care remains prompt initiation of CPR. Decisions to withhold CPR should be based on sound clinical reasons. Since patients have a right to refuse treatment, their preferences should be taken into account. The probability of survival might influence patients' preferences. Patients should be encouraged to determine in advance whether resuscitative efforts should be initiated and these decisions should be written down.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Reliability of prognostic biomarkers after prehospital extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation with target temperature management,"Background Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) performed at the emergency scene in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) can minimize low-flow time. Target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest can improve neurological outcome. A combination of ECPR and TTM, both implemented as soon as possible on scene, appears to have promising results in OHCA. To date, it is still unknown whether the implementation of TTM and ECPR on scene affects the time course and value of neurological biomarkers. Methods 69 ECPR patients were examined in this study. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 72 h after ECPR and analyzed for S100, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lactate, D-dimers and interleukin 6 (IL6). Cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were used to assess neurological outcome after ECPR upon hospital discharge. Resuscitation data were extracted from the Regensburg extracorporeal membrane oxygenation database and all data were analyzed by a statistician. The data were analyzed using non-parametric methods. Diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers was determined by area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Results were compared to the relevant literature. Results Non-hypoxic origin of cardiac arrest, manual chest compression until ECPR, a short low-flow time until ECPR initiation, low body mass index (BMI) and only a minimal need of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support were associated with a good neurological outcome after ECPR. Survivors with good neurological outcome had significantly lower lactate, IL6, D-dimer, and NSE values and demonstrated a rapid decrease in the initial S100 value compared to non-survivors. Conclusions A short low-flow time until ECPR initiation is important for a good neurological outcome. Hypoxia-induced cardiac arrest has a high mortality rate even when ECPR and TTM are performed at the emergency scene. ECPR patients with a higher BMI had a worse neurological outcome than patients with a normal BMI.

This study aimed to compare different cardioplegic techniques based on early and 30-day clinical outcomes via thorough monitoring. Methods This prospective cohort study included high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and receiving 3 different types of cardioplegia between January 2017 and June 2019. Group 1 (n = 101) had a single dose of del Nido cardioplegia, group 2 (n = 92) had a single dose of histidine-tryptophane-ketoglutarate, and group 3 (n = 119) had cold blood cardioplegia. Patients were examined perioperatively by memory loop recording and auto-triggered memory loop recording for 30 days, with documentation of predefined events. Results Interleukin-6 and cardiac troponin levels in group 1 were significantly higher than those in groups 2 and 3. The incidence of predefined events as markers of inadequate myocardial protection was significantly higher group 1, with more frequent atrial fibrillation attacks and more hospital readmissions. The readmission rate was 17.6% in group 1, 9% in group 2, and 8% in group 3. Conclusions Our data demonstrate the long-term efficacy of cardioplegic techniques, which may become more crucial in high-risk patients who genuinely have a chance to benefit from adjunct myocardial protection.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,δ-Opioid receptor agonist reduces severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction,"Postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is recognized as a leading cause of early death after initially successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In the present study, we hypothesized that a delta-opioid receptor agonist would decrease the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and improve survival. Fifteen Sprague-Dawley rats, fasted overnight with access to water, were anesthetized by an injection of 45 mg/kg ip pentobarbital sodium. Additional doses of 10 mg/kg were administered at hourly intervals but not within 30 min before induced ventricular fibrillation (VF). Either the delta-opioid receptor agonist pentazocine (300 mug/kg), pentazocine pretreated with the opioid receptor-blocking agent naloxone (I mg/kg), or saline placebo was injected into the right atrium after 5 min of untreated VF and 3 min before initiation of CPR. After an additional 8 min of CPR administration, defibrillation was attempted. All animals were successfully resuscitated. Left ventricular rate of pressure increase at 40 mmHg and cardiac index values were significantly improved in pentazocine-treated animals, which also had significantly longer survival times (60 +/- 11 vs. 16 +/- 7 h; P < 0.01). Except for ease of defibrillation, the beneficial effects of pentazocine were completely abolished by pretreatment with naloxone.

Due to organisational differences it is difficult to compare results in various studies. Comparison of studies has been simplified by introduction of the Utstein template. After introduction of an early defibrillation program in Hamburg, we compared the patients being treated with early defibrillation by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) with patients being defibrillated by physicians in an out-of-hospital emergency service in a prospective study. All patients suffered from non EMT-witnessed ventricular fibrillation of cardiac origin. During 1 year, 103 patients were analyzed with respect to survival rate and quality of life. Of the 53 patients in the early defibrillation group (G 1) 11 regained a palpable pulse at physicians' arrival, whereas all patients of the control group (G2) showed ventricular fibrillation. More patients treated with early defibrillation regained sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmics in the prehospital phase (G1: n = 43 (86%); G2: H = 32 (60%); P < 0.05) and had a shorter in-hospital stay (G1: median, 23 days; range 5-51 days; G2: median 39, range 15-88 days; P < 0.05). Twelve patients in G1 and 16 in G2 were discharged from hospital. The survival rate was similar in both groups (after 6 months G1: n = 12; G2: n = 14, after 12 months G1: n = 10; G2: n = 13 and after 24 months G1: n = 9; G2: n = 10), and the quality of life according to Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) and Overall Performance Category (OPC) scores also was comparable between groups. We conclude that early defibrillation provides a higher incidence of return of a spontaneous circulation, a reduced need for antiarrhythmics and shorter in-hospital treatment times in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation.

Few studies; however, have focused on patients with cardiac arrest not selected for coronary angiography. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cardiac arrest denied emergent angiography. Patients with cardiac arrest were identified within a registry that included all catheterization laboratory activations from 2008 to 2012. Logistic regression and proportional-hazards models were created to assess the clinical characteristics and mortality associated with denying emergent angiography. Among 664 patients referred for catheterization, 110 (17%) had cardiac arrest, and 26 of these patients did not undergo emergent angiography. Most subjects (69%) were turned down for angiography for clinical reasons and a minority for perceived futility (27%). After multivariate adjustment, pulseless electrical activity as the initial arrest rhythm (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 13.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76 to 100.12), <1.0 mm of ST-segment elevation (AOR 10.26,95% CI 1.68 to 62.73), female gender (AOR 4.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 19.08), and advancing age (AOR 1.10 per year, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16) were associated with increased odds of with-holding angiography. The mortality rate was markedly higher for patients who were denied emergent angiography (hazard ratio 3.64, 95% CI 2.05 to 6.49), even after adjustment for medical acuity (hazard ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.41). In conclusion, Older subjects, women, and patients without ST-segment elevation were more commonly denied emergent angiography after cardiac arrest.

A modified Delphi process builds content validity and is an accepted method to develop consensus by eliciting expert opinions through multiple rounds of questionnaires. Consensus was achieved when items reached a high level of agreement, defined as greater than 80% responses for a particular item rated a 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale.Results: Snowball sampling generated a panel of 14 content experts, composed of physicians from four continents and five primary specialties. Seven existing institutional protocols for ECPR cannulation following OHCA were identified and merged into a single comprehensive list of 207 items.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Organ-Specific Mitochondrial Alterations Following Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome: A Comprehensive Review,"Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is triggered by systemic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and affects various organs, is a key factor in the development of post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). Current research on PCAS primarily addresses generalized mitochondrial responses, resulting in a knowledge gap regarding organ-specific mitochondrial dynamics. This review focuses on the organ-specific mitochondrial responses to IR injury, particularly examining the brain, heart, and kidneys, to highlight potential therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction to enhance outcomes post-IR injury. Methods and Results: We conducted a narrative review examining recent advancements in mitochondrial research related to IR injury. Mitochondrial responses to IR injury exhibit considerable variation across different organ systems, influenced by unique mitochondrial structures, bioenergetics, and antioxidative capacities. Each organ demonstrates distinct mitochondrial behaviors that have evolved to fulfill specific metabolic and functional needs. For example, cerebral mitochondria display dynamic responses that can be both protective and detrimental to neuronal activity and function during ischemic events. Cardiac mitochondria show vulnerability to IR-induced oxidative stress, while renal mitochondria exhibit a unique pattern of fission and fusion, closely linked to their susceptibility to acute kidney injury. This organ-specific heterogeneity in mitochondrial responses requires the development of tailored interventions. Progress in mitochondrial medicine, especially in the realms of genomics and metabolomics, is paving the way for innovative strategies to combat mitochondrial dysfunction. Emerging techniques such as mitochondrial transplantation hold the potential to revolutionize the management of IR injury in resuscitation science. Conclusions: The investigation into organ-specific mitochondrial responses to IR injury is pivotal in the realm of resuscitation research, particularly within the context of PCAS. This nuanced understanding holds the promise of revolutionizing PCAS management, addressing the unique mitochondrial dysfunctions observed in critical organs affected by IR injury.",LIFE-BASEL,2024,"Nakamura, E; Aoki, T; Endo, Y; Kazmi, J; Hagiwara, J; Kuschner, CE; Yin, T; Kim, J; Becker, LB; Hayashida, K",10.3390/life14040477,,WOS:001210866700001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Ruthenium red alleviates post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by upregulating mitophagy through inhibition of USP33 in a cardiac arrest rat model,"Cardiac arrest (CA) remains a leading cause of death, with suboptimal survival rates despite efforts involving cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced life-support technology. Post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction (PRMD) is an important determinant of patient outcomes. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury underlies this dysfunction. Previous reports have shown that ruthenium red (RR) has a protective effect against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury; however, its precise mechanism of action in PRMD remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of RR on PRMD and analyzed its underlying mechanisms. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in rats, which were then subjected to cardiopulmonary resuscitation to establish an experimental CA model. At the onset of return of spontaneous circulation, RR (2.5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. Our study showed that RR improved myocardial function and reduced the production of oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSSG), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. RR also helped maintain mitochondrial structure and increased ATP and GTP levels. Additionally, RR effectively attenuated myocardial apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed downregulation of proteins closely related to mitophagy, including ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) and P62, whereas LC3B (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B) was upregulated. The upregulation of mitophagy may play a critical role in reducing myocardial injury. These results demonstrate that RR may attenuate PRMD by promoting mitophagy through the inhibition of USP33. These effects are likely mediated through diverse mechanisms, including antioxidant activity, apoptosis suppression, and preservation of mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism. Consequently, RR has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for addressing post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction.",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,2024,"Zhang, F; Ye, Z; Ran, YQ; Liu, C; Zhang, MT; Xu, XC; Song, FQ; Yao, L",10.1016/j.ejphar.2024.176633,,WOS:001265859100001,A

Yet, their effects on myocardial mechanics remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of mavacamten and disopyramide on left ventricular mechanical dispersion (LVMD) and its association with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and results Consecutive subjects (n = 120) with obstructive HCM treated with either Mavacamten or disopyramide from 2018 to 2024 were identified. Echocardiographic speckle-tracking strain imaging with myocardial work indices and LVMD quantification was performed at baseline and follow-up. Patients were followed up for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias: sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), up to 2 years. Propensity matching was performed for age and sex to compare the groups. Mavacamten significantly reduced LVMD (85.1 +/- 26.4 ms vs. 64.3 +/- 16.7 ms, P = 0.013) and global wasted work (GWW) (268 mmHg% (185-378) vs. 150 mmHg% (124-262), P = 0.006) and increased global work efficiency (GWE) (87% (82-92) vs. 90% (86-94), P = 0.038). None of the favourable effects were observed with disopyramide. The median follow-up duration was 12 (range 6-24) months. LVMD at follow-up was significantly associated with the outcome events [area under curve: 0.784, 95% CI (0.622-0.945), P < 0.001]. LVMD <72 ms at follow-up was associated with improved event-free survival (X6.4, log-rank P = 0.011). Mavacamten and global work indices were independent determinants of LVMD at follow-up. Conclusion Mavacamten, but not disopyramide, decreased LVMD, GWW, and increased GWE in obstructive HCM.

Nonetheless, women remain neglected in CHD research, resulting in treatments and recommendations being primarily based on data collected in men. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have supported dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) following cardiac arrest and MI to promote the development of mental health disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder). However, studies addressing changes in HPAA activation under basal and stress-induced conditions in women samples have been lacking. Thus, we conducted this study to determine basal and stress-induced changes in heart rate, respiration and cortisol secretion (via 8 saliva samples) in a sample of women with a history of MI (n = 13) and a control group (n = 16). We measured altered stress reactivity through exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test. In addition, participants completed questionnaires assessing perceived stress and mental health status (i.e., anxiety and mood). Overall, our findings indicated comparable assessments of perceived situational stress in both groups. Interestingly, salivary cortisol secretion support reduced stress-induced HPAA activation related to TSST exposure in MI women compared to control counterparts. Our observations are consistent with findings supporting glucocorticoid resistance noted following MI and cardiac arrest. Akin to cardiac arrest survivors, HPAA dysregulation in MI survivors could have an impact on the development of mental health disorders.

One of this complication is diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of abdominal organs. Surgical intervention needs to be planned carefully in multidisciplinary team approach and requires fine surgical techniques for better outcome. There are few reported cases of diaphragmatic rupture after Cardiopulmonary resuscitation but none in pregnant woman.Case presentationWe report a rare case of diaphragmatic rupture in a 29-year-old pregnant patient who experienced a full-blown diaphragmatic defect and herniation of the abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity, as a complication of CPR. Following careful assessment and diagnosis, the patient underwent urgent laparotomy with reduction of the contents and primary closure of the defect. One year follow up was satisfactory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of the abdominal organs following CPR in a pregnant woman in the literature.ConclusionThe application of external cardiac massage through CPR is a life-saving procedure for the management of cardiac arrest. Common complications related to CPR include rib fractures, sternal fractures and haemothorax. Diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of the abdominal organs is a rare complication, having been reported only once in the literature (Sabzi F, Faraji R, Tanaffos 16:170-172, 2017); however, it represents a serious and life-threating event.

Especially in centers caring for children with (congenital) heart disease, ECMO is now an essential part of care available for those with severe heart failure as a bridge to recovery, long term mechanical support, or transplantation. Short-term outcomes depend very much on indication. Hospital survival is similar to 40% for all neonatal cardiac ECMO patients combined. ECMO is being used for pre- and/or post-operative stabilization in neonates with congenital heart disease and in neonates with medical heart disease such as myocarditis, cardiomyopathy or refractory arrhythmias. ECMO use during resuscitation (ECPR) or for sepsis is summarized elsewhere in this special edition of Frontiers in Pediatrics. In this review article, we will discuss the indications for neonatal cardiac ECMO, the difficult process of patients' selection and identifying the right timing to initiate ECMO, as well as outline pros and cons for peripheral vs. central cannulation.

Recently, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibition was shown to exert effective myocardial protection against regional ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we investigated whether tubastatin A, a specific histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor, could improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction through the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated cell pyroptosis and its modulation mechanism. Methods and Results Healthy male white domestic swine were used to establish the model of CA/CPR in vivo, and the H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation model was used to simulate the CA/CPR process in vitro. Consequently, tubastatin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, decreased proinflammatory cytokines production and cell pyroptosis, and increased cell survival after hypoxia/reoxygenation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. In addition, tubastatin A increased the acetylated levels of transcription factor EB and its translocation to the nucleus, and its protective effect above was partly abrogated by transcription factor EB short interfering RNA after hypoxia/reoxygenation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Similarly, tubastatin A promoted cardiac transcription factor EB nuclear translocation, inhibited NLRP3-mediated cell pyroptosis, and mitigated myocardial dysfunction after CA/CPR in swine. Conclusions The inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 activity by tubastatin A limited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell pyroptosis probably through the enhancement of transcription factor EB signaling, and therefore improved myocardial dysfunction after CA/CPR.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION,2022,"Xu, JF; Zhao, X; Jiang, XK; He, L; Wu, XJ; Wang, JG; Chen, QJ; Li, YL; Zhang, M",10.1161/JAHA.121.024205,,WOS:000778262600075,A

This review examines the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies currently under development to activate the post-conditioning pathways and thereby improve survival and function. Recent findings Post-conditioning utilizes the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) and survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) pathways as common avenues to promote cell survival and function. Ischemic post-conditioning and multiple medications activate these pathways resulting in improved cardiac and neurological function in animal models of cardiac arrest. Detailed knowledge of the RISK and SAFE pathways can be used for further drug development. Human studies are now underway to test some of these strategies, but further clinical trials are necessary to translate these therapies to clinical practice.",CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE,2014,"Dell'anna, AM; Scolletta, S; Donadello, K; Taccone, FS",10.1097/MCC.0000000000000086,,WOS:000335973800004,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,The Association Between Functional Status and Health-Related Quality of Life Following Discharge from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit,"Background Despite one third of children with acquired brain injury (ABI) experiencing new functional impairments following critical care admission, there is limited research investigating the impact of new functional impairments on overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) or among important HRQOL domains. We aimed to investigate the association between new functional impairments, measured by the Functional Status Scale (FSS), and HRQOL in pediatric patients with ABI after critical care. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of 275 children aged 2 months to 18 years with ABI. The primary exposure evaluated was change in FSS from baseline at hospital discharge, categorized per prior work (no change, 1-2 point increase, and >= 3 point increase). The primary outcome was overall HRQOL 6 months after hospital discharge, measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) total score. Secondary outcomes were PedsQL domain scores. PedsQL total and domain scores were transformed into age-standardized z scores for analyses. Multiple linear regression models evaluated the association between FSS change category and HRQOL (overall and domain z scores) when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics and were reported as beta-coefficients with 95% confidence intervals. Results Complete data were analyzed for 195 (71%) children, including 127 with traumatic brain injury. New functional impairment was common with 32 (16%) patients experiencing FSS increases >= 3, 50 (26%) patients with FSS increases of 1-2 points, and 113 (58%) patients with no change from prehospital baseline. The majority of children (63%) demonstrated HRQOL ratings >= 1 standard deviation below healthy age-based standards (z scores <= - 1). Regression models demonstrated older age, female sex, presence of comorbidities, and preadmission cardiopulmonary resuscitation were all significantly associated with poorer overall HRQOL (all p < 0.05). FSS increase >= 3 at discharge was significantly associated with worse overall HRQOL at follow-up (beta = - 1.07; 95% confidence interval = - 1.63 to - 0.52) when controlling for the aforementioned significant factors, and significantly improved model fit (p value for change = 0.001). Similar findings in secondary analyses were found for physical domain scores, with FSS increase showing a significant association with worse physical HRQOL scores and improvements in model fit. Change in FSS was not significantly associated with other HRQOL domain scores (emotional, social, school, psychosocial). Conclusions Many children with ABI after critical care experience new functional impairments (FSS increases) and worse HRQOL than healthy peers. FSS increase at discharge is a significant risk factor for worse HRQOL in the months after hospital discharge and improves HRQOL models beyond illness and demographic variables alone.",NEUROCRITICAL CARE,2021,"Holding, EZ; Turner, EM; Hall, TA; Leonard, S; Bradbury, KR; Williams, CN",10.1007/s12028-021-01271-8,,WOS:000673192500001,A

However, optimal targets and management are unknown.MethodsThe STEPCARE (Sedation, Temperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation) trial is a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, factorial, superiority trial in which sedation, temperature, and blood pressure strategies will be studied in three separate comparisons (SED-CARE, TEMP-CARE, and MAP-CARE). The trial population will be adults admitted to intensive care who are comatose after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes will be poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6), Health-Related Quality of Life using EQ-VAS, and specific serious adverse events in the intensive care unit predefined for each trial. All outcomes will be assessed at 6 months after randomization.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Flipped Classroom Model for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training Among Novice Nursing Students in Oman: Exploratory Quasi-Experimental One-Group Pretest/Post-Test Design,"Background: The flipped classroom model (FC) has gained prominence in nursing education for its emphasis on active, student-centered learning. While global evidence supports its efficacy in skill-based training such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), limited studies have evaluated its impact within Middle Eastern nursing programs, particularly in Oman. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the FC approach in enhancing CPR knowledge, skills, and learner perception among first-year nursing students. Methods:Exploratory quasi-experimental one-group pretest/post-test design was conducted among 177 first-year nursing students enrolled in the Fundamentals of Nursing I course at the University of Buraimi, Oman. Participants completed preclass materials, followed by collaborative case-based discussions and skill demonstrations. CPR knowledge was assessed through multiple-choice tests, skills through a standardized checklist, and perceptions using a validated Likert-scale questionnaire. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in CPR knowledge scores from pretest (M = 6.81, SD = 3.20) to post-test (M = 10.88, SD = 2.00; p < .001). Knowledge scores moderately correlated with CPR skill performance (r = .209, p = .005), though no significant correlations were found with perception scores. Female students demonstrated significantly higher CPR performance than males (p = .023). Overall, students expressed positive perceptions of the FC model. Conclusion: The FC approach significantly improved CPR knowledge and moderately influenced skill acquisition among novice nursing students, irrespective of academic standing. These findings suggest potential benefits of integrating FC methods but should be interpreted as exploratory within a single-group design.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Ventilatory targets after cardiac arrest,"The mortality of postcardiac arrest patients has gradually reduced in years but it still is as high as 50%, despite advancements in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, i.e. revascularization and therapeutic moderate hypothermia. However, recent evidence suggests that other therapeutic interventions aimed to minimize progressive deterioration of the brain and other organs function might be helpful to reduce in-hospital mortality and improve neurologic outcome as well as quality of life after cardiac arrest. In this article, we discuss the role of ventilator management on the prognosis after cardiac arrest. We performed a meta-analysis showing that in adult patients not only hypcoda but also hyperoxia was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, while hypercapnia and hypocapnia worse neurologic outcome. In pediatric patients, hypoxia and hyperoxia were not associated with higher in.:hospital mortality, while hypocapnia and hypercabia with higher in-hospital mortality worse neurologic outcome. We propose a general bundle for ventilator treatment after cardiac arrest, including: 1) therapeutic hypothermia for 12-24 hours; 2) mean arterial pressure >=.65-75 mmHg; 3) PaO2 between 60-200 mmHg and PCO2 betweeri 30 and 50 mmHg; 4) protective MV with tidal volume of 6-8 mL/kg and positive end expiratory pressure of between 5-10 cmH(2)O; 5) monitoring of respiratory mechanics, extravascular lung water, hemodynamics, non-invasive transcranial Doppler and intracranial pressure monitoring; and 6) others supportive care, i.e. blood sugar and seizures control.",MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA,2015,"Sutherasan, Y; Vargas, M; Brunetti, I; Pelosi, P",,,WOS:000350839600007,A

Whether this expectation is similar for patients with the most extreme expression of massive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a particularly aggressive form of the disease is unresolved. Of 1,766 consecutive HC patients presenting to Tufts HC Institute (2004 to 2015), 92 were identified with extreme LV wall thickness (30 to 48 mm), and compared with 1,674 HC patients with less marked hypertrophy (13 to 29 mm). Follow-up assessment was over 5.3 +/- 3.4 years. Patients with massive LV hypertrophy (n = 92) had higher sudden death event rates (3.0%/year) than did patients with lesser hypertrophy (0.8%/year; p < 0.001). In 16 of the 92 patients (17%), potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia were successfully aborted by primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy at 30 +/- 13 years (n = 11), or by resuscitated cardiac arrest with external defibrillation (n = 5) and later by secondary prevention interventions (n = 3); no patient experienced arrhythmic sudden death. Aborted sudden death events (3.0%/year) exceeded HC-related mortality by 7-fold (n = 2; 0.4%/year; p < 0.001). European Society of Cardiology risk score would have failed to identify 60% of patients with arrhythmic sudden death events, leaving them exposed to sudden death without ICDs. In addition, 35 patients required surgical myectomy for progressive heart failure due to LV outflow obstruction (improved to NYHA I/II in 30). Eighty-eight (96%) of the 92 patients have survived to age 38 +/- 14 years (23% >= 50 years). All-cause mortality did not differ from an age and gender-matched general population (p = 0.62). In conclusion, in this referral-based population, patients with the most extreme expression of HC are at increased arrhythmic sudden death risk reliably prevented with prophylactic ICDs. Progressive heart failure secondary to outflow obstruction was reversible with surgical myectomy. Despite extreme phenotypic expression, with contemporary treatment interventions young HC patients have an opportunity to achieve extended survival with good quality of life. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Identifying the critical, potentially modifiable, barriers to CPR is essential. Our aim was to identify factors associated with delays (1) positioning patient flat and (2) initiating CPR in recordings of cardiac arrest calls and to explore potentially modifiable behavioural factors.Methods Retrospective analysis of 200 call recordings to the Scottish Ambulance Service January 2019-December 2020 during which dispatcher-assisted CPR instructions were provided. Potential barriers were coded inductively. Log rank tests were used to explore differences in 'time to position patient flat' and 'time to initiate CPR' depending on the presence/absence of potential barriers identified.Results A random sample of 200 calls were selected from 11 275 potentially eligible calls. Patients in those calls were mostly male (61%), most aged 40-80s; callers were mostly female spouses. Time to position patient flat: median 40 s (IQR: 15.5-82.0), time to initiate CPR: median 50 s (IQR: 36-92). Between 1 and 11 potential barriers were identified in calls (median=4, IQR:2-6). The most common barriers identified were communication (48%), emotion (45.5%) and physical challenges (38.5%). Various physical challenges, concern patient too heavy, concern that it was too late/futile, concern about physical ability, concern about doing harm and caller being 'upset' were significantly associated with delays to positioning the patient flat. Callers 'not knowing how' to do CPR; expressing concerns about doing harm, expressing anger and various physical challenges including concerns about ability were associated with delays in initiating CPR.

Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) play a crucial role in post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI). However, the effects and mechanisms of targeting BMVEC energy metabolism to mitigate brain injury remain unclear.MethodsWe established a mouse model of cardiac arrest by injecting potassium chloride into the right internal jugular vein. Mass spectrometry detected targeted changes in short-chain fatty acids and energy metabolism metabolites in the CA/CPR group compared to the sham group. Mice with overexpressed ACSS2 in BMVECs were created using an AAV-BR1 vector, and ACSS2 knockout mice were generated using the CRE-LOXP system. The oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model was established to investigate the role and mechanisms of ACSS2 in endothelial cells in vitro.ResultsMetabolomics analysis revealed disrupted cerebral energy metabolism post-CA/CPR, with decreased acetyl-CoA and amino acids. Overexpression of ACSS2 in BMVECs increased acetyl-CoA levels and improved neurological function. Vascular endothelial cell-specific ACSS2 knockout mice exhibited reduced aortic sprouting in vitro. Overexpression of ACSS2 improved endothelial dysfunction following oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) and influenced autophagy by interacting with transcription factor EB (TFEB) and modulating the AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha) pathway.ConclusionOur study shows that ACSS2 modulates the biological functions of BMVECs by promoting autophagy.

However, the necessity for cessation of systemic blood flow with hypothermic cardiac arrest carries substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, including poor neurological outcomes and kidney failure. While uncontrolled studies have suggested the safety of operating at warmer temperatures, significant variables remain un-investigated, supporting the need for a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to produce evidence-based guidelines for perfusion strategies in aortic surgery. This study proposes a multi-center RCT in order to compare outcomes of warmer hypothermic strategies during aortic hemiarch surgery on a composite endpoint of neurologic and acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods/design: This is a prospective multi-center, single-blind two-arm RCT comparing mild (32 degrees C) versus moderate (26 degrees C) hypothermic cardiac arrest in patients (n = 282) undergoing hemiarch surgery with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). The primary endpoint is a composite of neurological injury (incidence of transient ischemic attack and/or stroke) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 1 or higher AKI. Secondary outcomes include death, cardiopulmonary bypass time, bleeding, transfusion rates, prolonged mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, length of stay, and quality of life measures. Patients will undergo 1:1 block randomization to each treatment arm on day of surgery. Sequence of operation will be at the surgeon's discretion with mandatory guidelines for temperature and ACP administration. Perioperative management will occur as per enrolling center standard of care. Neurocognitive function will be assessed for neurological injury using validated neurological screening tests: NIHSS, MOCA, BI, and MRS throughout patient follow-up. Diagnosis and classification of AKI will be based on rising creatinine values as per the KDIGO criteria. Study duration for each patient will be 60 +/- 14 days. Discussion: It is hoped that performing hemiarch surgery using mild hypothermia (32 degrees C) and selective ACP will result in a 15% absolute risk reduction in the composite outcomes. The potential of this risk reduction will translate into improved patient outcomes, survival, and long-term financial savings to the health care system. In addition, the results of this trial will be used to create the first-ever guidelines for temperature management strategy during aortic surgery.",TRIALS,2019,"Jabagi, H; Wells, G; Boodhwani, M",10.1186/s13063-019-3713-9,,WOS:000506884900010,A

This study tested the hypothesis that TH would promote cerebral blood flow (CBF) restoration and its maintenance after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from CA. Twelve Wistar rats resuscitated from 7-min asphyxial CA were randomized into two groups: hypothermia group (7 H, n = 6), treated with mild TH (33-34celcius) immediately after ROSC and normothermia group (7 N, n = 6,37.0 +/- 0.5celcius). Multiple parameters including mean arterial pressure, CBF, electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. The neurological outcomes were evaluated using electrophysiological (information quantity, IQ, of EEG) methods and a comprehensive behavior examination (neurological deficit score, NDS). TH consistently promoted better CBF restoration approaching the baseline levels in the 7 H group as compared with the 7 N group. CBF during the first 5-30 min post ROSC of the two groups was 7 H:90.5% +/- 3.4% versus 7 N:76.7% +/- 3.5% (P < 0.01). Subjects in the 7 H group showed significantly better IQ scores after ROSC and better NDS scores at 4 and 24 h. Early application of TH facilitates restoration of CBF back to baseline levels after CA, which in turn results in the restoration of brain electrical activity and improved neurological outcome.",JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM,2019,"Wang, QH; Miao, P; Modi, HR; Garikapati, S; Koehler, RC; Thakor, N",10.1177/0271678X18773702,,WOS:000488396900007,A

OHCA predominantly affects the general population, with staggering numbers: 400 000 cases annually in Europe and 350 000 in the United States, contributing to 50% of cardiovascular-related deaths. The vast majority of OHCA cases begin with a shockable rhythm, making effective treatment possible through early defibrillation, even by non -medical personnel using automated external defibrillators (AEDs). Despite the availability of such devices, survival from OHCA remains below 10%, with no substantial improvements over the last 25 years. Public access defibrillation programs, which reduce response times with AEDs, have demonstrated a significant increase in survival chances for OHCA victims. Particularly, the ""Progetto Vita"" in Piacenza is an emblematic example of early defibrillation in Europe, tripling survival rates in OHCA patients treated by laypersons compared to patients treated with the traditional system. This experience contributed to the approval of Law 116, dated August 4, 2021, in Italy, aimed at promoting the distribution and use of AEDs in sports facilities, public venues, transportation, and public services. The law also emphasizes that AEDs can be used without the need for specific training, thus promoting wider usage. In this article, we will briefly examine the epidemiology of OHCA and delve into the organizational model of the ""Progetto Vita"", which aligns with the principles of Law 116/2021.

According to the interaction mechanism between M . tuberculosis and the host, the latency antigen Rv0572c and region of difference 9 (RD9) antigen Rv3621c were selected in this study to prepare the fusion protein DR2. Stimulating clinically diagnosed active tuberculosis infections (i.e., TB patients), latent tuberculosis infections, and healthy controls confirmed that T lymphocytes could recognize DR2 protein in the peripheral blood of TB-infected individuals more than subcomponent protein. The DR2 protein was then emulsified in the liposome adjuvant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide, and imiquimod (DIMQ) was administered to C57BL/6 mice immunized with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine to evaluate their immunogenicity. Studies have shown that DR2/DIMQ, a booster vaccine for BCG primary immunization, can elicit robust CD4+ Th1 cell immune response and predominant IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) effector memory T cells (TEM) subsets. Furthermore, the serum antibody level and the expression of related cytokines increased significantly with the extension of immunization time, with IL2(+), CD4(+), or CD8(+) central memory T cells (T-CM) subsets predominant in the long term.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Resuscitative hypothermia,"Resuscitative (postinsult) hypothermia is less well studied than protective-preservative (pre and intra-arrest) hypothermia. The latter is in wide clinical use, particularly for protecting the brain during cardiac surgery. Resuscitative hypothermia was explored in the 1950s and then lay dormant until the 1980s when it was revived. This change occurred through the discoveries of brain damage mitigating effects after cardiac arrest in dogs, and after forebrain ischemia in rats, of mild (34 degrees C) hypothermia (which is safe), and of benefits derived from moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C) after traumatic brain injury or focal brain ischemia in various species. The idea that protection-preservation or resuscitation by hypothermia is mainly explained by its ability to reduce cerebral oxygen demand has been replaced by an increasingly documented synergism of many beneficial mechanisms. Deleterious chemical cascades during and after these insults are suppressed even by mild hypothermia. Prolonged moderate hypothermia carries some risks, e.g., arrhythmias, infection and coagulopathies. These side effects need further study. In global brain ischemia, protective-preservative mild hypothermia provides lasting mitigation of brain damage. Resuscitative mild hypothermia, however, may be beneficial in terms of long-term outcome or may merely delay the inevitable loss of selectively vulnerable neurons. Even if the latter is true, mild hypothermia may extend the therapeutic window for other interventions. This extension of the therapeutic window requires further documentation. After normothermic cardiac arrest of 11 mins in dogs, mild resuscitative hypothermia from 15 mins to 12 hrs after reperfusion plus cerebral blood flow promotion normalized functional recovery with the least histologic damage seen thus far. Optimal duration of, and rewarming methods from, resuscitative hypothermia need clarification. The earliest possible induction of mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest seems desirable. Head-neck surface cooling alone is too slow. Among many clinically feasible rapid cooling methods, carotid cold flush and peritoneal cooling look promising. After traumatic brain injury or focal brain ischemia, which seem to still benefit from even later cooling, surface cooling methods may be adequate.

A bundle of procedures, which may need to be administered simultaneously, is required. These include prompt identification and treatment of the cause of cardiac arrest, with early consideration for procedures such as percutaneous coronary interventions and fibrinolytics, and treatment of electrolyte abnormalities. In addition, a definitive airway and normocapnoeic ventilation without causing hyperoxaemia, together with rational management of haemodynamics with intra-arterial and central venous lines and vasoactive agents will be crucial. Additional benefit is possible with appropriate forms of early goal-directed therapy and achieving therapeutic hypothermia within the first few hours, followed by gradual rewarming and ensuring glycaemic control by maintaining blood sugars within a range of 6-10 mmol/L. All these would be important and need to be continued for at least 24 hours, together with a series of measures to control neurological reactions and monitor neurological responses for best effect.

Mobile applications (apps) have the capability to augment cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skill retention as a low-cost, accessible training method. Methods An iterative process to develop an app to reinforce CPR skills emphasizing hand placement, compression rate, real-time feedback, and recurring tips is described. The app was tested on HS students to measure its impact on quality and comfort of CPR using Likert surveys and skills assessments before and after one month of usage. CPR Score and compression rate were measured using the Laerdal (TM) Little Anne Manikin QCPR software. Results Fourteen HS students participated in a prospective observational study.

Initially used in operating rooms before 2000, TEE expanded into emergency departments (EDs), intensive care units (ICUs), and even prehospital settings. Its superior imaging capability during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) supports rapid diagnosis, optimization of compression quality, and more accurate rhythm assessment, including the differentiation between asystole and fine ventricular fibrillation. TEE has been shown to influence intra-arrest clinical decision-making in up to 78% of cases, often revealing pathologies-such as aortic dissection or cardiac rupture-not detected by TTE. Importantly, TEE aids in identifying reversible causes of cardiac arrest, guiding high-quality CPR by assessing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and shortening the duration of pulse checks. It also may play a role in extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) and organ donation procedures, particularly in cannulation and monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). TEE use is feasible and safe during cardiac arrest, with high insertion success rates and minimal complications when performed by trained personnel. While cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and intensivists traditionally perform TEE, simplified training protocols now enable emergency physicians to safely and effectively deploy TEE in critical settings. Protocols such as ""POCUS-TEE"" may promote rapid acquisition of essential views, facilitating broader implementation. Despite the potential benefits, several barriers to widespread adoption remain. These include the availability of equipment, limitations in training, and concerns regarding the safety of the probe during defibrillation. Resuscitation guidelines recommend removing the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) probe, or at least insulating it, as a precaution during defibrillation. TEE is particularly valuable when TTE proves inadequate, such as in obese or mechanically ventilated patients. In conclusion, TEE might enhance the quality and precision of resuscitation in cardiac arrest and has the potential to improve survival and neurological outcomes in selected cases. Its broader adoption hinges on institutional support, streamlined protocols, operator training, and further research to validate its impact on patient-centered outcomes.

Underlying mechanisms may include ischaemia or electrophysiological abnormalities. The conventional diagnostic workflow may fail to uncover occult arrhythmic substrates, highlighting the need for targeted testing strategies in selected cases.Case summary A 35-year-old man, a former endurance athlete, experienced a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest during sleep. Ventricular fibrillation was terminated with direct-current shock, achieving return of spontaneous circulation. The initial 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V3 with a coved Brugada-like pattern, but reciprocal ST-segment depression. Myocardial ischaemia was ruled out with coronary angiography, and Brugada syndrome was excluded by a negative ajmaline test. No further abnormalities were found. Persistent clinical suspicion prompted an adenosine test, which revealed a left lateral accessory pathway. Electrophysiological testing demonstrated high-risk properties of the accessory pathway, with haemodynamic collapse during pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Catheter ablation successfully eliminated the accessory pathway without changes in QRS complex morphology, and the patient remained asymptomatic at follow-up, with no arrhythmic recurrence.Discussion Unexplained cardiac arrest in patients with structurally normal hearts presents significant diagnostic challenges. In this case, adenosine testing unmasked an accessory pathway as the reversible cause of cardiac arrest. Though not routinely included in cardiac arrest evaluations, adenosine testing was crucial in this patient's diagnosis and management, preventing unnecessary implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

For predicting the good cerebral performance category score 1 to 2, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87), 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.81), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.88), respectively. For predicting CA mortality, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation datasetwere0.85 (95%CI 0.82-0.87), 0.83 (95%CI 0.79-0.87), and0.79 (95%CI 0.74-0.83), respectively. Forpredicting ROSC, the pooled C-index, sensitivity, and specificity based on the validation dataset were 0.77 (95% CI 0.74-0.80), 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.74), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.71-0.96), respectively. In predicting CA, the most significant modeling variables were respiratory rate, blood pressure, age, and temperature. In predicting a good cerebral performance category score 1 to 2, the most significant modeling variables in the in-hospital CA group were rhythm (shockable or nonshockable), age, medication use, and gender; the most significant modelingvariablesinthe out-of-hospital CA group were age, rhythm (shockable or nonshockable), medication use, and ROSC. Conclusions: ML represents a currently promising approach for predicting the occurrence and outcomes of CA. Therefore, in future research on CA, we may attempt to systematically update traditional scoring tools based on the superior performance of ML in specific outcomes, achieving artificial intelligence-driven enhancements.

Both experimental groups received a two-hour BLS training. While the contents were identical in both groups, in one of them the reduction of no-flow time was focused on (focused no-flow group). The control group did not receive any training. Finally, all of them were evaluated in the same out-of-hospital cardiac arrest simulated scenario. The primary endpoint was the compression fraction.Results: Results from 78 participants were analysed (control group: 19; traditional group: 30; focused no-flow group: 29). The focused no-flow group achieved higher percentages of compression fraction (median: 56.0, interquartile rank (IQR): 53.5-58.5) than the traditional group (44.0, IQR: 42.0- 47.0) and control group (52.0, IQR: 43.0-58.0) in the complete scenario. Participants from the control group performed compression-only cardiopul-monary resuscitation (CPR), while the other groups performed compression-ventilation CPR. CPR fraction was calculated, showing the fraction of time in which the participants were performing resuscitation manoeuvres. In this case, the focused no-flow group reached higher percentages of CPR fraction (77.6, IQR: 74.4-82.4) than the traditional group (61.9, IQR: 59.3-68.1) and the control group (52.0, IQR: 43.0-58.0).

The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is growing rapidly, and centers providing ECMO must strive to meet stringent quality standards such as those set out by the ECMONet working group. Prognostic tools such as the RESP score can assist clinicians in predicting outcomes for patients with severe acute respiratory failure but do not predict whether ECMO will enhance survival. Evidence continues to grow that novel modes of mechanical ventilation such as neurally adjusted ventilatory assist are feasible and improve patient physiology and patient-ventilator interaction; data on clinical outcomes are limited but supportive. Critical illness causes long-term psychological and function sequelae: the risk of a new psychiatric diagnosis and severe physical impairment is significantly increased in the months after discharge from the intensive care unit. These long-term effects might be amenable to changes in sedation practice and increased early mobilization. Daily sedation discontinuation enhances the validity of routine delirium assessment. Many critically ill patients merit assessment by palliative care clinicians; the demand for palliative care services among critically ill patients is expected to grow.

This article reports the findings of focus groups conducted to explore the barriers and facilitators present for obstetric nurse providers in a central urban hospital in Malawi regarding the training and provision of neonatal resuscitation. All obstetric nurse providers in this setting participated in focus groups; these groups identified 4 themes: 1) confidence in their skills in assessing newborns and recognizing the need for resuscitation, 2) a lack of resources, 3) facilitators who would enable them to introduce resuscitation, and 4) solutions to the current problems. Resource shortages and barriers to providing care included availability of staff, equipment, and supplies; labor ward geography; ethical dilemmas; and the lack of standard protocols regarding newborn resuscitation. Facilitators were professional experience and the critical load of deliveries performed. Solutions to barriers included small resource additions as well as long-term policy changes. With standard policy and protocols, experienced, confident nurses could overcome the barriers to providing newborn resuscitation.

The aims of this 1-year prospective and monocentric study were to investigate the incidence of NDE in ICU survivors (all aetiologies) as well as factors that may affect its frequency, and to assess quality of life up to 1 year after enrolment.Methods We enrolled adults with a prolonged ICU stay (> 7 days). During the first 7 days after discharge, all eligible patients were assessed in a face-to-face interview for NDE using the Greyson NDE scale, dissociative experiences using the Dissociative Experience Scale, and spirituality beliefs using the WHOQOL-SRPB. Medical parameters were prospectively collected. At 1-year after inclusion, patients were contacted by phone to measure quality of life using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire.Results Out of the 126 included patients, 19 patients (15%) reported having experienced a NDE as identified by the Greyson NDE scale (i.e. cut-off score & GE; 7/32). In univariate analyses, mechanical ventilation, sedation, analgesia, reason for admission, primary organ dysfunction, dissociative and spiritual propensities were associated with the emergence of NDE. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the dissociative and spiritual propensity strongly predicted the emergence of NDE. One year later (n = 61), the NDE was not significantly associated with quality of life.Conclusions The recall of NDE is not so rare in the ICU.

The objectives are to understand the role of AI and ML in healthcare, specifically in medical diagnosis, statistics, and precision medicine, and to explore their applications in predicting and managing sudden cardiac arrest outcomes, especially in the context of prehospital emergency care.Recent FindingsThe role of AI and ML in healthcare is expanding, with applications evident in medical diagnosis, statistics, and precision medicine. Deep learning is gaining prominence in radiomics and population health for disease risk prediction. There's a significant focus on the integration of AI and ML in prehospital emergency care, particularly in using ML algorithms for predicting outcomes in COVID-19 patients and enhancing the recognition of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Furthermore, the combination of AI with automated external defibrillators (AEDs) shows potential in better detecting shockable rhythms during cardiac arrest incidents.SummaryAI and ML hold immense promise in revolutionizing the prediction and management of sudden cardiac arrest, hinting at improved survival rates and more efficient healthcare interventions in the future. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) continues to be a major global cause of death, with survival rates remaining low despite advanced first responder systems.

At present, induction of local hypothermia, as opposed to general hypothermia, is more desired because of its ease of application and safety; fewer side effects and an absence of severe complications have been noted. Local hypothermia involves temperature reduction of a small and specific segment of the spinal cord. Our group has previously shown the neuroprotective effect of short-term, acute moderate general hypothermia through improvements in electrophysiological and motor behavioral assessments, as well as histological examination following contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We have also shown the benefit of using short-term local hypothermia versus short-term general hypothermia post-acute SCI. The overall neuroprotective benefit of hypothermia can be categorized into three main components: (1) induction modality, general versus local, (2) invasive, semi-invasive or noninvasive, and (3) duration of hypothermia induction. In this study, a series of experiments were designed to investigate the feasibility, long-term safety, as well as eventual complications and side effects of prolonged, semi-invasive, moderate local hypothermia (30 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C for 5 and 8 hours) in rats with uninjured spinal cord while maintaining their core temperature at 37 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Semaphorin 3F Promotes Transendothelial Migration of Leukocytes in the Inflammatory Response After Survived Cardiac Arrest,"Leukocyte transmigration through the blood vessel wall is a fundamental step of the inflammatory response and requires expression of adhesion molecule PECAM-1. Accumulating evidence implicates that semaphorin (Sema) 3F and its receptor neuropilin (NRP) 2 are central regulators in vascular biology. Herein, we assess the role of Sema3F in leukocyte migration in vitro and in vivo. To determine the impact of Sema3F on leukocyte recruitment in vivo, we used the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. After the induction of peritonitis, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected daily with recombinant Sema3F or solvent for 3days. Compared with solvent-treated controls, leukocyte count was increased in the peritoneal lavage of Sema3F-treated mice indicating that Sema3F promotes leukocyte extravasation into the peritoneal cavity. In line with this observation, stimulation of human endothelial cells with Sema3F enhanced the passage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) through the endothelial monolayer in the transwell migration assays. Conversely, silencing of endothelial Sema3F by siRNA transfection dampened diapedesis of PBMCs through the endothelium in vitro. xMechanistically, Sema3F induced upregulation of adhesion molecule PECAM-1 in endothelial cells and in murine heart tissue shown by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The inhibition of PECAM-1 by blocking antibody HEC7 blunted Sema3F-induced leukocyte migration in transwell assays. SiRNA-based NRP2 knockdown reduced PECAM-1 expression and migration of PBMCs in Sema3F-treated endothelial cells, indicating that PECAM-1 expression and leukocyte migration in response to Sema3F depend on endothelial NRP2. To assess the regulation of Sema3F in human inflammatory disease, we collected serum samples of patients from day 0 to day 7 after survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA, n=41). First, we demonstrated enhanced migration of PBMCs through endothelial cells exposed to the serum of patients after OHCA in comparison to the serum of patients with stable coronary artery disease or healthy volunteers. Remarkably, serum samples of OHCA patients contained significantly higher Sema3F protein levels compared with CAD patients (CAD, n=37) and healthy volunteers (n=11), suggesting a role of Sema3F in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response after OHCA. Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated serum Sema3F levels after ROSC are associated with decreased survival, myocardial dysfunction, and prolonged vasopressor therapy, clinical findings that determine the outcome of post-resuscitation period after OHCA. The present study provides novel evidence that endothelial Sema3F controls leukocyte recruitment through a NRP2/PECAM-1-dependent mechanism. Sema3F serum concentrations are elevated following successful resuscitation suggesting that Sema3F might be involved in the inflammatory response after survived OHCA. Targeting the Sema3F/NRP2/PECAM-1 pathway could provide a novel approach to abolish overwhelming inflammation after resuscitation.",INFLAMMATION,2019,"Reichert, S; Scheid, S; Roth, T; Herkel, M; Petrova, D; Linden, A; Weberbauer, M; Esser, J; Diehl, P; Grundmann, S; Busch, HJ; Fink, K; Bode, C; Moser, M; Helbing, T",10.1007/s10753-019-00985-4,,WOS:000475814700012,A

Then, event resuscitation variables such as time of collapse and CPR team arrival are entered from a ""code flow sheet"". Finally, outcome variables such as patient condition at different time points are recorded. The program then makes automatic calculations of average response times, survival rates and other important outcome measurements. Also using the Utstein style, we developed a database program based on MS Office Access(R). To promote free public access to these programs, we established at http://www.cproutcomes.org a website. These programs will help hospitals track, analyze, and present their CPR outcomes data.

However, their residents often have a combination of comorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty and mental-health conditions with poor access to healthcare to meet these needs. Integrated healthcare for older people is a key NHS priority in the Long-Term Plan and the Five-Year Forward View. We describe development and implementation of multi-disciplinary intervention to integrate healthcare and promote interprofessional education. Methods A multi-disciplinary residential home quality improvement project in two cycles by a team comprising senior and trainee general practitioners, trainees in geriatrics, psychiatry, pharmacist and residential home senior staff. The intervention was underpinned by the framework for enhanced health in care homes including Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and mental-health review. Each intervention session included an educational presentation by a team member consideration of each resident in a pre-evaluation multi-disciplinary discussion followed by a structured clinical assessment and discussion of proposed management. Results Three residential homes participated with a total 34 residents receiving intervention. In one residential home, there was a 75% reduction in admissions for those reviewed and a reduction in overall admission costs. Polypharmacy was reduced by an average of 2 medications per resident across the three sites. There was a 63% increase in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation decisions and 76% increase in advance care planning discussions.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Safety and efficacy of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of acute medium- or high-risk pulmonary embolism: a single-center retrospective cross-sectional study,"Background: Patients with acute and high-risk pulmonary embolism have a high mortality rate, and the optimal treatment for these patients has still not been fully established. Although anticoagulation therapy is currently the preferred treatment for pulmonary embolism, for some patients with intermediate- or high-risk pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation therapy alone has a higher probability of long-term pulmonary hypertension and also seriously worsens the quality of life of patients. This paper mainly reports the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with acute medium- or high-risk pulmonary embolism in Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province so as to provide some clinical basis for the treatment of such patients in the future. Methods: This study mainly collected the clinical data of 43 patients who were admitted to Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province from May 2018 to May 2023 due to acute medium-to-high-risk pulmonary embolism and received PMT treatment. Preoperative and postoperative blood tests, vital signs, and echocardiographic parameters were compared. The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications in follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months was also recorded. Mechanical treatment included thrombus fragmentation complemented with aspiration. Results: Among the 43 patients, 22 patients were treated with thrombus fragmentation coupled with a pigtail catheter and aspiration using a 6-F multipurpose angiographic (MPA) catheter, 11 were treated by AngioJet, and 10 were treated with an AcoStream catheter. Local thrombolysis treatment with small dose of urokinase was administered in some patients according to the patient's risk of bleeding. Among the patients, 41 patients received a successful operation, representing a surgical success rate of 95.3%. There was one patient with pulmonary infection who died after discharge. There were significant differences in vital signs between the 48-hour preoperative timepoint and the 48-hour postoperative timepoint including cardiac index, pulse, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation (P<0.001). The blood test indicators of carbon dioxide partial pressure and creatinine level did not show obvious abnormalities, but differences in hemoglobin, oxygen partial pressure, and lactate level were statistically significant. In terms of cardiac ultrasound, pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial diameter change were significantly different (P<0.001). There were seven cases of local hematoma at the puncture site, three cases of infection at the puncture site, and nine cases of transient cardiac arrest during the operation. All 41 patients were followed up: one patient died after being discharged due to aggravation of pulmonary infection during hospitalization, one patient died of intracerebral hemorrhage 9 months after the operation, one patient developed recurrent pulmonary embolism, and five patients had no obvious improvement in chest tightness. Conclusions: PMT can be used as a safe and effective treatment option for acute medium-to-high-risk pulmonary embolism.",JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE,2024,"Li, F; Su, ZX; Fu, CT; Wang, Q; Wang, X; Zhang, JC; Yanagiya, M; Zhao, WJ",10.21037/jtd-24-1690,,WOS:001388012700015,A

Differently sized cell aggregates were created on the surface of indium tin oxide coated microelectrodes, their heights and shapes controlled by the strength of the induced electric field and the shape of the microelectrodes. Both two-dimensional (ring-patterned) and three-dimensional cell aggregates were produced. The cell aggregates were maintained under sterile conditions at 37 degrees C for up to 14 days by continuously flushing Sauton's medium through the chamber. Resuscitation of dormant M. smegmatis was evaluated by the production of the fluorescent dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyltetrazolium chloride. The results confirm that the resuscitation of dormant M. smegmatis is triggered by the accumulation of a resuscitation promoting factor inside the aggregates by diffusion limitation.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Oxygen targets in critically ill patients: from pathophysiology to population enrichment strategies,"Oxygen supplementation is widely used to enhance oxygen delivery and to treat or prevent hypoxia; however, it requires careful management to avoid the harmful effects of excessive oxygen exposure. Both hyperoxia (inspiratory oxygen fraction exceeding 0.21) and hyperoxemia (arterial oxygen tension oxygen partial pressure [PaO2] > 100 mmHg) can contribute to lung injury, promote systemic vasoconstriction, and increase the production of reactive oxygen species, which can impair macromolecular and cellular functions. Conversely, in certain situations, hyperoxemia may provide benefits, such as hemodynamic stabilization in hyperdynamic shock, immunomodulation, and bactericidal effects. The literature presents conflicting evidence regarding the impact of different oxygen targets (i.e., PaO2 and/or peripheral saturation of oxygen [SpO(2)]) on both short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute critical conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, cardiac arrest, and acute central nervous system injuries. These discrepancies may stem from the small differences between the oxygenation targets used in randomized trials, the physiological limitations of PaO2 and SpO(2) targets, which reflect blood oxygen content rather than oxygen delivery, the lack of measurements of microvascular function or oxygen delivery, and the heterogeneity in treatment response. Furthermore, advanced analytical methods (e.g., machine learning) are emerging as promising tools to implement population enrichment strategies. By refining patient sub-group identification, these approaches can significantly optimize precision medicine, enabling more personalized oxygen therapy tailored to individual patient characteristics.",MEDICAL GAS RESEARCH,2025,"Ripa, C; Munshi, L; Kuebler, WM; Magliocca, A; Taccone, FS; Ware, LB; Citerio, G; Laffey, JG; Rezoagli, E",10.4103/mgr.MEDGASRES-D-24-00120,,WOS:001470962900011,A

This study was designed to evaluate the impact of melatonin on postresuscitation neurological outcomes and to explore the underlying mechanism. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham group, CPR group, melatonin pretreatment group (Pre-M) and posttreatment group (Post-M). For the last 2 groups, daily melatonin gavage was performed for 12 consecutive days before or 24 hours after rat survival from CA/CPR. No statistical differences were observed in heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) at baseline and after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) among groups. However, melatonin pretreatment or posttreatment significantly improved neurological deficit score and memory and spatial learning ability after CA/CPR. Further studies demonstrated that the complex I- and complex-II supported mitochondrial respiration were greatly increased under melatonin treatment. In addition, melatonin treatment preserved the mitochondrialbinding hexokinase II (HKII) and ATP levels and suppressed the upregulated protein lysine acetylation in hippocampus after CA/CPR. In conclusion, using a rat asphyxial CA model we have demonstrated that treatment with melatonin either before or after CA/CPR provides a promising neuroprotective effect, and this protection was mediated by increasing mitochondrial HKII expression, suppressing protein acetylation and improving mitochondrial function in hippocampus.",PLOS ONE,2018,"Yang, LH; Wang, J; Deng, Y; Gong, CS; Li, Q; Chen, Q; Li, H; Jiang, CL; Zhou, RH; Hai, KR; Wu, W; Li, T",10.1371/journal.pone.0207098,,WOS:000449374000045,A

A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and analytical study of the survey type was developed with a sample of 1215 students enrolled in 10th-grade secondary education in 2019-2020 in Portugal. The results point to a fragile appropriation of theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of BLS. Self-declared competences tend to rank below the theoretical knowledge manifested. Motivation to intervene is high: students are sensitive to the topic and willing to learn and highlight the importance and social relevance of the topic.

Clinical data and blood samples were obtained from emergency medical services (EMS) and the intensive care department. A 31-year-old man experienced a witnessed hypothermic cardiac arrest with a core temperature of 26 degrees C (78.8 degrees F) during a summer thunderstorm; he received mechanical CPR for 3 hours and 42 minutes, followed by 5 hours of extracorporeal life support. The use of a standard operating procedure that integrates a technical mountain rescue performed by EMS, optimizes prolonged CPR to the hub hospital, and enables prompt placement of extracorporeal life support is described and discussed. Three months postaccident, the patient had recovered completely (Cerebral Performance Category score of 1) and resumed normal daily life. Neurologically intact survival from hypothermic cardiac arrest is common, suggesting that aggressive resuscitation measures are warranted.

The operation required muscle relaxation, for which we used rocuronium. Following completion of surgery, 180 mg sugammadex was administered intravenously. Shortly afterwards, the patient became severely bradycardic with hypotension, refractory to treatment with ephedrine. This progressed to a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest. After 4 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there was return of spontaneous circulation and, following a period of haemodynamic stability in which general anaesthesia was maintained, the patient emerged from anaesthesia without incident. He remained haemodynamically stable until discharge. Post-resuscitation investigations including the serum tryptase level were unremarkable except for a mild respiratory acidosis and slightly elevated D-dimers. Sugammadex-induced bradycardia has previously been described, but its mechanism remains unknown. We believe that sugammadex was the cause of cardiac arrest in this case because of the timing and sequence of events, the evolution to pulseless electric activity and the relatively uneventful post-arrest clinical course.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,An Enhanced Adaptive Filtering Method for Suppressing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Artifact,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be interrupted for reliable rhythm analysis in current automatic external defibrillators because of artifacts produced by chest compressions. However, interruptions in CPR adversely affect the restoration of spontaneous circulation and survival. Suppressing CPR artifacts by digital signal processing techniques is a promising method to enable rhythm analysis during chest compressions, which would eliminate CPR interruptions for rhythm analysis. Although numerous methods have been developed to suppress CPR artifacts, the accuracy of rhythm analysis is still inadequate due to the residual artifact components in the filtered signal. This study proposes an enhanced adaptive filtering method to suppress CPR artifacts. A total of 183 shockable and 453 nonshockable segments of ECG signal, together with CPR-related reference signal, were extracted from 233 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients. The method was optimized on a training set with 85 shockable and 211 nonshockable segments, and evaluated on a testing set with 98 shockable and 242 nonshockable segments. Compared with artifact corrupted ECG signals, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increased from -9.8 +/- 12.5 to 11.2 +/- 11.8 dB, and the accuracy was improved from 74.1% to 92.0% after filtering with the proposed method. Compared with the traditional adaptive filter, the SNR was improved by 1.7 dB and the accuracy was improved by 5.6 points. These results indicated that the proposed method could effectively suppress the chest compression related artifacts and improve the accuracy of rhythm analysis during uninterrupted CPR.",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,2017,"Gong, YS; Gao, P; Wei, L; Dai, CX; Zhang, L; Li, YQ",10.1109/TBME.2016.2564642,,WOS:000394686900022,A

Despite an organized approach to sudden cardiac arrest, survival in patients receiving CPR is in the range of 5-15%. The new AHA guidelines recommend standard manual CPR performed at a rate of 80-100 compressions/min and organized algorithms of advanced cardiac life support. These guidelines stress widespread community training and rapid response in the following sequence: (1) recognition of early warning signs, (2) activation of the emergency medical system (EMS), (3) basic CPR, (4) early defibrillation, (5) intubation, acid (6) intravenous medication. Several new recommendations pertain specifically to in-hospital care and are, therefore, particularly relevant to physician management of cardiac arrest. The best predictor of survival in patients requiring circulatory support after cardiac arrest is attainable coronary and cerebral perfusion. Unfortunately the minimal levels of end-organ perfusion required to sustain life are often difficult or impossible to achieve with standard manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation and several new techniques have therefore been introduced. The most promising of these techniques are (1) interposed abdominal compression, (2) pneumatic vest, and (3) active compression-decompression resuscitation. Each of these techniques offers unique advantages when compared with standard manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The 1992 National Conference recommendations provide a rational framework for the resuscitation of cardiac arrest victims. New methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are now available and investigation into these methods continues. In the future, these modalities may be incorporated in newer guidelines and be available on a widespread basis to supplement our current approach to cardiac arrest.",CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY,1995,"TUCKER, KJ; LARSON, JL; IDRIS, A; CURTIS, AB",10.1002/clc.4960180904,,WOS:A1995RR27300003,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Relational Family Therapy in the Treatment of Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survivors and their Relatives,"Sudden cardiac arrest is the most common single cause of death in the contemporary world, but the proportion of survivors is increasing thanks to modern intensive methods of hospital treatment. However, data show that survivors experience high rates of neurological and cognitive deficits and poorer emotional well-being, which is a major challenge in treating these individuals and encouraging their integration in everyday life. These issues range from a number of emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, to lower levels of participation in social life and a low rate of return to their workplace. The need for security and support increases because of the feelings of insecurity, vulnerability and fear of the recurrence of symptoms. Relatives/caregivers who report emotional problems and a higher level of post-traumatic stress are physically and mentally burdened, too. Hence, sudden cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event which is traumatic for survivors and their close relatives. It triggers strong emotional responses that are characteristic of all types of trauma (reliving the trauma, avoidance, negative thoughts and mood, increased agitation). People who have survived trauma thus suffer long-term effects, which are reflected in various dysfunctional behaviours and activities due to inadequate regulation of affective states. Because of these issues, there is a need for effective interventions that can psychologically help patients and relatives after surviving sudden cardiac arrest. In this paper, we will present the model of Relational Family Therapy, which can enable survivors and their relatives to appropriately emotionally-affectively process this experience and thus more appropriately integrate into a new way of life. With the qualitative research method of task analysis, we will show the process of change, which is based on the establishment of a new regulation of affect and allows in-depth processing of difficult emotional states after this event.",PERSON AND THE CHALLENGES-THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY EDUCATION CANON LAW AND SOCIAL STUDIES INSPIRED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II,2021,"Kosir, M; Simonic, B; Gostecnik, C; Noc, M; Kocjancic, ST; Jazbec, A; Dovecar, K; Kotnik, A; Kotnik, P; Kropivnik, S; Smonkar, H; Vacovnik, J; Vehovar, K; Pate, T",10.15633/pch.3894,,WOS:000631531600013,A

This issue has implications for doctrine, policy, training and post-CPR counselling of both resuscitator and victim. Post-salvage neurological syndromes in surviving victims include amnesia, personality change, cognitive loss, depression, Parkinsonian syndromes, decorticate and decerebrate states and permanent brain damage with vegetative existence. Children who are salvaged by CPR rarely have pre-existing co-morbidities: but 75% of adults have pre-existing cardiac disease, cancer or diabetes. Such, of course, continue after a successful resuscitation. In the case of children who are resuscitated from acute hypoxic insults, the quality of life is generally good and, in the specific instance of survivors from near-drowning, some 95% will lead lives relatively unmodified. Although successful CPR resuscitation rates remain low in adults, the quality of life of those who leave hospital remains generally high. CPR involves two feature subjects, the resuscitator and the victim. Just as for the victim, so too the resuscitator's life is modified by CPR and its aftermath, whether immediate salvage has been achieved or not. This review addresses these issues, as a successful CPR (dramatic as it is) is not a conclusion but the beginning of a new phase of life for both resuscitator and victim.

Faced with various stress factors, degraders with dormancy ability are more likely to survive and exhibit degradation activity. In this study, a hydrocarbonoclastic and halotolerant strain, Gordonia polyisoprenivorans ZM27, was isolated via stimulation with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf). Long-term exposure to dual stresses of 10% NaCl and starvation induced ZM27 to enter a viable but nonculturable (VBNC)-like state, and ZM27 cells could be resuscitated upon Rpf stimulation. Notable changes in both morphological and physiological characteristics between VBNC-like ZM27 cells and resuscitated cells confirmed the response to Rpf and their robust resistance against harsh environments. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis indicated ZM27 could be a generalist degrader with dormancy ability. Subsequently, VBNC-like ZM27 was applied in a soil microcosm experiment to investigate the practical application potential under harsh conditions. VBNC-like ZM27 combined with Rpf stimulation exhibited the most effective biodegradation performance, and the initial nhexadecane content (1000 mg kg(-1)) decreased by 63.29% after 14-day incubation. Based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis, Gordonia exhibited a positive response to Rpf stimulation. The relative abundance of genus Gordonia was negatively correlated with that of Alcanivorax, a genus of obligate hydrocarbon degrader with the greatest abundance during soil incubation. Based on the degradation profile and community analysis, generalist Gordonia may be more efficient in hydrocarbon degradation than specialist Alcanivorax under harsh conditions. The characteristics of ZM27, including its sustainable culturability under long-term stress, response to Rpf and robust performance in soil microcosms, are valuable for the remediation of petroleum pollution under stressful conditions.

Survival depends on prompt identification of cardiac arrest and on the quality and timing of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. For laypeople, there has been a growing interest on hands-only CPR, meaning continuous chest compression without interruption to perform ventilations. It has been demonstrated that intentional interruptions in hands-only CPR can increase its quality. The aim of this randomised trial is to compare three CPR protocols performed with different intentional interruptions with hands-only CPR.",BMJ OPEN,2018,"Baldi, E; Contri, E; Burkart, R; Borrelli, P; Ferraro, OE; Tonani, M; Cutuli, A; Bertaia, D; Iozzo, P; Tinguely, C; Lopez, D; Boldarin, S; Deiuri, C; Dénéréaz, S; Dénéréaz, Y; Terrapon, M; Tami, C; Cereda, C; Somaschini, A; Cornara, S; Cortegiani, A",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019723,,WOS:000435176700087,A

We assessed the role of endogenous versus exogenous vasopressin in a porcine open chest CPR model. Seven minutes before induction of cardiac arrest, seven pigs received 10 mug/kg of a selective vasopressin V(1)-receptor-antagonist (Blocked Vasopressin group); another 12 pigs in two groups received saline administration only. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 3 min of basic life support CPR, six animals received 0.8 U/kg vasopressin (Exogenous Vasopressin group), whereas the blocked vasopressin group (n = 7), and the remaining six animals received saline placebo only (Endogenous Vasopressin group). Defibrillation was attempted after 14 min of CPR. During basic life support CPR, left ventricular myocardial blood flow was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the Blocked Vasopressin group compared with the Exogenous Vasopressin group and Endogenous Vasopressin group (42 +/- 5 compared with 64 +/- 6 and 66 +/- 6 mL . min(-1) 100g(-1)). Left ventricular myocardial blood flow was significantly decreased in the Blocked Vasopressin group versus Exogenous Vasopressin group versus Endogenous Vasopressin group 90 s and 5 min after drug administration, respectively (38 +/- 4 and 27 +/- 3 vs 145 +/- 32 and 110 +/- 12 vs 62 +/- 4 and 56 +/- 6 mL . min(-1) 100g(-1), respectively). None of seven Blocked Vasopressin animals, six of six Exogenous Vasopressin pigs, and six of six Endogenous Vasopressin swine had return of spontaneous circulation after 14 min of cardiac arrest including 10 min of CPR (P < 0.05). In conclusion, pigs with blocked endogenous vasopressin had poor coronary perfusion pressure and left ventricular myocardial blood flow during open chest CPR, and could not be successfully resuscitated. All pigs with effective endogenous vasopressin or pigs with effective endogenous vasopressin and additional exogenous vasopressin had good left ventricular myocardial blood flow during experimental CPR, and survived the l-h postresuscitation phase. We conclude that endogenous vasopressin is an adjunct vasopressor to epinephrine and may serve as a back-up regulator to maintain cardiocirculatory homeostasis.",ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,2001,"Krismer, AC; Lindner, KH; Wenzel, V; Mayr, VD; Voelckel, WG; Lurie, KG; Strohmenger, HU",,,WOS:000168839100029,A

A potent inhibitor of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors, xenon has a well-documented ameliorating effect on excitotoxic neuronal injury in numerous cellular and animal models of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The most important determinant of overall survival and morbidity in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is the severity of neurological injury. The only approved neuroprotective strategy in this setting is mild therapeutic hypothermia, which has demonstrated significant, albeit modest, improvements in mortality. The combination therapy of therapeutic hypothermia and xenon in porcine models of cardiac arrest has shown a greater improvement in functional outcomes than either intervention alone, thereby prompting the study of combination therapy in randomized clinical trials. The treatment of postarrest patients with xenon and mild hypothermia is safe and demonstrates favorable cardiovascular features, including a reduced heart rate, a reduction in troponin elevations, and a decreased need for vasopressors. Combination therapy is superior in protecting white matter integrity than hypothermia alone, but did not significantly impact neurological outcomes at 6-month follow-up. Despite an abundance of preclinical evidence supporting xenon's neuroprotective properties, its translational potential in postcardiac arrest care is indeterminate due to a lack of adequately-powered studies.",CARDIOLOGY IN REVIEW,2018,"Roostan, M; Frishman, WH",10.1097/CRD.0000000000000198,,WOS:000434990400007,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,HEMODYNAMIC MONITORING DURING CPR,"Real-time hemodynamic monitoring provides useful information that can be used to assess and optimize mechanical and pharmacological interventions during CPR. The standard algorithms should always be the initial approach to resuscitation, because they offer a rapid, logical, coordinated series of treatments with proven success. Pressure and flow measurements during conventional, closed-chest CPR in humans indicate that the technique typically produces a hemodynamic state resembling profound cardiogenic shock, with a low systemic arterial pressure, markedly reduced cardiac output, and high intravascular filling pressures. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring provides useful, noninvasive information during clinical resuscitation. A low end-tidal carbon dioxide value during resuscitation should alert the rescuers that something is wrong with ventilation, perfusion, and/or carbon dioxide production and should prompt a search for correctable causes. If one or more hemodynamic parameters are being monitored at the time the patient develops cardiac arrest (eg, an intensive care unit patient who has an arterial line and a pulmonary artery catheter in place), it is appropriate for the resuscitation team to pay attention to the data that are generated during the resuscitation, particularly if the initial algorithm approach is not successful. For patients who are not being monitored at the time of their arrest, end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements provide noninvasive, semiquantitative information that can help the team detect and troubleshoot problems during resuscitation. Further research and better, more affordable technologies are needed to provide in- and out-of-hospital resuscitation teams feedback on the hemodynamic effectiveness of their resuscitative efforts.",ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,1993,"ORNATO, JP",10.1016/S0196-0644(05)80458-5,,WOS:A1993KM72900005,A

The P-COSCA Steering Committee generated a list of potential survival, life impact, and economic impact outcomes and assessment time points that were prioritized by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare providers, researchers, and parents/caregivers of children who survived cardiac arrest. Then expert panel discussions achieved consensus on the core outcomes, the methods to measure those core outcomes, and the timing of the measurements. The P-COSCA includes assessment of survival, brain function, cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills. Survival and brain function are assessed at discharge or 30 days (or both if possible) and between 6 and 12 months after arrest. Cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills are assessed between 6 and 12 months after cardiac arrest.

Methods Danish nationwide registries were used to identify patients with first-time MI by CS status between 2005 and 2015, aged 18-63 years, working before hospitalization and discharged alive. Multiple logistic regression models were used to compare groups. Results We identified 19 799 patients with MI of whom 653 had CS (3%). The median age was similar for patients with and without CS (53 years, interquartile range 47-58). One-year outcomes in patients with and without CS were as follows: 52% vs. 83% returned to work, 41% vs. 16% did not and 6% vs. 1% died.

We review the data on risk stratification. A history of CA or malignant syncope is a strong predictor of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), whereas the prognostic value of a history of familial sudden death and the presence of a SCN5A mutation are less well defined. On the electrocardiogram, the presence of spontaneous type I electrocardiogram increases the risk for VF in all studies, whereas the presence of fragmented QRS complexes and early repolarization correlates with increased risk in several studies.

There is increasing public interest in and uptake of public access defibrillation programs in communities and schools. Our purpose was to review recent data on sudden cardiac arrest in children and its outcome to identify ways to improve the current low survival rate of youth who experience sudden cardiac arrest.Recent findingsIncreases in bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Norway to 73% have occurred alongside increasing survival from sudden cardiac arrest from shockable rhythms to 52%. Studies in Denmark and the US show that survival of 69-74% is possible when a shockable rhythm is present and an automated external defibrillator is immediately applied. Up to 70-80% of US schools have automated external defibrillators, but not all have effective emergency action plans to maximize the impact of the presence of the AED.SummaryStudies suggest that education to increase bystander CPR and implementation of school AEDs and other public access defibrillation programs improve the survival of youth experiencing sudden cardiac arrest to 74% when optimal programs are in place. Methods to enhance such programs are presented.

Secondary, the influence of a successful ECV on the neuropsychological function and the association with SctO(2)was assessed as well. SctO(2)was measured continuously during elective ECV using near-infrared spectroscopy. Measurements started before induction of sedation and ended 15 min after awakening. A second measurement took place 4 to 6 weeks after ECV. To assess neuropsychological functioning, patients performed standardized neuropsychological tests before ECV and at follow-up and were compared to healthy volunteers as control group. SctO(2)was measured in 60 patients during elective ECV. ECV was successful in 50 AF patients, while in ten patients sinus rhythm was not obtained. SctO(2)increased immediately after successful ECV in 50 patients (1% (- 5 to 4); p = 0.031), but not after unsuccessful ECV in 10 patients (- 1% (- 5;3); p = 0.481). This SctO(2)change was positively correlated with the instant change in blood pressure (R-2 = 0.391; p = 0.004). At follow-up, SctO(2)values were no longer increased. Nevertheless, successful ECV improved the patient's quality of life but did not influence neuropsychological functioning at follow-up.

Among its potential complications, VA-ECMO may adversely affect lung function through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction. This review presents the mechanisms of lung damage and dysfunction under VA-ECMO and discusses potential strategies to prevent and treat such alterations.",CRITICAL CARE,2020,"Roumy, A; Liaudet, L; Rusca, M; Marcucci, C; Kirsch, M",10.1186/s13054-020-02937-z,,WOS:000534328300001,A

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising support, its diagnostic performance in this critical setting remains uncertain. Methods: This single-centre study included 97 adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA). Post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) ECG were evaluated by four methods: human experts (HE), a validated deep neural network [Queen of Hearts (QoH)], and two large language model (LLM)-based AI Chatbots (AI-CB)-ChatGPT and EKG Analyst. Primary outcome was AUROC for presence and probability of OMI and acute coronary occlusion (ACO), determined by coronary angiography. Results: For ACO (TIMI 0), QoH yielded highest AUROC (0.846 [0.752-0.939]), followed by HE (0.735 [0.622-0.848]). Both AI-CB resulted in lowest AUROC (ChatGPT: 0.456 [0.319-0.592]; EKG Analyst: 0.474 [0.346-0.603]). For OMI (TIMI 0-2 or TIMI 3 + peak-troponin), QoH again achieved highest AUROC (0.745 [0.647-0.843]), followed by HE (0.635 [0.515-0.755]), AI-CB were lowest again (ChatGPT: 0.495 [0.376-0.614]; EKG Analyst: 0.626 [0.508-0.743]). Threshold-dependent performance metrics revealed high sensitivity (ACO: 100 %; OMI: 98.36 %) for both AI-CB, at the cost of minimal specificity. QoH and HE showed more even distributions of sensitivity/specificity.

This scoping review broadly investigates the feasibility and impact of dronedelivered AEDs for OHCA response. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception to August 6, 2024, with eligibility broadly including empirical data. The charting process involved iterative data extraction for thematic analysis. Results: We identified 306 titles and, after duplicate removal, title/abstract screening, and full text review, included 39 studies. These were divided into three categories: 1) Real-world observational studies (n = 3), 2) Test flights/simulation studies and qualitative analyses (n = 15), and 3) Computer/prediction models (n = 21). Real-world studies demonstrated the feasibility of drone AED delivery, with a time advantage of 01:52 - 03:14 min over ambulances observed in 64-67 % of cases. Test flight/simulation and qualitative studies consistently reported feasibility and positive bystander experiences. Computer/prediction models exhibited considerable heterogeneity, yet all indicated significant time savings for AED delivery compared to traditional EMS methods. Moreover, seven studies estimated improved survival rates, with five assessing cost-effectiveness and favouring drone systems. Regional factors such as EMS response times, volunteer responder programmes, terrain, weather, and budget constraints influenced the system's effectiveness. Conclusion: Across all categories, studies confirmed the feasibility of drone-delivered AED systems, with significant potential for reducing time to AED arrival compared to EMS arrival.

Additionally, the adverse effects of extreme temperatures on health have become more important under climate change; however, few studies have investigated the relationship between temperature and OHCA. In this study, we examined the association between temperature and OHCA and its underlying risk factors. We conducted a two-stage time-series analysis using a Poisson regression model with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) and meta-analysis, based on a nationwide dataset from South Korea (2008-2018). We found that 17.4% of excess OHCA was attributed to cold, while 0.9% was attributed to heat. Based on central estimates, excess OHCA attributed to cold were more prominent in the population with hypertension comorbidity (31.0%) than the populations with diabetes (24.3%) and heart disease (17.4%). Excess OHCA attributed to heat were larger in the populations with diabetes (2.7%) and heart disease comorbidity (2.7%) than the population with hypertension (1.2%) based on central estimates. Furthermore, the time-varying excess OHCA attributed to cold have decreased over time, and although those of heat did not show a certain pattern during the study period, there was a weak increasing tendency since 2011. In conclusion, we found that OHCAs were associated with temperature, and cold temperatures showed a greater impact than that of hot temperatures. The effects of cold and hot temperatures on OHCA were more evident in the populations with hypertension, diabetes, and heart diseases, compared to the general population. In addition, the impacts of heat on OHCA increased in recent years, while those of cold temperatures decreased.

Methods This retrospective health records review included patients aged 18-75 years old presenting to our academic teaching hospital campuses with refractory nontraumatic out-of-hospital or in-emergency department (ED) cardiac arrest over a 2-year period. Based on a scoping review of the literature, both ""liberal"" and ""restrictive"" ECPR criteria were defined and applied to our cohort. Results A total of 179 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 years, and patients were predominantly male (72.6%). The initial rhythm was ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in 49.2%. The majority of arrests were witnessed (69.3%), with immediate bystander CPR performed on 53.1% and an additional 12% receiving CPR within 10 minutes of collapse. Median prehospital time was 40 minutes (interquartile range, 31-53.3). Two-thirds of patients (65.9%) were identified as having a reversible cause of arrest and favorable premorbid status was identified in nearly three quarters (74.3%). Our two sets of ECPR inclusion criteria revealed that 33 and 5 patients (liberal and restrictive criteria, respectively), would have been candidates for ECPR.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Headache, cardiac arrest, and intracranial hemorrhage","Headache is one of the most common manifestations of non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, which is an uncommon, but not rare, cause of cardiac arrest in adults. History of a sudden headache preceding collapse may be a helpful clue to estimate the cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Medical records of witnessed OHCA patients were reviewed to identify those who complained of a sudden headache preceding collapse, and the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage among them as well as their clinical characteristics was investigated retrospectively. During the 12-month period, 124 patients who sustained a witnessed OHCA were treated. Among them, 74 (60%) collapsed without any pain complaint, and only 6 (5%) complained of a sudden headache preceding collapse. All of the six patients were resuscitated: four had a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), while the other two had a massive cerebellar hemorrhage. By contrast, 39 of the 74 patients who collapsed without any pain were resuscitated. Among them, another six patients were found to harbor an SAH. Thus, a total of 12 among the 124 witnessed OHCA (10%) sustained a fatal intracranial hemorrhage. While OHCA patients who collapse complaining of a sudden headache are uncommonly seen in the emergency room, they have a high likelihood of harboring a severe intracranial hemorrhage. It should also be reminded that approximately half of patients whose cardiac arrest is due to an intracranial hemorrhage may collapse without complaining of a headache. The prognosis of those with cerebral origin of OHCA is invariably poor, although they may relatively easily be resuscitated temporarily.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in modulating post-ischemic inflammation and promoting neuroprotection. In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo expansion of Tregs using the interleukin-2/interleukin-2 antibody (IL-2/IL-2Ab) complex significantly increased Treg numbers in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. Mice pretreated with the IL-2/IL-2Ab complex before cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) exhibited improved neurological recovery, reduced ischemic brain injury, and enhanced survival rates.

Common features of these cases are occurrence in young men, within a few weeks after vaccination, in patients with no structural heart diseases. Cases of unexplained nocturnal death showed fibrotic or hypertrophied myocardium, and one case of OHCA presented ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by a prominent J wave on an automated external defibrillator and histopathologic findings compatible with myocarditis. Both myocarditis and J waves are prevalent in young men, and these cases imply that myocarditis augments J waves, which trigger VFs, and primary electrical disorders are a leading cause of death.

Methods and results A retrospective inquiry of the ECMO registry at the University Hospital of North Norway identified 74 ECMO-treated patients (mean age 49 years, 65% males). Acute cardiac failure was the dominant indication (58%), and venoarterial ECMO was the dominant mode of treatment (87%). Mortality for discharged patients was recorded on 20 September 2016. Thirty (41%) survivors were identified. Twenty-three survivors were eligible for the survey and received a set of questionnaires at home. The main outcome measure was HRQL as measured with the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36) (RAND Short Form-36 v1.2). Other questionnaires covered demographic information, problems with functioning in usual daily activities (such as hobbies, household chores, family, or work), employment status, and psychological distress. The survey was completed by 20 (87%) survivors (mean age = 49 years, 12 men). Indications for ECMO treatment (VA = 90%) had been respiratory failure (25%), cardiac failure (60%), and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (15%). The average time since ECMO treatment was 6.5 years. Seventy-five percent reported mental HRQL (SF-36 Mental Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 5) or physical HRQL (SF-36 Physical Component Summary, mean = 43, SD = 4.5) within the normal range (T = 50 +/- 10) in comparison with age-matched population data from national norms. Half of the responders reported problems on the SF-36 subscales general health and role physical. Seventy percent reported problems on the SF-36 subscale role emotional. All but one responder lived independently without any organized care, and 90% reported no problems related to basic self-care. Half of those in working age had returned to work after ECMO treatment. Forty percent of the responders reported some degree of restrictions in usual daily activities, problems with mobility (35%), anxiety/depression (35%), or pain/discomfort (55%). Significant univariate associations were observed for poorer HRQL and higher reports of psychological distress, pain, and experiencing restrictions in usual everyday activities. Improved HRQL was significantly related to an extended time since ECMO treatment. Conclusions Our survey indicates an overall positive long-term HRQL outcome for our ECMO survivors. A subset reported problems with functioning and HRQL.

In 2018, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation sponsored the COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set After Cardiac Arrest) to improve consistency in reported outcomes of clinical trials of adult cardiac arrest survivors and supported this PCOSCA initiative (Pediatric COSCA). The P-COSCA Steering Committee generated a list of potential survival, life impact, and economic impact outcomes and assessment time points that were prioritized by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare providers, researchers, and parents/caregivers of children who survived cardiac arrest. Then expert panel discussions achieved consensus on the core outcomes, the methods to measure those core outcomes, and the timing of the measurements. The P-COSCA includes assessment of survival, brain function, cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills. Survival and brain function are assessed at discharge or 30 days (or both if possible) and between 6 and 12 months after arrest. Cognitive function, physical function, and basic daily life skills are assessed between 6 and 12 months after cardiac arrest. Because many children have prearrest comorbidities, the P-COSCA also includes documentation of baseline (ie, prearrest) brain function and calculation of changes after cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Total liquid ventilation in a porcine model of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome using a new generation of liquid ventilator,"Background Total liquid ventilation (TLV) has been experimentally proposed as an alternative treatment for the management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Recent technological advances have led to the evaluation of a TLV prototype in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest. Here, our goal was to determine whether a derived version of this prototype, so-called LV4B (liquid ventilation for breathing), could be used for normothermic TLV in a swine model of severe ARDS. Methods Swine were anesthetized and instrumented for respiratory and hemodynamic evaluation. ARDS was induced by one or two administrations of oleic acid (0.1 mg/kg), until reaching a PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100 mmHg. After ARDS induction, animals were allocated to undergo 60 min of either gas ventilation continuation (Control group) or TLV using a prototype that continuously controls respiratory rate (RR), liquid tidal volume (LqVt) and end-expiratory liquid volume (EELqV, respectively). Perfluorooctyl bromide was used as breathable liquid. Results After ARDS induction and group allocation, 2/5 animals (40%) survived in the Control groups versus 5/5 in the TLV group (100%). In the Control group, premature deaths were related to sustained hypoxemia (PaO2 < 50 mmHg) with hemodynamic failure. Surviving animals presented a trend toward better oxygenation in TLV versus Control, without achieving statistical significance due to the low number of survivors in the Control group. PaCO2, blood pH, lactate levels, or pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics were not different between groups in survivors. In the TLV group, the average LqVt, EELqV, and respiratory rate (RR) were 12.6 +/- 0.4 mL/kg, 22.9 +/- 2.9 mL/kg, and 5.3 +/- 0.5 breath/min (mean +/- SEM) at the end of the procedure, respectively. In all animals, pulmonary debris were washed out from the lung and collected by the TLV device throughout the procedure. After necropsy, histopathological examination demonstrated a significantly lower extent of inflammatory and congestion lesions in TLV versus Control. Conclusions TLV with a liquid ventilator controlling EELqV, RR and LqVt is feasible and safe in large animals in a severe model of ARDS.

Prompt bystander action can more than double survival odds. OHCA response training is primarily pursued due to work-related mandates, with few programs targeting communities with lower training levels. The aim of this research was to describe the development process of a targeted multicomponent intervention package designed to enhance confidence and training among laypeople in responding to an OHCA. MethodsAn iterative, three-phase program development process was employed using a mixed methods approach. The initial phase involved establishment of a multidisciplinary panel that informed decisions on key messages, program content, format, and delivery modes. These decisions were based on scientific evidence and guided by behavioural theories. The second phase comprised the development of the intervention package, identifying existing information and developing new material to fill identified gaps. The third phase involved refining and finalising the material via feedback from panel members, stakeholders, and community members. ResultsThrough this approach, we collaboratively developed a comprehensive evidence-based education and training package consisting of a digital intervention supplemented with free access to in-person education and training. The package was designed to teach community members the specific steps in recognising and responding to a cardiac arrest, while addressing commonly known barriers and fears related to bystander response. The tailored program and delivery format addressed the needs of individuals of diverse ages, cultural backgrounds, and varied training needs and preferences. ConclusionThe study highlights the importance of community engagement in intervention development and demonstrates the need of evidence-based and collaborative approaches in creating a comprehensive, localised, relatively low-cost intervention package to improve bystander response to OHCA.",PLOS ONE,2022,"Munot, S; Bray, J; Bauman, A; Rugel, EJ; Giordan, LB; Marschner, S; Chow, CK; Redfern, J",10.1371/journal.pone.0273028,,WOS:000860991100002,A

Since the introduction of cyclosporine (CyA) in 1979, a regimen consisting of CyA, azathioprine, and steroids has been shown to improve long-term survival of clinical transplants. In Japan, the first simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation was performed, in 1984, using organs from a brain-dead donor. This procedure was followed by 14 pancreas transplantations from cardiac arrest donors. All cases utilized a CyA-based regimen with antilymphocyte globulin or OKT3 induction. Six of the 15 recipients required less insulin postoperatively. Under a new transplant law enforced in 1997, 10 pancreas/pancreas- kidney transplantations were performed in patients diagnosed with end-stage renal failure due to diabetes mellitus type 1. In 1 patient, the graft failed due to venous thrombosis, but the other 9 recipients achieved an increased quality of life without the need for insulin or for dialysis. Pancreas transplantation represents an effective treatment worldwide and in Japan, due to the availability of CyA or tacrolimus in combination with other agents such as antilymphocyte globulin, OKT3, or mycophenolate mofetil.

The goal of this study was to examine the characteristics, trends, and outcomes of HF hospitalizations complicated by in-hospital CA. We used the National Inpatient Sample to identify all pri-mary HF admissions from 2016 to 2019. Cohorts were built based on the presence of a codiagnosis of CA. Diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Associations with CA were then analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. We identified a total of 4,905,564 HF admissions, 56,170 (1.1%) of which had CA. Hospitalizations complicated by CA were significantly more likely to be male, to have coronary artery disease, renal disease, and less likely to be White (p <0.001, all). Age <65 (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, p <0.001), renal disease (OR 2.41, p <0.001), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.26, p <0.001) had higher odds of CA while female gender (OR 0.84, confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 0.86, p <0.001) or HFpEF (OR 0.49, CI 0.48 to 0.50, p <0.001) had lower odds of CA. Patients with CA had higher inpatient mortality (CA 54.2% vs no CA 2.1%, p <0.001), which persisted after multivari-ate adjustment (OR 64.8, CI 63.5 to 66.0, p <0.001).

However, knowledge on its association with self -reported health in CA survivors is still incomplete. Aim : To examine the associations between initial rhythm and self -reported health in CA survivors. Methods : This nationwide study used data from the Swedish Register for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 3-6 months post CA. Health status was measured using EQ-5D-5L and psychological distress by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences in self -reported health between groups of different initial rhythms. To control for potential confounders, age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, witnessed status, time to CPR, time to defibrillation, and neurological function were included as covariates in multiple regression analyses for continuous and categorical outcomes. Results : The study included 1783 adult CA survivors. Overall, the CA survivors reported good health status and symptoms of anxiety or depression were uncommon (13.7% and 13.9% respectively). Survivors with PEA and asystole reported significantly more problems in all dimensions of health status ( p = 0.037 to p < 0.001), anxiety ( p = 0.034), and depression ( p = 0.017) compared to VT/VF. Overall, these differences did not remain in the adjusted regression analyses. Conclusions : Initial rhythm is not associated with self -reported health when potential confounders are controlled. Initial rhythm seems to be an indicator of unfavourable factors causing the arrest, or factors related to characteristics and treatment.

Its indications are progressively increasing, ranging from functional to aesthetic surgery. The procedure has now entered in the field of regenerative medicine. Although many have commented on the long-term safety implications of fat grafting, especially to the breast, there is no body of information in the literature that analyzes near-term complications associated with this procedure. We performed a retrospective study of 1000 consecutive fat transplantation cases in our hospital since 2005. Complications were divided between donor-site complications and recipient-site complications. Of 1000 procedures, there were 2 donor-site hematomas and 83 local deformities caused by liposuction. In treated patients, the recipient site, there were 4 infections. One patient reported implant rupture at 1 month after fat graft. There was no skin necrosis in the grafted areas and no systemic complications such as pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, or deep venous thrombosis. The complications in fat transplantation are dominated by complications of the liposuction-the donor harvesting phase of the procedure. The relatively low complication rates in the recipient site suggest that fat transplantation, especially considering the recipient, is characterized by a high safety level and our device is simple to use.",ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY,2015,"Maione, L; Vinci, V; Klinger, M; Klinger, FM; Caviggioli, F",10.1097/SAP.0000000000000050,,WOS:000349678900003,A

However, their potential alterations due to alternative mechanisms, such as hypoxia in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, are not known. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the levels and trajectories of blood p-tau, A1342, and A1340 following cardiac arrest, in comparison with neural injury markers neurofilament light (NfL) and total tau (t-tau), can be used for neurological prognostication following cardiac arrest.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective clinical biobank study used data from the randomized Target Temperature Management After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM) trial. Unconscious patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were included between November 11, 2010, and January 10, 2013, from 29 international sites. Serum analysis for serum NfL and t-tau were performed between August 1 and August 23, 2017. Serum p-tau, A1342, and A1340 were analyzed between July 1 and July 15, 2021, and between May 13 and May 25, 2022. A total of 717 participants from the TTM cohort were examined: an initial discovery subset (n = 80) and a validation subset. Both subsets were evenly distributed for good and poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.EXPOSURES Serum p-tau, A1342, and A1340 concentrations using single molecule array technology. Serum levels of NfL and t-tau were included as comparators.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Blood biomarker levels at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Poor neurologic outcome at 6-month follow-up, defined according to the cerebral performance category scale as category 3 (severe cerebral disability), 4 (coma), or 5 (brain death).RESULTS This study included 717 participants (137 [19.1%] female and 580 male [80.9%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [13.5] years) who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Significantly elevated serum p-tau levels were observed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours in cardiac arrest patients with poor neurological outcome. The magnitude and prognostication of the change was greater at 24 hours (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), which was similar to NfL (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96). However, at later time points, p-tau levels decreased and were weakly associated with neurological outcome. In contrast, NfL and t-tau maintained high diagnostic accuracies, even 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Serum A1342 and A1340 concentrations increased over time in most patients but were only weakly associated with neurological outcome.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this case-control study, blood biomarkers indicative of AD pathology demonstrated different dynamics of change after cardiac arrest. The increase of p-tau at 24 hours after cardiac arrest suggests a rapid secretion from the interstitial fluid following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury rather than ongoing neuronal injury like NfL or t-tau. In contrast, delayed increases of A13 peptides after cardiac arrest indicate activation of amyloidogenic processing in response to ischemia.",JAMA NEUROLOGY,2023,"Ashton, NJ; Moseby-Knappe, M; Benedet, AL; Grötschel, L; Lantero-Rodriguez, J; Karikari, TK; Hassager, C; Wise, MP; Stammet, P; Kjaergaard, J; Friberg, H; Nielsen, N; Cronberg, T; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K",10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.0050,,WOS:000961957100003,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia After Cardiac Arrest and Prevention Strategies: A Narrative Review,"Background and Objectives: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) poses a significant threat to the clinical outcomes and hospital stays of mechanically ventilated patients, particularly those recovering from cardiac arrest. Given the already elevated mortality rates in cardiac arrest cases, the addition of VAP further diminishes the chances of survival. Consequently, a paramount focus on VAP prevention becomes imperative. This review endeavors to comprehensively delve into the nuances of VAP, specifically in patients requiring mechanical ventilation in post-cardiac arrest care. The overarching objectives encompass (I) exploring the etiology, risk factors, and pathophysiology of VAP, (II) delving into available diagnostic modalities, and (III) providing insights into the management options and recent treatment guidelines. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for articles about VAP and Cardiac arrest. We used the MeSH terms ""VAP"", ""Cardiac arrest"", ""postcardiac arrest syndrome"", and ""postcardiac arrest syndrome"". The clinical presentation, diagnostic, and management strategies of VAP were summarized, and all authors reviewed the selection and decided which studies to include. Key Content and Findings: The incidence and mortality rates of VAP exhibit significant variability, yet a recurring pattern emerges, marked by prolonged hospitalization and exacerbated clinical outcomes. This pattern is attributed to the elevated incidence of drug-resistant infections and the delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment. This review focuses on VAP, aiming to offer valuable insights into the efficient identification and management of this fatal complication in post-cardiac arrest patients. Conclusion: The prognosis for survival after cardiac arrest is already challenging, and the outlook becomes even more daunting when complicated by VAP. The timely diagnosis of VAP and initiation of antibiotics pose considerable challenges, primarily due to the invasive nature of obtaining high-quality samples and the time required for speciation and identification of antimicrobial sensitivity.

Although representing current clinical practice in the United States, there is limited evidence supporting the benefit of acute administration of such antiarrhythmic medications as lidocaine, bretylium, magnesium, and procainamide to a victim of cardiac arrest. There has been only 1 published case-controlled clinical trial in which shock-refractory victims of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation were stratified into those who received lidocaine and chose who did not, In this trial, no significant differences were observed between treatment groups in the return of an organized rhythm, admission to the hospital, or survival to hospital discharge. In the recently published ARREST trial, a significant improvement in admission alive to the hospital was observed in recipients of intravenous amiodarone, compared with placebo (44% vs 34%, respectively, p = 0.03), With the possible exception of intravenous amiodarone, available evidence of definitive benefit from antiarrhythmic drugs in cardiac arrest is inconclusive, Due to regulatory issues, clinical trials in cardiac arrest are extremely difficult to design and perform.

Because prompt delivery of bystander CPR (B-CPR) doubles survival and B-CPR rates are low, we sought to assess whether gender, socioeconomic status (SES), race, and ethnicity are associated with lower rates of B-CPR and CPR training. Methods: This scoping review was conducted as part of the continuous evidence evaluation process for the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care as part of the Resuscitation Education Science section. We searched PubMed and excluded citations that were abstracts only, letters or editorials, and pediatric studies. Results: We reviewed 762 manuscripts and identified 24 as relevant; 4 explored gender disparities; 12 explored SES; 11 explored race and ethnicity; and 3 had overlapping themes, all of which examined B-CPR or CPR training. Females were less likely to receive B-CPR than males in public locations. Observed gender disparities in B-CPR may be associated with individuals fearing accusations of inappropriate touching or injuring female victims. Studies demonstrated that low-SES neighborhoods were associated with lower rates of B-CPR and CPR training. In the US, predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods were associated with lower rates of B-CPR and CPR training. Language barriers were associated with lack of CPR training. Conclusion: Gender, SES, race, and ethnicity impact receiving B-CPR and obtaining CPR training. The impact of this is that these populations are less likely to receive B-CPR, which decreases their odds of surviving SCA. These health disparities must be addressed. Our work can inform future research, education, and public health initiatives to promote equity in B-CPR knowledge and provision. As an immediate next step, organizations that develop and deliver CPR curricula to potential bystanders should engage affected communities to determine how best to improve training and delivery of B-CPR.",HEALTHCARE,2024,"Blewer, AL; Bigham, BL; Kaplan, S; Del Rios, M; Leary, M",10.3390/healthcare12040456,,WOS:001172401200001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,An Algorithm Used for Ventricular Fibrillation Detection Without Interrupting Chest Compression,"Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the primary arrhythmic event in the majority of patients suffering from sudden cardiac arrest. Attention has been focused on this particular rhythm since it is recognized that prompt therapy, especially electrical defibrillation, may lead to a successful outcome. However, current versions of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) mandate repetitive interruptions of chest compression for rhythm analyses since artifacts produced by chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preclude reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm analysis. Yet, repetitive interruptions in chest compression are detrimental to the success of defibrillation. The capability for rhythm analysis without requiring ""hands-off"" intervals will allow for more effective resuscitation. In this paper, a novel continuous-wavelet-transformation-based morphology consistency evaluation algorithm was developed for the detection of disorganized VF from organized sinus rhythm (SR) without interrupting the ongoing chest compression. The performance of this method was evaluated on both uncorrupted and corrupted ECG signals recorded from AEDs obtained from out-of-hospital victims of cardiac arrest. A total of 232 patients and 31 092 episodes of either VF or SR were accessed, in which 8195 episodes were corrupted by artifacts produced by chest compressions. We also compared the performance of this method with three other established algorithms, including VF filter, spectrum analysis, and complexity measurement. Even though there was a modest decrease in specificity and accuracy when chest compression artifact was present, the performance of this method was still superior to other reported methods for VF detection during uninterrupted CPR.",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,2012,"Li, YQ; Bisera, J; Weil, MH; Tang, WC",10.1109/TBME.2011.2118755,,WOS:000298327100016,A

Methods: We utilized a US inpatient cardiac arrest registry used to study targeted temperature management (TTM) to identify patients with cardiac arrest in the setting of drug overdose between 2005 and 2013. Data regarding the cardiac arrest, resuscitation interventions, use of post-arrest TTM, urine drug screen, survival, and neurologic outcome were examined. These results were compared to patients suffering cardiac arrest from other causes during the same time period using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests on categorical variables. Results: Approximately 2.5% (64/2584) of cardiac arrests occurred in the setting of drug overdose. Patients in the OD cohort were younger, more likely to be male, and more likely to have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that was unwitnessed with no bystander CPR and from a non-shockable rhythm. However, the patients in the OD cohort had similar rates of survival and good neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2) compared to non-OD patients. A fraction of initially resuscitated patients in each group (8% in OD cohort vs. 15% in non-OD cohort, p = ns) did not receive post-arrest TTM due to prompt awakening following resuscitation. Conclusions: Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest in the setting of drug OD have neurologic and survival outcomes comparable to non-OD patients despite lower rates of bystander CPR, shockable rhythms, and witnessed arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Therapeutic Hypothermia for Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Arrest,"This report focuses on cardioprotection and describes the advantages and disadvantages of various methods of inducing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) with regard to neuroprotection and cardioprotection for patients with cardiac arrest and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). TH is recommended in cardiac arrest guidelines. For patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, improvements in survival and neurologic outcomes were observed with relatively slow induction of TH. More rapid induction of TH in patients with cardiac arrest might have a mild to modest incremental impact on neurologic outcomes. TH drastically reduces infarct size in animal models, but achievement of target temperature before reperfusion is essential. Rapid initiation of TH in patients with STEMI is challenging but attainable, and marked infarct size reductions are possible. To induce TH, a variety of devices have recently been developed that require additional study. Of particular interest is transcoronary induction of TH using a catheter or wire lumen, which enables hypothermic reperfusion in the absence of total-body hypothermia. At present, the main methods of inducing and maintaining TH are surface cooling, endovascular heat-exchange catheters, and intravenous infusion of cold fluids. Surface cooling or endovascular catheters may be sufficient for induction of TH in patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For patients with STEW, intravenous infusion of cold fluids achieves target temperature very rapidly but might worsen left ventricular function. More widespread use of TH would improve survival and quality of life for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; larger studies with more rapid induction of TH are needed in the STEMI population.

Prognostication of poor neurological outcome in this population may result in withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and death. The objective of this article is to provide recommendations on the reliability of select clinical predictors that serve as the basis of neuroprognostication and provide guidance to clinicians counseling surrogates of comatose cardiac arrest survivors.MethodsA narrative systematic review was completed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Candidate predictors, which included clinical variables and prediction models, were selected based on clinical relevance and the presence of an appropriate body of evidence. The Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Timing, Setting (PICOTS) question was framed as follows: ""When counseling surrogates of comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest, should [predictor, with time of assessment if appropriate] be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 3 months or later?"" Additional full-text screening criteria were used to exclude small and lower-quality studies. Following construction of the evidence profile and summary of findings, recommendations were based on four GRADE criteria: quality of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, good practice recommendations addressed essential principles of neuroprognostication that could not be framed in PICOTS format.ResultsEleven candidate clinical variables and three prediction models were selected based on clinical relevance and the presence of an appropriate body of literature. A total of 72 articles met our eligibility criteria to guide recommendations. Good practice recommendations include waiting 72 h following ROSC/rewarming prior to neuroprognostication, avoiding sedation or other confounders, the use of multimodal assessment, and an extended period of observation for awakening in patients with an indeterminate prognosis, if consistent with goals of care. The bilateral absence of pupillary light response > 72 h from ROSC and the bilateral absence of N20 response on somatosensory evoked potential testing were identified as reliable predictors. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain > 48 h from ROSC and electroencephalography > 72 h from ROSC were identified as moderately reliable predictors.ConclusionsThese guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of predictors of poor outcome in the context of counseling surrogates of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and suggest broad principles of neuroprognostication.

Younger individuals (18-35 and 36-50 years) showed greater willingness to provide CPR than older respondents (51-75 years), who were more cautious due to privacy concerns and traditional beliefs. Healthcare professionals and non-medical workers were more likely to perform CPR than medical students, who, despite receiving CPR training, expressed hesitation due to a lack of confidence and practical experience. Higher education levels were associated with increased willingness to perform CPR on women, with postgraduate respondents being the most willing. Additionally, most participants had never practiced on female CPR mannequins, despite widespread support-especially among women-for incorporating female models into training.ConclusionThe lower likelihood of women receiving CPR is influenced by gender bias, societal norms, and training limitations. Addressing this issue requires public education to eliminate gender-based hesitation, improvements in CPR training programs to include female mannequins, and enhanced legal protections to reduce rescuer concerns. These measures can be combined with other key factors such as community-wide CPR training programs and increasing the availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to help promote equity in access to life-saving interventions. Targeted interventions can promote gender equity in emergency response, ultimately improving survival outcomes for women.",BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS,2025,"Cheng, WXJ; Liu, JS; Zhou, CF; Wang, XZ",10.1186/s12872-025-04709-5,,WOS:001463087300002,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Non-Cardiac Depolarization-Blocking Drugs Are Associated with Increased Risk of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the Community,"Depolarization-blocking drugs (DB drugs) used for cardiac disease increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation [VT/VF]) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in specific patient groups. However, it is unknown whether drugs for non-cardiac disease that block cardiac depolarization as the off-target effect increase the risk of OHCA on a population level. Therefore, we aimed to investigate OHCA risk of non-cardiac, DB drugs in the community. We conducted a population-based case-control study. We included OHCA cases from an emergency-medical-services-attended OHCA registry in the Netherlands (ARREST:2009-2018), and age/sex/OHCA-date matched non-OHCA controls. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) of use of non-cardiac DB drugs for OHCA using conditional logistic regression. Stratified analyses were performed according to first-registered rhythm (VT/VF or non-VT/VF), sex, and age (<= 50, 50-70, or >= 70 years). We included 5473 OHCA cases of whom 427 (7.8%) used non-cardiac, DB drugs and 21,866 non-OHCA controls of whom 835 (3.8%) used non-cardiac, DB drugs and found that non-cardiac, DB-drug use was associated with increased OHCA-risk when compared to no use (OR(adj)1.6[95%-CI:1.4-1.9]). Stratification by first-recorded rhythm revealed that this applied to OHCA with non-VT/VF (asystole) (OR(adj)2.5[95%-CI:2.1-3.0]) but not with VT/VF (OR(adj)1.0[95%-CI:0.8-1.2]; p-value interaction < 0.001). The risk was higher in women (OR(adj)1.8[95%-CI:1.5-2.2] than in men (OR(adj)1.5[95%-CI:1.2-1.8]; p-value interaction = 0.030) and at younger ages (OR(adj >= 70yrs)1.4[95%-CI:1.2-1.7]; OR(adj50-70yrs)1.7[95%-CI:1.4-2.1]; OR(adj <= 50yrs)3.2[95%-CI:2.1-5.0]; p-value interaction < 0.001). Use of non-cardiac, DB drugs is associated with increased OHCA risk. This increased risk occurred in patients in whom non-VT/VF was the first-registered rhythm, and it occurred in both sexes but more prominently among women and more strongly in younger patients (<= 50 years).",PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY,2022,"Eroglu, TE; Blom, MT; Souverein, PC; de Boer, A; Tan, HL",10.3390/pharma1020007,,WOS:001544596500001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Perioperative Blood Pressure Management Recommendations in Pediatric Pheochromocytoma: A 10-Year Narrative Review,"Background: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare chromaffin cell-derived tumors characterized by catecholamine-secreting activity. Pheochromocytomas account for 1.7% of pediatric hypertension cases. Surgical resection, the definitive pheochromocytoma treatment, carries risks of hemodynamic instability and cardiovascular complications. Nevertheless, mortality rates decreased significantly in the latter half of the 20th century due to effective perioperative blood pressure (BP) management. The literature on BP management tailored to pediatric pheochromocytoma is limited, while the sustained hypertension rate in this population is high (up to 90%) and related to a high risk of intraoperative complications. In this narrative review, we provide up-to-date recommendations regarding BP management to minimize perioperative comorbidities in children with pheochromocytoma. Summary: Antihypertensive agents, primarily alpha (alpha)-blockers, should be promptly administered for suspected pheochromocytoma. Beta ((3)-blockers may be introduced thereafter to counteract reflex tachycardia. The patient must be salt- and water-replete preoperation. Intraoperatively, stable hemodynamics should be ensured during anesthesia and surgery, and short-acting intravenous medications and resuscitation fl uid should be supplied. Postoperatively, patients should be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for close monitoring for at least 24-48 h. Genetic testing is recommended for all pheochromocytoma patients. Identifying underlying mutations, like in succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, which is linked to a higher risk of multifocality and metastasis, is imperative for tailoring treatment strategies and prognostication. Key Messages: Achieving optimal outcomes in pediatric pheochromocytoma relies on preoperative BP optimization with appropriate antihypertensive agents, intraoperative hemodynamic stability, and postoperative routine long-term follow-up to monitor for complications, recurrence, and metastasis. Future research should prioritize well-designed prospective multicenter studies with adequate sample sizes and, where feasible, randomized controlled trials with standardized protocols and appropriate endpoints. These studies should focus on the efficacy and safety of preoperative nonselective versus selective alpha-blockers, whether as monotherapy or combined with other medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers and/ or beta-blockers), or treatment without preoperative anti- hypertensives.",KIDNEY & BLOOD PRESSURE RESEARCH,2025,"Ambarsari, CG; Nadhifah, N; Lestari, HI",10.1159/000542897,,WOS:001404628000001,A

One of the most effective methods of improving survival outcomes is bystander intervention in the form of calling the emergency services and initiating chest compressions. Additionally, the public must feel empowered to act and use this knowledge in an emergency. This study aimed to evaluate an ultra-brief CPR familiarisation video that uses empowering social priming language to frame CPR as a norm in Scotland.Methods In a randomised control trial, participants (n = 86) were assigned to view an ultra-brief CPR video intervention or a traditional long-form CPR video intervention. Following completion of a pre-intervention questionnaire examining demographic variables and prior CPR knowledge, participants completed an emergency services-led resuscitation simulation in a portable simulation suite using a CPR manikin that measures resuscitation quality. Participants then completed questionnaires examining social identity and attitudes towards performing CPR.Results During the simulated resuscitation, the ultra-brief intervention group's cumulative time spent performing chest compressions was significantly higher than that observed in the long-form intervention group. The long-form intervention group's average compressions per minute rate was significantly higher than the ultra-brief intervention group, however both scores fell within a clinically acceptable range. No other differences were observed in CPR quality. Regarding the social identity measures, participants in the ultra-brief condition had greater feelings of expected emergency support from other Scottish people when compared to long-form intervention participants. There were no significant group differences in attitudes towards performing CPR.Conclusions Socially primed, ultra-brief CPR interventions hold promise as a method of equipping the public with basic resuscitation skills and empowering the viewer to intervene in an emergency.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Multi-Drug Cocktail Therapy Improves Survival and Neurological Function after Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest in Rodents,"Background: Cardiac arrest (CA) can lead to neuronal degeneration and death through various pathways, including oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress. However, current neuroprotective drug therapies will typically target only one of these pathways, and most single drug attempts to correct the multiple dysregulated metabolic pathways elicited following cardiac arrest have failed to demonstrate clear benefit. Many scientists have opined on the need for novel, multidimensional approaches to the multiple metabolic disturbances after cardiac arrest. In the current study, we have developed a therapeutic cocktail that includes ten drugs capable of targeting multiple pathways of ischemia-reperfusion injury after CA. We then evaluated its effectiveness in improving neurologically favorable survival through a randomized, blind, and placebo-controlled study in rats subjected to 12 min of asphyxial CA, a severe injury model. Results: 14 rats were given the cocktail and 14 received the vehicle after resuscitation. At 72 h post-resuscitation, the survival rate was 78.6% among cocktail-treated rats, which was significantly higher than the 28.6% survival rate among vehicle-treated rats (log-rank test; p = 0.006). Moreover, in cocktail-treated rats, neurological deficit scores were also improved. These survival and neurological function data suggest that our multi-drug cocktail may be a potential post-CA therapy that deserves clinical translation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that, with its ability to target multiple damaging pathways, a multi-drug therapeutic cocktail offers promise both as a conceptual advance and as a specific multi-drug formulation capable of combatting neuronal degeneration and death following cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Effect of a grace period on false alarm rates of smartwatch-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest detection systems: a pilot study,"Aim: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of mortality, and rapid treatment is life-saving. Early detection is crucial to promptly start the chain of survival, leading to increasing interest in smartwatch-based OHCA detection. Introducing a grace period, during which the wearer can cancel a false alarm before emergency medical services (EMS) are notified, may improve system reliability. This study evaluates how this grace period affects false alarm rates. Methods: In this study, 26 participants wore smartwatches that produced auditory, tactile or audiotactile alarms at random times during daytime, while instructed to cancel these alarms as quickly as possible. Response times were registered by the smartwatch, alongside demographic and time-of-day data. Bayesian time-to-event analysis assessed the effects of alarm type, time of day, and demographic variables. Results: (Audio)tactile alarms significantly shortened response times compared to auditory-only alarms (HR 0.475, 95% CI: 0.38-0.59). Grace periods of 10 and 20 s would result in 98.3% (95% CI: 97.1-99.0%) and 99.6% (95% CI: 99.2-99.9%) of the (audio)tactile alarms being canceled, respectively. No clear evidence was found for meaningful effects of time of day, age or sex. Conclusion: The findings in this study suggest that the application of a grace period to smartwatch-based OHCA detection systems may potentially reduce false alarms reaching EMS with only minor delays.

Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an event of global myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, which is associated with severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and fatal outcome. Evidence has demonstrated that mammalian hibernation is triggered by cyclic variation of a delta-opiate-like compound in endogenous serum, during which the myocardial metabolism is dramatically reduced and the myocardium tolerates the stress of ischemia and reperfusion without overt ischemic and reperfusion injury. Previous investigations also proved that the delta-opioid agonist elicited the cardioprotection in a model of regional ischemic intact heart or myocyte. Accordingly, we were prompted to search for an alternative intervention of pharmacologically induced myocardial hibernation that would result in rapid reductions of myocardial metabolism and therefore minimize the myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2006,"Fang, XS; Tang, WC; Sun, SJ; Weil, MH",10.1097/01.CCM.0000246015.05214.5A,,WOS:000242540100013,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,A new method to detect ventricular fibrillation from CPR artifact-corrupted ECG based on the ECG alone,"During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, chest compressions (CCs) introduce mechanical activity in the ECG and thus preclude a reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm diagnosis. To achieve a reliable rhythm analysis, chest compression must therefore be interrupted, and therefore, the probability of the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is adversely affected. In recent years, a number of algorithms have been developed to distinguish ventricular fibrillation (VF) rhythm from normal sinus rhythm (SR) without chest compression (CC) interruptions. However, the implementation of most of these algorithms relies on the acquisition of reference signals that are strongly correlated with CC artifacts and makes additional hardware alteration inevitable. In the present work, a novel method (the enhanced LMS method) that effectively suppresses CPR artifacts and can easily use the corrupted ECG signal alone is developed for the reliable detection of the VF rhythm during uninterrupted CCs. The enhanced LMS method was tested using mixtures of CC artifacts and real out-of-hospital ECG recordings for different corruption levels, and it was compared with other established algorithms that use the corrupted ECG signal alone, including the morphology consistency evaluation algorithm and the adaptive stop-band filtering algorithm. The validation results indicate that the enhanced LMS method has superior performance in VF/SR rhythm classification under different artifact interference levels. It is shown that the VF rhythm can be reliably detected using only the corrupted ECG alone. The novel method proposed in this study is promising for identification VF from SR with no hardware alterations for clinical cardiopulmonary resuscitation practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Future directions for resuscitation research .2. External cardiopulmonary resuscitation basic life support,"In sudden cardiac deaths outside hospitals, the present performance of external cardiopulmonary resuscitation-basic life support (CPR-BLS), as a bridge to advanced life support (ALS) attempts for restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), still yields suboptimal results. Therefore, future education research should develop more effective, simpler and quicker ways to enable everyone to acquire the necessary BLS skills. Individualized self-training by lay persons is being revived. Although airway control and direct mouth-to-mouth ventilation skills are difficult to acquire, they must continue to be taught to the lay public and health professionals, primarily for use on relatives and friends where infection risk is not a problem, In children and trauma victims, steps A and B alone may be lifesavers, The best way to ventilate and oxygenate during the initiation of brief external CPR-BLS should be re-evaluated. There is a great difference between animals and humans in the behavior of the airway and thorax during coma, and thus in the need for added positive pressure ventilation, During chest compressions in humans, steps A and B are needed. Details deserve re-evaluation. The low perfusion pressures (borderline blood flows) produced by standard external CPR remain the most serious limitation of this method. In spite of extensive efforts so far, novel laboratory research to remedy this limitation is important for the development of more effective emergency artificial circulation. The results of such studies are greatly influenced by different details in animal models. Active compression-decompression (ACD) external CPR, also called 'push-pull' CPR, with a plunger-type device used by hand or a machine, and intermittent abdominal compression (IAC) external CPR are both promising modifications of standard external CPR. Both need further experimental and clinical clarification. For BLS, developing a more effective purely manual CPR-BLS method for help in rapid ROSC should be given high priority. Portable external CPR machines need improvements. They will serve for bridging ROSC-resistant cases through transport and ALS attempts, primarily by freeing the hands of health professionals for more effective sophisticated ALS measures.",RESUSCITATION,1996,"Bircher, N; Otto, C; Babbs, C; Braslow, A; Idris, A; Keil, JP; Kaye, W; Lane, J; Morioka, T; Roese, W; Wik, L",10.1016/0300-9572(95)00935-3,,WOS:A1996UV45700012,A

OBJECTIVE We studied if the peri-operative use of HES is noninferior to crystalloids in terms of acute kidney injury. Secondary outcome was the noninferiority of HES on worsening of renal injury and/or the incidence of a composite endpoint of major complications and mortality until postoperative day 90. DESIGN Randomised double-blind trial in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery with expected blood loss at least 500 ml. SETTING Multicentre trial at 53 study sites in 10 European countries. PATIENTS One thousand nine hundred and eighty-five (HES 977, crystalloid-only 981) patients aged 40 to 85 years with ASA status II-III. INTERVENTION Either 6% HES 130/0.4 or a crystalloid solution. Dosing was guided by mean arterial pressure and/or routine haemodynamic variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Change from pre-operative to lowest cystatin C-based eGFR during the first 3 postoperative days. Key secondary outcome was a composite endpoint of mortality and major postoperative complications after 90 days. RESULTS Mean change in eGFR from baseline to minimum was -3.4 +/- 17.7 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 in HES patients and -1.0 +/- 17.1 ml min-11.73 m-2 in crystalloid-only patients (P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The key secondary endpoint occurred in 35% of patients in each group. There were no clinically relevant differences in any safety endpoint including 90-day renal function. Any cause mortality-difference until the end of 1-year follow-up was not significantly different (8.6% in HES and 10.1% in crystalloid patients).

The concept has evolved markedly, from early descriptions of ""blood poisoning"" to the recognition of sepsis as a systemic syndrome in the late 20th century. Consensus definitions and large clinical trials, including early goal-directed therapy, led to structured treatment bundles and the launch of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which have contributed to gradual improvements in survival. Current management emphasizes rapid recognition, timely antimicrobials, source control, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support, with norepinephrine as the first-line agent. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity among patients complicates decision-making, and debate continues around fluid thresholds, timing of vasopressor initiation, and the use of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids or immunomodulators. Looking ahead, precision medicine and emerging technologies promise to refine sepsis care. Machine learning and multi-omic approaches are improving risk prediction, enabling identification of sepsis subphenotypes, and guiding individualized treatment strategies.

Haematoma formation had most probably occurred after resuscitation, since the initial echocardiogram was normal. After a one week follow-up, there had been no decrease in the size of the haematoma, and surgery was proposed. Left atrial compression by the formation of a periatrial haematoma related to resuscitation has not been reported before. It can cause atrial fibrillation and rapidly progressive heart failure.

Patient outcomes of a cardiac arrest :response strategy employed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and the Shrine of Remembrance by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers are reported. Twenty-eight consecutive events occurring between December 1989 and December 1997 have been analysed. Included are three cardiac arrests managed at ANZAC day parades utilising the same response strategy by the same unit. The incidence of cardiac arrest at the MCG was 1:500000 attendances. Of the 28 patients, 24 (86%) left the venue alive and 20 (71%) were discharged home from hospital. In all cases the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF). All 26 patients (93%) who were defibrillated by St John teams had this intervention within 5 min from the documented time of collapse. One patient in VF spontaneously reverted during CPR. Of the eight fatalities, four died at the scene. At major public venues and events, a co-ordinated emergency life support provision strategy, tailor made for the venue, is necessary for the delivery of prompt CPR, timely defibrillation and advanced life support.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Case Report: Effective extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitationin prolonged cardiac arrest,"Background Cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality, and outcomes after prolonged conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) are often poor. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), involving veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), offers a rescue strategy for refractory cardiac arrest by providing cardiopulmonary support to allow treatment of underlying causes. This case report illustrates the potential of ECPR in an unusually prolonged cardiac arrest.Case description We report a case of a 44-year-old man who experienced sudden prolonged cardiac arrest secondary to acute myocardial infarction and was successfully rescued with ECPR and VA-ECMO. The patient presented with 8 h of chest pain and went into ventricular fibrillation (VF) out of hospital; despite aggressive CCPR for approximately 155 min, return of spontaneous circulation was not achieved until ECPR was initiated. At 12:17 on the day of presentation, VA-ECMO was initiated in the emergency department after continuous CCPR. Subsequent coronary angiography revealed severe multivessel disease with critical proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis, which was successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) while the patient remained on ECMO support. The patient's post-arrest care included mechanical ventilation, targeted temperature management, inotropic and vasopressor support, antithrombotic therapy and aggressive neuroprotective measures. A large infarct in the left occipitotemporal lobe was identified on CT, but intensive care with hypothermia and sedation allowed the patient to survive with intact neurological function. ECMO was weaned off on day 9 of admission, and the patient was extubated on day 12. He subsequently made a full neurological recovery and was transferred out of the intensive care unit in stable condition.Conclusion This case illustrates that even extremely prolonged cardiac arrest can result in good outcomes when managed promptly with ECPR and comprehensive critical care. It highlights the potential of ECPR to improve survival and neurological outcomes after refractory cardiac arrest and underscores the importance of rapid ECMO deployment in selected patients.",FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE,2025,"Yan, WJ; Tang, GX; Wang, H; Li, HS; Liang, LB; Li, YJ; Zhao, SP",10.3389/fcvm.2025.1643839,,WOS:001611222900001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Predictors of Survival and Favorable Functional Outcomes After an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients Systematically Brought to a Dedicated Heart Attack Center (from the Harefield Cardiac Arrest Study),"Despite advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), survival remains low after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). Acute coronary ischemia is the predominating precipitant, and prompt delivery of patients to dedicated facilities may improve outcomes. Since 2011, all patients experiencing OOHCA in London, where a cardiac etiology is suspected, are systematically brought to heart attack centers (HACs). We determined the predictors for survival and favorable functional outcomes in this setting. We analyzed 174 consecutive patients experiencing OOHCA from 2011 to 2013 brought to Harefield Hospital-a designated HAC in London. We analyzed (1) all-cause mortality and (2) functional status using a modified Rankin scale (mRS 0 to 6, where mRS0-3(+) = favorable functional status). The overall survival rates were 66.7% (30 days) and 62.1% (1 year); and 54.5% had mRS0-3(+) at discharge. Patients with mRS0-3(+) had reduced mortality compared to mRS0-3(-) : 30 days (1.2% vs 72.2%, p<0.001) and 1 year (5.3% vs 77.2%, p<0.001). Multivariate analyses identified lower patient comorbidity, absence of cardiogenic shock, bystander CPR, ventricular tachycardia/ventricullar fibrillation as initial rhythm, shorter duration of resuscitation, prehospital advanced airway, absence of adrenaline and inotrope use, and intra-aortic balloon pump use as predictors of mRS0-3(+). Consistent predictors of increased mortality were the presence of cardiogenic shock, advanced airway use, increased duration of resuscitation, and absence of therapeutic hypothermia. A streamlined delivery of patients experiencing OOHCA to dedicated facilities is associated with improved functional status and survival. Our study supports the standardization of care for such patients with the widespread adoption of HACs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism and the development of chronic critical illness after surgery","As early as the 1990s, chronic critical illness, a distinct syndrome of persistent high-acuity illness requiring management in the ICU, was reported under a variety of descriptive terms including the ""neuropathy of critical illness,"" ""myopathy of critical illness,"" ""ICU-acquired weakness,"" and most recently ""post-intensive care unit syndrome."" The widespread implementation of targeted shock resuscitation, improved organ support modalities, and evidence-based protocolized ICU care has resulted in significantly decreased in-hospital mortality within surgical ICUs, specifically by reducing early multiple organ failure deaths. However, a new phenotype of multiple organ failure has now emerged with persistent but manageable organ dysfunction, high resource utilization, and discharge to prolonged care facilities. This new multiple organ failure phenotype is now clinically associated with the rapidly increasing incidence of chronic critical illness in critically ill surgery patients. Although the underlying pathophysiology driving chronic critical illness remains incompletely described, the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome has been proposed as a mechanistic framework in which to explain the increased incidence of chronic critical illness in surgical ICUs. The purpose of this review is to provide a historic perspective of the epidemiologic evolution of multiple organ failure into persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome; describe the mechanism that drives and sustains chronic critical illness, and review the long-term outcomes of surgical patients who develop chronic critical illness.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Improving Survival From Cardiac Arrest: A Review of Contemporary Practice and Challenges,"Cardiac arrest is a common and lethal condition frequently encountered by emergency medicine providers. Resuscitation of persons after cardiac arrest remains challenging, and outcomes remain poor overall. Successful resuscitation hinges on timely, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The optimal method of providing chest compressions and ventilator support during cardiac arrest remains uncertain. Prompt and effective defibrillation of ventricular arrhythmias is one of the few effective therapies available for treatment of cardiac arrest. Despite numerous studies during several decades, no specific drug delivered during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact survival after cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal circulation can rescue a minority of highly selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest. Current management of pulseless electrical activity is associated with poor outcomes, but it is hoped that a more targeted diagnostic approach based on electrocardiography and bedside cardiac ultrasonography may improve survival. The evolution of postresuscitation care appears to have improved cardiac arrest outcomes in patients who are successfully resuscitated. The initial approach to early stabilization includes standard measures, such as support of pulmonary function, hemodynamic stabilization, and rapid diagnostic assessment. Coronary angiography is often indicated because of the high frequency of unstable coronary artery disease in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and should be performed early after resuscitation. Optimizing and standardizing our current approach to cardiac arrest resuscitation and postresuscitation care will be essential for developing strategies for improving survival after cardiac arrest.",ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2016,"Jentzer, JC; Clements, CM; Wright, RS; White, RD; Jaffe, AS",10.1016/j.annemergmed.2016.05.022,,WOS:000389164800007,A

Both personal narratives and studies suggest that parents also base their decisions on factors other than the probabilistic facts about expected outcomes. Statistics are difficult to understand at any time. Rational decision-making may be difficult when taking life-and-death decisions. Furthermore, the role of emotions is not discussed in peri-viability guidelines. Conclusion: We argue against trying to tell parents every fact that we think might be relevant to their decision.

This prompted us to investigate the option of using lower electrical energy biphasic waveform defibrillation. We compared the effects of low-energy biphasic waveform defibrillation with conventional monophasic waveform defibrillation after a short (4 mins), intermediate (7 mins), or prolonged (10 mins) interval of untreated ventricular fibrillation, Biphasic waveform defibrillation with a fixed energy of 150 joules proved to be as effective as conventional monophasic damped sine waveform defibrillation for restoration of spontaneous circulation, with significantly lower delivered energy.

As prospective parents are not educated earlier in pregnancy about extreme premature delivery, crucial information and counselling explaining neonatal issues is only offered to labouring women during their emergency admission. As a result, most have difficulty understanding the risks and benefits of baby's treatment and therefore rely heavily on the perinatal physician to take responsibility for the initial treatment. However, this lack of understanding often leaves parents disadvantaged, as many are left unprepared to participate objectively in quality of life decisions. According to recent research, morbidity figures remain relatively high with one in five survivors at risk of a long-term disability. This shows that some parents will still be confronted by ethical decision of whether or not to continue treatment, and this may not be apparent until days after treatment has been established. As recent research has shown, parents do, in fact, want increased involvement in the decision-making process regarding their child's treatment. Therefore, it has been argued, that parents should be provided with information earlier in pregnancy to familiarise themselves with quality of life issues which they may encounter as the NICU parents of an extremely premature infant.",JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH,2008,"Schroeder, J",10.1111/j.1440-1754.2008.01301.x,,WOS:000254991200011,A

Here, we explored associations between positive psychology factors and emotional distress post-CA.Methods: We recruited CA survivors treated from 4/2021-9/2022 at a single academic medical center. We assessed positive psychology factors (mindfulness [Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised], existential well-being [Meaning in Life Questionnaire Presence of Meaning sub -scale], resilient coping [Brief Resilient Coping Scale], perceived social support [ENRICHD Social Support Inventory]) and emotional distress (post -traumatic stress [Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-5], anxiety and depression symptoms [PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a]) just before discharge from the index hospitalization. We selected covariates for inclusion in our multivariable models based on an asso-ciation with any emotional distress factor (p < 0.10).

Automated detection could improve survival by reducing delays in first responder activation. This study provides proof-of-principle for a device-independent technology that can (A) distinguish presence versus absence of spontaneous circulation, and (B) reliably alert emergency medical services (EMS). Methods: Circulatory arrest data were collected from three groups: (1) volunteers undergoing temporarily restricted blood flow to the arm using a cuff, (2) patients undergoing cardioplegic cardiac arrest for heart surgery, and (3) domestic swine, slaughtered in food industry. Data were collected using Samsung Watch5 and Watch5 Pro. An algorithm was developed to analyze photoplethysmography signals and detect circulatory arrest. Emergency response was tested via the Dutch community first responder network HartslagNu, using their test environment to activate test responResults: Nineteen participants were analyzed. Across all three groups, 28 of 31 circulatory arrests were correctly identified, sensitivity 90.3% (95% CI: 74.2%-98.0%), and hour-level specificity was 94.1% (95% CI: 71.3%-99.9%). Triggering a circulatory arrest consistently resulted in an audiovisual smartwatch alarm and an instantaneous alert to the virtual EMS at the HartslagNu test server. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting circulatory arrest using commercially available smartwatch sensors, achieving high sensitivity and specificity.

The action of vasopressors in the heart, particularly beta(1)-Adrenergic stimulation, is associated with adverse cardiac effects including post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, worsening ventricular arrhythmias, and increasing myocardial oxygen consumption- alpha(2)-Adrenergic agonists, in experimental studies, show great promise in improving outcomes in experimental cardiac arrest, but have not been studied in humans. The combination of epinephrine and vasopressin may be effective, but has been incompletely studied. Clinical trials of vasopressor agents, which minimize direct myocardial effects are needed.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Different resuscitation strategies and novel pharmacologic treatment with valproic acid in traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in young adults, and effective treatment strategies have the potential to save many lives. TBI results in coagulopathy, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, cell death, and impaired epigenetic homeostasis, ultimately leading to morbidity and/or mortality. Commonly used resuscitation fluids such as crystalloids or colloids have several disadvantages and might even be harmful when administered in large quantities. There is a need for next-generation treatment strategies (especially in the prehospital setting) that minimize cellular damage, improve survival, and enhance neurological recovery. Pharmacologic treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid, has shown promising results in animal studies of TBI and may therefore be an excellent example of next-generation therapy. This review briefly describes traditional resuscitation strategies for TBI combined with hemorrhagic shock and describes preclinical studies on valproic acid as a new pharmacologic agent in the treatment of TBI.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Trauma-induced coagulopathy,"Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a major preventable cause of death in patients with traumatic injury. Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) describes abnormal coagulation processes that are attributable to trauma. In the early hours of TIC development, hypocoagulability is typically present, resulting in bleeding, whereas later TIC is characterized by a hypercoagulable state associated with venous thromboembolism and multiple organ failure. Several pathophysiological mechanisms underlie TIC; tissue injury and shock synergistically provoke endothelial, immune system, platelet and clotting activation, which are accentuated by the 'lethal triad' (coagulopathy, hypothermia and acidosis). Traumatic brain injury also has a distinct role in TIC. Haemostatic abnormalities include fibrinogen depletion, inadequate thrombin generation, impaired platelet function and dysregulated fibrinolysis. Laboratory diagnosis is based on coagulation abnormalities detected by conventional or viscoelastic haemostatic assays; however, it does not always match the clinical condition. Management priorities are stopping blood loss and reversing shock by restoring circulating blood volume, to prevent or reduce the risk of worsening TIC. Various blood products can be used in resuscitation; however, there is no international agreement on the optimal composition of transfusion components. Tranexamic acid is used in pre-hospital settings selectively in the USA and more widely in Europe and other locations.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,MANAGEMENT OF ARRHYTHMIAS IN HEART-FAILURE,"Vasodilator therapy is prolonging life in patients with dilated heart failure, but 20% to 80% of deaths are sudden and unexpected. Sudden death may be due to myocardial ischemia, primary ventricular arrhythmias, primary bradyarrhythmias, drug- or electrolyte-induced arrhythmias, or arterial emboli. Cardiac arrest survivors require careful evaluation and therapy. Patients with cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischemia should be considered for coronary artery bypass surgery. Automatic implantable defibrillators should be considered for survivors of cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.  However, the long-term mortality and risk for sudden death in cardiac arrest survivors with heart failure is substantially worse than in those with well-preserved ventricular function. For patients who have not suffered spontaneous arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is generally avoided because of the risks of proarrhythmias and negative inotropic effects. Programmed electric stimulation and signal-averaged electrocardiography may identify postinfarction patients at greater risk for ventricular tachycardia, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy is beneficial or deleterious to these patients is unknown.  In post-myocardial infarction patients who require antiarrhythmic therapy, amiodarone or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs appear safe, although they have not been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced heart failure. Electrophysiologic testing is not useful for screening nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients and the impact of antiarrhythmic drug therapy on these patients has not been established. Atrial fibrillation is common in heart failure and is associated with an increased risk of emboli. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates can aggravate heart failure, and better rate control may be followed by improvement in ventricular function. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs may increase mortality in heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation, but the use of amiodarone appears promising.",CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY,1993,"STEVENSON, WG; MIDDLEKAUFF, HR; SAXON, LA",10.1097/00001573-199308030-00008,,WOS:A1993KZ32200009,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Review What are the care needs of families experiencing cardiac arrest?: A survivor and family led scoping review,"Aim: The sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest of a family member can be a grief-filled and life-altering event. Every year many hundreds of thousands of families experience the cardiac arrest of a family member. However, care of the family during the cardiac arrest and afteris poorly understood and incompletely described. This review has been performed with persons with lived experience of cardiac arrest to describe, ""What are the needs of families experiencing cardiac arrest?"" from the moment of collapse until the outcome is known. Methods: This review was guided by specific methodological framework and reporting items (PRISMA-ScR) as well as best practices in patient and public involvement in research and reporting (GRIPP2). A search strategy was developed for eight online databases and a grey literature review. Two reviewers independently assessed all articles for inclusion and extracted relevant study information. Results: We included 47 articles examining the experience and care needs of families experiencing cardiac arrest of a family member. Forty one articles were analysed as six represented duplicate data. Ten family care need themes were identified across five domains. The domains and themes transcended cardiac arrest setting, aetiology, family-member age and family composition. The five domains were i) focus on the family member in cardiac arrest, ii) collaboration of the resuscitation team and family, iii) consideration of family context, iv) family post-resuscitation needs, and v) dedicated policies and procedures. We propose a conceptual model of family centred cardiac arrest. Conclusion: Our review provides a comprehensive mapping and description of the experience of families and their care needs during the cardiac arrest of a family-member. Furthermore, our review was conducted with co-investigators and collaborators with lived experience of cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and non-survivors alike).

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,External Validation of Deep Learning-Based Cardiac Arrest Risk Management System for Predicting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients Admitted to General Wards Based on Rapid Response System Operating and Nonoperating Periods: A Single-Center Study,"OBJECTIVES:The limitations of current early warning scores have prompted the development of deep learning-based systems, such as deep learning-based cardiac arrest risk management systems (DeepCARS). Unfortunately, in South Korea, only two institutions operate 24-hour Rapid Response System (RRS), whereas most hospitals have part-time or no RRS coverage at all. This study validated the predictive performance of DeepCARS during RRS operation and nonoperation periods and explored its potential beyond RRS operating hours.DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study.SETTING:In this 1-year retrospective study conducted at Yonsei University Health System Severance Hospital in South Korea, DeepCARS was compared with conventional early warning systems for predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). The study focused on adult patients admitted to the general ward, with the primary outcome being IHCA-prediction performance within 24 hours of the alarm.PATIENTS:We analyzed the data records of adult patients admitted to a general ward from September 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020.INTERVENTIONS:None.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:Performance evaluation was conducted separately for the operational and nonoperational periods of the RRS, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as the metric. DeepCARS demonstrated a superior AUROC as compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), both during RRS operating and nonoperating hours. Although the MEWS and NEWS exhibited varying performance across the two periods, DeepCARS showed consistent performance.CONCLUSIONS:The accuracy and efficiency for predicting IHCA of DeepCARS were superior to that of conventional methods, regardless of whether the RRS was in operation. These findings emphasize that DeepCARS is an effective screening tool suitable for hospitals with full-time RRS, part-time RRS, and even those without any RRS.",CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2024,"Cho, KJ; Kim, KH; Choi, J; Yoo, D; Kim, J",10.1097/CCM.0000000000006137,,WOS:001168124200014,A

Further, little is known about the relationship between parent-reported HS outcomes and standardised neurodevelopmental outcomes measured in preterm survivors at preschool age. Our objective was to evaluate parent-reported child HS outcomes and their relationship to neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months of age in very preterm survivors.Design Prospective population-based cohort study.Setting Perinatal follow-up programme.Patients Infants <31 weeks' gestational age born from 2014 to 2016.Outcome measures Parents completed the Health Status Classification System for Pre-School Children questionnaire at 36 months. At the same age, neurodevelopmental assessments were completed to determine neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). NDI was categorised as none, 'mild' or 'significant' (moderate or severe cerebral palsy, Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition <70, blind or required hearing aid).Results Of 118 children, 87 (73.7%) parents reported their child had an HS concern (mild: 61 (51%); moderate: 16 (13.6%); and severe: 10 (8.5%)). Mild and significant NDIs were observed in 17 (14.4%) and 14 (11.9%) children, respectively.

MicroRNA are small-non-coding RNA molecules ultimately involved in gene-silencing. They show promise as biomarkers, as they are stable in body fluids. The microRNA 9-3p (miR-9-3p) is associated with neurological injury in trauma and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Methods and results This post hoc analysis considered all 171 comatose OHCA patients from a single centre in the target temperature management (TTM) trial. Patients were randomized to TTM at either 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C for 24 h. MicroRNA-9-3p (miR-9-3p) was measured in plasma sampled at admission and at 28, 48, and 72 h. There were no significant differences in age, gender, and pre-hospital data, including lactate level at admission, between miR-9-3p level quartiles. miR-9-3p levels changed markedly following OHCA with a peak at 48 h. Median miR-9-3p levels between TTM 33 degrees C vs. 36 degrees C were not different at any of the four time points. Elevated miR-9-3p levels at 48 h were strongly associated with an unfavourable neurological outcome [OR: 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64-3.15, P < 0.0001). MiR-9-3p was inferior to neuron-specific enolase in predicting functional neurological outcome [area under the curve: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.87) vs. 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97)].

This mixed-methods pilot study evaluated whether supplementing the traditional Heartcode BLS course with a high-fidelity teamwork simulation session improved mastery of these higher-level skills. Methods Twenty-four first-year medical students completed the pilot training during sessions offered in February and May of 2023. The program included the traditional AHA Heartcode BLS course, which ranges from two to four hours, and includes both online and in -person skills components. This was followed by a 90 -minute high-fidelity simulation session consisting of two simulated resuscitations separated by a student -led plus/delta debriefing. Facilitators then debriefed the entire activity. Students completed an anonymous online survey that used a 0-10 slider scale to attribute their perceived proficiency for specific skills to the initial BLS course or the teamwork simulations and provided qualitative feedback. Results Twenty-one students (87.5%) completed the follow-up survey. Students credited their proficiency in technical skills (e.g., ""Chest Compressions"") to both sessions equally, but proficiency in higher-level skills, such as leadership, communication, and teamwork, was predominantly credited to the simulation. Additionally, students reported that the teamwork simulation promoted realism and increased self-efficacy. Conclusion Team -based resuscitation simulations using high-fidelity equipment augmented the AHA BLS course by promoting perceived competence in team dynamics domains and increasing students' self-efficacy for participating in real hospital -based resuscitations.

A growing body of research indicates that continuing care adherence interventions positively impact treatment outcome. However, it is unclear whether these interventions are effective for individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders. This paper explores this question with data from 150 participants who were randomized to receive a behavioral continuing care adherence intervention involving contracting, prompting and reinforcing attendance (CPR), or standard treatment. Fifty-one percent of the participants had one or more co-occurring Axis I or Axis II psychiatric disorders in addition to a SUD diagnosis. Among individuals with co-occurring disorders, those who received the CPR intervention show increased duration of treatment and improved 1-year abstinence rates compared to those who received STX. Additionally, effects of the CPR intervention were generally more pronounced among persons with co-occurring Axis I and/or Axis II disorders than those without these disorders.

As a noninvasive procedure, photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy has emerged as a potential novel treatment for brain injury. PBM involves the use of low-level laser light therapy to influence cell behavior. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of PBM treatment with an 808-nm diode laser initiated 6h after GCI. It was noted that PBM dose-dependently protected against GCI-induced neuronal death in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 subregion. Functional assessments demonstrated that PBM markedly preserved both short-term (a week) and long-term (6months) spatial learning and memory function following GCI. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PBM post-treatment (a) preserved healthy mitochondrial dynamics and suppressed substantial mitochondrial fragmentation of CA1 neurons, by reducing the detrimental Drp1 GTPase activity and its interactions with adaptor proteins Mff and Fis1 and by balancing mitochondrial targeting fission and fusion protein levels; (b) reduced mitochondrial oxidative damage and excessive mitophagy and restored mitochondrial overall health status and preserved mitochondrial function; and (c) suppressed mitochondria-dependent apoptosome formation/caspase-3/9 apoptosis-processing activities. Additionally, we validated, in an in vitro ischemia model, that cytochrome c oxidase served as a key PBM target for mitochondrial function preservation and neuroprotection. Our findings suggest that PBM serves as a promising therapeutic strategy for the functional recovery after GCI, with mechanisms involving PBM's preservation on mitochondrial dynamics and functions and the inhibition of delayed apoptotic neuronal death in GCI.",MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY,2019,"Wang, RM; Dong, Y; Lu, YJ; Zhang, WL; Brann, DW; Zhang, QG",10.1007/s12035-018-1191-9,,WOS:000460163700024,A

Emerging evidence implicates that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of post-resuscitation brain injury, and its regulatory mechanisms remain to be investigated. Recently, some studies manifested that long noncoding RNAs could be critical regulators of cell ferroptosis in diverse ischemia-reperfusion injuries of vital organs. This study was designed to explore the role and mechanism of a newly screened long noncoding RNA ENSSSCG00000035331 in alleviating post-resuscitation hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and further investigate its potential regulation by a novel antioxidant sulforaphane.Methods and ResultsHealthy male pigs and mice were used to establish the models of CA and resuscitation in vivo. A hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model using primary porcine hippocampal neurons was constructed to replicate post-resuscitation brain injury in vitro. We found that the expression of ENSSSCG00000035331 was significantly decreased in the post-resuscitation impaired hippocampus using RNA sequencing analysis and verification. Subsequently, ENSSSCG00000035331 overexpression significantly reduced ferroptosis-related ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species production while markedly increased glutathione and further alleviated post-resuscitation brain injury. Mechanistically, ENSSSCG00000035331 interacted with miR-let7a, then inhibited its binding with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA and finally promoted the recovery of the latter's translation after H/R stimulation. In addition, sulforaphane treatment significantly increased ENSSSCG00000035331 and GPX4 expression while markedly decreased miR-let7a expression and hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and finally alleviated post-resuscitation brain injury.ConclusionsOur findings highlighted that ENSSSCG00000035331 was a critical regulator of hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis after CA and resuscitation by targeting the miR-let7a/GPX4 axis, and additionally, sulforaphane might be a promising therapeutic agent for alleviating post-resuscitation brain injury by regulating the signaling axis mentioned above.",CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS,2025,"Zhang, M; Zhang, WB; Chen, ZW; He, L; Chen, QJ; Lan, P; Li, LL; Wu, XL; Wu, XG; Xu, JF",10.1111/cns.70377,,WOS:001467385300001,A

Equivalence margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculations were based on previous standard BLS studies, using two-sided 95% confidence intervals to determine significance of equivalence.ResultsThe results regarding CD revealed equivalence with a trend toward superiority of EM over EA (proportional difference 23.3%-points; 95% CI 11.4%-34.2%) and EM over control (proportional difference 23.4%-points; 95% CI 11.5%-34.2%.) and significant equivalence of EA and control (proportional difference 0.1%-points; 95% CI -11.6%-11.7%). Significant equivalence was determined for all study arms with respect to CR and self-confidence.ConclusionOur study revealed that EM was not detrimental to learners' CPR performance. Given existing research on long-term beneficial effects of EM on patient safety, coupled with the proven equivalence of EM and EA concerning short-term performance, we argue that EM is a promising approach for future medical education purposes. Raising awareness of error framing and teaching error-handling strategies is expected to benefit ongoing safety management efforts in medical education and beyond.",ANNALS OF MEDICINE,2024,"Schmidt, M; Schauwinhold, MT; Loeffler, LAK; Klasen, M; Lambert, SI; Sopka, S; Vogt, L",10.1080/07853890.2024.2408458,,WOS:001327566100001,A

Especially spatial memory is affected due to ischemia-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Aim of this study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of 2-iminobiotin (2-IB), a biotin analogue, on memory and learning in a four-vessel occlusion model of global ischemia using the Water Maze test. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham operation (n = 6), vehicle treatment (n = 20), 1.1 (n = 15), 3.3 (n = 14), 10 (n = 14), or 30 mg/kg/dose 2-IB treatment (n = 15). Treatment was subcutaneously (s.c.) administered immediately upon reperfusion, at 12h, and at 24h after reperfusion. Memory function on day 32 was significantly preserved in all doses of 2-IB rats compared to vehicle, as was the learning curve in the 1.1, 3.3 and 30 mg/kg dose group. Adult rats treated s.c. with 3 gifts of 2-IB every 12 h in a dose range of 1.1-30 mg/kg/dose directly upon reperfusion showed significant improved memory and learning after four vessel occlusion compared to vehicle-treated rats. Since 2-IB has already shown to be safe in a phase 1 clinical trial in adult human volunteers, it is a suitable candidate for translation to a human phase 2 study after OHCA.",PLOS ONE,2023,"Peeters-Scholte, C; Meilin, S; Berckovich, Y; Westers, P",10.1371/journal.pone.0291915,,WOS:001079828600012,A

Design: Randomized controlled trial with a pre-test/post-test control group design. Method: Study was conducted with 144 s-year nursing students at an accredited state university in Turkey. Participants were randomly assigned to either a VR group or a traditional simulation group. Both groups received theoretical instruction in CPR followed by VR-based training using Oculus Quest 2 headsets or a traditional simulation-based exercise. Data were collected using the CPR Knowledge Test, the Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, the Simulation Design Scale and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for CPR skills. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in CPR skills after the intervention, with no significant difference between groups. The traditional simulation group showed a significant increase in self-directed learning skills, while no significant change was observed in the VR group. The VR group showed a supportive effect on abstract conceptualization in learning styles, but had no significant effect on learning preferences. Students in the VR group outperformed the control group on several critical psychomotor CPR skills measured by OSCE. Both groups rated their simulation experiences favorably. Conclusions: VR-based CPR training is an effective, scalable, and engaging teaching method that enhances psychomotor skill acquisition and promotes cognitive engagement.

In this study, the stimulation effect and its mechanism of folate addition on resuscitation of AnGS after the long-term cryopreservation were investigated. The folate addition was found to enhance the recovery of AnGS activity to 76.4% of the original level on the 8th day, which was 28.1% higher than the folate-free group (CK). The folate addition could also promote the community recovery of AnGS, in which the live cells and abundance of anammox bacteria (AnAOB) were 10.2% and 14.0% higher than those in the CK in the early phase of resuscitation. Besides, the folate addition was revealed to stimulate the AnAOB recovery of AnGS, with higher activity and cell number by 58.7% and 40.9% than those in the CK. Furthermore, the mechanism of folate stimulation was proposed on the resuscitation of preserved AnGS. The exogenous folate addition could enhance the CO2 fixation capacity of AnAOB, which further accelerated both activity and cell number recovery of AnAOB, leading to the strong stimulation effect on the resuscitation of AnGS.

Its application is expanding across several therapeutic contexts, surpassing conventional indications. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed worldwide health systems to manage acute respiratory failure. ECMO has been employed as a vital intervention, particularly for patients with severe COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ECMO is applicable throughout pregnancy. The principal indications for ECMO in pregnant women align with those in the general population. However, pregnancy complicates issues, necessitating consideration of both mother's and infant's well-being. Patients with systemic rheumatic diseases are prone to experience life-threatening complications. While a majority of these patients respond to immunosuppressive drugs, a small percentage suffer organ failure and may benefit from ECMO as a bridge to recovery. The article addresses coagulation therapies, highlighting the necessity of precise anticoagulation to avert both bleeding and thrombosis, particularly in patients requiring extended ECMO support. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in ECMO patients are summarized, including the influence of the ECMO circuit on drug metabolism. Survey-based research offers valuable insights into ECMO use, procedures, and challenges.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Purpose of review Many efforts have been made in the last decades to improve outcome in patients who are successfully resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest. Despite some advances, postanoxic encephalopathy remains the most common cause of death among those patients and several investigations have focused on early neuroprotection in this setting. Recent findings Therapeutic hypothermia is the only strategy able to provide effective neuroprotection in clinical practice. Experimental studies showed that therapeutic hypothermia was even more effective when it was started immediately after the ischemic event. In human studies, the use of prehospital hypothermia was able to reduce the time to target temperature but did not result in higher survival rate or neurological recovery in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when compared with standard in-hospital therapeutic hypothermia. Thus, intra-arrest hypothermia (i.e., initiated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation) may be a valid alternative to improve the effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia in this setting; however, more clinical data are needed to demonstrate any potential benefit of such intervention on neurological outcome. Together with cooling, early hemodynamic optimization should be considered to improve cerebral perfusion in cardiac arrest patients and minimize any secondary brain injury. Nevertheless, only scarce data are available on the impact of early hemodynamic optimization on the development of organ dysfunction and neurological recovery in such patients. Some new protective strategies, including inhaled gases (i.e., xenon, argon, nitric oxide) and intravenous drugs (i.e., erythropoietin) are emerging in experimental studies as promising tools to improve neuroprotection, especially when combined with therapeutic hypothermia. Early cooling may contribute to enhance neuroprotection after cardiac arrest. Hemodynamic optimization is mandatory to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion in this setting. The combination of such interventions with other promising neuroprotective strategies should be evaluated in future large clinical studies.",CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE,2014,"Fagnoul, D; Combes, A; De Backer, D",10.1097/MCC.0000000000000098,,WOS:000335973800005,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,A case of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to fulminant myocarditis requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of fever and chest pain that led her to collapse, prompting her father to call the emergency medical services (EMS). Both an EMS ambulance and a physician-staffed ambulance were dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, the EMS crew discovered that the patient was in cardiac arrest, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the initial heart rhythm. Due to the patient's refractory VF, the physician requested the receiving hospital to prepare for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), which was successfully initiated 105 minutes after the patient's collapse. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, where her cardiac function gradually improved. On the eighth day, she was successfully weaned off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and discharged from the hospital on the thirty-third day without any neurological complications. The presumed cause of the cardiac arrest was fulminant myocarditis, based on the patient's clinical history and findings from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, early mechanical cardiopulmonary support is crucial for patients with fulminant myocarditis. However, cases resulting in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest generally have poor outcomes, even with ECPR. This particular case demonstrated that optimal resuscitation, spanning from the prehospital phase to the intensive care unit, utilizing ECPR, played a vital role in achieving a favorable neurological outcome.",SIGNA VITAE,2024,"Murakami, K; Takano, K; Kinoshita, A; Hiraga, S; Mitani, K; Yokoyama, S; Tsujii, N; Kajimoto, T; Sasaki, A; Fukushima, H",10.22514/sv.2023.075,,WOS:001186105700013,A

This paper is a report of an interpretive review of qualitative research on how an implantable cardioverter defibrillator affects adult recipients and their significant others. Background. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator detects pathological cardiac rhythms and automatically converts the rhythm with electrical counter shocks. Data sources. A systematic literature search was conducted for qualitative research papers published between January 1999 and January 2009. PubMed, Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge and CINAHL databases were searched with the following key words: internal defibrillator, implantable defibrillator and qualitative research. Review Methods. Twenty-two papers were included. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and Prompts were used to appraise studies. Thematic analysis and synthesis approaches were used to interpret evidence. Findings. People with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator were found to experience physical, psychological and social changes. Shocks produce fear and anxiety, affecting relationships and sexual relations. The use of support groups and the use of the Internet are important in helping adjustment to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Womens responses to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator appear different than mens responses and include concerns about physical appearance and relationship issues.

While femoral artery cannulation remains the most common arterial access, axillary artery cannulation has emerged as a valuable alternative in selected cases. Objective: This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence and expert opinion on axillary artery cannulation in V-A ECMO, focusing on its technical feasibility, physiologic implications, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus using relevant keywords related to ECMO, axillary artery, cannulation techniques, and outcomes. Emphasis was placed on prospective and retrospective clinical studies, expert consensus statements, and technical reports published over the past two decades. Results: Axillary cannulation provides antegrade aortic flow, potentially reducing the risk of differential hypoxia and improving upper body perfusion. However, the technique presents unique technical challenges and may carry risks such as hyperperfusion syndrome or arterial complications. Emerging data suggest favorable outcomes in selected patient populations when performed in experienced centers. Conclusions: Axillary cannulation represents a promising arterial access route in V-A ECMO, particularly in cases with contraindications to femoral cannulation or when upper-body perfusion is a concern.

The main goal of this treatment modality is to preserve patients' neurological function without deficits and improve survival rates and quality of life. Our aim in this study was to further clarify the biochemical outcomes (changes) after therapeutic hypothermia, contributing to the improvement of treatment strategies and clinical outcomes. This study retrospectively included 174 patients aged 18 to 85 years who were exposed to therapeutic hypothermia for 24 hours or longer. Gender, age, diagnosis, day of discharge, neurologic sequelae, day of death if mortality was present, and whether vasopressor drugs were used during treatment were recorded in the intensive care unit. Biochemical parameters (glucose, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], albumin, calcium, sodium, potassium, pH, SPO2, C-reactive protein, Hb, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) values before (T1) and after 24 hours (T2) treatment were recorded. T1 GCS value measured in the intensive care unit was compared with the T2 GCS values, a significant difference (P < .05) was found between T1 and T2. Statistically significant decreases (P < .05) were observed in T2 (glucose, ALT, AST, albumin, calcium, potassium, and troponin) levels. In contrast, T2 (creatinine, urea, and sodium) levels increased (P < .05). In conclusion, in our study, statistically significant decreases were observed in glucose, ALT, AST, albumin, calcium, potassium, and troponin levels in patients treated with hypothermia. Increases in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio suggest potential suppression of the immune response, which may increase susceptibility to infection. In contrast, creatinine, urea and sodium levels increased. In addition, pH values tended to increase towards normal limits.

AEDs were installed (Lifepak 500; Medtronik PhysioControl Corp., Redmond, USA, equipped with a Biolog 3000i portable ECG monitor; Micromedical Industries Ltd., Labrador, Australia). Within 3 months, 120 medical officers, 750 nurses, and 50 administrative or technical staff underwent a 2 h training programme. An AED was applied and activated by nurses/medical staff before the cardiac arrest team arrived in 27 of 33 cases (81.8%) of witnessed cardiac arrest. The median time from onset of the emergency call to the activation of the AED (record of ECG) was on average 2.1 min (range 1.0-4.5 min). In 18 of 27 cases in which the AED was installed promptly, the primary arrest rhythm was either VT or VF, and the AED delivered a shock.

There are no clinically effective therapies which reduce mortality or improve long-term cognitive outcome. Ventilation could be an easily modifiable variable in resuscitation; gases are relatively simple to administer. Xenon is the prototypic agent of a new generation of experimental treatments which show promise. However, use is hindered by its prohibitive cost and anaesthetic properties. Argon is an attractive option, being cheaper, easy to transport, non-sedating, and mechanistically distinct from xenon. In vitro and in vivo models provide evidence of argon reducing brain injury, with improvements in neurocognitive, histological, and biomarker metrics, as well as improved survival. Current data suggest that the effect of argon is mediated via the toll-like receptors 2 and 4, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI-3K)-AKT pathways. Ventilation with argon appears to be safe in pigs and preliminary human trials. Given recent evidence that arterial hyperoxia may be harmful, the supplementation of high-concentration argon may not necessitate changes to clinical practice.

This study evaluates the efficacy of catheter ablation in high-risk BrS patients. Methods and results This prospective, single-centre, randomized (2:1) study enrolled BrS patients with cardiac arrest (CA) or appropriate ICD therapies. All patients had an ICD and were randomized to undergo epicardial ablation (ablation group) or no ablation (control group). Enrolment began in September 2017 and prematurely terminated in February 2024. The primary endpoint was freedom from VF recurrences. Secondary endpoints included procedure safety, ICD-related complications, and quality-of-life assessment. Forty patients (83% male, mean age 43.7 +/- 12.1) were randomized: 26 in the ablation group and 14 in the control group. Thirty-six patients received appropriate ICD therapies before enrolment: 24 (92%) in the ablation group and 12 (86%) in the control group. One patient in the ablation group experienced a post-procedural pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis. Thirteen patients (33%) had major ICD-related complications. After a mean follow-up of 4.0 +/- 1.7 years, freedom from VF recurrence was 96% (25/26) in the ablation group and 50% (7/14) in the control group (P < 0.001). No unexplained or arrhythmic deaths occurred during follow-up. Conclusion Epicardial catheter ablation was associated with a reduction in VF recurrence compared with ICD therapy alone. These findings support the use of epicardial ablation in high-risk BrS patients.

Prompt diagnosis of EOP in these patients is difficult because of targeted temperature management and the postcardiac arrest syndrome. We hypothesized that an algorithm for proactive screening of EOP would improve patient outcomes. Methods: We conducted a single-center observational study comparing the outcomes of mechanically ventilated adult patients with OHCA, before (study period 1) and after (study period 2) implementation of an algorithm for proactive diagnosis of EOP, including an early distal pulmonary specimen. An inverse probability treatment weighted multivariable regression was performed to identify independent parameters associated with duration of mechanical ventilation. A subgroup analysis was conducted in patients alive on day 5 after intensive care unit admission. Results: Over the 4-year study period, 190 patients (99 and 91 for study periods 1 and 2, respectively) were enrolled. The overall incidence of EOP was 57.4% and was similar between both study periods. Although there was no difference in the time interval to antibiotic initiation, study period 2 was independently associated with higher SpO2/FiO2 ratios on days 3 and 4. We also observed a decrease in mechanical ventilation time in study period 2 (4.5 [1-11.3] vs. 3 [2-5.8] days; P = 0.07), and this reached statistical significance in the subgroup analysis of patients alive at day 5 (10 [5-17] vs. 5 [3-9] days, P = 0.01). Conclusion: In critically ill patients with OHCA, proactive diagnosis of EOP was not associated with a significant change in the time to antibiotic initiation.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Near-infrared spectroscopy: a tool to monitor cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic changes after cardiac arrest in rats,"Introduction: Cardiac arrest (CA) is associated with poor neurological outcome and is associated with a poor understanding of the cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic changes. The objective of this study was to determine the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), to observe the changes in cerebral total hemoglobin (T-Hb) reflecting cerebral blood volume, oxygenation state of Hb, oxidized cytochrome oxidase (Cyto-C). and brain water content following CA. Methods: Fourteen rats were subjected to normothermic (37.5 degreesC) or hypothermic (34 degreesC) CA induced by 8 min of asphyxiation. Animals were resuscitated with ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Hypothermia was induced before CA. NIRS was applied to the animal head to measure T-Hb with a wavelength of 808 mu (11 = 10) and oxygenated/deoxygenated Hb, Cyto-C, and brain water content with wavelengths of 620-1120 nm (n = 4). Results: There were no technical difficulties in applying NIRS to the animal, and the signals were strong and consistent. Normothermic CA caused post-resuscitation hyperemia followed by hypoperfusion determined by the level of T-Hb. Hypothermic CA blunted post-resuscitation hyperemia and resulted in more prominent post-resuscitation hypoperfusion. Both, normothermic and hypothermic CA resulted in a sharp decrease in oxygenated Hb and Cyto-C. and the level of oxygenated Hb was higher in hypothermic CA after resuscitation. There was a rapid increase in brain water signals following CA. Hypothermic CA attenuated increased water signals in normothermic CA following resuscitation. Conclusion: MRS can be applied to monitor cerebral blood volume, oxygenation state of Hb, Cyto-C, and water content following CA in rats. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we report all outcomes up to one year in the subgroup of patients enrolled after cardiac arrest.Results: The HOT-ICU trial included 335 patients after cardiac arrest: 149 in the lower-oxygenation group and 186 in the higher-oxygenation group. At 90 days, 96/147 patients (65.3%) in the lower-oxygenation group and 111/185 patients (60.0%) in the higher-oxygenation group had died (adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.28, p = 0.32); similar results were found at one year (adjusted RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.21, p = 0.53). Serious adverse events (SAEs) in the ICU occurred in 23% of patients in the lower-oxygenation group and 38% in the higher-oxygenation group (adjusted RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86, p = 0.005); the difference was mainly due to more new episodes of shock in the higher-oxygenation group. No statistically significant differences were observed in other secondary outcomes.Conclusion: A lower oxygenation target in adult ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure after cardiac arrest did not result in lower mortality, but fewer SAEs occurred in this group compared to the higher-oxygenation group.

Objective: This scoping review sought to evaluate the survival outcomes and characteristics of published cases of ECPR for toxicological arrest, with the aim of highlighting the potential and limitations of ECPR in toxicology. Eligibility Criteria. We searched PubMed and Cochrane for eligible papers from database inception to October 1, 2022 using the keywords ""toxicology"", ""ECLS"" and ""CPR"". References of included publications were searched to identify additional relevant articles. Qualitative synthesis was used to summarize the evidence. Results: 85 articles were chosen: 15 case series, 58 individual cases and 12 other publications that were analyzed separately due to ambiguity. ECPR may improve survival outcomes in selected poisoned patients, although the extent of benefit is unclear. As ECPR for poisoning-induced arrest may have better prognosis compared to from other aetiologies, it is likely reasonable to apply ELSO ECPR consensus guideline recommendations to toxicological arrest. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest alone may not be sufficient grounds to deny ECPR if effective resuscitation had been promptly instituted. Poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agents and cardio-depressive drugs, and cardiac arrests with shockable rhythms appear to have better outcomes. ECPR may permit excellent neurologically-intact recovery despite prolonged low-flow time of up to four hours. Early ECLS activation and pre-emptive catheter placement can significantly shorten time-to-ECPR and possibly improve survival.

The aim of the study was to assess ICU physicians ability to perform preliminary interpretations of a simplified cEEG in the post cardiac arrest setting. Methods Five ICU physicians received training in interpretation of simplified cEEG - total training duration 1 day. The ICU physicians then interpreted 71 simplified cEEG recordings from 37 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The cEEG included amplitude-integrated EEG trends and two channels with original EEG-signals. Basic EEG background patterns and presence of epileptiform discharges or seizure activity were assessed on 5-grade rank-ordered scales based on standardized EEG terminology. An EEG-expert was used as reference. Results There was substantial agreement (kappa 0.69) for EEG background patterns and moderate agreement (kappa 0.43) for epileptiform discharges between ICU physicians and the EEG-expert. Sensitivity for detecting seizure activity by ICU physicians was limited (50%), but with high specificity (87%). Conclusions After cardiac arrest, preliminary bedside interpretations of simplified cEEGs by trained ICU physicians may allow earlier detection of clinically relevant cEEG changes, prompting changes in patient management as well as additional evaluation by an EEG-expert.

Despite its potential, the correlation of p-Tau with other clinical indicators remains underexplored. This study assesses the predictive capability of p-Tau and its effectiveness when used in conjunction with other predictors.MethodsIn this single-center retrospective study, 230 CA survivors had plasma and brain computed tomography scans collected within 24 h after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from January 2016 to June 2023. The patients with prearrest Cerebral Performance Category scores >= 3 were excluded (n = 33). The neurological outcomes at discharge with Cerebral Performance Category scores 1-2 indicated favorable outcomes. Plasma p-Tau levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was recorded after ROSC, and the gray-to-white matter ratio (GWR) was calculated from brain computed tomography scans within 24 h after ROSC.ResultsOf 197 patients enrolled in the study, 54 (27.4%) had favorable outcomes. Regression analysis showed that higher p-Tau levels correlated with unfavorable neurological outcomes. The levels of p-Tau were significantly correlated with DBP and GWR. For p-Tau to differentiate between neurological outcomes, an optimal cutoff of 456 pg/mL yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. Combining p-Tau, GWR, and DBP improved predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.80 vs. 0.71, p = 0.008).ConclusionsPlasma p-Tau levels measured within 24 h following ROSC, particularly when combined with GWR and DBP, may serve as a promising biomarker of neurological outcomes in CA survivors, with higher levels predicting unfavorable outcomes.",NEUROCRITICAL CARE,2025,"Huang, SS; Huang, CH; Hsu, NT; Ong, HN; Lin, JJ; Wu, YW; Chen, WT; Chen, WJ; Chang, WT; Tsai, MS",10.1007/s12028-024-02055-6,,WOS:001268865800002,A

We do not administer the same drug or dose to every patient at all times, so why then would we live under the illusion that we should give the same nutrition at all times in the continuum of critical illness? We have long lived under the assumption that critical illness and trauma lead to a consistent early increase in metabolic/caloric need, the so-called ""hypermetabolism"" of critical illness. What if this is incorrect? Recent data indicate that early underfeeding of calories (trophic feeding) may have benefits and may require consideration in well-nourished patients. However, we must confront the reality that currently ICU nutrition delivery worldwide is actually leading to ""starvation"" of our patients and is likely a major contributor to poor long-term quality of life outcomes. To begin to ascertain the actual calorie and protein delivery required for optimal ICU recovery, an understanding of ""starvation"" and recovery from starvation and lean body mass (LBM) loss is needed. To begin to answer this question, we must look to the landmark Minnesota Starvation Study from 1945. This trial defines much of the world's knowledge about starvation, and most importantly what is required for recovery from starvation and massive LBM loss as occurs in the ICU. Recent and historic data indicate that critical illness is characterized by early massive catabolism, LBM loss, and escalating hypermetabolism that can persist for months or years. Early enteral nutrition during the acute phase should attempt to correct micronutrient/vitamin deficiencies, deliver adequate protein, and moderate nonprotein calories in well-nourished patients, as in the acute phase they are capable of generating significant endogenous energy. Post resuscitation, increasing protein (1.5-2.0 g/kg/day) and calories are needed to attenuate LBM loss and promote recovery. Malnutrition screening is essential and parenteral nutrition can be safely added following resuscitation when enteral nutrition is failing based on pre-illness malnutrition and LBM status. Following the ICU stay, significant protein/calorie delivery for months or years is required to facilitate functional and LBM recovery, with high-protein oral supplements being essential to achieve adequate nutrition.",CRITICAL CARE,2017,"Wischmeyer, PE",10.1186/s13054-017-1906-8,,WOS:000419612900009,A

A 40 year old man collapsed following electrocution at a construction site. His colleagues immediately transferred him to hospital via taxi, without performing chest compressions. At the hospital he showed ventricular fibrillation; resuscitation attempts failed and he died. Ventricular fibrillation due to electrocution is a benign type of cardiac arrest.

Following minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, the patient was discharged on postoperative Day 7 without complications. However, he returned on post-operative Day 113 with acute chest pain and dyspnoea, resulting in cardiac arrest that required extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Subsequent transoesophageal echocardiography revealed significant thrombus formation on the bioprosthetic valve, leading to reoperation and implantation of a new bioprosthetic valve.Discussion This case illustrates the rapid progression to obstructive BPVT following discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. It underscores the potential risk of BPVT despite appropriate anticoagulation.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Higher bilirubin on admission predicts better outcome in refractory cardiac arrest: A Prague OHCA trial analysis focused on the antioxidant effect of bilirubin,"Background: Although bilirubin is a proven antioxidant substance and a protective factor against the development of various diseases, in emergency medicine, its increased concentration is considered solely a marker of organ damage and negative prognosis. However, clinical data on the role of bilirubin in cardiac arrest (CA) and reperfusion injury, are sparse. The presented study investigates the protective effects of increased serum bilirubin concentrations and genetic determinants (UGT1A1 promoter variations) on the outcomes of patients with refractory out-of-hospital CA (r-OHCA) in a randomized population. Methods: Between March 1, 2013, and October 25, 2020, 256 randomized Prague OHCA patients with r-OHCA were evaluated for inclusion and categorized as having increased (>10 mmol/l) or low/normal serum bilirubin concentrations on hospital arrival and present or absent genetic variations for mild hyperbilirubinemia. The primary outcome was survival with a good neurological outcome (defined as cerebral performance category 1-2) 180 days after randomization. Results: Finally, 164 patients were included in the bilirubin concentration analysis. Favorable neurological survival after 180 days occurred in 50 of 99 patients (50.5 %) in the group with higher initial serum bilirubin concentrations and 18 of 65 patients (27.7 %) in the low-bilirubin group (absolute difference 22.8 [8.1-37.5]; P = 0.006). The effect persisted also in multivariable analysis (OR for favorable outcome = 3.02 [95 % CI = 1.16-7.84]; P = 0.023). Genetic predisposition for mild hyperbilirubinemia was not associated with any patient outcomes.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Beyond Standard Shocks: A Critical Review of Alternative Defibrillation Strategies in Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation,"Background: Refractory ventricular fibrillation (RVF) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the persistence of ventricular fibrillation despite multiple defibrillation attempts. It represents a critical challenge in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest management, with poor survival outcomes and limited guidance from current resuscitation guidelines. In recent years, alternative defibrillation strategies (ADSs), including dual sequential external defibrillation (DSED) and vector change defibrillation (VCD), have emerged as potential interventions to improve defibrillation success and patient outcomes. However, their clinical utility remains debated due to heterogeneous evidence and limited high-quality data. Methods: This narrative review explores the current landscape of ADSs in patients with RVF. MEDLINE, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization, LitCovid NLM, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library were examined from their inception to April 2025. Results: The available literature is dominated by retrospective studies and case series, with only one randomized controlled trial (DOSE-VF). This trial demonstrated improved survival to hospital discharge with ADSs compared to standard defibrillation. DSED was associated with higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurological outcomes. However, subsequent meta-analyses have produced inconsistent results, largely due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. The absence of sex-, gender-, and ethnicity-specific analyses further limits the generalizability of the findings. In addition, practical barriers, such as equipment availability, pose significant challenges to implementation. Conclusions: ADSs represent a promising yet still-evolving approach to the management of RVF, with DSED showing the most consistent signal of benefit.

However, the impact of longitudinal changes in body mass index (BMI) on the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) remains unclear, especially among overweight populations. Methods This nested case-control study utilized data from the Korean National Health Information Database between 2009 and 2018. A total of 23 453 OHCA patients, who underwent national health check-ups within 1 and 2-4 years before OHCA occurrence, and 31 686 controls, who underwent similar national health check-ups, were included. The study population was matched for sex, age and survival status. Conditional logistic regression was employed to analyse the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each BMI per cent change in assessing the risk of OHCA occurrence within 1 year. Results A reverse J-shaped association between BMI per cent change and OHCA risk was observed, even among overweight populations. Among the overweight populations, weight loss significantly increased OHCA risk, with ORs (95% CI) of 4.10 (3.23-5.20) for severe weight loss (BMI decrease > 15%), 2.72 (2.33-3.17) for moderate weight loss (BMI decrease 10-15%) and 1.46 (1.35-1.59) for mild weight loss (BMI decrease 5-10%). Conversely, mild weight gain (BMI increase 5-10%) did not significantly increase OHCA risk. The impact of weight changes on the occurrence of OHCA differed by sex, being more prominent in males. Conclusions Significant weight changes within a 4-year period increase the risk of OHCA with a reverse J-shaped association, even among overweight and obese individuals.

Prospective Observational Study in Volume Control and Follow-Up Acute Kidney Injury,"Background and Objective: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious condition requiring prompt fluid resuscitation, yet both under- and over-treatment carry risks. Accurate volume assessment is essential, especially in emergency settings. The Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index (IVCCI) is commonly used but has limitations. The Pleth Variability Index (PVI) offers a non-invasive alternative, though its role in AKI remains unclear. To compare the efficacy of the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) and Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index (IVCCI) in assessing fluid responsiveness and predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 50 adult AKI patients presenting to a tertiary emergency department. All patients received sequential fluid resuscitation with 1000 mL and 2000 mL of isotonic saline. PVI, IVCCI, mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2), perfusion index (PI), and shock index (SI) were recorded at baseline and after each fluid bolus. Changes in these parameters were analyzed to assess their utility in fluid responsiveness. Additionally, the prognostic value of baseline PVI for in-hospital mortality was investigated. Results: PVI demonstrated a significant and dose-responsive decrease following fluid administration, outperforming IVCCI, MAP, PI, SpO(2), and SI in sensitivity (p < 0.001). Baseline PVI values were significantly associated with mortality (AUC: 0.821, p < 0.001), whereas post-resuscitation PVI values showed no prognostic significance. IVCCI and PI showed comparable reliability but were less sensitive to incremental volume changes. Conclusions: PVI is a sensitive, non-invasive marker of fluid responsiveness in non-intubated AKI patients and may also serve as an early prognostic indicator.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate international legislation relating to PAD and develop legal recommendations to improve PAD in OHCA. METHODS Searches covering 5 domains (automated external defibrillator [AED] provision, funding, identification, maintenance, lay responder training) were conducted in 99 jurisdictions worldwide: United States (50) and Canada (13) analyzed at state/province level; 36 other countries analyzed at national level. Forty-nine legislation sources were searched from September 27, 2021, to May 5, 2022. Legislative data were classified: Enabling Legislation (facilitating PAD) or Disabling Legislation (hindering PAD). Based on retrieved data, recommendations for international AED laws were developed. RESULTS Searches identified 419,248 legal records. Enabling Legislation regarding AED provision in public areas was present in 60% U.S. states, 8% Canadian provinces, and 22% of nations studied from the rest of world. Disabling Legislation regarding registration of AEDs, that could potentially discourage AED ownership, was found in 37 North American jurisdictions. Enabling Legislation regarding AED signage was found in 66% U.S. states and 39% of all jurisdictions worldwide. Overall, 48% of worldwide jurisdictions studied had legislative requirements for AED maintenance, including 80% of all U.S. states. Internationally, 49.5% of jurisdictions studied had Enabling Legislation mandating AED training, and 66% United States had this for schools. Only 4 jurisdictions worldwide gave implicit authorization to laypersons for AED use in emergencies. CONCLUSIONS There is significant variability in international legislation relating to PAD. All countries should consider Enabling Legislation that could decrease delays to PAD. Similarly, Disabling Legislation potentially hindering prompt PAD during OHCA should be withdrawn.

However, guidelines do not distinguish between specific types of buffered solutions and clinical equipoise exists. We aimed to assess the desirable and undesirable effects of acetate- versus lactate-buffered solutions in hospitalised patients. Methods We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised clinical trials assessing the use of acetate- versus lactate-buffered solutions for intravenous administration in hospitalised adults and children.

Epinephrine, the primary pharmacological intervention in the treatment of cardiac arrest, improves immediate outcome. However, epinephrine increases the severity of myocardial dysfunction after cardiac resuscitation. Both inotropic and chronotropic actions provoke disproportionate increases in myocardial oxygen consumption by the ischemic heart, prompting this study, in which we hypothesized that a selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, alpha-methylnorepinephrine (alpha-MNE), would moderate these adverse effects of epinephrine and minimize postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. After 7 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 14 anesthetized male domestic pigs, precordial compression at a fixed rate of 80 compressions/min was begun, along with mechanical ventilation. Either alpha-MNE (100 mug/kg) or epinephrine (20 mug/kg) was administered as a bogus after 2 minutes of precordial compression. After an additional 4 minutes of precordial compression, defibrillation was attempted. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was quantitated with the use of transesophageal echo-Doppler imaging. Comparable increases in coronary perfusion pressure to 15 mm Hg were observed after the administration of both drugs. All animals were successfully resuscitated; epinephrine and alpha-MNE were equally quick in restoring spontaneous circulation after 7 minutes of untreated VF. Ejection fraction was reduced by 35% and 14% by epinephrine and alpha-MNE, respectively, after resuscitation. Epinephrine and alpha-MNE increased postresuscitation heart rate by 38% and 15%, respectively. Accordingly, significantly less postresuscitation impairment followed the administration of alpha-MNE. alpha-MNE, a selective alpha-adrenergic agonist, was as effective as epinephrine in restoring spontaneous circulation after 7 minutes of untreated VF in a porcine model for CPR and demonstrated lesser postresuscitation myocardial injury.",JOURNAL OF LABORATORY AND CLINICAL MEDICINE,2002,"Klouche, K; Weil, MH; Tang, WC; Povoas, H; Kamohara, T; Bisera, J",10.1067/mlc.2002.125177,,WOS:000176547500005,A

Cardiac arrhythmias are significantly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular complications and sudden death, consequently leading to decreased quality of life, disability, high mortality, and healthcare expense. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, and has been further increasing with the aging of society. Although the prevalence is relatively lower in Asians than in Westerners, the prognostic impacts on stroke and mortality in Asians are comparable. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in approximately 40 cases per 100,000 persons annually in each country of Asia. Most cases are caused by myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, but the proportion of myocardial infarction is lower in Asia than in Western countries.

Twenty experienced mountaineers of the Austrian Mountain Rescue Service trained in Basic Life Support (BLS) performed BLS on a manikin in groups of two for 16 min. The scenario was executed at baseline altitude and immediately after a quick ascent over an altitude difference of 1200 m at 3454 m above sea level. The sequence of scenarios was randomised for a cross over analysis. Quality of CPR and exhaustion of participants (vital signs, Borg-Scale, Nine hole peg test) were measured and compared between high altitude and baseline using random-effects linear regression models. Results The primary outcome of chest compression depth significantly decreased at high altitude compared to baseline by 1 cm (95% CI 0.5 to 1.3 cm, p < 0.01). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of chest compressions in the target depth (at least 5 cm pressure depth) by 55% (95% CI 29 to 82%, p < 0.01) and in the duration of the release phase by 75 ms (95% CI 48 to 101 ms, p < 0.01). No significant difference was found regarding hands-off times, compression frequency or exhaustion. Conclusion Physical strain during a realistic alpine rescue mission scenario at high altitude led to a significant reduction in quality of resuscitation.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,The importance of the viable but non-culturable state in human bacterial pathogens,"Many bacterial species have been found to exist in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state since its discovery in 1982. VBNC cells are characterized by a loss of culturability on routine agar, which impairs their detection by conventional plate count techniques. This leads to an underestimation of total viable cells in environmental or clinical samples, and thus poses a risk to public health. In this review, we present recent findings on the VBNC state of human bacterial pathogens. The characteristics of VBNC cells, including the similarities and differences to viable, culturable cells and dead cells, and different detection methods are discussed. Exposure to various stresses can induce the VBNC state, and VBNC cells may be resuscitated back to culturable cells under suitable stimuli. The conditions that trigger the induction of the VBNC state and resuscitation from it are summarized and the mechanisms underlying these two processes are discussed. Last but not least, the significance of VBNC cells and their potential influence on human health are also reviewed.",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2014,"Li, L; Mendis, N; Trigui, H; Oliver, JD; Faucher, SP",10.3389/fmicb.2014.00258,,WOS:000337526400001,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Erythropoietin: Powerful protection of ischemic and post-ischemic brain,"Ischemic brain injury inflicted by stroke and cardiac arrest ranks among the leading causes of death and long-term disability in the United States. The brain consumes large amounts of metabolic substrates and oxygen to sustain its energy requirements. Consequently, the brain is exquisitely sensitive to interruptions in its blood supply, and suffers irreversible damage after 10-15 min of severe ischemia. Effective treatments to protect the brain from stroke and cardiac arrest have proven elusive, due to the complexities of the injury cascades ignited by ischemia and reperfusion. Although recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and therapeutic hypothermia have proven efficacious for stroke and cardiac arrest, respectively, these treatments are constrained by narrow therapeutic windows, potentially detrimental side-effects and the limited availability of hypothermia equipment. Mounting evidence demonstrates the cytokine hormone erythropoietin (EPO) to be a powerful neuroprotective agent and a potential adjuvant to established therapies. Classically, EPO originating primarily in the kidneys promotes erythrocyte production by suppressing apoptosis of proerythroid progenitors in bone marrow. However, the brain is capable of producing EPO, and EPO's membrane receptors and signaling components also are expressed in neurons and astrocytes. EPO activates signaling cascades that increase the brain's resistance to ischemia-reperfusion stress by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, limiting formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil infiltration. Collectively, these mechanisms preserve functional brain tissue and, thus, improve neurocognitive recovery from brain ischemia. This article reviews the mechanisms mediating EPO-induced brain protection, critiques the clinical utility of exogenous EPO to preserve brain threatened by ischemic stroke and cardiac arrest, and discusses the prospects for induction of EPO production within the brain by the intermediary metabolite, pyruvate.",EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,2014,"Nguyen, AQ; Cherry, BH; Scott, GF; Ryou, MG; Mallet, RT",10.1177/1535370214523703,,WOS:000344541700006,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,ISCHEMIA trial: Is there enough evidence to drive a change in clinical practice? A critical appraisal,"Recently, ISCHEMIA trial was published in order to determine the effect of adding cardiac catheterization and revascularization when feasible to medical therapy in patients with stable CAD and moderate or severe ischemia. Over a median of 3.2 years of follow-up, among patients with stable CAD who had moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing, an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, did not reduce the rates of the primary or key secondary composite outcomes. The primary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The key secondary outcomes were the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or MI and angina-related quality of life. Patients in the invasive-strategy group had more procedural myocardial MIs, and they had fewer spontaneous infarctions during follow-up. The incidence of death from any cause was low and similar in the two groups. However, the ISCHEMIA trial was challenging to implement, event rates were low and enrollment fell behind initial milestones. Furthermore, power of the study was compromised, composite end-point definition as well as definitions of crucial individual components were changed amid study progression. There was a ""heterobaric"" combined end-point with procedural MIs favoring the conservative arm and spontaneous MIs favoring the invasive arm. Finally, the duration of reported follow-up showed signals that findings may shift in favor of invasive treatment and results were sensitive to definition and type of MIs. Therefore, we believe that it is premature to change clinical practice in view of the results of ISCHEMIA trial. As stable CAD patients is a vastly heterogenous patient group, it may be prudent to apply common clinical judgement and individual decision-making according to current guidelines before changing our management strategies.

In this scoping review of international contemporary literature, we describe the evidence of family effects and functioning postpediatric intensive care unit (PICU) as well as outcome measures used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the literature. Methods We reviewed all articles published between 1970 and 2017 in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), or the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Our search used a combination of terms for the concept of ""critical care/illness"" combined with additional terms for the prespecified domains of social, cognitive, emotional, physical, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and family functioning. Results We identified 71 articles reporting on the postPICU experience of more than 2400 parents and 3600 families of PICU survivors in 8 countries. These articles used 101 different metrics to assess the various aspects of family outcomes; 34 articles also included open-ended interviews. Overall, most families experienced significant disruption in at least five out of six of our family outcomes subdomains, with themes of decline in mental health, physical health, family cohesion, and family finances identified. Almost all articles represented relatively small, single-center, or disease-specific observational studies. There was a disproportionate representation of families of higher socioeconomic status (SES) and Caucasian race, and there was much more data about mothers compared to fathers. There was also very limited information regarding outcomes for siblings and extended family members after a child's PICU stay. Conclusions Significant opportunities remain for research exploring family functioning after PICU discharge.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion impairs neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory,"The incidence of cognitive impairment in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients has increased, adversely impacting quality of life and imposing a significant economic burden. Brain imaging of CVD patients has detected changes in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for normal learning and memory. However, it is not clear whether adverse cardiac events or other associated co-morbidities impair cognition. Here, using a murine model of acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), where the coronary artery was occluded for 30 min followed by reperfusion, we tested the hypothesis that acute myocardial infarction triggers impairment in cognitive function. Two months following cardiac I/R, behavioral assessments specific for hippocampal cognitive function were performed. Mice subjected to cardiac I/R performed worse in the fear-conditioning paradigm as well as the object location memory behavioral test compared to sham-operated mice. Reactive gliosis was apparent in the hippocampal subregions CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus 72 h post-cardiac I/R as compared with sham, which was sustained two months post-cardiac I/R. Consistent with the inflammatory response, the abundance of doublecortin positive newborn neurons was decreased in the dentate gyrus 72 h and 2 months post-cardiac I/R as compared with sham. Therefore, we conclude that following acute myocardial infarction, rapid inflammatory responses negatively affect neurogenesis, which may underlie long-term changes in learning and memory.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,The automated external defibrillator,"Sudden death claims 250,000 lives annually in the U.S. The vast majority of such events are due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Even though these arrhythmias can be converted if treated promptly, less than 5% of victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survive to hospitalization. This poor survival is often due to delay in the initiation of quality CPR and defibrillation. Several clinical studies have evaluated the use of an AED by nontraditional emergency medical providers and by laypersons in Public Access Defibrillation programs. These studies have demonstrated a significant improvement in survival due to earlier access to defibrillation provided by the AED. The AED has proven to be safe, reliable, and efficacious in the diagnosis and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias when employed by lay providers/rescuers in a variety of outpatient settings. Society has embraced these data and legislation has been passed that supports the implementation of PAD programs into communities and protects lay rescuers and organizations implementing these programs from liability. Concerns about cost versus benefit still serve as barriers to widespread implementation of PAD programs, but with the declining cost of AEDs and increased public awareness, many communities have initiated PAD programs. We encourage widespread implementation of PAD programs and enhanced public awareness about basic life support, with the expectation that such efforts will enhance survival of out of hospital cardiac arrest.",JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,2007,"Rho, RW; Page, RL",10.1111/j.1540-8167.2007.00822.x,,WOS:000248484500020,A

Coronary artery disease was present in 74% of patients, cardiomyopathy in 19% of patients, and no evident heart disease in 7% of patients. Two hundred twenty-one patients were given drug therapy, 47 patients underwent arrhythmia surgery, and 75 patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). During a mean follow-up of 30 months (range 1 to 101), 66 patients (18%) died from a cardiac death of which 26 (39%) were sudden. Cox regression analysis was conducted utilizing a total of 19 variables (clinical and therapeutic) in the entire population and separately in patients with coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy, The most significant variables (multivariate analysis) of survival from cardiac mortality in the entire population were: congestive heart failure (CHF) class (p = 0.0003), ejection fraction (p = 0.02), and the use of drug therapy (p = 0.03); in patients with coronary artery disease, CHF class (p = 0.0001) and ejection fraction (p = 0.0006); and in patients with cardiomyopathy, CHF class (p = 0,009) and sustained VT on Holter monitoring (p = 0.007). Kaplan-Meier survival rates from cardiac death were: significantly lower (p = 0.005) in patients with CHF class III and IV compared with CHF class I and II (25% vs 58%, p = 0.005) with drug therapy; marginally significant (47% vs 88%, p = 0.06) from 20 to 40 months in patients with an ICD; and nonsignificant in patients who underwent arrhythmia surgery (63% vs 77%). Patients with an ICD had a better expected survival (82%) than patients who had arrhythmia surgery (69%) and drug therapy (65%). Thus, in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, CHF class was the most significant independent predictor of survival from cardiac mortality over all disease substrates, and therapy influenced survival depending on the CHF class. Patients in CHF class III and IV who underwent arrhythmia surgery or had an LCD had a better expected survival than those taking drug therapy, and the negative impact of antiarrhythmic therapy was most prominent in patients with CHF class III and IV, (C) 1997 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,1997,"Gomes, JA; Mehta, D; Ip, J; Winters, SL; Camunas, J; Ergin, A; Newhouse, TT; Pe, E",10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00046-5,,WOS:A1997WV11400009,A

Approximately, 49 million cases of sepsis are recorded worldwide annually, with 11 million sepsis-related deaths, the majority occurring in patients with septic shock. A substantial proportion of survivors suffer from moderate to severe functional limitations including physical, cognitive and psychological disability, exacerbation of pre-existing chronic conditions and a high incidence of re-hospitalisation in the first 12 months after the initial diagnosis. Optimal management of patients with septic shock requires prompt and reliable recognition of patients with sepsis who require additional haemodynamic support. Initially, patients will need judicious intravenous fluids and consideration of the need for vasopressors such as norepinephrine. Administration of appropriate antibiotics and consideration for control of the source of infection are also required. In the optimisation phase, depending on patients' comorbidities and response to therapy, the balance of fluid therapy, vasopressors and potentially the addition of an inotropic agent will need to be adjusted, based on clinical findings and haemodynamic and biochemical parameters. For those patients who do not respond to initial therapy, more intensive monitoring may be required with consideration of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids, vasopressin, angiotensin II or other rescue therapies to achieve cardiovascular stability.

Before bethanidine sulfate was administered sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) were inducible in 11 patients and reproducible nonsustained VT was induced in 3 patients. Bethanidine sulfate shortened sinus cycle length and  absolute and relative ventricular refractory periods measured during sinus rhythm, but did not alter ventricular effective refractory period measured during ventricular pacing.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Design projections for prospective studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of cardiac arrest detection technologies,"Background: Recent developments have illustrated the feasibility of scalable out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) detection using consumer-wearable products. While initial evidence is promising, the real-world effectiveness of these technologies is unproven and design decisions to minimize false positives may constrain clinical impact. To support the real-world evaluation of these technologies, we analyzed registry data and evaluated strategies for a clinical trial. Methods: We analyzed Emergency Medical Services (EMS)-treated and EMS-untreated cases in the British Columbia Cardiac Arrest Registry (2019-2020) who may have benefitted from cardiac arrest detection. Within strata formed by Age (0-35, 36-55, 56-65, 65+) and Sex, we estimated strata-specific treatment effects from recognition and calculated the required sample sizes for a set of potential primary clinical outcomes for a trial (survival to hospital discharge, initial shockable cardiac rhythm, EMS treatment). We compared this with population incidence to inform prospective recruitment requirements. Results: Within a population-at-risk of 9,739,356, 11,382 sentinel cases met criteria for inclusion. Strata-specific incidence ranged from 18.3 per 100,000 to 395 per 100,000. The most statistically efficient subgroup for a survival outcome was Males aged 56-65 (171,676 needed, total). For a trial outcome of EMS treatment or initial shockable rhythm, Males over 65 were the most efficient subgroup within which to test the intervention (7,608 and 66,962 needed, total respectively). Conclusion: A prospective trial of OHCA detection technologies will require large recruitment targets. Subgroups with the highest estimated treatment effect are not those with the highest incidence. Large trials in the general population will require multiple centers and innovative recruitment strategies that may be aided by partnership with industry.",RESUSCITATION,2025,"Hutton, J; Khalili, M; Lingawi, S; Askari, Z; Nourizadeh, M; Sekhon, M; Shadgan, B; Kuo, C; Puyat, JH; Morrison, LJ; Sobolev, B; Christenson, J; Grunau, B",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2025.110681,,WOS:001582538500007,A

MH sequelae can include anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress symptoms which hinder one's ability to return to usual life and activity, impeding follow-up, health care seeking, and adherence to care plans. Addressing MH as part of a whole person care in such scenarios could lead to improved wellness and recovery. This review examines the MH sequelae of SCA and ICD-S, explores potential therapies for managing these issues, proposes strategies to improve MH post-SCA or defibrillator shock, and identifies areas for future research.

If an infant eventually cannot survive or is likely to suffer severe disability after surviving, ethical issues in the treatment process are inevitable, and this problem arises not only in developed countries but is also becoming increasingly prominent in developing countries. In addition, ethical concerns cannot be avoided in medical research. This review article introduces basic ethical guidelines that should be followed in clinical practice, including respecting the autonomy of the parents, giving priority to the best interests of the infant, the principle of doing no harm, and consent and the right to be informed.

We carried out a pilot study in which 24 adult Wistar rats were anaesthetised and subjected to controlled asphyxia for specified durations. We measured the pH, 'neurological score' and the ECG, extracting from this heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). We have developed a technique capable of detecting asphyxia in less than I min, based on monitoring the ECG and estimating HRV by measuring the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (the RR interval is the time interval between two consecutive R-points of the QRS complex). In all cases the heart rate decreased and HRV increased, by an average of 46 +/- 33 ms in relation to the baseline, at the onset of asphyxia. The comparison of the base level of HRV after and before asphyxia shows promise for the estimation of the severity of the episode; however, the limitations of this study should be noted as they include the small size of the cohort and the methods of analysis.",MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,2002,"Boardman, A; Schlindwein, FS; Thakor, NV; Kimura, T; Geocadin, RG",10.1007/BF02345299,,WOS:000180219600002,A

As postulated in international guidelines, the resulting hands-off intervals should not exceed 10 s. Objectives We investigated delay in onset of chest compressions and the length of hands-off intervals during defibrillation associated with the application of AEDs. Materials and methods In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded observational study, the resuscitation efforts by first year medical students were analyzed in different emergency scenarios on manikins. Delay in onset of chest compressions and the length of hands-off intervals between voice prompts from four conventional devices were compared during shockable and nonshockable rhythms. Satisfaction with the device, difficulties with the application, and suggested improvements were assessed by questionnaire. Results In a total of 70 applications, the start with thoracic compressions was delayed by a mean of 115 s. On average, the first shock was administered after 125 s in shockable heart rhythms. Perishock pauses of less than 10 s were achieved with none of the tested devices. Hands-off intervals during defibrillation differed significantly between the devices (p < 0.001). Improvements were suggested regarding marking, voice prompts, and electrodes. Conclusions Perishock pause of less than 10 s was not achieved with any of the tested devices. Shortened and more precise voice prompts as well as more clearly arranged labeling and layout of pads are needed to simplify application, reduce delayed onset of chest compressions and shorten hands-off intervals.",NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN,2024,"Schäfer, V; Witwer, P; Schwingshackl, L; Salchner, H; Gasteiger, L; Schabauer, W; Lederer, W",10.1007/s10049-022-01059-z,,WOS:000822002600001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Rationale and design of the home automatic external defibrillator trial (HAT),"Most cardiac arrests occur in the home, where emergency medical services (EMS) systems are challenged to provide timely care. Because a large proportion of sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs) are due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, home use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) might offer an opportunity to decrease mortality in those at risk. Predicting who will have a cardiac arrest in the general population is difficult. Individuals at high risk are usually easily identified and may become candidates for implantable cardioverter defibrillators. It is within the population at lower risk where home AEDs may be most useful. The purpose of the Home Automatic External Defibrillator Trial (HAT) is to test whether providing home access to an AED can improve survival in patients at modest risk of SCA, such as those surviving an anterior myocardial infarction but in whom implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy is not deemed necessary. Between January 23, 2003, and October 20, 2005, 7001 patients were enrolled, with completion of follow-up scheduled for September 30, 2007. Randomization was conducted in a I : I fashion between control therapy, comprising the standard lay response to SCA (calling the EMS and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and the use of an AED first, followed by calling the EMS and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary end point is all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include survival from SCA (witnessed and unwitnessed, in home and out of home), incremental cost-effectiveness, and quality of life measures for both the patient and the spouse/companion.

Umbilical cord milking is an alternate method of rapid placental transfusion, but has been associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm neonates.

The VBNC state may pose a great threat to food safety and public health. To date, more than 100 VBNC microorganism species have been proven to exist in fields of food safety, environmental application, and agricultural diseases. Most harsh conditions can induce these microorganisms into the VBNC state, including food processing and preservation methods, adverse environmental conditions, and plant-disease controlling means. The characteristics of VBNC state cells differ from those of normally growing cells and dead cells, based on which of the various detection methods are developed, and they are of great significance for potential risk assessment. To provide molecular level insights into this state, many studies on induction and resuscitation mechanisms have emerged over the past three decades, including research on omics, specific genes, or proteins involved in VBNC state formation and the roles of promoters in resuscitation from the VBNC state. In this review, microorganism species, induction and resuscitation factors, detection methods, and formation and resuscitation mechanisms of the VBNC state are comprehensively and systematically summarized.",COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND FOOD SAFETY,2020,"Dong, K; Pan, HX; Yang, D; Rao, L; Zhao, L; Wang, YT; Liao, XJ",10.1111/1541-4337.12513,,WOS:000503339900001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"A comparison of α-methylnorepinephrine, vasopressin and epinephrine for cardiac resuscitation","The objective of this research was to compare the effects of an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, a selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, alpha-methylnorepinephrine (alpha-MNE), and a non-adrenergic vasopressin on post-resuscitation myocardial function and duration of survival. Epinephrine continues to be the primary adrenergic agent for advanced cardiac life support. However, its major inotropic actions and especially its beta-adrenergic and, to a lesser extent, its alpha(1)-actions increase the severity of global ischemia during cardiac arrest and adversely affect post-resuscitation myocardial function and survival. We had previously observed significantly better outcomes with a selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist when compared with epinephrine. Non-adrenergic vasopressin also has promise of more favorable actions. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to compare a selective alpha(2)-adrenergic vasopressor drug with vasopressin, epinephrine, and saline placebo. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in 20 Sprague-Dawley rats. Mechanical ventilation and precordial compression were initiated after 8 min of untreated VF. About 2 min later, alpha-MNE in a dose of 100 mug/kg, vasopressin in a dose of 0.4 U/kg, epinephrine in a dose of 30 mug/kg, or saline control was administered. Defibrillation was attempted after 6 min of CPR. Left ventricular pressure, dP/dt(40), -dP/dt, and cardiac index were measured for an interval of 240 min after resuscitation. Except for saline controls, comparable increases in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) were observed after each drug intervention. All animals were successfully resuscitated. Post-resuscitation myocardial function and survival were significantly better in animals treated with alpha-MNE. Both post-resuscitation myocardial function and survival were most improved after administration of the selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, intermediate after vasopressin and least after epinephrine and saline placebo.

Guidelines recommend that the decision involves competent and willing patients or, in the case of incapacitation, their families. In practice, patient autonomy is often compromised. Ideally, discussion of preferences for end-of-life care should take place prior to hospitalisation. The majority of research on this topic has been conducted on hospitalised patients, so little is known about the views of older, but healthy, people about resuscitation decision-making. The present study was designed to address this gap. A series of eight focus groups involving a total of 48 participants over the age of 65 was conducted to explore people's views about the factors guiding resuscitation decision-making. A qualitative analysis, which emphasised the dilemmatic nature of resuscitation decision-making, identified two broad thematic dilemmas that subsumed six specific themes which contribute to resolving the dilemmas: quality of life (medical condition, mental versus physical incapacity, age and ageing, and burden), and the involvement of others (doctors and families) versus loss of autonomy. The dilemma underlying quality of life is that an acceptable quality of life after CPR cannot be assured. The dilemma underlying the involvement of others is that individual autonomy may be lost. The themes and subthemes provide the basis for guiding these difficult discussions in advance of serious illness. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimisation can be considered in two parts: that of the patient's condition; and that of the care pathway. Optimising the patient's condition is less about improving long-term pathology, and more about correcting physiological derangement, such as electrolyte and fluid balance, blood loss, prompt treatment of sepsis, and ensuring appropriate continuation of medication in the peri-operative period. Optimising the care pathway involves ensuring that the system is designed to deliver reliably the appropriate interventions, such as prompt antibiotics, and access to computed tomography scanning and the operating theatre with minimal delay.",ANAESTHESIA,2019,"Poulton, T; Murray, D",10.1111/anae.14514,,WOS:000454713100013,A

Two patients orally ingested large amounts of the organophosphorous agent oxydemeton-methyll in suicide attempts, resulting in the hypercholinergic syndrome in both. Resuscitation included early administration of antidote by emergency medical personnel as well as high-dose atropine. Plasma levels of pseudo cholinesterase were initially very low in both patients. Long-term mechanical ventilation was necessary, and both patients developed aspiration pneumonia. At discharge, no major neurological deficits were present. Prompt antidote treatment and aggressive supportive emergency and intensive care unit therapy contribute to improved survival after acute organophosphate poisoning.

Twenty-four patients (16 men, mean age 56 years) with a history of either recurrent ventricular tachycardia or noninfarction ventricualr fibrillation were studied after antiarrhythmic therapy had been symptom-free on a tailored drug program for a mean of 31 months. Twenty of the 24 patients were hospitalized and underwent systematic drug withdrawal to assess continued need for therapy or because of intolerable side effects. In 4 patients, medication was discontinued either on their own or by their local physician. Recurrence after drug withdrawal was defined as either recurrence of the presenting arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) (12 patients) or reappearance of repetitive arrhythmia during Holter monitoring or exercise stress testing comparable to pretreatment levels (11 patients). The clinical arrhythmia recurred in 12 patients. Nine patients had a cardiac arrest.

Teaching CPR skills through short videos offers numerous advantages. However, potential inaccuracies or misinformation could mislead the public and impact the effectiveness of CPR education. This study aims to evaluate the quality and accuracy of CPR instructional videos shared on three major short video platforms in China (TikTok, Bilibili, and REDnote), analyze common irregular or erroneous practices, and provide valuable suggestions for content optimization. Methods The collected videos were evaluated using a five-point scoring criterion based on 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC). The videos were categorized into three levels: excellent, moderate, and poor, based on their video quality scores for CPR procedures and non-procedural content. Further categorization was made by video duration (<= 5 min as short; >5 min as long). Additionally, the most critical and prevalent irregularities or errors were documented, and a detailed analysis of the most popular video from each platform was carried out. The relationship between video quality and popularity, and video duration and popularity were examined separately. Results A total of 100 CPR instructional videos were analyzed. While 86% of the videos were produced by healthcare professionals, substantial errors were identified in critical areas such as the extra time spent removing foreign body airway obstruction (67%), and incorrect hand position during compression (62%). Other issues with non-procedural content were identified, including video acceleration (13%), lack of step-by-step explanations (61%), etc. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in popularity across videos of different quality or duration (p = 0.876 among video quality groups for CPR procedures, p = 0.988 among video quality groups for non-procedural content, p = 0.260 between video duration groups).

The average excess mortality rate over the follow-up period of 14 years was 1.81 (95% confidence interval = 1.76-1.86). Analyses of follow-up time windows showed different patterns for the average excess rate of mortality following TBI, with the greatest rates observed in year one after injury. Among identified pre-injury comorbidity factors, 33 were associated with excess mortality rates. These rates were comparable between sexes. Additional analyses in the validation dataset confirmed that these findings were unlikely a result of TBI misclassification or unmeasured confounding. Thus, detection and subsequent management of pre-injury health status should be an integral component of any strategy to reduce excess mortality in TBI patients. The complexity of pre-injury comorbidity calls for integration of multidisciplinary health services to meet TBI patients' needs and prevent adverse outcomes.",PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,2020,"Mollayeva, T; Hurst, M; Chan, V; Escobar, M; Sutton, M; Colantonio, A",10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106213,,WOS:000571475500037,A

Follow-up data are still missing. Methods: From November 2019 to September 2023, coronary artery bypass grafting via left anterior minithoracotomy on cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic cardiac arrest was performed as a routine procedure in 392 consecutive, nonemergency patients (345 men; 67.0 +/- 9.9 years; range, 32-88 years). All patients had multivessel coronary artery disease (77.6% 3-vessel-disease, 22.4% 2-vessel-disease, and 32.9% left main stenosis). Patients at old age (older than a 80 years, 12.5%), with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <30%, 7.9%), diabetes mellitus (34.9%), massive obesity (body mass index > 35, 8.9%), and chronic lung disease (17.1%) were included. Mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score was 2.9 +/- 2.8. Mean midterm follow-up (100%) was 15.2 +/- 10.7 months (range, 0.1-39.5 months). Results: Left internal thoracic artery (99.0%), radial artery (70.4%), and saphenous vein grafts (57.4%) were used, and 70.4% of patients received at least 2 arterial grafts. A total of 3.0 +/- 0.8 anastomoses (range, 2-5 anastomoses) per patient were performed to revascularize the territories of left anterior descending (98.7%), circumflex (91.6%), and right coronary (70.9%) artery.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Predicting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Machine Learning Models: Protocol fora Scoping Review,"Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains a public health conundrum with high morbidity and mortality rates. While early identification of high-risk patients could enable preventive interventions and improve survival, evidence on the effectiveness of current prediction methods remains inconclusive. Limited research exists on patients' prearrest pathophysiological status and predictive and prognostic factors of IHCA, highlighting the need for a comprehensive synthesis of predictive methodologies. Objective: This scoping review aims to synthesize and critically evaluate the quality and quantity of clinical features and machine learning (ML) models for predicting IHCA. The review will evaluate temporal characteristics, predictive and prognostic values of prearrest clinical features, and model performance metrics. Methods: This scoping review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and aims to synthesize studies that used ML algorithms to predict IHCA published between April 2009 and April 2024. We will conduct a comprehensive search using 4 major databases: PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Embase. The inclusion criteria are peer-reviewed, English-language studies that explore ML applications for predicting IHCA in adult patients (aged >= 18 years). Exclusion criteria include review articles, preprints, non-English-language studies, and studies without specific ML metrics for IHCA prediction. Two independent reviewers will conduct the screening and data extraction using Rayyan for deduplication and ensuring study eligibility. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data, and a narrative synthesis will provide insights into the clinical features used in the models, the performance metrics, and any gaps in the literature. Results: A total of 2479 records were identified between April 2009-April 2024. After removing duplicates and conducting screening, 16 studies have been included in the review. Data extraction and synthesis are ongoing and are expected to be completed by June 2025. The anticipated results from this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical predictors of IHCA used in ML models, including commonly reported clinical features such as vital signs, biomarkers, and comorbidities. We expect to highlight variations in data quality and quantity across studies, which may influence model performance. Conclusions: This study will contribute to advancing ML applications for IHCA prediction by addressing data challenges and promoting standardization to improve the clinical decision-making process. The results of this review are expected to inform future studies; promote consistency in the reporting of clinical features; and, ultimately, enhance the decision-making process in clinical settings, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients experiencing IHCA.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,CPR-Induced Life-Threatening Hemothorax in a Rescue PCI Patient: Case Report and Brief Challenges of Regional Centers,"Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is performed in cardiac arrests. There exist life support guidelines for individuals in performing effective CPR. CPR-related bleeding and hemothoraces are rare. Intercostal artery rupture leading up to shock and respiratory compromise in such situations is rare. Here, we present a unique case with a management dilemma while discussing challenges and guidance to regional centers. Case presentation: A 49-year-old Caucasian male experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest which required bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation from a colleague prior to commencement of lysis protocol at the local hospital. Transfer was later arranged to the nearest cardiac catheterization laboratory where a rescue percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in the left anterior descending artery that required strict dual antiplatelet use. Beneath the shroud of these events was a life-threatening right-sided hemothorax from rupture of intercostal arteries that occurred during initial resuscitation. Astute recognition of this post-percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in eventual transfer of the patient to a tertiary center where the source and the collection of the bleed was addressed. The patient's took a great trajectory to improvement. Conclusions: A regional center poses many challenges and limitations. Massive bleeding from intercostal arteries leading to hemorrhagic shock and respiratory compromise from an expanding hemothorax post-CPR is rare. Post-percutaneous coronary intervention use of dual antiplatelets posed a management dilemma that prompted assistance from tertiary counterparts. Clinicians should be astute and quick in assessing and providing care.",REPORTS,2024,"Thanabalasingam, V; Tan, C; Kapu, CS; Higgins, MD; Zhang, ZH",10.3390/reports7030069,,WOS:001323175300001,A

Those affected tend to abuse sympathomimetic drugs, have strong family histories, or have a significant burden of cardiac risk factors. Another uncommon cause of STEMI is coronary artery dissection, which overwhelmingly affects middle-and older-aged women with few cardiac risk factors. Case Report: A 22year- old athlete with no medical history was admitted to our institution post-cardiac arrest with an anterior STEMI and concomitant right coronary dissection. To our knowledge, this represents the first documented case of these simultaneous pathologies in a young cardiac arrest survivor. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Myocardial infarction is rare in young adults, and a diverse range of etiologies must be considered promptly to prevent delays in time-sensitive therapies, such as antiplatelet agents and revascularization. The emergency physician is most often the first point of contact in patients with acute coronary syndromes, and the failure to recognize it in young adults threatens them with premature death and potentially life-long disability.

Methods: This was a prospective one-armed feasibility study. Six progression criteria were identified related to the feasibility of the intervention and viability of a future effect study in terms of: participant :recruitment (1), participant retention (2,3,4), and completeness of outcomes (5,6). Data on participant/clinician satisfaction with the intervention was also collected along with self-reported outcomes: fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, depression, function and disability, and physical activity (at baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months) and physical capacity (baseline and 12 weeks). Results: Four progression criteria were met including retention (87.5%) and completion of baseline outcomes (97.5%). Two criteria were not met: recruitment rate was 2.9 participants per month (estimated rate needed 6.1) and completion of final outcomes was 65% (estimated proportion needed 75%). Participant/clinician satisfaction with the intervention was high. Three months after the SCARF intervention small to moderate effect size changes of r = 0.18-0.46 were found for self-reported fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, depression, function and disability and for two of the physical capacity tests (d = 0.46-0.52). Conclusion: SCARF was found to be a feasible intervention with high participant/clinician satisfaction, high participant retention and the possible potential to improve self-reported and physical capacity outcomes.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Particularities of hand and wrist complex injuries in polytrauma management,"Hand and wrist lesions are relatively common in polytraumatised patients. These subjects sustain a wide range of potential life-threatening conditions and hand and wrist injuries incurred are often not diagnosed or are insufficiently treated. Closed lesions are the most frequently missed diagnosis, but even severe open lesions may be incorrectly treated. Most of these hand and wrist injuries can have a strong negative impact on long-term quality of life, particularly when treatment of these injuries is poor or delayed. Orthopaedic and hand surgeons should be vigilant in their assessment and treatment of patients with multiple injuries and a global approach, based on the advanced trauma life support (ATLS)-protocol, must be applied. The very common association of head, chest, abdomen, bone and soft-tissue lesions in the polytraumatised patient requires a multidisciplinary team approach from the beginning. The energy of trauma in these patients often causes complex injuries to the wrist and hand; these require correct treatment in terms of both timing and techniques. It is not possible to create a practical, useful guideline with a ""one lesion-one solution'' approach, because every case is different; therefore, this paper describes a spectrum of indications and techniques that may be useful in managing hand and wrist injuries, particularly in polytraumatised patients.

Increasing survival at lower gestational ages has had a significant impact on this complexity. It also has an impact on healthcare resource utilization and policy development in Canada. This study sought to determine the current attitudes and practices of neonatologists in Canada, and to assess moral distress associated with resuscitation decisions in the ELGAN population. It also aimed to explore the perspectives of adopting a shared decision-making approach where further data with regard to best interests and prognosis are gathered in an individualized manner after birth. Methods Neonatologists in Canadian level III NICUs were surveyed in 2020. Results Amongst the 65 responses, 78% expressed moral distress when parents request non-resuscitation at 24 weeks. Uncertainty around long-term outcomes in an era with improved chances of morbidity-free survival was the most prominent factor contributing to moral distress. 70% felt less moral distress deciding goals of care after the baby's initial resuscitation and preferred an individualized approach to palliation decisions based on postnatal course and assessment. Conclusions While most current guidelines still support the option of non-resuscitation for infants born at less than 25 weeks, we show evidence of moral distress among Canadian neonatologists that suggests the consideration of routine resuscitation from 24 weeks and above is a more ethical approach in the current era of improved outcomes.

To date, more than 100 microbial species have been reported to enter the VBNC state under various stressful conditions. In the VBNC state, cells undergo morphological, physiological, and genetic changes, with the mechanisms of VBNC state formation differing among microbial species and stressful conditions. Although the VBNC state has been extensively investigated in the fields of medicine and food safety, research on the VBNC state of pollutant-degrading microorganisms remains limited. Mounting evidence has confirmed the existence of the VBNC state in microorganisms capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phenol. The resuscitation of VBNC microorganisms, which represent a significant portion of microbial resources, is crucial for the effective microbial remediation of polluted environments. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the formation, characteristics, and mechanisms of the VBNC state in microorganisms. It also outlines various methods for resuscitating VBNC bacteria, with a specific focus on resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs).

Here, we use genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to understand of the microbial interaction in a simple and effective resuscitation process for long-term cryopreserved anammox consortia by sequential addition of anammox SBR supernatant. Performance results showed that sequential addition of anammox supernatant significantly reduced the resuscitation time of the granule-based anammox process from 40 to 20 days. Genome-centric metagenomics were used to recover 19 high-quality draft genomes of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria. Comparative metatranscriptomic analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression of Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, the dominant anammox bacterium, and heterotrophic bacteria to better understand their potential interactions. Proteobacteria-affiliated bacteria found in the supernatant were highly active in producing the secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate which are needed for growth of the auxotrophic anammox bacteria. In addition, the significantly higher expression levels of hzsA and CO2-fixtion genes in the Candidatus Kuenenia genome indicated the anammox bacteria were likely more active and growing faster after sequential anammox supernatant addition during the resuscitation process. The resuscitation treatment pulse assays confirmed that sequential addition of supernatant was an effective way for the rapid resuscitation of anammox consortia. Our findings offer the first evidence of cross-feeding during the rapid resuscitation of cryo-preserved anammox consortia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Epidemiologic metrics and trends over time for OHCA cases in Canada are not well defined. This study evaluated geographic differences in the incidence and outcomes of OHCA patients admitted to hospitals across Canada, during the period 2013-2017. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study included 10,492 nontraumatic OHCA patients aged 2-85 years (66% male) who were admitted to an acute-care hospital in any Canadian province or territory (excluding Quebec) between 2013 and 2017. Overall age- and sex-standardized incidence measures (per 100,000 population per year) were calculated through direct standardization to the 2016 Ca- nadian population. Temporal trends in incidence and survival to hos- pital discharge were evaluated. Results: The overall age- and sex-standardized incidence of OHCA patients admitted to the hospital was 8.3 per 100,000 population per year, which did not change significantly from 2013 to 2017 (incidence rate ratio: 1.01, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.02). The incidence was highest in British Columbia (9.2 per 100,000 population per year), Manitoba (9.0 per 100,000 population per year), and Nova Scotia (9.0 per 100,000 population per year), and lowest in New Brunswick (6.5 per 100,000 population per year), Prince Edward Island (6.8 per 100,000 population per year), and Saskatchewan (7.5 per 100,000 population per year). The proportion of OHCA patients who survived to hospital discharge was highest in Prince Edward Island (57%) and lowest in Ontario (38%). No significant trend in rates of survival to hospital discharge was observed from 2013 (43%) to 2017 (42%; P = 0.86).

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE: ACCIDENTAL ATENOLOL TOXICITY?,"Background: Antihypertensive medications, including beta-blockers, are widely used in patients with chronic kidney disease. Unlike most beta-blockers, atenolol is excreted primarily by the kidney, and its clearance by peritoneal dialysis is poor. These pharmacokinetic factors may predispose patients to gradual accumulation of the drug over time. Objectives: To review the management of a diagnostic dilemma, the role of glucagon therapy, and the clinical implications of atenolol clearance. Case Report: A young woman with end-stage renal disease requiring peritoneal dialysis presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability with hypotension and relative bradycardia. The patient reported that she took her regular four antihypertensive agents, including atenolol, with no excess ingestion or recent dose changes. After resuscitation and consideration of a broad differential diagnosis, the most likely cause of the patient's illness was determined to be unintentional atenolol toxicity, with secondary mesenteric ischemia due to a low-flow state that caused her abdominal pain. Glucagon therapy led to rapid correction of the patient's hemodynamic instability and pain. Conclusion: The unique pharmacokinetics of long-term medications must be considered in patients with impaired clearance, such as this patient with end-stage renal disease treated by peritoneal dialysis. Medications may gradually accumulate to supratherapeutic levels, which over time may lead to symptoms of significant toxicity.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Role of buccal PCO2 in the management of fluid resuscitation during hemorrhagic shock,"Arterial pressure is a widely used measurement for estimating the severity of hemorrhagic shock and to guide its management. However, this capability is reduced when very low arterial pressure values cannot be reliably measured by noninvasive methods. Moreover, hypoperfusion may be masked by compensatory hemodynamic changes, and therefore, in the presence of near normal blood pressure, tissue hypoperfusion may progress undetected. Accordingly, hypercarbia is a general phenomenon of perfusion failure, which occurs in coincidence of the onset of hypotension and is promptly reversed with restoration of normal blood flows. Increases in buccal mucosa PCO2 are highly correlated with increases in gastric wall and sublingual mucosa PCO2 and decreases in tissue blood flows during hemorrhagic shock. In both clinical and experimental settings, tissue PCO2 measured in the oral mucosa proved to be a practical and reliable measurement for the diagnosis of circulatory failure states and an indicator of its severity. In contrast to intraarterial pressure, buccal PCO2 discriminated between short- and long-term survival after large-volume blood loss. Buccal Pco(2) measurement therefore emerges as a useful predictor for survival and outcome and a useful guide to manage fluid resuscitation during hemorrhagic shock.",CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2006,"Ristagno, G; Tang, WV; Sun, SJ; Weil, MH",10.1097/01.CCM.0000247722.24781.D0,,WOS:000242540100006,A

Three groups of 10 rats each were subjected to 10 min of untreated VF and resuscitation attempted by providing chest compression for up to 8 min with the depth of compression adjusted to attain an aortic diastolic pressure between 26 and 28 mmHg (to secure a coronary perfusion pressure above 20 mmHg) followed by electrical shocks. Rats received AVE4454B (1 mg/kg), cariporide (1 mg/kg), or vehicle control immediately before chest compression. We observed that NHE-1 inhibition (NHEI) preserved left ventricular myocardial distensibility during chest compression evidenced by less depth of compression required to attain the target aortic diastolic pressure corresponding to (mean +/- standard deviation) 14.1 +/- 1.1 mm in the AVE4454B group (P < 0.001 versus control), 15.0 +/- 1.4 mm in the cariporide group (P < 0.01 versus control), and 17.0 +/- 1.2 mm in controls. When the depth of compression was related to the coronary perfusion pressure generated-an index of left ventricular distensibility-only the cariporide group attained statistical significance. Postresuscitation, both compounds ameliorated myocardial dysfunction evidenced by lesser reductions in mean aortic pressure and the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure increase as well as earlier normalization of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increases. This effect was associated with improved survival corresponding to 55% in the AVE4454B group (not significant) and 70% in the cariporide group (P < 0.01 versus control by Gehan-Breslow analysis) at 240 min postresuscitation. An inverse correlation was found between plasma cytochrome c and indices of left ventricular function at 240 min postresuscitation suggesting that NHEI exerts beneficial effects in part by attenuating mitochondria! injury. We conclude that cariporide is more effective than AVE4454B for resuscitation from cardiac arrest given its more prominent effect on preserving left ventricular myocardial distensibility and promoting survival.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Amniotic fluid embolism rescued by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"Background Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but often catastrophic complication of pregnancy that leads to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Although few case reports have reported successful use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) with AFE, concerns can be raised about the increased bleeding risks with that device. Methods This study included patients with AFE rescued by VA-ECMO hospitalized in two high ECMO volume centers between August 2008 and February 2021. Clinical characteristics, critical care management, in-intensive care unit (ICU) complications, and hospital outcomes were collected. ICU survivors were assessed for health-related quality of life (HRQL) in May 2021. Results During that 13-year study period, VA-ECMO was initiated in 54 parturient women in two high ECMO volume centers. Among that population, 10 patients with AFE [median (range) age 33 (24-40), SAPS II at 69 (56-81)] who fulfilled our diagnosis criteria were treated with VA-ECMO. Pregnancy evolved for 36 (30-41) weeks. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest before ECMO and two were cannulated under cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pre-ECMO hemodynamic was severely impaired with an inotrope score at 370 (55-1530) mu g/kg/min, a severe left ventricular ejection fraction measured at 14 (0-40)%, and lactate at 12 (2-30) mmol/L. 70% of these patients were alive at hospital discharge despite an extreme pre-ECMO severity and massive blood product transfusion. However, HRQL was lower than age-matched controls and still profoundly impaired in the role-physical, bodily pain, and general health components after a median of 44 months follow-up. Conclusion In this rare per-delivery complication, our results support the use of VA-ECMO despite intense DIC and ongoing bleeding.

With available data from the long-term studies, a wide variety of manifestations have been described, with recognition of autonomic features as being the most prominent aspect of this epilepsy. The presenting symptoms are usually focal seizures comprising autonomic symptoms and/or behavioral changes. Majority of these seizures are in sleep, with half of the seizures progressing to become secondarily generalized. Occasionally, these seizures can present with prominent autonomic features such as ictal vomiting, pallor, flushing/cyanosis, and tachycardia with prolonged thermoregulatory changes lasting for hours, constituting autonomic status epilepticus. Recovery from this autonomic status epilepticus is within hours and is always complete. Autonomic status epilepticus has been previously reported in this epilepsy syndrome, but ictal cardiorespiratory arrest is extremely rare, with only 4 cases being reported in literature.

Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (BCPR) can double the chance of survival but occurs less often in these communities in comparison to more affluent communities. People living in deprived communities are, therefore, doubly disadvantaged and there is limited evidence to explain why BCPR rates are lower. The aim of this paper is to examine the barriers to administering BCPR in deprived communities. Method Mixed method qualitative study with ten single sex focus groups (n = 61) conducted in deprived communities across central Scotland and 18 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from the UK, Europe and the USA. Results Two key themes related to confidence and environmental factors were identified to summarise the perceived barriers to administering BCPR in deprived communities. Barriers related to confidence included: self-efficacy; knowledge and awareness of how, and when, to administer CPR; accessing CPR training; having previous experience of administering BCPR; who required CPR; and whether the bystander was physically fit to give CPR. Environmental barriers focused on the safety of the physical environment in which people lived, and fear of reprisal from gangs or the police. Conclusions Barriers to administering BCPR identified in the general population are relevant to people living in deprived communities but are exacerbated by a range of contextual, individual and environmental factors.

Because the survival rate is now fairly high, important questions about neurological sequelae or quality of life after LT have emerged. Indeed, LT represents a peculiar situation because up to 30% of patients present with neurological symptoms after LT compared with only 4% after cardiac transplant and 0.5% after renal transplant. These postoperative neurological symptoms have long been interpreted as sequelae of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, postoperative decompensation of an unknown cerebral condition due to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis or undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorders or aging constitute other possibilities that are underrecognized. Some patients who undergo LT for acute liver failure and patients with cirrhosis without episodes of HE and without any previous cerebral alteration also display post-LT neurological symptoms. This latter situation speaks in favor of a direct adverse effect of either general anesthesia, the surgical procedure, or factors related to the postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) environment. The role of inflammation, which has been described in the ICU setting, could also be a crucial determinant. In this review, we will discuss the neurological complications associated with LT, the neurocognitive complications after LT, and how to assess the LT-related neurological or neurocognitive complications.

Patient selection criteria comprise prognostic characteristics of cardiac arrest such as witnessed status, resuscitation efforts within 5 min, shockable initial rhythm, and characteristics of effective cCPR such as signs of life during resuscitation, persistent ventricular fibrillation, intermittent episodes of spontaneous circulation or end-tidal CO2 levels constantly > 10 mm Hg, patient age and health status. The timeframe from cardiac arrest to eCPR is a major contributor for neurologically favourable survival and should not exceed 60 min according to current guidelines. This may be achieved with an efficient ""load & go"" strategy, including early patient selection and rapid transport with ongoing mechanical cCPR to the eCPR centre, or with a prehospital eCPR strategy. Two randomized controlled eCPR trials demonstrated survival rates of 43% and 31.5% in patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation and cardiac-origin cardiac arrest, respectively.

Methods: A pooled, post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials was conducted. Baseline frailty was assessed using a Frailty Index (FI), and participants were categorized into data-derived tertiles. Multivariable Cox models with multiplicative interaction terms (frailty x treatment arm) were constructed to evaluate whether baseline frailty status modified the treatment effect of the initial invasive (vs conservative) strategy on a composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest and the secondary outcome of HRQoL (Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]). Results: Among 5322 participants (mean 64 years, 24% female), a high frailty burden (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1) was associated with lower baseline SAQ scores and increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes on follow-up. Baseline frailty burden did not significantly modify the effect of the initial invasive strategy on the primary composite outcome (P(interaction)frailty x intervention arm = 0.30). However, frailty significantly modified the effect of the initial invasive strategy on HRQoL, with higher baseline frailty burden associated with greater improvement in SAQ scores at 1 year with initial invasive (vs. conservative) treatment (P(interaction)frailty x intervention arm < 0.001). The treatment effect of an initial invasive vs. conservative strategy on 12-month SAQ score change was most pronounced in individuals with lower baseline SAQ scores in both higher and lower frailty burden groups.

The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that sudden cardiac arrest is responsible for about 250 000 out-of-hospital deaths annually in the United States. Since the early 1990s, the AHA has called for innovative approaches to reduce time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation and improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest. In the mid-1990s, the AHA launched a public health initiative to promote early CPR and early use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by trained lay responders in community (lay rescuer) AED programs. Between 1995 and 2000, all 50 states passed laws and regulations concerning lay rescuer AED programs. In addition, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act (CASA, Public Law 106-505) was passed and signed into federal law in 2000. The variations in state and federal legislation and regulations have complicated efforts to promote lay rescuer AED programs and in some cases have created impediments to such programs. Since 2000, most states have reexamined lay rescuer AED statutes, and many have passed legislation to remove impediments and encourage the development of lay rescuer AED programs. The purpose of this statement is to help policymakers develop new legislation or revise existing legislation to remove barriers to effective community lay rescuer AED programs.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system may mediate the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression; therefore, this study measured CA/CPR-induced changes in CRF receptor binding and HPA axis negative feedback. Mice were exposed to CA/CPR or SHAM surgery and assessed 7 or 21 days later. Consistent with earlier demonstrations of anxiety-like behavior 7 days after CA/CPR, increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field was also present 21 days after CA/CPR. On postoperative day 7, CA/CPR was associated with an increase in basal serum corticosterone concentration relative to SHAM, but this difference resolved by postoperative day 21. The Dexamethasone Suppression Test showed that the CA/CPR group had enhanced negative feedback compared with SHAM controls at postoperative day 21. Furthermore, there was a gradual increase in CRF1 receptor binding in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, as well as a transient decrease of both CRF1 and CRF2A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. Therefore, sustained changes in activity of the HPA axis and the CRF system after CA/CPR may contribute to the postischemic increase in affective disorders.

This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of post- asphyxial aftercare strategies and forms part of a supplement describing an extensive synthesis of effective newborn interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Evidence was generated by performing de novo reviews, updates to reviews via systematic searches, and reanalyses of studies conducted in LMICs from existing reviews. Results: Sixty-one trials recruiting 5,046 term infants post-asphyxia were included across all intervention domains. Limited studies were available from LMICs related to fl uid restriction, antiseizure medications, and early interventions to improve developmental outcomes. Our reanalysis of whole- body cooling trials in LMICs found effects on neonatal mortality and mortality or neurological disability in infancy differed significantly based on the care center and type of cooling device used. Pharmacological therapies for neuroprotection evaluated in 27 trials in middle-income countries had varied effects in neonates with encephalopathy. Majority of the trials (60%) focused on magnesium sulfate therapy and showed significant improvements in short-term mortality and morbidities. Conclusion: The sample sizes of included trials were relatively small, and the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Evidence on long-term survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes was limited. Further research on promising neuroprotective therapies and factors affecting their implementation in low-resource contexts is required. To reduce the high burden related to asphyxia in LMICs, this review underscores the need for a paradigm shift toward prevention, and strategies that emphasize improving antenatal and obstetric care.

This study explores the clinical demand for emergency medical outreach services at Taoyuan International Airport (TIA), Taiwan. Methods: Electronic medical records collected from TIA medical outreach services from 2017 to 2018, included passengers' profiles, flight information, events location, chief complaints, diagnosis (using ICD-9 -CM codes), and management outcomes. Medical events distribution was stratified by location and ages, and were compared statistically. Results: Among 1,501 eligible records, there were 81.8% ground-based emergency medical events (GBME), 16.9% in-flight medical events (IFME) managed after scheduled landing, and 1.3% IFME leading to unscheduled diversion or re-entry to TIA. The top three GBME diagnoses were associated with neurological (23.3%), gastrointestinal (21.2%), and trauma-related (19.3%) conditions. The top three IFME diagnosis that prompted unscheduled landings via flight diversion or re-entry were neurological (47.4%), psychological (15.8%), and cardiovascular (10.5%). The chief complaints that prompted unscheduled landings were mostly related to neurological (42.1%), cardiovascular (26.3%), and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) (10.5%) symptoms. A higher frequency of IFME events due to dermatologic causes in patients aged <= 18 years compared with adults and older adults (19 vs. 1.5% and 0, respectively); and a higher frequency of IFME due to cardiovascular causes in adults >= 65 years compared with patients aged <= 65 (15.1 vs. 9%). Among all IFME patients, six out-of-hospital deaths occurred among passengers from scheduled landings and two deaths occurred among 18 IFME passengers who were transferred to local hospitals from flight diversion or re-entry. A statistically significant difference in outcomes and short-term follow-up status was found between patients with IFME and those with GBME (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Ground-based emergency medical events exceeded in-flight medical events at TIA. The most frequent events were related to neurological, gastrointestinal symptoms, or trauma.

Electrical storms (ESs) in this population are life-threatening and typically require urgent administration of isoproterenol; however, in resource-limited settings, alternative pharmacologic strategies may be required. The management of ES in BrS is complex and often relies on case reports due to the rarity of the condition.Case summary A 50-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with sudden cardiac arrest during a social event. Following successful resuscitation and multiple defibrillations for ventricular fibrillation, the patient was transferred to our centre with an ECG showing a spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern. Despite therapy with multiple antiarrhythmic agents including amiodarone and lidocaine, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation. In the absence of isoproterenol, low-dose adrenaline infusion was initiated, resulting in prompt termination of ES. A single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was subsequently implanted in combination with quinidine and cilostazol for long-term suppression of arrhythmic events and prevention of recurrent ES. Genetic testing revealed two SCN5A mutations [c.4744C>T (p.Arg1582Cys) and c.3067C>T (p.Arg1023Cys)]; the first has not been previously reported in BrS.Discussion This case underscores the potential utility of adrenaline as an accessible and effective alternative in the acute management of ES in BrS patients, if isoproterenol is unavailable. It also highlights the importance of genetic evaluation in BrS for tailored therapeutic strategies.",EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS,2025,"Vo, DT; Tran, DC; Kieu, DN; Nguyen, TT; Dao, BTT",10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf364,,WOS:001548973000001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Cryopreservation and Resuscitation of Natural Aquatic Prokaryotic Communities,"Experimental reproducibility in aquatic microbial ecology is critical to predict the dynamics of microbial communities. However, controlling the initial composition of naturally occurring microbial communities that will be used as the inoculum in experimental setups is challenging, because a proper method for the preservation of those communities is lacking. To provide a feasible method for preservation and resuscitation of natural aquatic prokaryote assemblages, we developed a cryopreservation procedure applied to natural aquatic prokaryotic communities. We studied the impact of inoculum size, processing time, and storage time on the success of resuscitation. We further assessed the effect of different growth media supplemented with dissolved organic matter (DOM) prepared from naturally occurring microorganisms on the recovery of the initially cryopreserved communities obtained from two sites that have contrasting trophic status and environmental heterogeneity. Our results demonstrated that the variability of the resuscitation process among replicates decreased with increasing inoculum size. The degree of similarity between initial and resuscitated communities was influenced by both the growth medium and origin of the community. We further demonstrated that depending on the inoculum source, 45-72% of the abundant species in the initially natural microbial communities could be detected as viable cells after cryopreservation. Processing time and long-term storage up to 12 months did not significantly influence the community composition after resuscitation. However, based on our results, we recommend keeping handling time to a minimum and ensure identical incubation conditions for repeated resuscitations from cryo-preserved aliquots at different time points. Given our results, we recommend cryopreservation as a promising tool to advance experimental research in the field of microbial ecology.",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2021,"Rain-Franco, A; de Moraes, GP; Beier, S",10.3389/fmicb.2020.597653,,WOS:000616990800001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Public access defibrillation: a shocking idea?,"Currently, survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom is poor. Ambulance response standards require that an ambulance reach 75 per cent of cardiac arrests within 8 min. But a short time to defibrillation from the onset of collapse is a key predictor of outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Department of Health has recently implemented a lay responder defibrillation programme, with the aim of shortening this time interval for victims in public places. This initiative utilizes automated external defibrillators (AEDs). which provide written and recorded voice prompts to minimize training requirements and errors in use. Lay responder AED programmes with very short response times have reported survival to discharge rates of up to 53 per cent for patients presenting in ventricular fibrillation (VF). This compares well with the results of a meta-analysis that reported a survival rate of only 6.4 per cent for traditional defibrillator-equipped ambulance systems. The annual incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in England is 123 per 100 000 population. Approximately half of these present in VF, and could benefit from an AED programme. But only 16 per cent of cardiac arrests occur in a public place. It has been calculated that there are approximately 5000 instances of VF in public places each year in England. If half of these patients can be reached and administered a first shock within 4 min of their collapse, an additional 400 victims may survive each year. Given the current investment by the DoH of pound2 million, this suggests a cost per life saved of approximately pound 505 over a 10 year period.",JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE,2001,"Woollard, M",10.1093/pubmed/23.2.98,,WOS:000169436100003,A

Design Systematic review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and grey literature sources were searched from inception to November/December 2020. Study eligibility criteria Observational studies assessing a population of exercise-related SCA (out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred during exercise or within 1 hour of cessation of activity), where bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or automated external defibrillator (AED) use were reported, and survival outcomes were ascertained. Methods Among all included studies, the median (IQR) proportions of bystander CPR and bystander AED use, as well as median (IQR) rate of survival to hospital discharge, were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies were included in this review, with a median study duration of 78.7 months and a median sample size of 91. Most exercise-related SCA patients were male (median: 92%, IQR: 86%-96%), middle-aged (median: 51, IQR: 39-56 years), and presented with a shockable arrest rhythm (median: 78%, IQR: 62%-86%). Bystander CPR was initiated in a median of 71% (IQR: 59%-87%) of arrests, whereas bystander AED use occurred in a median of 31% (IQR: 19%-42%) of arrests. Among the 19 studies that reported survival to hospital discharge, the median rate of survival was 32% (IQR: 24%-49%). Studies which evaluated the relationship between bystander interventions and survival outcomes reported that both bystander CPR and AED use were associated with survival after exercise-related SCA.

However, even among shoulder specialists there is controversy regarding the best treatment strategy. Questions/purposes To evaluate for (1) a greater risk of in-hospital major adverse events, (2) a greater risk for in-hospital surgical complications, and (3) a greater risk of 30-day mortality, locking plate fixation and RTSA were compared for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures of patients aged 65 years and older after controlling for potentially confounding variables in a large-database analysis. Methods Health claims data of the largest German insurance company including approximately one-third of the population (26.5 million policyholders) between 2010 and 2018 were analyzed. This database was chosen because of its size, nationwide distribution, and high quality/completeness. In total, 55,070 patients (>= 65 years of age) treated with locking plate fixation (75% [41,216]) or RTSA (25% [13,854]) for proximal humeral fracture were compared. As primary endpoints, major adverse events (including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, organ failure, resuscitation, and death) and surgical complications (infection, hematoma, loss of reduction, dislocation, and revision surgery) were analyzed. The risk of all endpoints was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression models in the context of comorbidities to address existing group differences. Results After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as age, sex, and risk profile, RTSA was associated with a higher risk for major adverse events (OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.29 to 1.53]; p < 0.001) and surgical complications (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.21]; p < 0.01) compared with locking plate fixation. There was no evidence for an increase in mortality (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.86 to 1.12]; p = 0.81). Conclusion The increased in-hospital risk for major adverse events and surgical complications may moderate the enthusiasm associated with RTSA for proximal humeral fractures in patients 65 years and older.

An arrhythmia is a deviation in the shape of the ECG signal from the normal sinus rhythm. Long-term arrhythmias are the primary sources of cardiac disorders. Shockable arrhythmias, a type of life-threatening arrhythmia in cardiac patients, are characterized by disorganized or chaotic electrical activity in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), disrupting blood flow throughout the body. This condition may lead to sudden cardiac arrest in most patients. Therefore, detecting and classifying shockable arrhythmias is crucial for prompt defibrillation. In this work, various machine and deep learning algorithms from the literature are analyzed and summarized, which is helpful in automatic classification of shockable arrhythmias. Additionally, the advantages of these methods are compared with existing traditional unsupervised methods. The importance of digital signal processing techniques based on feature extraction, feature selection, and optimization is also discussed at various stages.

Less agreement exists when this point is reached. We investigated the influence of three major considerations for in-hospital DNAR orders: expected survival probability after resuscitation, prospects of the patients? current condition without a cardiac arrest and the patients' autonomous decision not to want resuscitation. We calculated an expected survival probability according to two multi-morbidity prediction scores for each patient, assuming the event of cardiac arrest. The prospects of the current condition without a cardiac arrest was estimated by the patients' physician, in terms of life expectancy and quality of life (level of dependency after discharge and pain). The patients' preference was documented from the medical records. A total of 470 patients were included in the study. Fifty-eight patients (12%) had a DNAR-order, 11 of these patients (19%) wanted no resuscitation. The patients' prospects (life expectancy, dependency after discharge), and age proved to be independently associated with the presence of a DNAR order. The odds ratio (OR) for the presence of a DNAR order was 37 (CL 14-107) for an estimated life expectancy less than 3 months, 13 (CL 4-41) for a life in a nursing home and four (CL 2-12) for an age of 80 years and older. Expected survival probability after resuscitation and pain were not independently associated with a DNAR order. We conclude that resuscitation is considered futile on the basis of the patients' age and prospects without cardiac arrest and that the impact of expected survival probability on these decisions is small.

We sought to determine the outcomes of recipients receiving organs from DCD EVLP donors in a multicenter setting. Methods: This was an unplanned post hoc analysis of a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized trial that took place during 2011 to 2017 with 3 years of followup. Patients were placed into 3 groups based off procurement strategy: brain- dead donor (control), brain-dead donor evaluated by EVLP, and DCD donors evaluated by EVLP. The primary outcomes were severe primary graft dysfunction at 72 hours and survival. Secondary outcomes included select perioperative outcomes, and 1-year and 3-years allograft function and quality of life measures. Results: The DCD EVLP group had significantly fi cantly higher incidence of severe primary graft dysfunction at 72 hours (P P = .03), longer days on mechanical ventilation (P P < .001) and in-hospital length of stay (P P = .045). Survival at 3 years was 76.5% % (95% % CI, 69.2%-84.7%) %-84.7 % ) for the control group, 68.3% % (95% % CI, 58.9%- %- 79.1%) % ) for the brain-dead donor group, and 60.7% % (95% % CI, 45.1%-81.8%) %-81.8 % ) for the DCD group (P P = .36). At 3-year follow-up, presence observed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or quality of life metrics did not differ among the groups. Conclusions: Although DCD EVLP allografts might not be appropriate to transplant in every candidate recipient, the expansion of their use might afford recipients stagnant on the waitlist a viable therapy.

In order to determine ultimate efficacy for this or other drugs, clinical trials must be performed in human subjects. In several human clinical trials, though, drug administration has been significantly delayed following resuscitation from CA. These experiments test the hypothesis that post-resuscitative delay in ALCAR administration will impair the ability of this drug to promote neurologic recovery. Neurological deficit scoring (23 h) as well as frontal cortex lactate levels (2 and 24 h) were. compared following resuscitation from 10 min CA in dogs receiving either ALCAR or drug vehicle 30 min following ROSC. Dogs treated with ALCAR 30 min following ROSC from 10 min CA exhibited more normal cerebral cortex lactate levels than did vehicle control animals. There was no difference, however, in neurologic deficit scores between groups, with all animals demonstrating moderate to severe clinical neurologic impairment at 23 h following ROSC. A 30-min delay in ALCAR administration following ROSC from 10 min CA impairs the ability of this drug to promote neurologic recovery despite apparent normalization of brain lactate levels.

When the etiology of arrest is unclear, particularly without clear signs of life-threatening trauma, standard basic and advanced cardiac life support (BCLS/ACLS) treatments for medical cardiac arrest is appropriate. Traumatic circulatory arrest may result from massive hemorrhage, airway obstruction, obstructive shock, respiratory disturbances, cardiogenic causes or massive head trauma. While resuscitation and/or transport is appropriate for some populations, it is appropriate to withhold or discontinue resuscitation attempts for TOHCA patients for whom these efforts are non-beneficial. This position statement and resource document were written as an update to the 2013 joint position statements.NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT recommend:EMS resuscitation of adults with TOHCA should:Prioritize prompt identification of patients who may benefit from transport to definitive care at trauma centers when safe and appropriate.Emphasize the identification of reversible causes of traumatic circulatory arrest and timely use of clinically indicated life-saving interventions (LSIs) within the EMS clinician's scope of practice.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Artificial intelligence based resuscitation simulation: a pilot study of a novel approach to team leadership training,"Introduction Team leadership training is essential alongside with technical training for effective resuscitation management. Addressing this gap, we developed a novel simulation system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create Artificial Intelligence (Al) agents simulating team members in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) scenarios. This pilot study aimed to to develop a novel LLM-based ACLS simulation training platform and evaluate its performance in simulated resuscitation scenarios on established protocols.<br /> Method Using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet API, we designed a simulation system with four Al agents assigned specific roles as healthcare staff within an ACLS team. Each agent strictly followed the 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) ACLS guidelines while interacting with an ACLS certified emergency medicine specialist user. The ten patient scenario transcripts were evaluated with three blinded emergency medicine specialists whether all the recommended steps are completed. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Kendall's W and Krippendorff's Alpha statistics to evaluate agreement both within raters and the model.<br /> Results Al agents consistently adhered to the AHA 2020 ACIS algorithm across scenarios, with a high inter-rater reliability (Kendall's W > 0.75 ) . Krippendorff's Alpha values for agreement ranged from substantial (0.84) to almost perfect (0.99), indicating robust compliance with guidelines and effective simulation of resuscitation responses.<br /> Conclusion This study highlights the potential of LL.M-powered simulations as an adjunct to traditional resuscitation training. The system effectively supported team leadership training by providing consistent and guideline-compliant responses.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Correction of Murine SCID-X1 by Lentiviral Gene Therapy Using a Codon-optimized IL2RG Gene and Minimal Pretransplant Conditioning,"Clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy to treat X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) using retroviral vectors, leading to immune system functionality in the majority of treated patients without pretransplant conditioning. The success was tempered by insertional oncogenesis in a proportion of the patients. To reduce the genotoxicity risk, a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector (LV) with improved expression of a codon optimized human interleukin-2 receptor gamma gene (IL2RG) cDNA (co gamma c), regulated by its 1.1 kb promoter region (gamma cPr), was compared in efficacy to the viral spleen focus forming virus (SF) and the cellular phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoters. Pretransplant conditioning of IL2rg(-/-) mice resulted in long-term reconstitution of T and B lymphocytes, normalized natural antibody titers, humoral immune responses, ConA/IL-2 stimulated spleen cell proliferation, and polyclonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements with a clear integration preference of the SF vector for proto-oncogenes, contrary to the PGK and gamma cPr vectors. We conclude that SIN lentiviral gene therapy using co gamma c driven by the gamma cPr or PGK promoter corrects the SCID phenotype, potentially with an improved safety profile, and that low-dose conditioning proved essential for immune competence, allowing for a reduced threshold of cell numbers required.

Several international guidelines have thus incorporated TTM in the management of the postresuscitation phase. However, despite extremely promising results in animal models and in randomized trials including selected patient cohorts, TTM benefits on neurological outcome have been questioned. Moreover, TTM potential side effects have raised some concerns on its wide application in all cardiac arrest patients in different healthcare systems. There is indeed still relatively large uncertainty concerning some practical aspects related to TTM application, such as: A) how to select patients who will benefit the most from TTM; B) the optimal time to initiate TTM; C) the best target temperature; D) the most effective methods to provide TTM; E) the length of the cooling phase; and F) the optimal rewarming rate and fever control strategies.

Although the overall incidence of CAS during coronary angiography is estimated to be between 0.3% and 1%, CAS remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated cause of acute cardiac events. Case outline We report a case of a 62-year-old male presenting with cardiac arrest and repeated ST segment elevations during chest pain episodes, caused by initially unrecognized CAS. Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is generally not recommended for the treatment of CAS, due to clinical manifestations and the presence of underlying flow-limiting stenosis, we decided to perform PCI of the left anterior descending coronary artery. During the two-year-follow up period, the patient reported no chest pains nor exercise limitations at regular outpatient controls.Conclusion CASs should be considered an unrecognized cause of refractory angina, acute coronary syndrome, malignant arrhythmia, and even cardiac arrest.

Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have been available for some years and as a result defibrillation can be carried out by individuals other than physicians and healthcare providers such as trained first responders and untrained lay rescuers. This so-called public access defibrillation nourished hope of progress in the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest. However, several limitations exist, such as low frequency of sudden cardiac arrest in public, rare use of publicly placed AEDs, low cost effectiveness, legal requirements and insufficient public willingness to help. Due to these restrictions of public access defibrillation other measures are more promising than the attempt at general distribution of AEDs. These measures are primary or secondary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac arrest, general knowledge of adequate activation of emergency medical services, implementation of first responder teams equipped with AEDs and particularly a better education in and application of the well-established principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",ANAESTHESIST,2006,"Maisch, S; Friederich, P; Goetz, AE",10.1007/s00101-006-1098-0,,WOS:000242814400007,A

Many of the life-saving efforts and advances in critical care situations have now begun to focus more and more on how, through evolving technology, the average person can save lives and perhaps even spare precious intensive care unit (ICU) resources. A striking example was the recent study conducted at the Chicago airports at which automated external defibrillators (AEDs) were deployed throughout the airline terminals for use by the public at large. Not only did random bystanders on the concourses save an extremely high percentage of cardiac arrest patients with the AEDs, most patients rapidly awakened, even before the arrival of professional rescuers. Thus, this technology-assisted intervention, performed by an average person, pre-empted the need for many other critical care interventions and prolonged care in the ICU. Equipped with automated prompts to improve performance, new technology also exists to help to monitor the inadequacies and too-frequent interruption of life-saving chest compressions during basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As a result of these technological advances, survival rates for cardiac arrest are now expected to improve significantly.",CRITICAL CARE,2006,"Pepe, PE; Wigginton, JG",10.1186/cc4838,,WOS:000240382800058,A

Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of exosomes released from mesenchymal stem cells. Given the challenge of systemic dilution associated with intravenous administration, intranasal delivery has emerged as a promising approach. In this study, we investigate the effects of intranasally administered exosomes in an animal model. Exosomes were isolated from the cell supernatants using the ultracentrifugation method. Brain injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats through a transient four-vessel occlusion model. Intranasal administration was conducted with 3 x 108 exosome particles in 20 mu L of PBS or PBS alone, administered daily for 7 days post-injury. Long-term cognitive behavioral assessments, biodistribution of exosomes, and histological evaluations of apoptosis and neuroinflammation were conducted. Exosomes were primarily detected in the olfactory bulb one hour after intranasal administration, subsequently distributing to the striatum and midbrain. Rats treated with exosomes exhibited substantial improvement in cognitive function up to 28 days after the insult, and demonstrated significantly fewer apoptotic cells along with higher neuronal cell survival in the hippocampus. Exosomes were found to be taken up by microglia, leading to a decrease in the expression of cytotoxic inflammatory markers.",PHARMACEUTICS,2024,"Ikeda, T; Kawabori, M; Zheng, YY; Yamaguchi, S; Gotoh, S; Nakahara, Y; Yoshie, E; Fujimura, M",10.3390/pharmaceutics16040446,,WOS:001220379000001,A

However, ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) induced by cardiac arrest has limited the use of DCD organs. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) without the culturing step has been proposed as a safer and easier source for stem cell therapy, which has emerged as an attractive technology that could facilitate the recovery of renal function and structure from acute kidney injury induced by IRI after DCD renal transplantation. In this study, freshly isolated donor-derived SVF was identified and then delivered intra-arterially into the grafts in DCD rat renal transplantation. Administration of freshly isolated donor-derived SVF could significantly alleviate the IRI of renal grafts and enhance graft reparation by promoting graft cell proliferation and microvascularization in DCD renal transplantation. Moreover, results revealed that the oxidative stress in grafts was significantly alleviated with SVF treatment, and this might be attributed to the overexpression of anti-oxidative molecules including nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2, superoxide dismutase-1, and heme oxygenase-1. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the administration of freshly isolated donor-derived nonexpanded adipose SVF could attenuate IRI and protect the grafts after DCD rat renal transplantation.",TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS,2021,"Wang, XN; Zhou, CC; Liu, JY; Yang, TL; Mao, L; Hong, X; Jiang, N; Jia, RP",10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.05.012,,WOS:000687331700047,A

Early defibrillation is crucial to manage fatal arrhythmias. The use of automated external defibrillators is a promising tool in minimizing time to defibrillation and enhancing survival. Methods PV (Progetto Vita) in Piacenza pioneered the first community-based automated external defibrillator project in Europe. We present survival data spanning 23 years for all cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest managed under both PV and standard emergency medical services interventions. Results A total of 6996 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were recorded. Among these, 156 cases were managed by PV volunteers (PV group). The PV group managed a significantly higher proportion of shockable rhythms than the emergency medical services group (69.9% versus 10.9%). Mean time to arrival was shorter (5.7 versus 10.2 minutes), and survival rates better with favorable neurological outcomes (46.2% versus 2.9%, overall). Survival rates declined with time. However, a higher proportion of patients in the PV -group demonstrated favorable neurological outcomes, even up to 9 minutes from the call, compared with the EMS group. Over the study period, the increasing number of automated external defibrillators in fixed public places coincided with a substantial rise in ventricular fibrillation survival in the PV group patients (22% for 2003-2012 to 73% for 2013-2022, P<0.001). Both time from call to arrival and PV-group intervention emerged as independent predictors of survival (odds ratio 1.08 and 0.28, respectively).

However, often price and maintenance of CPR manikins are barriers that prevent training at schools. This study aims to evaluate the learning of hands-only (HO) CPR by practicing with a low-cost manikin (LoCoMan) with visual qualitative feedback and to compare the results with the skills acquired by practice on a conventional manikin. A quasi-experimental study with 193 schoolchildren (10 to 12 years old) who were allocated to two groups: the LoCoMan group was taught via an integrative approach (science combined with physical education (PE)) and practiced on a handmade manikin, and a control group practiced in a traditional setting with a commercial manikin (Resusci Junior, Laerdal, Norway). All participants practiced for 1 hands-on skill session before performing a post-test on an instrumented CPR manikin. The outcomes including HO-CPR performance variables were compared between groups. The LoCoMan and control groups both achieved acceptable percentage of HO-CPR quality (57% and 71%, p = 0.004). Among 6th-graders, there were no significant differences in HO-CPR quality between LoCoMan 68% and control 71%, p = 0.66. The control group achieved better chest compression depth while the LoCoMan group showed more compressions with adequate chest recoil. Conclusion: Schoolchildren are able to build and use a low-cost manikin with visual feedback. The integrative learning approach used in this study may be a feasible alternative methodology for training and learning HO-CPR in schools when commercial manikins are not available. What is Known: center dot Access to CPR training should be universal and independent of age, location, financial means, or access to qualified instructors. center dot Scientific societies promote the implementation of CPR in schools, so that teachers and schoolchildren can play a multiplier role in their environment, but the gap in CPR learning is related to cultural, economic factors or access to resources and materials. What is New: center dot LoCoMan may be a useful device for teaching and learning CPR in schoolchildren from the age of 10 and upwards. center dot LOCOMAN shows that it is feasible and possible to build a low-cost manikin (about <euro>5 in the European Region) and to integrate it into an integrative educational project, and outlines how this could be done. this approach can be an incentive for teachers to attempt teaching CPR, but also for education outside the formal environment.",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,2024,"Peixoto-Pino, L; Isasi, SM; Agra, MO; Van Duijn, T; Rico-Díaz, J; Núñez, AR; Furelos, RB",10.1007/s00431-024-05601-8,,WOS:001220943600001,A

Despite the efforts made to install automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in crowded areas, their usage rate remains suboptimal. This study evaluated the efficiency of installing AEDs at key landmarks in Taoyuan City to enhance accessibility and usage.METHODS AND RESULTS This retrospective cohort study analyzed nontraumatic public out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases in Taoyuan City from 2017 to 2021, using data from the Taoyuan Fire Department and a regional registry. AED data were collected for 1163 devices. A geographic information system mapped target locations within the city, and real-world walking routes were examined to assess coverage. The primary outcome was actual coverage and the coverage efficiency ratio, calculated as the actual coverage divided by the number of facilities at a location. The coverage efficiency ratio compared the coverage efficiency of target locations with existing public access defibrillators (PADs). Top locations for superior coverage in both downtown and outside downtown areas were bus stops and convenience stores (7-Eleven and FamilyMart), which outperformed existing PADs.

It is detected that the synthesized sorbents adsorb low and medium molecular weight substances on their surface. Moreover, it is found that there is a toxic effect on red blood cells (hemolysis) occurs with prolonged exposure (120 h), short-term (5 min) exposure of the components of human peripheral blood with the sorbents leads to a loss in the number of platelets and leukocytes, mainly granulocytes, of mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood, as well as short-term and long-term contact of the blood components with the samples of sorbents contributes to a decrease in the metabolic activity of the cells and the activation of nitric-oxide production.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,CHAP,Leptospirosis and the Kidney: An Overview,"Leptospirosis is one of the main causes of tropical infections causing acute kidney injury (AKI). These infections commonly relate to the low socioeconomic status and humid climate. Leptospires modified their membrane transport for cell volume regulation and acid - base control to survive in the various environments of the tropics. Kidney is one of the main targets due to highly vascular blood supply, low rate of leptospires clearance, and suitable acid - base environment. The unique clinical characteristics of leptospirosis-associated AKI are non-oliguria and hypokalemia. The mechanism of leptospirosis-associated AKI can be due to direct or indirect effect. Leptospiral bacteria invade renal interstitium by the attachment of outer membrane protein to renal tubular epithelium. The indirect effect mostly results from dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, hemoglobinuria, and hyperbilirubinemia as the part of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Prompt antibiotic treatment, adequate hemodynamic resuscitation, and early renal support are the key success in the treatment of leptospirosis-associated AKI. The concept of the transition from AKI to chronic kidney disease has been recently proposed in the field of nephrology. Unfortunately, the long-term renal outcome of these specific diseases is still lacking. (c) 2019 S.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Sensor-free, Camera-only: Low-cost multi-angle CPR skill assessments method based on computer vision","Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is critical for survival following Cardiac Arrest (CA), particularly in out-of-hospital settings. However, current CPR skill assessments often rely on simulators with manual scoring, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise, many AI-based methods still depend on expensive, sensor-laden equipment. This study introduces a novel, sensor-free approach for CPR evaluation, aiming to provide a cost-effective solution for wider accessibility. We propose the LCSG-YOLO model, an enhanced version of the YOLO11 algorithm, coupled with the Kalman-Hungarian-Confidence-Temporal (KCHT) matching algorithm. The KCHT algorithm refines target tracking and assignment, improving detection precision and system efficiency by addressing challenges in dynamic object tracking and ambiguous assignments. By integrating these techniques, our system analyzes CPR training videos to assess compression position, frequency, and depth. We calculate standardized mean times for compressions and respirations, determine operation frequencies, and extract grayscale and jitter signals from compression regions using image processing and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This allows for accurate evaluation of compression depth and frequency characteristics. The LCSG-YOLO approach offers a practical, computer vision-based solution for CPR training and assessment, potentially expanding CPR education in resource-limited environments. The results show that the LCSG-YOLO model outperforms YOLO11s and YOLO11n, with improvements of 6.4% and 2.3% in chest compression detection box precision and 4.2% and 6.4% in artificial respiration detection recall, as detailed in our comparative performance analysis.

This report presents a case of heart failure in a patient whose limbs and heart were preserved through a collaboration between modern and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Patient Presentation: A 47-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and was diagnosed with 3-vessel disease and acute decompensated heart failure on October 27, 2020. After extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patient presented with cyanosis and gangrene in all four limbs. Cardiologists and plastic surgeons recommended heart transplantation and amputation. The patient wanted to keep his limbs and heart intact and requested to receive TCM. A TCM physician was consulted by visiting staff to provide combined care. After TCM intervention, both the ejection fraction (EF) and gangrene improved.

The primary and secondary injuries create unique metabolic derangements along with accompanying issues such as optimal timing and route of nutrition, appropriate fluid and electrolytes, drug administration, rehabilitation, and dysphagia. Enteral nutrition is clearly established as the preferential route of nutrition support for this population vs parenteral nutrition. There appears to be a consensus on early initiation of enteral nutrition, but less definitive are recommendations on advancement timing and formula components. Nutrition therapies should include exact fluid resuscitation goals specific for TBI and strict electrolyte monitoring to avoid extreme fluid, electrolyte, or glucose shifts that could be detrimental to the patient. While the critical care patient often tolerates small bowel feeding, the long-term rehabilitation patient should transition to and tolerate gastric feeding. Drug-nutrient and adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea should be routinely evaluated in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Monitoring for dysphagia is critical to avoid the costly negative aspects associated with aspiration and to capitalize on quality of life and appropriate oral nutrition. Emphasizing the priority of early nutrition support within a multi-disciplinary team may be the critical key for successful provision and tolerance of nutrition support in the TBI population.

The 2 primary goals of providing artificial circulation and defibrillation to halt ventricular fibrillation remain of paramount importance for saving lives. They have undergone significant improvements in technology and dissemination into the community subsequent to their establishment 60 years ago. The evolution of artificial circulation includes efforts to optimize manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, external mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices designed to augment circulation, and may soon advance further into the rapid deployment of specially designed internal emergency cardiopulmonary bypass devices. The development of defibrillation technologies has progressed from bulky internal defibrillators paddles applied directly to the heart, to manually controlled external defibrillators, to automatic external defibrillators that can now be obtained over-the-counter for widespread use in the community or home. But the modern treatment of cardiac arrest now involves more than merely providing circulation and defibrillation. As suggested by a 3-phase model of treatment, newer approaches targeting patients who have had a more prolonged cardiac arrest include treatment of the metabolic phase of cardiac arrest with therapeutic hypothermia, agents to treat or prevent reperfusion injury, new strategies specifically focused on pulseless electric activity, which is the presenting rhythm in at least one third of cardiac arrests, and aggressive post resuscitation care. There are discoveries at the cellular and molecular level about ischemia and reperfusion pathobiology that may be translated into future new therapies.

Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, in particular those that histopathologically resemble Crohn's disease, are characterized by increased mucosal TNF production, and anti-TNF antibodies have shown efficacy in decreasing disease activity. These data have provided a rationale for immunotheraphy of Crohn's disease. Administration of anti-TNF antibodies to patients with Crohn's disease not responding to standard immunosuppressive treatment rapidly induced complete remisssions, and healing of intestinal ulceration. A rapid reduction of circulating IL-6, CPR, and sPLA2 levels was observed in all patients, as well as a reduction of mucosal cells expressing RANTES and MIP-1. Short-term treatment with anti-TNF antibodies was not associated with significant toxicity, but results from long-term administration are still lacking. These data indicate that TNF is a pivotal and central inflammatory mediator in this disease. Further characterization of the precise mechanism of action of anti-TNF antibody therapy may further unravel the cause of immune dysregulation in Crohn's disease.

By monitoring gene induction using a whole-cell Escherichia coli bioreporter panel, in which diverse stress-responsive gene promoters are fused to luminescent or fluorescent reporting systems, we have demonstrated that DNA repair genes belonging to the SOS operon (recA, sulA, uvrA, umuD, and lexA) were induced upon resuscitation from the freeze-dried state, whereas other stress-responsive promoters such as grpE, katG, phoA, soxS, and sodA were not affected. This observation was confirmed by the UMU-chromotest (activation of the umuD gene promoter) in Salmonella typhimurium, as well as by real-time PCR analyses of selected E. coli SOS genes. We further show that a functional SOS operon is important in viability maintenance following resuscitation, but that at the same time, this repair system may introduce significantly higher mutation rates, comparable to those induced by high concentrations of a known mutagen.

However, lowering the whole-body temperature below 34 degrees C can lead to severe systemic complications such as cardiac, hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic side effects. Although the brain accounts for only 2% of the total body weight, it consumes 20% of the body's total energy at rest and requires a continuous supply of glucose and oxygen to maintain function and structural integrity. As such, theoretically, temperature-controlled selective brain cooling (SBC) may be more beneficial for brain ischemia than systemic pan-ischemia. Various SBC methods have been introduced to selectively cool the brain while minimizing systemic TH-related complications. However, technical setbacks of conventional SBCs, such as insufficient cooling power and relatively expensive coolant and/or irritating effects on skin or mucosal interfaces, limit its application to various clinical settings.

Concern exists because an inverse relationship has been reported between the number of electrical shocks delivered during cardiac resuscitation and both resuscitability and survival, Repetitive electrical shacks can alter diastolic function and prompt leftward shifts of the end-diastolic pressure-volume curves, Repetitive shocks may, therefore, contribute to the recently recognized phenomenon of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and hamper efforts to reestablish competent myocardial function after resuscitation, Thus, strategies aimed at limiting the number of electrical shocks during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are highly desirable, These may include real-time ventricular fibrillation waveform analysis to improve targeting of individual shocks and efforts (using mechanical and pharmacologic means) to render the myocardium more responsive to individual shocks and to promote greater electrical stability after successful defibrillation.",CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2000,"Gazmuri, RJ",10.1097/00003246-200011001-00016,,WOS:000165499700016,A

Recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the structure, function and physiological role of Rpfs in different organisms, most notably the major human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which encodes multiple rpf-like genes. A key unresolved question, however, concerns the relationship between the predicted biochemical activity of Rpfs - cleavage of the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond in the glycan backbone of peptidoglycan - and their effect on culturability. In M. tuberculosis, the interaction between RpfB and the D,L-endopeptidase, Rpf interacting protein A (RipA), enables these proteins to synergistically degrade peptidoglycan to facilitate growth. Furthermore, the combined action of Rpfs with RipA and other peptidoglycan hydrolases might produce muropeptides that could exert diverse biological effects through host and/or bacterial signaling, the latter involving serine/threonine protein kinases. Here, we explore these possibilities in the context of the structure and composition of mycobacterial peptidoglycan.

Exogenous estradiol ameliorates global ischemia-induced neuronal death and cognitive impairment in male and female rodents. However, the molecular mechanisms by which a single acute injection of estradiol administered after the ischemic event intervenes in global ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death are unclear. Here we show that acute estradiol acts via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling cascade to protect CA1 neurons in ovariectomized female rats. We demonstrate that global ischemia promotes early activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) and forkhead transcription factor of the O class (FOXO)3A, known Akt targets that are related to cell survival, and activation of caspase-3. Estradiol prevents ischemia-induced dephosphorylation and activation of GSK3 beta and FOXO3A, and the caspase death cascade. These findings support a model whereby estradiol acts by activation of PI3K/Akt signaling to promote neuronal survival in the face of global ischemia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

After 12 months, sepsis survivors who developed chronic critical illness (N = 63) had significantly poorer HRQoL as measured by EuroQoL 5-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire mean utility index score and Short Form 36-item (SF-36) physical and mental summary scores compared with patients who rapidly recovered (N = 110). Among patients admitted to a skilled nursing facility post-sepsis (N = 66,540), 34% and 72.5% had severe or very severe cognitive impairment and dependence to perform activities of daily living, respectively. Significant increase in moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment among severe sepsis survivors (N = 623) before and after sepsis was reported (median 0.9 [IQR: 0.4, 1.4] years; 6.1% and 16.7%, respectively [P < 0.001]). Substantial depression and anxiety symptoms were frequently observed post-sepsis, but with limited evidence for increased burden as assessed by specific psychological measures. Conclusion: These findings underscore the profound negative impacts of sepsis on patients' HRQoL, ability to perform activities of daily living, and cognitive abilities.",INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY,2025,"Basu, S; Wei, ZJ; Laor, A; Bennetts, L; Ahmad, N; El Khoury, AC; Geurtsen, J; Neary, MP",10.1007/s40121-024-01106-x,,WOS:001406460700001,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Effects of uniform-allocation constraints in networked common-pool resource extraction games,"Communities that share common-pool resources (CPRs) often coordinate their actions to sustain resource quality more effectively than if they were regulated by some centralized authority. Networked models of CPR extraction suggest that the flexibility of individual agents to selectively allocate extraction effort among multiple resources plays an important role in maximizing their payoffs. However, empirical evidence suggests that real-world CPR appropriators may often de-emphasize issues of allocation, for example by responding to the degradation of a single resource by reducing extraction from multiple resources, rather than by reallocating extraction effort away from the degraded resource. Here, we study the population-level consequences that emerge when individuals are constrained to apply an equal amount of extraction effort to all CPRs that are available to them within an affiliation network linking agents to resources. In systems where all resources have the same capacity, this uniform-allocation constraint leads to reduced collective wealth compared to unconstrained best-response extraction, but it can produce more egalitarian wealth distributions. The differences are more pronounced in networks that have higher degree heterogeneity among resources. In the case that the capacity of each CPR is proportional to its number of appropriators, the uniform-allocation constraint can lead to more efficient collective extraction since it serves to distribute the burden of over-extraction more evenly among the network's CPRs. Our results reinforce the importance of adaptive allocation in self-regulation for populations who share linearly degrading CPRs; although uniform-allocation extraction habits can help to sustain higher resource quality than does unconstrained extraction, in general this does not improve collective benefits for a population in the long term.",JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY,2022,"Schauf, A; Oh, P",10.1088/2632-072X/ac42e0,,WOS:000751408700001,A

Endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) has obvious protective effects on cardiomyocytes and that mitochondria are considered to be the main targets of CO action. This study aimed to investigate whether exogenous CO (carbon monoxide releasing molecule 2, CORM-2) could protect against PRMD, and improve cardiac function in rats via the mitochondria pathway. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham group, model cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) group, CORM-2 treatment group, inactivated CORM-2 group, and DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide, CORM-2 vehicle) group. Excluding the sham group, all groups underwent CPR 4 min after cardiac arrest (CA), animals in every group underwent surgery for catheter insertion before the CA-CPR. In the treatment groups, CORM-2 and inactivated CORM-2 (both 4 mg/kg, dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in normal saline) were intraperitoneally injected 12 h before CPR was started. In the sham, model CPR, and vehicle groups, animals were administered normal saline or vehicle as appropriate. The results demonstrated that the mitochondrial ultrastructure abnormalities in CORM-2 group was less severe than CPR rats. CORM-2 alleviated myocardial contractile and diastolic dysfunction after CPR, decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in myocardial tissues, and meanwhile suppressed cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore, CORM-2 lessen the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased myocardial mitochondrial respiratory complex IV enzyme activity after CPR. Dynamin-related protein 1(Drp1) was significantly less expressed in CORM-2 group with high expression of mitofusion-2 (Mfn2), sug-gesting that CORM-2 can promote mitochondrial fusion and reduce mitochondrial fission. Collectively, we provide the evidence that CORM-2 effectively relieved myocardial injury after CPR in rats, protected myocardial mitochondria, and preserved cardiac function after resuscitation. The proposed mechanisms of action were improved mitochondrial respiratory function, maintained mitochondrial dynamics balance, and suppressed the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,2022,"Liu, M; Du, F; Liu, F; Wang, XH",10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.175038,,WOS:000809751000003,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Ghrelin for Neuroprotection in Post-Cardiac Arrest Coma,"Importance Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates have markedly risen in the last decades, but neurological outcome only improved marginally. Despite research on more than 20 neuroprotective strategies involving patients in comas after cardiac arrest, none have demonstrated unequivocal evidence of efficacy; however, treatment with acyl-ghrelin has shown improved functional and histological brain recovery in experimental models of cardiac arrest and was safe in a wide variety of human study populations. Objective To determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenous acyl-ghrelin to improve neurological outcome in patients in a coma after cardiac arrest. Design, Setting, and Participants A phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, Ghrelin Treatment of Comatose Patients After Cardiac Arrest: A Clinical Trial to Promote Cerebral Recovery (GRECO), was conducted between January 18, 2019, and October 17, 2022. Adult patients 18 years or older who were in a comatose state after cardiac arrest were assessed for eligibility; patients were from 3 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Expected death within 48 hours or unfeasibility of treatment initiation within 12 hours were exclusion criteria. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive intravenous acyl-ghrelin, 600 mu g (intervention group), or placebo (control group) within 12 hours after cardiac arrest, continued for 7 days, twice daily, in addition to standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was the score on the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale at 6 months. Safety outcomes included any serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were mortality and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels on days 1 and 3. Results A total of 783 adult patients in a coma after cardiac arrest were assessed for eligibility, and 160 patients (median [IQR] age, 68 [57-75] years; 120 male [75%]) were enrolled. A total of 81 patients (51%) were assigned to the intervention group, and 79 (49%) were assigned to the control group. The common odds ratio (OR) for any CPC improvement in the intervention group was 1.78 (95% CI, 0.98-3.22; P = .06). This was consistent over all CPC categories. Mean (SD) NSE levels on day 1 after cardiac arrest were significantly lower in the intervention group (34 [6] mu g/L vs 56 [13] mu g/L; P = .04) and on day 3 (28 [6] mu g/L vs 52 [14] mu g/L; P = .08). Serious adverse events were comparable in incidence and type between the groups. Mortality was 37% (30 of 81) in the intervention group vs 51% (40 of 79) in the control group (absolute risk reduction, 14%; 95% CI, -2% to 29%; P = .08). Conclusions and Relevance In patients in a coma after cardiac arrest, intravenous treatment with acyl-ghrelin was safe and potentially effective to improve neurological outcome.

Methods: The study was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta- Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google databases were queried until 31st December 2023. Eligible studies included all articles reporting data, management, and outcomes on ETI. Results: Twenty-seven patients (23 case reports) experiencing ETI from solid and liquid hot food ingestion were included. Overall, 12 patients suffered from hot solid food ingestion while 15 experienced hot liquid food ingestion causing ETI. Odynophagia, dysphagia, and chest pain were the most commonly reported symptoms. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical assessment, endoscopic evaluation, and imaging modalities. A multidisciplinary approach involving both gastroenterologists and surgeons is critical. Management strategies encompass supportive care, such as fluid resuscitation and nutritional support, along with specific interventions like surgical repair and endoscopic dilatation in severe cases. Conclusions: ETI resulting from the ingestion of hot liquids and solid foods pose a not negligible morbidity and mortality risk.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Combined treatment of nerve growth factor and transcranical direct current stimulations to improve outcome in children with vegetative state after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the most dramatic events in pediatric age and, despite advanced neurointensive care, the survival rate remains low. Currently, no effective treatments can restore neuronal loss or produce significant improvement in these patients. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin potentially able to counteract many of the deleterious effects triggered by OHCA. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to be neuroprotective in many neurological diseases, such as motor deficit and cognitive impairment. Children with the diagnosis of chronic vegetative state after OHCA were enrolled. These patients underwent a combined treatment of intranasal administration of human recombinant NGF (hr-NGF), at a total dose of 50 gamma/kg, and tDCS, in which current intensity was increased from zero to 2 mA from the first 5 s of stimulation and maintained constant for 20 min. The treatment schedule was performed twice, at one month distance each. Neuroradiogical evaluation with Positron Emission Tomography scan (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Power Spectral Density of the brain (PSD) was determined before the treatment and one month after the end. Neurological assessment was deepened by using modified Ashworth Scale, Gross Motor Function Measure, and Disability Rating Scale.ResultsThree children with a chronic vegetative state secondary to OHCA were treated. The combined treatment with hr-NGF and tDCS improved functional (PET and SPECT) and electrophysiological (EEG and PSD) assessment. Also clinical conditions improved, mainly for the reduction of spasticity and with the acquisition of voluntary finger movements, improved facial mimicry and reaction to painful stimuli. No side effects were reported.ConclusionsThese promising preliminary results and the ease of administration of this treatment make it worthwhile to be investigated further, mainly in the early stages from OHCA and in patients with better baseline neurological conditions, in order to explore more thoroughly the benefits of this new approach on neuronal function recovery after OHCA.",BIOLOGY DIRECT,2023,"Curatola, A; Graglia, B; Granata, G; Conti, G; Capossela, L; Manni, L; Ferretti, S; Di Giuda, D; Romeo, DM; Calcagni, ML; Soligo, M; Castelli, E; Piastra, M; Mantelli, F; Marca, GD; Staccioli, S; Romeo, T; Pani, M; Cocciolillo, F; Mancino, A; Gatto, A; Chiaretti, A",10.1186/s13062-023-00379-5,,WOS:000985819500002,A

Our aim was to investigate its effects on regional perfusion and tissue oxygenation with respect to extracorporeal blood flow (EBF). In five swine, decompensated low-output chronic heart failure was induced by long-term rapid ventricular pacing. Subsequently, VA ECMO was introduced and left ventricular (LV) volume, aortic blood pressure, regional arterial flow and tissue oxygenation were continuously recorded at different levels of EBF. With increasing EBF from minimal to 5 l/min, mean arterial pressure increased from 47 +/- 22 to 84 +/- 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and arterial blood flow increased in carotid artery from 211 +/- 72 to 479 +/- 58 ml/min (P<0.01) and in subclavian artery from 103 +/- 49 to 296 +/- 54 ml/min (P<0.001).

However, the clinical presentation and the acuity of symptoms prompting invasive management in SCAD patients have not been described. Understanding these presenting features may improve SCAD diagnosis and management. Methods: We reviewed SCAD patients who were prospectively followed at the Vancouver General Hospital SCAD Clinic. Their presenting symptoms and unstable features were obtained from detailed clinical histories and hospital admission documentation. Baseline characteristics, predisposing and precipitating conditions, angiographic findings, management strategies, in-hospital, and long-term events were recorded prospectively. Results: We included 196 SCAD patients who had complete documentation of their presenting symptoms. The majority were women (178/196; 90.8%) and all presented with MI (24.0% STEMI). The most frequent presenting symptom was chest discomfort, reported by 96%. Other symptoms included arm pain (49.5%), neck pain (22.1%), nausea or vomiting (23.4%), diaphoresis (20.9%), dyspnea (19.3%), and back pain (12.2%). Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation occurred in 8.1% (16/196), with 1.0% having cardiac arrest. The time from symptom onset to hospital presentation was 1.1 +/- 3.0 days.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Recent Advances in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Cardiocerebral Resuscitation,"Cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) is a new approach for resuscitation of patients with cardiac arrest. It is composed of 3 components: 1) continuous chest compressions for bystander resuscitation; 2) a new emergency medical services (EMS) algorithm; and 3) aggressive post-resuscitation care. The first 2 components of CCR were first instituted in 2003 in Tucson, Arizona; in 2004 in the Rock and Walworth counties of Wisconsin; and in 2005 in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The CCR method has been shown to dramatically improve survival in the subset of patients most likely to survive: those with witnessed arrest and shockable rhythm on arrival of EMS. The CCR method advocates continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilations for witnessed cardiac arrest. It advocates either prompt or delayed defibrillation, based on the 3-phase time-sensitive model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) articulated by Weisfeldt and Becker. For bystanders with access to automated external defibrillators and EMS personnel who arrive during the electrical phase (i.e., the first 4 or 5 min of VF arrest), the delivery of prompt defibrillator shock is recommended. However, EMS personnel most often arrive after the electrical phase-in the circulatory phase of VF arrest. During the circulatory phase of VF arrest, the fibrillating myocardium has used up much of its energy stores, and chest compressions that perfuse the heart are mandatory prior to and immediately after a defibrillator shock. Endotracheal intubation is delayed, excessive ventilations are avoided, and early-administration epinephrine is advocated.

BackgroundData on new cardiac radiofrequency ablation devices for the treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) are limited. Materials and methodsFrom July 2019 to July 2020, a total of 68 patients with drug-resistant HOCM, who underwent PIMSRA with the Liwen RF (TM) ablation system, which has an ablation electrode of stepless adjustable length, were prospectively enrolled. Safety endpoints included, amongst others, the occurrence of pericardial effusion and/or hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmias, device failure and procedural death. The reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients at 12 months follow-up were used as a surrogate marker for device efficacy. ResultsAll procedures were technically successful. The total energy output time of the system was 75.8 (IQR: 30.0) min, and the average power was 43.61 +/- 13.34 watts. No ablation system error occurred. The incidence of pericardial effusion or hemorrhage, transient arrhythmia and resuscitation was 8.8, 39.7, and 1.5% during procedure, respectively. None of the patients died. During 30-day follow-up, there were no complications with the exception of a pericardial effusion in one patient (1.5%). No further complications were reported after 30 days. The patients' resting [baseline: 75 (IQR: 48) vs. 12-months: 12 (IQR: 19) mmHg, p < 0.001] and provoked [baseline: 122 (IQR: 53) vs. 12-months: 41 (IQR: 59) mmHg, p < 0.001] LVOT gradients decreased significantly during follow-up. ConclusionIn this study, we demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the Liwen RF (TM) ablation system to treat HOCM. The system allows for significant and sustainable LVOT gradient reduction during 12-months of follow-up. Hence, the Liwen RF (TM) ablation system is a promising new device that has the potential to become an alternative to existing septal reduction concepts in HOCM patients.",FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE,2022,"Wang, ZH; Zhao, R; Sievert, H; Ta, S; Li, J; Bertog, S; Piayda, K; Zhou, MY; Lei, CH; Li, XJ; Liu, JN; Xu, B; Feng, B; Hu, R; Liu, LW",10.3389/fcvm.2022.1028763,,WOS:000889811100001,A

Researchers have hypothesized that high levels of cognitive load reduce performance and increase errors. This phenomenon has been studied primarily by experimental designs that measure responses to predetermined stimuli and self-reports that reduce the experience to a summative value. Our goal was to develop a method to identify clinical activities with high cognitive burden using physiologic measures.MethodsTeams of emergency medical responders were recruited from local fire departments to participate in a scenario with a shockable pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) patient. The scenario was standardized with the patient being resuscitated after receiving high-quality CPR and 3 defibrillations. Each team had a person in charge (PIC) who wore a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device that recorded changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration in their prefrontal cortex (PFC), which was interpreted as cognitive activity.We developed a data processing pipeline to remove nonneural noise (e.g., motion artifacts, heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure) and detect statistically significant changes in cognitive activity. Two researchers independently watched videos and coded clinical tasks corresponding to detected events. Disagreements were resolved through consensus, and results were validated by clinicians.MethodsTeams of emergency medical responders were recruited from local fire departments to participate in a scenario with a shockable pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) patient.

Participants arrived in teams of 4 to 7 members, including one PIC. We recorded the PIC's fNIRS signals and identified 173 events associated with increased cognitive activity. [Defibrillation] (N = 34); [medication] dosing (N = 33); and [rhythm checks] (N = 28) coincided most frequently with detected elevations in cognitive activity. [Defibrillations] had affinity with the right PFC, while [medication] dosing and [rhythm checks] had affinity with the left PFC.ConclusionsFNIRS is a promising tool for physiologically measuring cognitive load.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Acute gastric dilatation after excessive consumption of traditional Chinese medicine: a case report,"Introduction Acute gastric dilatation (AGD) is a rare but clinically significant condition characterized by abnormal enlargement of the stomach. It can lead to serious complications such as gastric necrosis, perforation, and respiratory failure if not promptly managed. AGD has been associated with mechanical obstructions, binge eating, and systemic conditions like diabetes mellitus. However, AGD induced by excessive consumption of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has not been previously reported.Patient concerns A 40-year-old male with a history of chronic dyspepsia presented to the emergency department with recurrent vomiting. Over the 3 days prior to admission, he self-reported consuming approximately 3.5 liters of TCM liquid (about 1.1-1.3 liters per day). This attempt to alleviate his chronic dyspepsia symptoms failed to show the expected therapeutic effect. The patient denied experiencing headache, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.Diagnosis Abdominal CT revealed significant gastric distension, and subsequent endoscopy showed pyloric ulcer with stenosis, gastric retention, chronic atrophic gastritis, and a relaxed cardia. Laboratory investigations indicated metabolic alkalosis, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of tissue hypoxia.Interventions The patient was immediately managed with nasogastric tube decompression, anti-infection therapy, gastric mucosal protection, fluid resuscitation, parenteral nutritional support, fasting, and gastrointestinal decompression.Outcomes The patient's symptoms and signs notably improved after these interventions. A follow-up CT scan demonstrated improved gastric dilation. At a 4-week follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of vomiting and resumed normal oral intake. Repeat endoscopy showed healed pyloric ulcers and improved gastric motility. No adverse events (e.g., rehospitalization or medication intolerance) were reported during a 3-month follow-up period.Conclusion This case highlights the necessity of including AGD in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with frequent vomiting after excessive consumption of TCM. It underscores the importance of thorough evaluation to prevent misdiagnosis and severe complications. The case also emphasizes the need for caution when using TCM, especially in patients with organic lesions or pyloric obstruction.",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2025,"Zeng, T; Chen, ZL; Zhou, YH; Liu, WQ; Chen, J; Lu, JH; Lin, JH",10.3389/fmed.2025.1584032,,WOS:001529325000001,A

At present there is no specific neuroprotective treatment available.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,ECMO-facilitated rapid and deep hypothermia reduces brain injury on MRI following prolonged cardiac arrest in a translational swine model,"Introduction: Neuroprotective interventions after cardiac arrest are essential but largely lack evidence of efficacy. Early therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the only intervention that has shown promise in humans. However, despite a consistent signal for efficacy in animal models, conflicting clinical data hamper clinical acceptance. Two potential causes for the lack of translation from animal studies to humans are the time to achieve target temperature in humans and the inability to cool to deep hypothermic states due to the inherent detrimental cardiac effects accompanying deep hypothermia. Given the observed inconsistent impact of TH on human patients with cardiac arrest despite animal data, we developed a perfusion-controlled, translational swine model to quantify the effects of rapid deep TH on HIBI, quantifying severity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at a controlled time threshold. Methods: Ten swine underwent cardiac arrest with 20 min of ""no-flow"" state, followed by resuscitation and controlled reperfusion using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Animals were randomized to either control (normal temperature reperfusion) or rapid hypothermic reperfusion (RHR) (29 degrees C through ECMO-facilitated cooling). All swine underwent brain MRI with Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) before cardiac arrest and then 2 h after ECMO reperfusion. Whole-brain gray and white matter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared pre- and post-ECMO cannulation and arrest in all animals. Results: At 45 min post-reperfusion, the mean temperature for RHR animals was 30.4 degrees C (95 % CI 29.6-31.1 degrees C), while for control animals it was 35.7 degrees C (95 % CI 34.9-36.5 degrees C, p < 0.0001). Whole brain ADC in RHR swine increased by a mean of 1.36 +/- 4.09 %, while in control swine it decreased by a mean of 4.36 +/- 4.50 % (Median difference of -5.91, 95 %CI -12.13 to -0.15; P value = 0.047). Discussion: Swine with induced cardiac arrest who underwent rapid ECMO-mediated cooling post-arrest had less cerebral hypoxic cellular injury, as quantified by changes on MRI DWI, than controls. These findings support the protective effect on neurologic injury of a rapid and brief period of induced deep hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Compared to prior translational models, our use of ECMO has the advantage of an ability to control important factors such as no-flow ischemic time and variability in post-arrest cardiac output as well as to mitigate complications of cardiac dysrhythmias that tend to arise from deep hypothermia. This portends a greater promise for translational success of ECMO-facilitated rapid cooling and potentially other ECMO-mediated models of cardiac arrest than experienced by previous attempts.",RESUSCITATION PLUS,2025,"Tonna, JE; Anderson-Bell, D; Peckham, ME; Hoareau, GL; Drakos, S; Dehavenon, A; Alexander, MD; Johnson, AM; Steenblik, J; Youngquist, ST",10.1016/j.resplu.2025.101072,,WOS:001583686200004,A

Myocardial infarction (MI) in neonates is a recognized, uncommon entity, but the incidence and broad spectrum of the disease is unknown and likely underestimated due to limited reporting which in the majority is confined to acute ischemic events. The challenges involve clinical diagnosis which masquerades in the early phase as non-specific symptoms and signs that are commonly found in a host of neonatal disorders. Precise diagnostic criteria for neonatal MI are lacking, and management is driven by clinical presentation and hemodynamic stabilization rather than an attempt to rapidly establish the root cause of the condition. We conducted a review of the published reports of neonatal MI from 2000 to 2014, to establish an approach to the diagnosis and management based on the existing evidence. The overall evidence from 32 scientific articles stemmed from case reports and case series which were graded as low-to-very low quality. Neonatal MI resembles childhood and adult MI with features that involve characteristic ECG changes, raised biomarkers, and diagnostic imaging, but with lack of robust, standardized criteria to facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention. The mortality rate of neonatal MI ranges from 40 to 50% based on inclusion criteria, but the short-term data reflect normal quality of life in survivors. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of neonatal MI may optimize outcomes, but at the present time is based on limited evidence.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Sacubitril/Valsartan Improves Cardiac Function in Dialysis Patients,"Heart failure (HF) is characterized by the activation of adverse neurohormonal systems and a high mortality rate. Noteworthy, HF is a well-known complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), where dialysis patients are seven to eight times more likely to encounter cardiac arrest than the general population. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient treatments to improve cardiac function in dialysis patients and eventually reduce the cardiovascular death toll. Sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) is a dual inhibitor/blocker of the neprilysin and angiotensin II receptors, which exert cardioprotective effects among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF). Unfortunately, the drug is not approved for subjects with advanced CKD or dialysis patients due to safety concerns. The current study examined the cardiac effects of Sac/Val in HD patients. Administration of Sac/Val (100-400 mg/day) to 12 hemodialysis (HD) patients with HFrEF for six months gradually improved ejection fraction (EF) independently of morphological changes in cardiac geometry, as assessed by echocardiography (ECHO), and hemodynamic alterations. Interestingly, the Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (Kansas City KCCQ-12) revealed that quality of life significantly improved after Sac/Val treatment. No major adverse effects were reported in the present study, supporting the safety of Sac/Val at least in these patients and for the applied follow-up period. Collectively, these findings support the use of Sac/Val as a cardioprotective agent in both HD and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results In total, 6536 patients with 242,183 days of veno-venous ECMO were reviewed. The overall survival to discharge rate after weaning from ECMO was 89.7% (n= 5861), and 10.3% (n= 675) of the patients died during hospitalization. The discharge location varied as follows: 33.7% (n= 1976) returned home, 23.4% (n= 1369) were transferred to a referral hospital, 41.8% (n= 2447) required hospital services, and 0.6% (n= 36) were discharged to other places.

In multisite randomized clinical trial 92 graduates of two intensive substance use disorder programs who received CPR were compared to 91 who received standard treatment (STX). The CPR group evidenced increased frequency of aftercare group therapy attendance and near significant findings suggested that more CPR than STX participants completed 3 months (76 vs. 64%), 6 months (48 vs. 35%), and 9 months (35 vs. 22%) of aftercare. However, the groups did not differ on the majority of attendance measures and had similar abstinence rates at the 3-month (67% CPR vs. 71% STX), 6-month (52% CPR vs. 51% SDC), and 12-month (the primary outcome measure; 48% CPR vs. 49% STX) follow-up points.

The extent to which the experience of preYhospital discharge (PHD) testing without anesthesia after ICD implantation, under observation by a physician, affects shock-related anxiety symptoms on follow-up has not been investigated as yet. Methods: In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, 44 patients with a primary prevention indication for an ICD were randomly assigned to experience PHD testing without anesthesia (n = 23) or with anesthesia (n = 21). Patients were longitudinally evaluated before (T-1), shortly after (T-2), and 3 months after (T-3) PHD testing. During the respective PHD testings, the course of patients' serum cortisol release was measured. Results: During PHD testing, patients without anesthesia showed a significantly higher serum cortisol release than patients with anesthesia (F(4,152) = 22.227, p < .001). Patients who experienced PHD testing without anesthesia felt significantly safer with the ICD (U = 165.000, p = .040), would significantly more often recommend other patients to undergo PHD testing without anesthesia (chi(2) = 12.013, p = .002), and showed significantly lower levels of general shock-related anxiety shortly afterward (F(1,42) = 6.327, p = .02) and 3 months after PHD testing (F(1,41) = 8.603, p = .005).

In some cases, persufflation produced better results than hypothermic machine perfusion. The timing of persufflation is of importance; benefits of persufflation appear to increase as the timing of its administration postprocurement decreases. This may be particularly true for tissues that are more sensitive to ischemia, such as the pancreas prior to islet isolation. Combining oxygen persufflation with nitric oxide and addition of pulsatile flow may provide further benefits and amplify its effects on improving transplant outcomes.SummaryPersufflation is a promising, relatively simple, preservation technique that enables improved oxygenation, which provides protection and improvement in the graft condition during preservation and prior to transplantation.

Conventional infusion methods, which rely on elevating fluid containers to generate hydrostatic pressure, risk secondary injury and are less efficient during prehospital transport. We developed a wearable, portable, sealed positive-pressure infusion device to optimize fluid administration in austere environments. <bold>Methods:</bold> Ten male Bama miniature pigs underwent controlled hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 60 mmHg, induced by blood withdrawal until approximately 40-45% of estimated total blood volume [70 mL/kg body weight] and maintained for 30 min). Animals were randomized to receive resuscitation with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in saline at 10 mL/min using either the novel device or conventional manual pressure infusion. Vital signs and blood parameters (e.g., activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT]) were measured at baseline, shock phase, 1 h post-resuscitation, and upon completion of resuscitation. Resuscitation time, fluid volume, and maximum infusion line pressure were recorded. <bold>Results:</bold> All animals achieved successful resuscitation (100% immediate survival). During a 7-day follow-up, one animal in each group died (20%, p > 0.05). The device group exhibited a significantly shorter resuscitation time (103.0 +/- 16.97 [95% CI: 81.93, 124.07] vs. 122.4 +/- 8.02 [95% CI: 112.44, 132.36] minutes, p = 0.0496) and a higher infusion rate (9.29 +/- 0.50 [95% CI: 8.67, 9.91] vs. 7.68 +/- 0.40 [95% CI: 7.18, 8.18] mL/min, p < 0.001) compared with the control group. Both groups exhibited reduced APTT post-resuscitation; these descriptive findings may be associated with the colloid used but require further investigation with comprehensive coagulation assays (e.g., viscoelastic testing) and do not imply clinical benefit or harm. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The portable sealed positive-pressure infusion device provided stable pressure, improved infusion performance, and maintained safety.

Besides, the surface of MWCNT electrode becomes hydrophilic after amino-functionalization (AF-MWCNTs) which can enhance electrical conductivity because of lower MWCNT/electrolyte interfacial impedance and higher interfacial capacitance. Durability tests show that electrical characteristics of the MWCNTs treated by 2 wt% 1,4-diaminobutane solution (2 wt%-AF-MWCNTs) can last for at least six months in air ambient. The neural recording of crayfish shows that 2 wt%-AF-MWCNTs can provide better capability on detecting action potentials of caudal photoreceptor (CPR) interneuron compared to suction glass pipette from the evidence of a higher S/N ratio (126 versus 23). The amino-functionalized MWCNT electrode is feasible for long-term recording application according to the results of biocompatibility tests. As the MWCNTs were directly synthesized on Si-based substrates by catalyst-assisted thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at a low temperature (400 degrees C), these self-aligned MWCNT electrodes could be friendly implemented in integrated circuits fabrications.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Myocardial infarction: a paradigm of success in modern medicine,"Hospital mortality for acute myocardial infarction declined from 30% to 10% in the last 30 years, thanks to coronary care units and early revascularization with thrombolysis, angioplasty, and stein implantation. Pathologists played a major role by establishing plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis as the major cause of acute myocardial infarction and by discovering that ischemic myocardium necrosis progresses from endocardium to epicardium as a ""wave front"" phenomenon, with potential reversible injury if the reperfusion is accomplished within 3 h. Lone-term mortality following myocardial infarction is mostly due to sudden electrical death, which may be prevented by pharmacologic (antiarrhythmic drugs) and nonpharmacologic (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, pacemaker) therapy. Ventricular assist devices may support the left ventricle as a bridge to transplantation. Long-term mortality at distance from acute myocardial infarction declined from 10% to 2% per year. Despite these indisputable achievements, there are still pending questions: in vivo identification of vulnerable plaque, mechanisms of thrombosis by plaque erosion, prompt treatment on the spot of instantaneous cardiac arrest by external defibrillation, adverse effect of myocardial reperfusion, fate of bare- and drug-eluting coronary stents. With these limitations and challenges well in mind, nowadays myocardial infarction does not represent a nightmare as it was in the past. The achievements in its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment should be considered as a pride of cardiovascular medicine. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Definitive External Fixation for Anterior Stabilization of Combat-related Pelvic Ring Injuries, With or Without Sacroiliac Fixation","Background Combat-related pelvic ring injuries frequently lead to placement of a temporizing external fixation device for early resuscitation and transport. These injuries are commonly complicated by concomitant polytrauma and extensive soft-tissue injuries, which may preclude early internal fixation and lead to prolonged use of external fixation. To date, few studies have reported on the outcomes of definitive external fixation for combat-related pelvic ring injuries. Questions/purposes (1) In patients treated with definitive external fixation after combat-related pelvic ring injuries, how often is the quality of reduction within radiographically acceptable parameters at the end of treatment? (2) What proportion of patients demonstrate local heterotopic ossification after these injuries? (3) What patient- and treatment-related factors are associated with increased complications and pain? Methods We retrospectively studied all patients with pelvic ring injuries treated at a tertiary military referral center from January 2003 to December 2012. In total, 114 patients were identified, 55 of whom maintained an external fixation frame throughout their treatment. During that time, the general indications for definitive external fixation were an open, contaminated pelvic ring injury with a high risk of infection or open urologic injury; confluent abdominal, perineal, and thigh wounds; or comminution of the pubic ramus that would necessitate plate fixation extending up the anterior column in patients with open abdomen or exposure-compromising abdominal wounds. Posterior fixation, either sacroiliac or lumbopelvic, was applied in patients with sacroiliac instability. Of the 55 patients with pelvic ring injuries treated with definitive external fixation (27 open and 28 closed), four underwent hemipelvectomy and construct removal for massive ascending infections and four were lost to follow-up, leaving 47 patients (85%) who were available at a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median 29 months, interquartile range 17-43 months). All 47 patients underwent serial imaging to assess their injury and reduction during treatment. External fixators were typically removed after 12 weeks, except in patients in whom pin-site irritation or infection prompted earlier removal, and all were confirmed to be grossly stable during an examination under anesthesia. Clinical union was defined as the absence of radiographically present fracture lines and stable examination findings under anesthesia when the external fixator was removed. Data on demographics, injury pattern, associated injuries, revision procedures, complications, and final functional outcomes including ambulation status, sexual function, and pain were collected. Pelvic radiographs were reviewed for the initial injury pattern, type of pelvic fixation construct, residual displacement after removal of the frame, and evidence of formation of heterotopic ossification in the pelvis or bilateral hips. Pelvic displacement and diastasis were determined by digital caliper measurement on plain images; malunion was defined as anterior diastasis of the pelvis or vertical incongruity of the hemipelvis greater than 10 mm. Results Radiographic malunion after construct removal occurred in eight of 24 patients with open injuries and in five of 23 patients with closed injuries.

The modes of resuscitation, which is an evidenced-based practice, require evaluation to identify their effectiveness.Objectives This study evaluated neonatal resuscitation techniques and their effectiveness in the management of asphyxiated neonates during the perinatal period.Design Cross-sectional design with observation of delivery and immediate care of 254 newborns in five hospitals from April to June 2022.Methods Neonatal resuscitation and demographic characteristics were noted. Data were analyzed descriptively using STATA 17 and Cramer's V test of association between APGAR scores and resuscitation modes was done with statistical significance established at p <= .05.Results Neonatal resuscitation was primarily performed by midwives (98.4%), with 48.8% of the infants resuscitated after birth. The most common modalities of resuscitation were drying, keeping warm, rubbing the back, and flicking the feet, with 46.0% started on bag and mask ventilation. The success rate of resuscitation was impressive (58.1%), satisfactory (38.7%), and poor (3.2%). There was a strong association of the first minute APGAR score with drying the neonate (p = .0001, phi c = 0.619), keeping the neonate warm, and rubbing the back of the neonate (p = .0001, phi c = 0.613). However, their association with the fifth minute APGAR score was weak (p = .002, phi c = 0.222). Feet flicking has no significant association with the fifth minute APGAR score.Conclusion Neonatal resuscitation, which is an evidence-based practice, is more effective in the first minute than in the fifth minute.

Signs and symptoms at presentation were predominantly of cardiopulmonary dysfunction contrary to more common presenting features of gastrointestinal and neurological impairment. The reason for this seems to be the aspiration pneumonitis as a consequence of vomiting induced by parents at home, rather than the toxin itself even though a rather rapid progression of lung injury does not rule out the possibility. He had developed decreased level of consciousness and increased work of breathing after ingestion, which had progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, septic shock, and multi organ failure. He even had a brief cardiac arrest with Return of Spontaneous Circulation after 5 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, immediately after arrival at our unit, which seemed more likely to be a consequence of inappropriate management during transfer of the child. In addition to antibiotics and vasopressors, he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation and prone positioning initially, and lung-protective conventional ventilation later. His cardiopulmonary status improved gradually and he was successfully extubated after 12 days. Other organ systems also showed complete recovery. Even though Magnetic Resonance Imaging of brain done a few days after cardiac arrest showed features suggestive of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy he showed complete neurological recovery. He was thriving well at three-month follow-up with no neurological deficits, good exercise tolerance, and normal renal and liver function. Atypical presentation of pyrethroid poisoning is associated with significant morbidities and there seems to no reliable parameters in children to identify the risk of the same.

Clinical manifestations may include angina, syncope, dyspnoea, sudden death, or failure to thrive. Information on the treatment of this anomaly is extremely limited, and the long-term outcomes of conventional coronary artery bypass grafting in young patients remain uncertain.Case summary A 37-year-old woman presented with recurrent syncope during adolescence and later developed chest pain and cardiac arrest during childbirth. Coronary angiography confirmed LMCA atresia, yet repeated stress perfusion tests consistently showed no ischaemia. Considering the limited negative predictive value of stress testing and insights from guidelines addressing other congenital coronary anomalies, surgical reconstruction was performed using an external iliac artery (EIA) autograft directly anastomosed from the aorta to the LMCA. The harvest site was repaired with a vascular prosthesis. The patient recovered uneventfully and has remained stable under medical therapy.Discussion This case represents the first reported surgical reconstruction of LMCA atresia using an EIA autograft. It highlights the limitations of ischaemia testing in congenital coronary anomalies, the potential advantages of reconstruction over conventional bypass surgery in the setting of competitive native flow, and the importance of individualized, thoughtful decision-making.

Prenatal diagnosis (PND) may lead many women to terminate their pregnancy but some women choose to continue their pregnancy. We sent 503 invitations to answer a questionnaire to parents who belong to T13 and 18 internet support groups. Using mixed methods, we asked parents about their prenatal experience, their hopes, the life of their affected child, and their family experience. 332 parents answered questions about 272 children; 128 experienced PND. These parents, despite feeling pressure to terminate (61%) and being told that their baby would likely die before birth (94%), chose to continue the pregnancy. Their reasons included: moral beliefs (68%), child-centered reasons (64%), religious beliefs (48%), parent-centered reasons (28%), and practical reasons (6%). At the time of the diagnosis, most of these parents (80%) hoped to meet their child alive. By the time of birth, 25% chose a plan of full interventions. A choice of interventions at birth was associated with fewer major anomalies (P<0.05). Parents describe Special healthcare providers as those who gave balanced and personalized information, respected their choice, and provided support. Parents make decisions to continue a pregnancy and choose a plan of care for their child according to their beliefs and their child's specific medical condition, respectively. Insights from parents' perspective can better enable healthcare providers to counsel and support families.

Different pathologies, such as poor blood supply and tissue breakdown, may lead to inadequate oxygenation of the wound. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is a widely used treatment for an increasing number of medical practices. A new so-called ""hyperbaric treatment"" trend has emerged. The use of low-pressure, soft-sided, or inflatable chambers represents a growing trend in hyperbaric medicine. Used in professional settings as well as directly marketed to individuals for home use, they are promoted as equivalent to clinical hyperbaric treatments provided in medical centers. However, these chambers are pressurized to 1.3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) on either air or with an oxygen concentrator, both generate oxygen partial pressures well below those used in approved hyperbaric centers for UHMS-approved indications. A total of 130 consecutive patients with chronic ulcers where tested. TcPO2 was measured near the ulcer area while the patient was breathing 100% O-2 at 1.4 ATA for five and 10 minutes. The average TcPO2 at 1.4 ATA after 10 minutes of O-2 breathing was 161 mmHg (1-601 mmHg, standard deviation 137.91), compared to 333 mmHg in 2 ATA (1-914 +/- 232.56), p < 0.001. Each electrode tested was also statistically significant, both after five minutes of O-2 breathing and after 10 minutes. We have not found evidence supporting the claim that 1.4 ATA treatment can benefit a chronic ulcer patient. The field of HBO2 is constantly evolving. We have discovered new ways to treat previously incurable ailments. Nevertheless, it is important to note that new horizons must be examined scientifically, supported by evidence-based data.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Sepsis: Diagnosis and Management,"Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

Beyond the several well-known benefits of regular exercise practice, the occurrence of adverse clinical events during sports in apparently healthy individuals, especially sudden cardiac death, and the described long-term adverse cardiac adaptations associated to high volume of exercise, remain challenging. The early identification of athletes with increased risk is critical, but the most appropriate preparticipation screening protocols are also debatable and a more personalized evaluation, considering individual and sports-related characteristics, will potentially optimize this evaluation. As the risk of major clinical events during sports is not zero, independently of previous evaluation, ensuring the capacity for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, especially with availability of automated external defibrillators, in sports arenas, is crucial for its prevention and to improve outcomes. As in other areas of medicine, application of new digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, is promising and could improve in near future several aspects of sports cardiology.

Long-term dynamics of cavity patterns and the effect of forest management on cavities are, however, largely unknown. We studied cavity production, measured as nest cavity production rates (CPR=no. of new cavities/km(2)/year), of woodpeckers and tits in forests with different management intensity in southern Finland, based on a data from 37 years. Forests were divided into managed, seminatural and natural stands. The data covered 56 forest stands with the total area of 1690 ha. Stands were inventoried annually for new cavities. The total numbers of woodpecker and tit cavities were 2238 and 329, respectively. There were large differences in CPRs between forest stands with different management intensity. For woodpeckers, the CPR was highest in natural forests (5.7) and lowest in managed forests (1.5). For the tit species, the respective numbers were 0.9 and 0.3. The CPRs of different cavity-making bird species and cavity tree characteristics (e.g. tree condition and species) were consistent, suggesting that different cavity-makers benefit from similar forest and tree characteristics. The results also suggest that forests managed with currently prevailing methods limit the production of cavities. To promote cavities, the results from this and other studies suggest that managed forests should include more features of natural forests, such as more diverse tree species and within-stand structural variability distribution (tree-level heterogeneity), larger amount of decayed wood, more retention trees and snags and longer rotation periods.",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,2024,"Pakkala, T; Peltonen, A; Lindberg, H; Hjältén, J; Kouki, J",10.1007/s10342-023-01645-x,,WOS:001138730300001,A

Supportive materials were considered useful but only when up-to-date, in addition to the discussion and with opportunity for personalization. Regarding decision making, it is not always clear to parents that a prenatal decision needs to be made and they can participate, influencing factors could be, e.g., unclear language, directive counseling, overload of information, and an immediate delivery.

Given the combined effects of frailty and the consequences of cancer treatment, older individuals with GC are more likely than young patients to suffer from postoperative complications and poor clinical outcomes. Nutrition, functional capacity and psychological state-based multimodal prehabilitation, which is dominated by Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway management, has been shown to reduce postoperative complications, promote functional recovery and decrease hospitalisation time in certain malignancies. However, no previous studies have investigated the clinical application of multimodal prehabilitation in frail older patients with GC.Methods and analysis The study is a prospective, multicentre randomised controlled trial in which a total of 368 participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomised into either a prehabilitation group or an ERAS group. The prehabilitation group will receive multimodal prehabilitation combined with ERAS at least 2 weeks before the gastrectomy is performed, including physical and respiratory training, nutritional support, and therapy and psychosocial treatment. The ERAS group patients will be treated according to the ERAS pathway. All interventions will be supervised by family members. The primary outcome measures are the incidence and severity of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes include survival, functional capacity and other short-term postoperative outcomes. Overall, the multimodal prehabilitation protocol may improve functional capacity, reduce the surgical stress response and concomitant systemic inflammation, and potentially modulate the tumour microenvironment to improve short-term and long-term clinical outcomes and patients' quality of life.Ethics and dissemination All procedures and participating centres of this study were approved by their respective ethics committees (QYFYKYLL 916111920).

Shock is a critical complication during the early stages of burn injury, contributing substantially to mortality and long-term disability. Effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for preventing and treating shock, with prompt administration being vital. However, timely intravenous fluid resuscitation is often challenging, and errors in resuscitation significantly contribute to mortality. Therefore, exploring a more rapid and effective non-invasive method of fluid resuscitation is necessary. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has shown considerable potential in this regard. This paper reviews ORT's historical development and current research progress, discussing its application in early anti-shock treatment for burns. While ORT is generally safe, potential complications like diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort must be noted, particularly if the rehydration rate is too rapid or if gastrointestinal issues exist. Careful patient assessment and monitoring are essential during ORT administration. Based on a comprehensive review of relevant research, we present provisional guidelines for ORT in burn patients. These guidelines aim to inform clinical practice but should be applied cautiously due to limited clinical evidence. Implementation must be tailored to the patient's condition under healthcare supervision, with adjustments according to evolving circumstances: (1) Initiation timing: Start as soon as possible, and the ideal start time is usually within 6 h after injury. (2) Rate of application: Employing a fractional administration approach, wherein small quantities of approximately 150-250 millilitres are provided for each instance and the initial fluid rate of oral rehydration can be simplified to 100 mL/kg/24 h.

Its sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, and sympatholytic activities together with opioid-sparing effects make it suitable for short- and long-term sedation in the intensive care setting. We report our experience with dexmedetomidine use during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure as an alternative to general anesthesia. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of high-risk patients undergoing dexmedetomidine infusion for the transfemoral TAVI procedure between July 2017 and October 2019. The primary outcome parameters were hemodynamic: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP); respiratory oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and sedation level (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, RASS). The frequency of conversion to general anesthesia and the need for sedative ""rescue therapy"" were secondary endpoints. We also reported the overall anesthetic management and the incidence of intra- and postoperative complications. Results Eighty-five patients were evaluated (age 81.58 +/- 5.23 years, 36.5% men, 63.5% women). High comorbidity, according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS PROM). The patients' hemodynamic functions were kept normal. Complications such as cardiac arrest occurred in four patients; orotracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were necessary. Atrioventricular block occurred in nine patients. Respiratory parameters were maintained stable. Complications such as apnea, hypoventilation, and hypoxemia did not occur. All patients had RASS scores above or equal to 0 and - 1. No patient required rescue midazolam or fentanyl. No conversion to general anesthesia in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine was observed in the absence of hemodynamic complications caused by the surgical technique.

Previous studies have shown that deletion of any one of the five rpf-like genes did not affect the growth or survival of M. tuberculosis in vitro. In conjunction with the results of whole-genome expression profiling, this finding was indicative of their functional redundancy. In this study, we demonstrate that the single deletion mutants are phenotypically similar to wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vivo. The deletion of individual rpf-like genes had no discernible effect on the growth or long-term survival of M. tuberculosis in liquid culture, and the ability to resuscitate spontaneously from a nonculturable state in a most probable number assay was also unaffected for the three strains tested (the Delta rpfB, Delta rpfD, and Delta rpfE strains). In contrast, two multiple strains, KDT8 (Delta rpfA-mutation Delta rpfC Delta rpfB) and KDT9 (Delta rpfA Delta rpfC Delta rpfD), which lack three of the five rpf-like genes, were significantly yet differentially attenuated in a mouse infection model. These mutants were also unable to resuscitate spontaneously in vitro, demonstrating the importance of the Rpf-like proteins of M. tuberculosis in resuscitation from the nonculturable state.

Air embolism should be managed by high pressure of compressed air during decompression (beginning with 2.8 ATA), in addition to HBO. Favourable effects were obtained in 39 of the 48 patients when this therapy was employed. The effect was less favourable when only HBO was employed. It has been established that HBO contributes to consciousness recovery and to a lesser degree affects regress of focal neurological abnormalities in cerebrovascular thrombosis and embolism. HBO produces a favourable effect in short-term circulatory arrest. The mortality rate significantly decreases when HBO is used in the early hours of this affection. HBO also stabilizes hemodynamics and promotes correction of respiratory disorders, the processes of functional recovery of the intimately connected DNS and extracerebral systems. Dog experiment with prolonged circulatory arrest due to electroshock and acute blood loss have demonstrated that HBO contributes to the correction of lactate-acidotic-blood disorders and rapid compensation of neurological abnormalities in animals with early functional CNS recovery, while in animals with later CNS functional recovery after long-term circulatory arrest HBO fails to produce a favourable affect on the final outcome of resuscitation measures.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Field termination of resuscitation: Analysis of a newly implemented protocol,"Introduction. Earlier work has shown the safety of termination-of-resuscitation (TOR) protocols for traumatic and nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). This study examined the implementation of these protocols in one urban/suburban EMS system. The objective was to determine how often patients are transported to the ED despite meeting TOR criteria. Methods. All adult OOHCA patients transported to two EDs during a 3.5-year interval were retrospectively identified through dispatch and hospital records. EMS and ED records were evaluated to assess for the presence of TOR protocol criteria and to determine whether the patients should have been transported or pronounced dead on scene. Records were also examined for documentation of mitigating circumstances that might have prompted transport despite meeting TOR criteria. Results. 865 OOHCA patients were identified; 235 met study criteria. Of these, 131 (56%) met TOR criteria but were transported anyway. All expired in the ED or in the hospital (131/131 = 100%, 95% CI: 97.7-100) Of the 43 traumatic OOHCA patients, 27 (63%) met TOR criteria, yet were transported, and all expired in the ED (27/27 = 100%, 95% CI: 89.5-100). Of the 192 nontraumatic OOHCA patients, 104 (54%) met TOR criteria, yet were transported, and all expired in the ED or in the hospital (104/104 = 100%, 95% CI: 97.2-100). In no case was a mitigating circumstance documented to justify transporting a patient meeting TOR criteria. Conclusions. Termination-of-resuscitation protocols are not being implemented as intended in this EMS system: more than half of cardiac arrest patients meeting criteria for termination of resuscitation were transported anyway. These protocol violations result in emergency transport to the ED for a substantial number of patients for whom continued resuscitative efforts are futile: no patient who met TOR criteria in this sample survived to discharge.",PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE,2008,"O'Brien, E; Hendricks, D; Cone, DC",10.1080/10903120701707989,,WOS:000252347100010,A

This has been associated with worse long-term outcomes for transplanted lungs. Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) reduces systemic inflammation in brain death and improves lung procurement rate. The effect of DPR on macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs is not known. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats had a 4F Fogarty catheter inserted into the skull and the balloon inflated until brain death was achieved. Rats were resuscitated with normal saline to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 80mmHg (targeted intravenous fluid, TIVF) and DPR animals received an intraperitoneal injection of commercial peritoneal dialysis solution. Rats were sacrificed at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after brain death. Protein levels were assessed using quantitative ELISA. Leukocyteswere quantified using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: At all time points, DPR downregulated multiple inflammatory cytokines including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1a, and IL-6. Adhesion molecules ICAM, E-selectin, and P-selectin were increased above sham at 4 and 6 h after brain death and reduced with DPR, whereas VCAM was reduced at 2 and 6 h. Infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils were trended downward at 6 h with DPR, though this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Animals that received TIVF alone had significant increases in inflammatory cytokines within the lung tissue, leading to adhesion molecule expression and ultimately leukocyte infiltration. Each stage of inflammation was affected by DPR. Using DPR in brain dead organ donors shows promise as a way to reduce lung injury and inflammation.",SHOCK,2018,"Weaver, JL; Matheson, PJ; Matheson, A; Downard, CD; Garrison, RN; Smith, JW",10.1097/SHK.0000000000001069,,WOS:000454036000011,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Intranasal Delivery of a Caspase-1 Inhibitor in the Treatment of Global Cerebral Ischemia,"Caspase-1 is an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation, a critical component of many diseases that affect neuronal degeneration. However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI.",MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY,2017,"Zhao, NJ; Zhuo, XY; Lu, YJ; Dong, Y; Ahmed, ME; Tucker, D; Scott, EL; Zhang, QG",10.1007/s12035-016-0034-9,,WOS:000406503500008,A

In the skin, molecular hydrogen reduces oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting oxidative stress, leading to improvements in texture and tone. It also regulates the inflammatory response, alleviating redness, itching, and discomfort, while promoting skin repair and regeneration. Moreover, hydrogen activates antioxidant enzymes in skin cells, boosting their antioxidant capacity and delaying aging. Clinical trials show that molecular hydrogen significantly improves conditions like acne, chloasma, and skin sensitivity. However, research in skin cosmetology remains in its early stages, with unanswered questions regarding mechanisms of action, optimal dosage, and long-term safety.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Relationships between institutional success and length of tenure in a Kenyan irrigation scheme,"In a context of higher reliance on irrigation schemes to ensure food security, it is crucial to understand institutional success of water resource management. In addition to other factors explored in great depth by the CPR literature, the actions of long-term appropriators contribute to the success of institutions. However, only a limited amount of work has attempted to examine the actual relationship between length of tenure and institutional success. To examine these relationships, we analyze a long-enduring CPR, the Mwea irrigation scheme (MIS) in Kenya, a network created in the 1950s and whose appropriators have held different lengths of tenure. We explore payment of operation and maintenance (O&M) fees of 71 irrigation units over two consecutive years. We examine 422 household surveys in eight out of the 71 irrigation units on the practice of institutions. We find that length of tenure impacts institutional success by influencing the behaviors of appropriators. Appropriators with longer tenure promote institutional success by provisioning the resource in a more sustainable manner through achieving high payments of O&M fees. Relatively dissatisfied with the implementation of the rules, they use formal and informal means to criticize institutions and to promote institutional change and adaptation. In contrast, appropriators with shorter tenure achieve lower payments of O&M fees, they complain less, and are more satisfied with the existing implementation of the rules. They are satisfied with the status quo. Hence, it is through the pressure of experienced appropriators that institutions such as the MIS evolve and adapt to become more successful.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS,2019,"Washington-Ottombre, C; Evans, TP",10.18352/ijc.876,,WOS:000469000700014,A

Only a little is known about venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO)-related SCI. Retrospective observational study conducted, from 2006 to 2019, in a tertiary referral center on patients who developed VA-ECMO-related neurovascular complications, focusing on SCI. During this period, among the 1893 patients requiring VA-ECMO support, 112 (5.9%) developed an ECMO-related neurovascular injury: 65 (3.4%) ischemic strokes, 40 (2.1%) intracranial bleeding, one cerebral thrombophlebitis (0.05%) and 6 (0.3%) spinal cord infarction. Herein, we report a series of six patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest receiving circulatory support with VA-ECMO who developed subsequent SCI during ECMO course, confirmed by spine MRI after ECMO withdrawal. All six patients had long-term neurological disabilities. VA-ECMO-related SCI is a rare but catastrophic complication. Its diagnosis is usually delayed due to sedation requirement and/or ICU acquired weakness after sedation withdrawal, leading to difficulties in monitoring their neurological status. Even if no specific treatment exist for SCI, its prompt diagnosis is mandatory, to prevent secondary spine insults of systemic origin.

Methods We retrospectively evaluated CT neuroimaging studies of 91 comatose patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest and 46 non-comatose controls. We tested the diagnostic performance of Gray-White-Matter-Ratio compared with established morphologic signs of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, e. g. loss of distinction between gray and white matter, and laboratory parameters, i. e. neuron-specific enolase, for the prediction of poor neurologic outcomes after resuscitated cardiac arrest. Primary endpoint was neurologic function assessed with cerebral performance category score 30 days after the index event. Results Gray-White-Matter-Ratio showed encouraging interobserver variability (ICC 0.670 [95% CI: 0.592-0.741] compared to assessment of established morphologic signs of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (Fleiss kappa 0.389 [95% CI: 0.320-0.457]) in CT neuroimaging studies.

The purpose of this study is to compare patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and patients with ACS who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in terms of their clinical profile, management, treatment complications, and prognosis. Methods: We analyzed 47,940 cases of patients treated for ACS in 2020, including 44,952 patients (93.8%) who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 and 2988 patients (6.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Sulforaphane improves post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting cardiomyocytes ferroptosis via the Nrf2/IRF1/GPX4 pathway,"Background: Ferroptosis is an important type of cell death contributing to myocardial dysfunction induced by whole body ischemia reperfusion following cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation. Sulforaphane (SFN), known as the activator of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), has been proven to effectively alleviate regional myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. The present study was designed to investigate whether SFN could improve post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting cardiomyocytes ferroptosis and its potential regulatory mechanism. Methods and results: An in vivo pig model of CA and resuscitation was established. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)stimulated AC16 cardiomyocytes was constructed as an in vitro model to simulate the process of CA and resuscitation. In vitro experiment, SFN reduced ferroptosis-related ferrous iron, lipid reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde, increased glutathione, and further promoted cell survival after H/R stimulation in AC16 cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, the activation of Nrf2 with the SFN decreased interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression, then reduced its binding to the promoter of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and finally recovered the latter's transcription after H/R stimulation in AC16 cardiomyocytes. In vivo experiment, SFN reversed abnormal expression of IRF1 and GPX4, inhibited cardiac ferroptosis, and improved myocardial dysfunction after CA and resuscitation in pigs. Conclusions: SFN could effectively improve myocardial dysfunction after CA and resuscitation, in which the mechanism was potentially related to the inhibition of cardiomyocytes ferroptosis through the regulation of Nrf2/IRF1/GPX4 pathway.",BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY,2024,"Zheng, ZJ; Xu, JF; Mao, Y; Mei, ZH; Zhu, JJ; Lan, P; Wu, XL; Xu, SX; Zhang, M",10.1016/j.biopha.2024.117408,,WOS:001312215300001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Mild resuscitative hypothermia and outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Recovery without residual neurological damage after cardiac arrest with global cerebral ischemia is still a rare event. Severe impairment of bodily or cognitive functions is often the result. The individual, emotional, and social aspects of brain damage and rehabilitation are seldom taken into account. Efforts to improve the prevention of brain damage immediately after successful resuscitation of patients are missing. The efficacy of hypothermia in preserving neurologic function when instituted before and during certain no-flow cardiovascular states has been well documented both clinically and experimentally since the 1950s. Most studies have used moderate (28-33 degrees C) to deep (20-28 degrees C) hypothermia to demonstrate these protective effects. Considering the use of hypothermia for preservation and resuscitation, the lack of controlled outcome trials, the long period of time required to reach therapeutic hypothermia, and the incidence of rewarming complications such as infection, arrhythmia, and coagulopathy have made it difficult to apply these methods to emergency situations such as cardiac arrest. Recent experimental evidence in dogs has shown that hypothermia induced after cardiac arrest does indeed mitigate the effects of the postresuscitation syndrome and improves neurologic function and reduces histologic brain damage. More importantly, such benefits can be demonstrated with mild (34-36 degrees C) hypothermia thus minimizing complications and requiring less time for induction of hypothermia. Ice water nasal lavage, direct carotid infusion of cold fluids, use of a cooling helmet, and peritoneal cooling are promising techniques for clinical cerebral cooling. External auditory canal temperature (e.g., tympanic membrane temperature changes) could provide an approximation to brain temperatures. For accurate temperature monitoring, however, a central pulmonary artery thermistor probe should be inserted. Temperature monitoring is needed to avoid temperature <30 degrees C.

Despite this and other national recommendations, the use of diuretics has steadily decreased over the past 15 years. Reasons include heavy promotion of other medications and the perception that diuretics produce adverse metabolic effects and do not reduce coronary heart disease events. Data, however, indicate that (1) changes in glucose and cholesterol metabolism are minor, especially with the smaller doses now being used; (2) cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been reduced in hypertensive patients, even in those with hyperlipidemia or diabetes, when diuretics are used; and (3) concerns about hypokalemia-induced arrhythmias have been overstated. While special indications exist for other medications in the treatment of hypertension, for example, use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (usually in addition to a diuretic) for a patient with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy, most patients, including those with hyperlipidemia or glucose intolerance, can be effectively treated with a diuretic as initial therapy or as part of a combination regimen, Diuretics should be used more not less frequently; use of diuretics would reduce the number of resistant hypertensive patients.",JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,1998,"Moser, M",10.1001/jama.279.22.1813,,WOS:000073998500034,A

These devices offer a non-invasive and temporary solution, providing continuous monitoring and the potential for prompt defibrillation when needed. In this study, we explore the use of WCD and evaluate arrhythmic events through comprehensive monitoring. Methods From November 2022 to May 2024, we conducted an outpatient follow-up of 41 patients receiving WCD. Regular check-ups, remote monitoring and comprehensive echocardiography were performed to optimise a tailored therapy. Results The average age of the patients was 59.2.4 +/- 16.5 years, with 78% being male. Among the cohort, 54% had hypertension, 41% were smokers and 66% had dyslipidaemia, while 27% were diabetic. WCD was assigned according to the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists position paper focussing on the appropriate use of WCD and European Society of Cardiology guidelines on ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: 24 (58%) patients had a de novo diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, 11 (27%) patients had a recent acute coronary syndrome and ejection fraction <35%, 3 (7%) patients had a cardiac electronic device extraction and 3 (7%) patients had myocarditis with features of electrical instability. The average follow-up was 62 +/- 38 days according to specific aetiology, with a daily wearing time of 22.7 +/- 1.3 hours. No device interventions were recorded. At the end of the follow-up period, 15 patients still required an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Among these, 12 patients (29%) underwent ICD implantation. Two patients (5%) declined the procedure. Conclusions The use of WCD for patients at high risk of arrhythmias allowed to optimise therapy and limit the indications for ICD. Inappropriate implantation of ICD was avoided in 69% of patients who received WCD. The device showed a good safety profile, low incidence of device interventions and adequate patients' adherence to WCD use.",OPEN HEART,2024,"Matteucci, A; Pignalberi, C; Di Fusco, S; Aiello, A; Aquilani, S; Nardi, F; Colivicchi, F",10.1136/openhrt-2024-002787,,WOS:001318647600001,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Development of a new method for the noninvasive measurement of deep body temperature without a heater,"The conventional zero-heat-flow thermometer, which measures the deep body temperature from the skin surface, is widely used at present. However, this thermometer requires considerable electricity to power the electric heater that compensates for heat loss from the probe; thus, AC power is indispensable for its use. Therefore, this conventional thermometer is inconvenient for unconstrained monitoring. We have developed a new dual-heat-flux method that can measure the deep body temperature from the skin surface without a heater. Our method is convenient for unconstrained and long-term measurement because the instrument is driven by a battery and its design promotes energy conservation. Its probe consists of dual-heat-flow channels with different thermal resistances, and each heat-flow-channel has a pair of IC sensors attached on its top and bottom. The average deep body temperature measurements taken using both the dual-heat-flux and then the zero-heat-flow thermometers from the foreheads of 17 healthy subjects were 37.08 degrees C and 37.02 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the correlation coefficient between the values obtained by the 2 methods was 0.970 (p < 0.001). These results show that our method can be used for monitoring the deep body temperature as accurately as the conventional method. and it overcomes the disadvantage of the necessity of AC power supply.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,The rationale for cardiomyocyte resuscitation in myocardial salvage,"Clinical heart failure results from the cumulative loss of functioning myocardium from any cause. At the cellular level, cardiac myocytes die from three causes, individually or in combination: Necrosis occurs when external conditions are not sufficient to sustain minimal cellular functions, as with ischemia, and there is a general and unorganized breakdown of cell organelles, engendering an inflammatory response that may have harmful collateral tissue effects. Apoptosis, or cell suicide, occurs when specific external or internal conditions provoke a highly structured sequence of events to shut down cellular functions and remove the cell, with minimal consequences to surrounding tissue. Autophagy is a normal response to cell starvation that is induced under conditions of chronic metabolic or other stress. Current therapeutics, such as early myocardial revascularization after myocardial infarction, are focused exclusively upon minimizing cardiac myocyte necrosis and may even contribute to secondary apoptosis and autophagy. This review explores possible approaches to bring cardiac myocytes that are destined to die, back to life, i. e., cellular resuscitation. Two pro-apoptotic proteins in particular, Bnip3 and Nix, are transcriptionally upregulated specifically in response to myocardial ischemia and pathological hypertrophy and have been examined as therapeutic targets. In Bnip3 and Nix genetic mouse models, prevention of cardiac myocyte apoptosis in ischemic and hemodynamically overloaded hearts salvaged myocardium, minimized late ventricular remodeling, and enhanced ventricular performance. Cardiomyocyte resuscitation by preventing programmed cell death shows promise as an additive approach to minimizing necrosis for long-term prevention of heart failure.",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE-JMM,2008,"Dorn, GW; Diwan, A",10.1007/s00109-008-0362-y,,WOS:000259439400002,A

This study explored the impact of air pollution on arrhythmia incidence among patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in Mashhad, Iran, and its potential influence on their quality of life and risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: In 2018, a study was conducted on patients with ICDs from Imam Reza Hospital. Patients were assigned to an air pollution monitoring station based on their residential address. Arrhythmia data were collected from device interrogations during follow-up visits. A checklist was used to record meteorological data, unhealthy weather days, and levels of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). The correlation between arrhythmia and air pollutants was analyzed using time-series and spatial data analyses. Results: The study involved 194 patients (mean [SD] age =63.14 [12.34] years; 167 men and 27 women). The primary indication for ICD implantation was ischemic cardiomyopathy (70%), followed by dilated cardiomyopathy (18.6%). A total of 1163 cardiac arrhythmias were recorded, with 70% being ventricular and 30% supraventricular. A significant association was identified between the overall count of cardiac arrhythmias and the levels of NO2(P =0.034), PM5.2 (P =0.03), and CO (P =0.004). Conversely, the concentrations of SO(2 )and PM10 did not have a substantial impact on total arrhythmia occurrences. These findings imply that air pollutants such as NO2, PM2.5, and CO could potentially jeopardize cardiac health. Conclusions: We concluded that air pollutants, specifically NO2, CO, and PM2.5, influence the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia in high-risk groups such as patients with ICDs. The findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate air pollution to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in vulnerable populations.",IRANIAN HEART JOURNAL,2025,"Ekramifard, M; Bigdelu, L; Dowlatabadi, Y; Tayyebi, M; Esmaili, H; Hadianfar, A; Eshraghi, A; Ekramifard, MM",,,WOS:001588363400003,A

In this common pool resource (CPR) dilemma, climate is the common resource which bears the burden of humans extracting non-renewable energy sources. Maximizing individual resource exploitation is at odds with the group's collective profit, which is affected by the overall resource depletion. Sustainable use refers to the balance between short-term individual gains and the long term common gains while not damaging the resource. Developed at the University of Warsaw, and implemented in VR by Kiin (formerly Virtual Bodyworks), as part of the EU-funded GuestXR project, led by Dr. Mel Slater from the University of Barcelona, the game places groups of 3-5 players in a shared environment where they make critical decisions about harvesting energy cubes symbolic units of resource extraction. Players are guided by the avatar of an AI agent, GuestXR, who explains the rules and offers intermittent feedback to encourage cooperation and warn against the dangers of overuse. A mathematical model of the CPR dilemma was developed and used as the engine of the game as well as in the simulations needed to develop the Guest XR interventions. In line with economic theory, each player in our game aims to maximize their utility through resource harvesting. The dilemma of choosing the proper harvesting rate that maximizes individual total gain without external coordination poses a challenge.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of pediatric OHCA in age, location, and quarantine-related movement restriction subgroups.MethodsCombining the nationwide OHCA registry with the emergency medical service transportation database, we created a database with detailed information on 7657 non-neonatal, pediatric OHCA cases.ResultsThe pandemic period did not significantly alter neurologically favorable 1-month survival compared to pre-pandemic 4 years (95% confidence interval 0.73-1.00). However, the survival rate significantly decreased in the following subgroups of OHCA: school-age (0.62-0.96), outside of school or home (0.52-0.96), and cases where no quarantine-related movement restrictions were applied (0.68-0.97). There was a prominent increase in the proportion of suicide-related OHCA in these subgroups: from 30.3 to 38.1% (1.22-1.64), from 10.2 to 15.9% (1.21-2.28), and from 12.5 to 17.8% (1.30-1.77), respectively.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly alter neurologically favorable 1-month survival.

However, its association with cortical pathology and disease progression is still uncertain. We aimed to characterize choroid plexus enlargement and evolution in MS and its relationship with imaging markers of compartmentalized inflammation and clinical outcome. <bold>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</bold> One hundred patients with MS (74 relapsing-remitting [RRMS]; 26 secondary-progressive MS [SPMS] and 41 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent 3T MRI to measure brain volumes and 7T MRI for cortical and WM lesions, including paramagnetic rim lesion (PRL) segmentation. Choroid plexus volumes of the lateral ventricles were manually edited from FreeSurfer segmentation by 1 neurologist and normalized by total intracranial volume to estimate the choroid plexus ratio (CPR). The Expanded Disability Status Scale was assessed at baseline and longitudinally in 71 patients, 43 of whom had a follow-up MRI at 1.5 years. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm estimated the importance of CPR, alongside other imaging markers, in predicting disease phenotype (RRMS versus SPMS) and progression independent of relapse activity. <bold>RESULTS:</bold> Relative to HC, CPR was higher in patients (11.66 [3.21] versus 14.98 [4.37] x 10(-4), P = .001), both in RRMS and SPMS (P = .007, P = .003), and there was a mean similar to 4% increase per year in CPR at follow-up, though it was not significant[ (P = .14).

Extensive thermal trauma can be life-threatening or result in long-lasting complications, generating a significant impact on quality of life for patients as well as a cost burden to the healthcare system. The importance of addressing global or systemic issues such as resuscitation and management of inhalation injuries is not disputed but is beyond the scope of this review, which focuses on cutaneous pathophysiologic mechanisms for current treatments, both in the acute and long-term settings. Pathophysiological mechanisms of burn progression and wound healing are mediated by highly complex cascades of cellular and biochemical events, which become dysregulated in slow-healing wounds such as burns. Burns can result in fibroproliferative scarring, skin contractures, or chronic wounds that take weeks or months to heal. Burn injuries are highly individualized owing to wound-specific differences such as burn depth and surface area, in addition to patient-specific factors including genetics, immune competency, and age. Other extrinsic complications such as microbial infection can complicate wound healing, resulting in prolonged inflammation and delayed re-epithelialization. Although mortality is decreasing with advancements in burn care, morbidity from postburn deformities continues to be a challenge. Optimizing specialized acute care and late burn outcome intervention on a patient-by-patient basis is critical for successful management of burn wounds and the associated pathological scar outcome. Understanding the fundamentals of integument physiology and the cellular processes involved in wound healing is essential for designing effective treatment strategies for burn wound care as well as development of future therapies.

Hyperoxia, acting via multiple direct and indirect mechanisms, may be a powerful neuroprotective strategy to salvage acutely ischemic brain tissue and extend the time window for acute stroke treatment. Of the available oxygen delivery methods, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) appears to be the most potent, while even normobaric oxygen therapy (NBO) may be effective if started promptly after stroke onset. HBO has so far failed to show efficacy in three clinical trials. The failure of these trials is probably attributable to factors such as delayed time to therapy, inadequate sample size and use of excessive chamber pressures. Previous trials did not assess long-term benefit in patients with tissue reperfusion. In this modern era of stroke thrombolysis and advanced neuroimaging, oxygen therapy may have renewed significance. If applied within the first few hours after stroke onset or in patients with imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue, oxygen therapy could be used to 'buy time' for the administration of thrombolytic or neuroprotective drugs.

Schoolchildren are an accessible population for learning basic life support (BLS) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) and can be regarded as multipliers of knowledge that can reach the whole population. This study aimed to develop and validate a test for examining levels of knowledge about BLS and AED among schoolchildren that can be used to uniformly present reliable data. Methods A knowledge test about BLS and AED consisting of 10 multiple-choice questions was developed and implemented before and after a 2-h BLS and AED course consisting of an interactive lecture and a practical workshop for 783 students in seventh and ninth grades of elementary schools in Maribor, Slovenia. Each question was analyzed and presented with descriptive statistics and educometric parameters (difficulty and discriminating indices). All variables were checked for normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and analyzed using non-parametric tests. Statistical significance of the differences in knowledge before and after intervention were calculated with chi-square statistics and effect sizes r are reported. Differences between genders, grades and previous attendance to BLS courses were compared using Mann - Whitney U test. The effect size was calculated from the Z score and reported as r value. Results After educometric analysis, questions were adjusted to meet the requirements of satisfactory functioning difficulty and discriminating indices (values between 0,40 and 0,60, and above 0,20, respectively). Only one question had to be eliminated due to inadequate difficulty and discriminating index (0,99 and 0,02, respectively). Measurement invariance across gender (p < 0,001), school grade (p < 0,001), and attendance to previous courses (p = 0,303) was assured. Conclusions A test for accurate and reliable measurement of knowledge of BLS and AED among schoolchildren was developed and validated. According to the findings it can now reliably be used to assess baseline knowledge and potential improvement in knowledge after a course on BLS and AED.

With the recognition that lungs are more robust than initially thought, the size of the donor pool of available lungs has increased dramatically in the past decade. Donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD) lungs, both ideal and extended are now routinely utilized. DBD lungs can be damaged. There are important differences in the public's understanding, legal and consent processes, intensive care unit strategies, lung pathophysiology, logistics, and potential-to-actual donor conversion rates between DBD and DCD. Notwithstanding, the short- and long-term outcomes of LTx from any of these DBD versus DCD donor scenarios are now similar, robust, and continue to improve. Large audits suggest there remains a large untapped pool of DCD (but not DBD) lungs that may yet further dramatically increase lung transplant numbers.

Since its initial description in the 18th century, indications have shifted from cardiopulmonary resuscitation to long-term ventilatory support. Recently, the technical development of devices for temporary diaphragm neurostimulation has opened up the possibility of a new era for the management of mechanically ventilated patients. Combining positive pressure ventilation with diaphragm neurostimulation offers a potentially promising new approach to the delivery of mechanical ventilation which may benefit multiple organ systems. Maintaining diaphragm contractions during ventilation may attenuate diaphragm atrophy and accelerate weaning from mechanical ventilation. Preventing atelectasis and preserving lung volume can reduce lung stress and strain and improve homogeneity of ventilation, potentially mitigating ventilatorinduced lung injury. Furthermore, restoring the thoracoabdominal pressure gradient generated by diaphragm contractions may attenuate the drop in cardiac output induced by positive pressure ventilation. Experimental evidence suggests diaphragm neurostimulation may prevent neuroinflammation associated with mechanical ventilation. This review describes the historical development and evolving approaches to diaphragm neurostimulation during mechanical ventilation and surveys the potential mechanisms of benefit.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Effect of non-invasive ventilation on Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of prematurity, leading to long-term pulmonary morbidity. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is associated with ventilator-induced lung injury, oxygen toxicity, and inflammation, all contributing to BPD pathogenesis. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has emerged as a key strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of BPD. We examine the role of various NIV strategies in the respiratory management of premature infants. We discuss the common forms of NIV, including nasal continuous positive airway pressure, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure, highflow nasal cannula, and nasal high-frequency ventilation, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, benefits, and limitations. Several studies have demonstrated that early and appropriate NIV use can reduce the incidence of BPD, improve oxygenation, and promote lung growth. However, NIV is not without challenges, including patient selection, the timing of initiation, and potential difficulties in achieving adequate ventilation, especially in extremely low birth weight neonates. Adjunctive therapies such as early surfactant therapy, less invasive surfactant administration, and caffeine may enhance the effectiveness of NIV. In conclusion, NIV is a promising approach to decreasing BPD, yet its effectiveness relies on proper clinical application and integration with other therapies to maximize its benefits.",SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY,2025,"Dumpa, V; Avulakunta, I; Bhandari, V",10.1016/j.semperi.2025.152061,,WOS:001585952100006,A

Despite years of implementation, the BLS training rate in China has remained modest. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the implementation of BLS training programs in emergency medical service (EMS) centers in China and to identify specific barriers and enablers.Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with key informants from 40 EMS centers in Chinese cities. The participants included 11 directors/deputy directors, 24 training department leaders, and 5 senior trainers. The interview guide was based on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Thematic content analysis was used to identify themes and patterns across the interviews.Results We identified 16 factors influencing the implementation of BLS training programs encompassing the outer content, inner context, innovation and bridging factors. Some factors acted as either barriers or enablers at different EPIS stages. The main implementation barriers included limited external leadership, insufficient government investment, low public awareness, a shortage of trainers, an absence of incentives, an absence of authoritative courses and guidelines, a lack of qualification to issue certificates, limited academic involvement, and insufficient publicity. The main enablers were found to be supportive government leaders, strong public demand, adequate resources, program champions, available high-quality courses of high fitness within the local context, the involvement of diverse institutions, and effective publicity and promotion.Conclusion Our findings emphasize the diversity of stakeholders, the complexity of implementation, and the need for localization and co-construction when conducting BLS training for lay public in city EMS centers.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Early results and operative considerations of endoventricular circular patch plasty for ischemic cardiomyopathy,"Seven patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent elective endoventricular circular patch plasty (EVCPP) were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 63 years old. All seven patients had anterior left ventricular aneurysms following old myocardial infarction. Two patients were graded NYHA class II, 4 patients class III, and one patient class IV. EVCPP was performed under cardiac arrest with moderate hypothermia in five patients. The two most recent patients underwent EVCPP under on-pump beating and normothermia. Coronary artery bypass grafting was conducted in all cases and the mean number of grafts was 1.8, ranging from one to three. The mitral valve was replaced in one patient. One patient died of myonephrotic metabolic syndrome caused by ischemia of the lower limb. In the follow-up of six patients, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDI) decreased significantly from 128 +/- 31 mL/m(2) to 108 +/- 37 mL/m(2). Left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESI) decreased in five patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter remained unchanged after surgery. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 0.28 +/- 0.08 to 0.32 +/- 0.1. LVESI and LVEF did not improve in one patient with a large residual dyskinetic area at the distal LV septum. A residual dyskinetic area at the distal LV septum was observed in two of four patients who underwent EVCPP under cardiac arrest. This condition, however, was not detected in two patients who underwent EVCPP under on-pump beating conditions.

People born extremely premature experience the consequences of the decision made, but information about their perspectives on prenatal decisions is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to describe their perspectives on what is important in decision-making at the limit of viability.DesignSemi-structured focus group discussions were conducted, recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were independently analysed by two researchers in Atlas.ti.ResultsFour focus groups were conducted in the Netherlands, with five to six participants each, born between 240/7 and 300/7 weeks gestation in the period between 1965 and 2002. Considering their personal life experiences and how their extremely premature birth affected their families, the participants reflected on decision-making at the limit of viability. Various considerations were discussed and summarised into the following themes: anticipated parental regret, the wish to look at the baby directly after birth, to give the infant a chance at survival, quality of life, long-term outcomes for the infant and the family, and religious or spiritual considerations.ConclusionsInsights into the perspectives of adults born extremely premature deepened our understanding of values considered in decision-making at the limit of viability.

This study aimed to assess the impact of antimicrobial substances, useful in symbiotic control of H. halys, on the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus through the treatment of egg masses with fungicides (copper hydroxide, sulfur, sweet orange essential oil) and plant biostimulants (flavonoids and chestnut tannin extract), compared with one disinfectant for civil and industrial use (sodium hypochlorite/sodium hydrate/tetraborate decahydrate). Two tests were conducted: one involved exposing egg masses to T. japonicus, followed by treatment post-parasitism for a subset, and treatment after seven days post-parasitism for another subset to evaluate short/long-term effects based on treatment timing variation. Additionally, a choice test between treated and untreated egg masses was conducted to evaluate T. japonicus oviposition preference. Our results showed that all substances did not impact the emergence of parasitoids at both the treatment times, as well as on preference among treatments, choosing indifferently between all paired egg masses.

So far, there is no treatment for PBI; thus, it is urgent to develop new drugs or therapies for the prevention and treatment of brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although multiple constituent herbs or active ingredients of Xinbao Pill (XBP) have shown neuroprotective effects, whether XBP could play a therapeutic role on PBI is still unknown. This study aimed to illustrate the neuroprotective effect of XBP on PBI and probe the underlying mechanisms. Method: We first performed the cell and animal experiments to validate the protective effect of XBP on neurological function. We next identified the potential differential metabolites via metabolomics analysis. We further conducted a comprehensive network pharmacology analysis including overlap gene analysis, protein-protein interaction network, and gene-biological process-module function network to preliminarily investigate the specific mechanism of action (MOA) of XBP against PBI. Finally, PCR, MTT, ELISA assay, as well as Western blotting experiments were made to validate our proposed molecular mechanisms. Result: The in vitro experiment showed that XBP could increase cell viability and ameliorate cell morphological damage in PC12 cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/RO) conditions. The in vivo experiment demonstrated that XBP improved the Neurologic Deficit Score (NDS), lowered the Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) level as well as reversed the typical neuropathological changes in PBI rats, indicating its neuroprotective effect on PBI. Further metabolomics analysis identified 94 differential metabolites after XBP treatment, and multiple metabolites were highly related to CIR. Moreover, network pharmacology results revealed that the therapeutic effect of XBP on PBI may be relevant to mitochondrial quality control (MQC). Mechanistically, XBP could not only promote the expressions of marker proteins including PGC1 alpha, NRF1, TFAM, OPA1, MFN1 as well as MFN2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion but also inhibit those proteins containing DRP1, MFF, FIS1, p62, PINK1, Parkin as well as LC3 in mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Finally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor was demonstrated to play a crucial role in regulating MQC. Conclusions: Our study first determined that XBP might be an underlying anti-PBI formula, which also deciphered the potential MOAs of XBP against PBI by a network pharmacology approach combined with in vivo and in vitro experimental validation.",CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS,2025,"Li, DL; Wu, QH; Li, ZJ; Chen, BJ; Sun, X; Wu, QQ; Ding, ZZ; Liu, LL; Fang, JS; Zeng, RF; Gu, Y; Ding, BH",10.1111/cns.70297,,WOS:001436950300001,A

Room air exposure of an organism primed to develop in a hypoxic environment, lacking antioxidant defenses, and subjected to hyperoxia, hypoxia, and ischemia challenges the newborn with oxidative stress production. Free radicals can be generated by a multitude of other mechanisms, such as glutamate excitotoxicity, excess free iron, inflammation, and immune reactions. Free radical-induced damage caused by oxidative stress appears to be the mOor candidate for the pathogenesis of most of the complications of prematurity, brain being especially at risk, with short to long-term consequences. We review the role of free radical oxidative damage to the newborn brain and propose a mechanism of oxidative injury, taking into consideration the particular maturation-dependent vulnerability of the oligodendrocyte precursors. Prompted by our observation of an increase in plasma Adenosine concentrations significantly associated with brain white matter lesions in some premature infants, we discuss a possible bioenergetics hypothesis, correlated to the oxidative challenge of the premature infant. We aim at explaining both the oxidative stress generation and the mechanism promoting the myelination disturbances. Being white matter abnormalities among the most common lesions of prematurity, the use of Adenosine as a biomarker of brain damage appears promising in order to design neuroprotective strategies.",FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,2018,"Panfoli, I; Candiano, G; Malova, M; De Angelis, L; Cardiello, V; Buonocore, G; Ramenghi, LA",10.3389/fped.2018.00369,,WOS:000451945200001,A

Traditional ventilators are not suitable for prompt out-of-hospital first aid treatment due to the limitations of large size and slow titration. This study proposed a novel portable emergency ventilator prototype with compact structure and efficient titration. The prototype was realized by using a centrifugal fan suitable for volume controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation and pressure controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation modes. The new titration technique was developed based on the relationships between the PWM and flow. The validity of the new prototype was examined using a test-lung (Michigan A13) in comparison with a commercial ventilator (ResMed Stellar 150) under three simulated lung conditions - acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and normal lung. Results indicated that the new prototype could provide desired tidal volume, ventilation respiratory rate, peak inspiratory pressure, peak inspiratory flow, inspiratory time and expiratory time with satisfactory respiratory waveforms, functional per-formance, fast flow supply and accurate parameter control for all three lung conditions. The tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow values were higher than their default values at 500 ml and 33 L, respectively, and the errors were within 10 % of target. The new titration method required only 3 breaths to complete the titration process, which were fewer than the ResMed Stellar 150 that requires at least 5 breaths. The fewer breaths needed for titration may result in shorter response time and could accelerate estimating the lung compliance and airway resistance while running the ventilator. This new prototype with the new titration technique could play a role in various emergency situations for out-of-hospital, transport or in-hospital first aid.",BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,2023,"Ding, BZ; Xu, F; Wang, JL; Pang, JJ; Chen, YG; Li, K",10.1016/j.bspc.2023.104619,,WOS:000964134100001,A

Although corticosteroids, particularly hydrocortisone, promote positive effects on hemodynamic stability in septic shock, the efficacy of these drugs remains controversial. In this narrative review, we aimed at appraising the actual role of corticosteroids focusing specifically on septic shock. We conducted a comprehensive search of the recent literature, including randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and current clinical guidelines, to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the management of septic shock. Studies were evaluated to determine the impact on mortality, hemodynamics, and other clinical outcomes. The studies showed variability in dosing and time of administration as well as patient selection, which highlighted the lack of a standardized treatment approach. While corticosteroids improved short-term hemodynamic outcomes and reduced vasopressor requirement, their effect on long-term survival was minimal. These results led current guidelines to a weak recommendation for hydrocortisone use in septic shock patients with persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Corticosteroids, e.g. hydrocortisone, can be beneficial in managing septic shock, but their role remains uncertain.

We aimed to observe the changes of serum eCIRP and evaluate whether the increased serum eCIRP was associated with the severity and prognosis in patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Methods: A total of 73 patients after ROSC were divided into non-survivor (n = 48) and survivor (n = 25) groups based on 28-day survival. Healthy volunteers (n = 25) were enrolled as controls. Serum eCIRP, procalcitonin (PCT), the pro-inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL)-6 and high mobility group protein (HMGB1), the neurological damage biomarkers neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and soluble protein 100 beta (S100 beta) were measured on days 1, 3, and 7 after ROSC. Clinical data and laboratory findings were collected, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) were calculated concurrently. Cerebral performance category scores on day 28 after ROSC were recorded. Results: Serum eCIRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PCT, and HMGB1, NSE and S100 beta were significantly increased within the first week after ROSC. The increased levels of eCIRP were positively correlated with IL-6, TNF-alpha, lactate, NSE, S100 beta, CPR time, SOFA score, APACHE II score, and HMGB1 after ROSC. Serum eCIRP on days 1, 3, and 7 after ROSC could predict 28-day mortality and neurological prognosis. Serum eCIRP on day 3 after ROSC had a biggest AUC [0.862 (95% CI: 0.741-0.941)] for 28-day mortality and a biggest AUC [0.807 (95% CI: 0.630-0.981)] for neurological prognosis.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Medical perspectives regarding goals-of-care consultations in Emergency Departments,"Goals-of-care discussions aim to establish patient values for shared medical decision-making. These discussions are relevant towards end-of-life as patients may receive non-beneficial treatments if they have never discussed preferences for care. End-of-life care is provided in Emergency Departments (EDs) but little is known regarding ED-led goals-of-care discussions. We aimed to explore practitioner perspectives on goals-of-care discussions for adult ED patients nearing end-of-life. We report the qualitative component of a mixed methods study regarding a 'Goals-of-Care' form in an Australian ED. Eighteen out of 34 doctors who completed the form were interviewed. We characterised ED-led goals-of-care consultations for the first time. Emergency doctors perceive goals-of-care discussions to be relevant to their practice and occurring frequently. They aim to ensure appropriate care is provided prior to review by the admitting team, focusing on limitations of treatment and clarity in the care process. ED doctors felt they could recognise end-of-life and that ED visits often prompt consideration of end-of-life care planning. They wanted long-term practitioners to initiate discussions prior to patient deterioration. There were numerous interpretations of palliative care concepts.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a better strategy for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention,"Background: The incidence of cardiac arrest (CA) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is relatively rare. However, when it does occur, the mortality rate is extremely high. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promising survival rates for in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA), with low-flow time being an independent prognostic factor for CA. However, there is no definitive answer on how to reduce low-flow time. Methods: This retrospective study, conducted at a single center, included 39 patients who underwent ECPR during PCI between January 2016 and December 2022. The patients were divided into two cohorts based on whether standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was utilized during PCI: standby ECPR (SBE) (n = 13) and extemporaneous ECPR (EE) (n = 26). We compared the 30-day mortality rates between these two cohorts and investigated factors associated with survival. Results: Compared to the EE cohort, the SBE cohort showed significantly lower low-flow time (P < 0.01), ECMO operation time (P < 0.01), and a lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (P = 0.017), as well as peak lactate (P < 0.01). Stand-by ECMO was associated with improved 30-day survival (p = 0.036), while prolonged low-flow time (p = 0.004) and a higher SYNTAX II score (p = 0.062) predicted death at 30 days. Conclusions: Standby ECMO can provide significant benefits for patients who undergo ECPR for CA during PCI. It is a viable option for high-risk PCI cases and may enhance the overall prognosis. The low-flow time remains a critical determinant of survival.",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2024,"Liu, C; Li, XX; Li, J; Shen, DL; Sun, QQ; Zhao, JJ; Zhao, H; Fu, GW",10.3389/fmed.2024.1404479,,WOS:001268547700001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Dysautonomia in athletes,"Dysautonomia is a complex syndrome involving dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is responsible for regulating many involuntary bodily functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and thermoregulation. In athletes, this condition can arise due to various interconnected factors, including physical overload and chronic stress associated with intensive training and frequent competitions. This prolonged state of stress can disrupt the autonomic balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, leading to a predominance of symptoms such as tachycardia, latent hypertension, and orthostatic intolerance. Athletes with a genetic predisposition, such as those with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, are particularly vulnerable to dysautonomia due to the fragility of connective tissue, which impairs vascular function and increases susceptibility to episodes of hypotension and reduced exercise capacity. Additionally, brain injuries, common in contact sports, can damage the nerve centers responsible for autonomic control, leading to episodes of ""paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity,"" characterized by hypertension, excessive sweating, and other dysautonomic manifestations. The use of vasoactive drugs, often employed to manage other medical conditions, can exacerbate the symptoms of dysautonomia, further compromising an athlete's ability to maintain optimal performance. This condition not only impairs training and competition ability but also increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke and cardiac arrest, especially during intense physical activity. Therefore, it is crucial to early identify athletes with dysautonomia through tools and analyses of the ANS, such as photoplethysmographic heart rate variability analysis, to receive timely diagnosis and regular monitoring to evaluate autonomic parameters and the effectiveness of any treatments to mitigate associated risks. These include optimizing training load, lifestyle adjustments, potential pharmacological regulation, and adopting preventive measures to avoid trauma, which can significantly improve the quality of life and sports performance of these athletes and enhance long-term outcomes.",MEDICINA DELLO SPORT,2024,"Boschiero, D; Beltrami, G; Marro, M; Ferrari, F; Sacco, A; Pecorelli, S",10.23736/S0025-7826.24.04480-6,,WOS:001359548600001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Patients' and healthcare providers' understandings of life-sustaining treatment: Are perceptions of goals shared or divergent?,"In this cross-sectional qualitative study, researchers performed in-depth, semistructured interviews with 30 pairs of patients and their primary care providers in an outpatient clinic of a large, urban Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center in the United States. During audiotaped interviews to assess their understanding of advance directive concepts, participants were asked what ""life-sustaining treatment"" means to them and why they think of it in the way they do. The findings indicate that patients and providers in the United States tend to view and discuss life-sustaining treatment in terms of four goals for end-of-life care: (1) extending the length of life, (2) improving the quality of life, (3) maintaining or improving specific biological functions, and (4) assisting the body for a temporary period of time. Patients thought providers were more concerned with extending the length of life than with quality-based outcomes, and patients often discussed life-sustaining treatment as acceptable means for short-term but not long-term use. Many providers indicated that they struggle with conflicting quality-based and physiologic care goals. The findings highlight the importance of eliciting patient preferences not only for specific types of treatment, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but also for end-of-life care goals or desired health-related outcomes, such as maximizing the quantity of life. The findings also suggest that advance directives and patient-provider discussions that focus on acceptable health states and valued life activities may be better suited to patients' end-of-life care goals than those that focus on specific medical interventions.

However, only a few bystanders are willing to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The use of a live video during emergency calls appears to have a positive effect on the number of cardiopulmonary resuscitations performed by bystanders.Objective: The objective of this study is to propose and evaluate the relevance of a living lab methodology involving video calls in simulated life-threatening emergency situations.Methods: The first study aimed at analyzing the process of dealing with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at a dispatch center and identifying the needs of the dispatchers. The second study is a pretest of a living lab. The third study focuses on a living lab in which 16 situations of cardiac arrest and airway obstruction are simulated. The simulation includes both a live video and transmission of a video demonstration of emergency procedures. The measures focus on 3 areas: the impact of video tools, development of collaboration within the community, and evaluation of the method.Results: The results of the first study show that dispatchers have an interest in visualizing the scene with live video and in broadcasting a live demonstration video when possible. The initial results also show that collaboration within the community is enhanced by the shared simulation and debriefing experiences, clarifying regulation procedures, and improving communication. Finally, an iterative development based on the lessons learned, expectations, and constraints of each previous study promotes the existence of a living lab that aims to determine the place of live video tools in the sequence of care performed by dispatchers.Conclusions: Living labs offer the opportunity to grasp previously undetected insights and refine the use of the applications while potentially developing a sense of community among the stakeholders.",JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,2023,"Morand, O; Larribau, R; Safin, S; Pages, R; Soichet, H; Rizza, C",10.2196/40699,,WOS:001015245000030,A

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Review of Abdominal Damage Control and Open Abdomens: Focus on Gastrointestinal Complications,"Massive trauma and abdominal catastrophes carry high morbidity and mortality. In addition to the primary pathologic process, a secondary systemic injury, characterized by inflammatory mediator release, contributes to subsequent cellular, end-organ, and systemic dysfunction. These processes, in conjunction with large-volume resuscitations and tissue hypoperfusion, lead to acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. This ""lethal triad"" synergistically contributes to further physiologic derangements and, if uncorrected, may result in patient death. One manifestation of the associated clinical syndrome is the development of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The development of ACS is insidious. If not recognized and treated promptly, ACS leads to multi-system organ failure (MSOF) and mortality. Improved understanding of IAH and ACS led to the development of damage control (DC)/open abdomen (OA) as surgical decompressive strategy. The DC/OA approach consists of three basic management steps. During the initial step the abdomen is opened, hemorrhage/abdominal contamination are controlled, and temporary abdominal closure is performed (Stage I). The patient then enters Stage 11 physiologic restoration with core rewarming, correction of coagulopathy and completion of acute resuscitation. After physiologic normalization, definitive management of injuries and eventual abdominal closure (Stage III) are achieved.

Cardiac arrest witnessed by emergency medical services (EMS) accounts for approximately 16% of prehospital traumatic cardiac arrests, but the prognosis is unknown. We aimed to compare the 1-month survival rate of cardiac arrest witnessed by EMS with that of cardiac arrest witnessed by bystanders and unwitnessed cardiac arrest in trac trauma victims; further, the time from injury to cardiac arrest was assessed. Methods: This analysis used the Utstein Registry in Japan and included data of 3883 patients with traumatic cardiac arrest caused by trac collisions registered between 2014 and 2019 in Japan. Results: The 1-month survival rate was 10.9% in the EMS-witnessed cardiac arrest group; this was significantly higher than that in the bystander witnessed (7.2%) and unwitnessed (5.6%) cardiac arrest groups (P < 0.01). The median time from injury to cardiac arrest was 18 min (25% quartile: 12, 75% quartile: 26). Conclusion: The 1-month survival rate was significantly higher in the EMS-witnessed cardiac arrest group than in the bystander-witnessed and unwitnessed cardiac arrest groups. It is important to prevent progression to cardiac arrest in trauma patients with intact respiratory function and pulse rate at the time of contact with EMS.

Patients were selected from the Burn Intensive Care Unit at El-Demerdash Hospital, Ain Shams University. On the microscopic level, HDVC infusion significantly reduced inflammation as evidenced by decreased iNOS immuno-expression and inflammatory cell count, markedly improved tissue barrier function as expressed in enhanced occludin immune-reactivity, significantly decreased the mean area percentage of dermal capillaries, and promoted angiogenesis through increased immuno-expression over time in skin punch biopsies.

A less commonly used method of promoting early resuscitation and hemorrhagic control in trauma patients is resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). The focus of this literature review is to examine the effectiveness of REBOA in the management of noncompressible pelvic hemorrhage when compared with traditional methods of hemorrhage control in trauma patients. A literature search was performed by using the PubMed database to explore studies that defined the efficacy of REBOA or compared the use of REBOA with resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping for hemorrhage control. Studies encompassed in the review included 3 experimental studies utilizing swine, 2 retrospective studies that reviewed data collected from procedures performed in empirical situations, and a case series that described the implementation of REBOA. Trauma patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage that is intervened with REBOA have higher mean arterial pressures and systolic blood pressures, require fewer boluses of intravenous fluids and vasopressors, avoid severe acidosis and ischemia, and have significantly lower rates of mortality, thus ensuring enhanced long-term outcomes. Evidence suggests that hemodynamic stability, physiological effects, and mortality rates are improved in patients who receive REBOA for torso hemorrhage control when compared with traditional methods.",JOURNAL OF TRAUMA NURSING,2018,"Sambor, M",10.1097/JTN.0000000000000339,,WOS:000426556900006,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,(+)-Naltrexone is neuroprotective and promotes alternative activation in the mouse hippocampus after cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Despite dramatic improvement in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other techniques for cardiac arrest (CA), the majority of survivors continue to show signs of decreased memory or executive cognitive function. Such memory impairment may be due to hippocampal CA1 neuronal death, which is delayed by several days after CA/CPR. Classical microgliosis in the CA1 region may contribute to neuronal death, yet the role of a key activation receptor Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) has not been previously investigated for such neuronal death after CA/CPR. We show that (+)-naltrexone was neuroprotective after CA/CPR. TLR4 blockade was associated with decreased expression of markers for microglial/macrophage activation and T cell and B cell infiltration, as well as decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Notably, IL-10 expression was elevated in response to CA/CPR, but was not attenuated by (+)-naltrexone, suggesting that the local monocyte/microglial phenotype had shifted towards alternative activation. This was confirmed by elevated expression of Arginase-1, and decreased expression of NF kappa B p65 subunit. Thus, (+)-naltrexone and other TLR4 antagonists may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate the substantial burden of memory or executive cognitive function impairment after CA/CPR.

A prospective survey,"The hospital cardiac arrest team is summoned in response to a sudden severe deterioration in a patient's condition. However, clinical experience suggests that some calls to general wards are preceded by a more gradual, possibly treatable decline. We undertook this study to define the extent of the problem and look for features that might enable prediction and prevention of cardiorespiratory arrest. We identified patients on general medical and surgical wards for whom cardiac arrest calls had been made. Their casenotes were examined for documentation of abnormal physical signs and laboratory test results in the 24 h before the call. We noted what doctors and nurses had done after abnormalities had been found. Over a 28-week period, calls were made for 47 patients on these wards. Twenty-four (51%) had premonitory signs. These patients were also less likely to survive to hospital discharge (P=0.02). We conclude that some cardiorespiratory arrests are predictable. Wider appreciation of the significance of abnormal signs and laboratory test results could lead to prompter involvement of experienced clinicians and more aggressive therapy. Alternatively, as mortality is so high in this group of patients, more patients could be appropriately designated 'not for resuscitation'. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

On the basis of the similarity of the photoplethysmography signal (from ventricular fibrillation or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Following its development, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval of 64.32% to 70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model.

Recent visual epicardial observations in an open-chest, open-pericardium model of swine VF indicate that blood flows from the high-pressure arterial system to the lower-pressure venous system during untreated VF, thereby overdistending the right ventricle and apparently decreasing left ventricular size. Therefore, inadequate left ventricular stroke volume after defibrillation from prolonged VF has been postulated as a major contributor to the development of pulseless rhythms.",CIRCULATION,2005,"Berg, RA; Sorrell, VL; Kern, KB; Hilwig, RW; Altbach, MI; Hayes, MM; Bates, KA; Ewy, GA",10.1161/01.CIR.0000157147.26869.31,,WOS:000227469600008,A

Methods: We developed a machine learning algorithm to automatically predict the circulatory state during cardiopulmonary resuscitation from 4-second-long snippets of accelerometry and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from pauses of chest compressions of real-world defibrillator records. The algorithm was trained based on 422 cases from the German Resuscitation Registry, for which ground truth labels were created by a manual annotation of physicians. It uses a kernelized Support Vector Machine classifier based on 49 features, which partially reflect the correlation between accelerometry and electrocardiogram data. Results: Evaluating 50 different test-training data splits, the proposed algorithm exhibits a balanced accuracy of 81.2%, a sensitivity of 80.6%, and a specificity of 81.8%, whereas using only ECG leads to a balanced accuracy of 76.5%, a sensitivity of 80.2%, and a specificity of 72.8%. Conclusion: The first method employing accelerometry for pulse/no-pulse decision yields a significant increase in performance compared to single ECG-signal usage. Significance: This shows that accelerometry provides relevant information for pulse/no-pulse decisions.

Exploratory work suggests that enhancing feedback and follow-up to emergency medical service (EMS) staff might provide staff with closure and improve clinical performance. Our aim was to summarise the literature on the types of feedback received by EMS professionals and its effects on the quality and safety of patient care, staff well-being and professional development. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis, including primary research studies of any method published in peer-reviewed journals. Studies were included if they contained information on systematic feedback to emergency ambulance staff regarding their performance. Databases searched from inception were MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, HMIC, CINAHL and Web of Science, with searches last updated on 2 August 2022. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data analysis followed a convergent integrated design involving simultaneous narrative synthesis and random effects multilevel meta-analyses. ResultsThe search strategy yielded 3183 articles, with 48 studies meeting inclusion criteria after title/abstract screening and full-text review. Interventions were categorised as audit and feedback (n=31), peer-to-peer feedback (n=3), postevent debriefing (n=2), incident-prompted feedback (n=1), patient outcome feedback (n=1) or a combination thereof (n=4). Feedback was found to have a moderate positive effect on quality of care and professional development with a pooled effect of d=0.50 (95% CI 0.34, 0.67). Feedback to EMS professionals had large effects in improving documentation (d=0.73 (0.00, 1.45)) and protocol adherence (d=0.68 (0.12, 1.24)), as well as small effects in enhancing cardiac arrest performance (d=0.46 (0.06, 0.86)), clinical decision-making (d=0.47 (0.23, 0.72)), ambulance times (d=0.43 (0.12, 0.74)) and survival rates (d=0.22 (0.11, 0.33)). The between-study heterogeneity variance was estimated at sigma(2)=0.32 (95% CI 0.22, 0.50), with an I-2 value of 99% (95% CI 98%, 99%), indicating substantial statistical heterogeneity. ConclusionThis review demonstrated that the evidence base currently does not support a clear single point estimate of the pooled effect of feedback to EMS staff as a single intervention type due to study heterogeneity. Further research is needed to provide guidance and frameworks supporting better design and evaluation of feedback interventions within EMS.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,SHock-INduced Endotheliopathy (SHINE): A mechanistic justification for viscoelastography-guided resuscitation of traumatic and non-traumatic shock,"Irrespective of the reason for hypoperfusion, hypocoagulable and/or hyperfibrinolytic hemostatic aberrancies afflict up to one-quarter of critically ill patients in shock. Intensivists and traumatologists have embraced the concept of SHock-INduced Endotheliopathy (SHINE) as a foundational derangement in progressive shock wherein sympatho-adrenal activation may cause systemic endothelial injury. The pro-thrombotic endothelium lends to micro-thrombosis, enacting a cycle of worsening perfusion and increasing catecholamines, endothelial injury, de-endothelialization, and multiple organ failure. The hypocoagulable/hyperfibrinolytic hemostatic phenotype is thought to be driven by endothelial release of anti-thrombogenic mediators to the bloodstream and perivascular sympathetic nerve release of tissue plasminogen activator directly into the microvasculature. In the shock state, this hemostatic phenotype may be a counterbalancing, yet maladaptive, attempt to restore blood flow against a systemically pro-thrombotic endothelium and increased blood viscosity. We therefore review endothelial physiology with emphasis on glycocalyx function, unique biomarkers, and coagulofibrinolytic mediators, setting the stage for understanding the pathophysiology and hemostatic phenotypes of SHINE in various etiologies of shock. We propose that the hyperfibrinolytic phenotype is exemplified in progressive shock whether related to trauma-induced coagulopathy, sepsis-induced coagulopathy, or post-cardiac arrest syndrome-associated coagulopathy. Regardless of the initial insult, SHINE appears to be a catecholamine-driven entity which early in the disease course may manifest as hyper- or hypocoagulopathic and hyper- or hypofibrinolytic hemostatic imbalance. Moreover, these hemostatic derangements may rapidly evolve along the thrombohemorrhagic spectrum depending on the etiology, timing, and methods of resuscitation. Given the intricate hemochemical makeup and changes during these shock states, macroscopic whole blood tests of coagulative kinetics and clot strength serve as clinically useful and simple means for hemostasis phenotyping. We suggest that viscoelastic hemostatic assays such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are currently the most applicable clinical tools for assaying global hemostatic function-including fibrinolysis-to enable dynamic resuscitation with blood products and hemostatic adjuncts for those patients with thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic complications in shock states.",FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,2023,"Bunch, CM; Chang, E; Moore, EE; Moore, HB; Kwaan, HC; Miller, JB; Al-Fadhl, MD; Thomas, AV; Zackariya, N; Patel, SS; Zackariya, S; Haidar, S; Patel, B; McCurdy, MT; Thomas, SG; Zimmer, D; Fulkerson, D; Kim, PY; Walsh, MR; Hake, D; Kedar, A; Aboukhaled, M; Walsh, MM",10.3389/fphys.2023.1094845,,WOS:000948489700001,A

We investigated the cerebrovascular effects of intravenous epinephrine in a swine model of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Estradiol rescues neurons from global ischemia-induced cell death: Multiple cellular pathways of neuroprotection,"The potential neuroprotective role of sex hormones in chronic neurodegenerative disorders and acute brain ischemia following cardiac arrest and stroke is of a great therapeutic interest. Long-term pretreatment with estradiol and other estrogens affords robust neuroprotection in male and female rodents subjected to focal and global ischemia. However, the receptors (e.g., cell surface or nuclear), intracellular signaling pathways and networks of estrogen-regulated genes that intervene in neuronal apoptosis are as yet unclear. We have shown that estradiol administered at physiological levels for two weeks before ischemia rescues neurons destined to die in the hippocampal CA1 and ameliorates ischemia-induced cognitive deficits in ovariectomized female rats. This regimen of estradiol treatment involves classical intracellular estrogen receptors, transactivation of IGF-1 receptors and stimulation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which in turn maintains CREB activity in the ischemic CA1. We also find that a single, acute injection of estradiol administrated into the brain ventricle immediately after an ischemic event reduces both neuronal death and cognitive deficits. Because these findings suggest that hormones could be used to treat patients when given after brain ischemia, it is critical to determine whether the same or different pathways mediate this form of neuroprotection. We find that an agonist of the membrane estrogen receptor GPR30 mimics short latency estradiol facilitation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Therefore, we are testing the hypothesis that GPR30 may act together with intracellular estrogen receptors to activate cell signaling pathways to promote neuron survival after global ischemia.

Herein, peracetic acid (PAA) oxidation, a green and potent disinfection method, was combined with a physical nanowire-assisted electroporation (EP) to develop the synchronous EP/PAA approach, aiming to reinforce bacterial inactivation via facilitating PAA permeation from EP-induced pores for oxidative damage of cell structures. The locally enhanced electric field near nanowire tips at a low voltage of 1.5 V induced 38.4 % and 52.4 % cells with reversible and irreversible membrane damages, accompanied by 72.5 % cells inactivation and 18.3 % VBNC cells formation.

The promising development of FR systems over the past years has been challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19. Whilst increased numbers and worse outcomes of cardiac arrests during the pandemic suggest a need for expansion of FR schemes, appropriate risk management is required to protect first responders and patients from contracting COVID-19. This study investigated how European FR schemes were affected by the pandemic and what measures were taken to protect patients and responders from COVID-19. Methods To identify FR schemes in Europe we conducted a literature search and a web search. The schemes were contacted and invited to answer an online questionnaire during the second wave of the pandemic (December 2020/ January 2021) in Europe. Results We have identified 135 FR schemes in 28 countries and included responses from 47 FR schemes in 16 countries. 25 schemes reported deactivation due to COVID-19 at some point, whilst 22 schemes continued to operate throughout the pandemic. 39 schemes communicated a pandemic-specific algorithm to their first responders. Before the COVID-19 outbreak 20 FR systems did not provide any personal protective equipment (PPE). After the outbreak 19 schemes still did not provide any PPE. The majority of schemes experienced falling numbers of accepted call outs and decreasing registrations of new volunteers. Six schemes reported of FR having contracted COVID-19 on a mission. Conclusions European FR schemes were considerably affected by the pandemic and exhibited a range of responses to protect patients and responders. Overall, FR schemes saw a decrease in activity, which was in stark contrast to the high demand caused by the increased incidence and mortality of OHCA during the pandemic.

Endovascular techniques are becoming more common in surgical treatment, but they also present new challenges in terms of complications and outcomes. It is rec-ommended that patients with suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms be trans-ferred to facilities with both open and endovascular treatment options and a track record of successful outcomes to ensure the best patient care and long-term results. To achieve opti-mal patient outcomes, close collaboration and regular case discussions between health care professionals are necessary, as well as participation in educational programs to promote a culture of teamwork and continuous improvement. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

These phenomena are attributed to excitotoxicity, changes in the blood-brain barrier, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and ultimately neuronal death. In addition, genetic factors such as post-ischemic changes in genetic programming in the expression of amyloid protein precursor, & beta;-secretase, presenilin-1 and -2, and tau protein play an important role in the irreversible progression of post-ischemic neurodegeneration. Since current treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms such as dementia and disability, the search for causative therapy that would be helpful in preventing and treating post-ischemic neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy is ongoing. Numerous studies have shown that the high contents of flavonoids and phenolic acids in honey have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-amyloid, anti-tau protein, anticholinesterase, serotonergic, and AMPAK activities, influencing signal transmission and neuroprotective effects. Notably, in many preclinical studies, flavonoids and phenolic acids, the main components of honey, were also effective when administered after ischemia, suggesting their possible use in promoting recovery in stroke patients.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,An approach for the emergency diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in elderly individuals: a literature review,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse dysfunction of the nervous system resulting from sepsis originating outside the central nervous system. Elderly individuals (>= 65 years of age) constitute a particularly vulnerable population comprised by a high burden of underlying diseases and complications, which frequently leads to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. These patients are at increased risk of long-term or permanent central nervous system impairment, making rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment especially critical. The review is expected to promote improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of SAE in elderly patients, ultimately achieving more standardized and effi cient SAE management. METHODS: We performed a literature search in four databases-PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang-from inception to April 2025 using bilinguals (Chinese and English). RESULTS: The diagnostic criteria for SAE in elderly individuals include the following: (1) sepsis; (2) new-onset neurological dysfunction; and (3) exclusion of other causes of neurological dysfunction. Physicians should develop tailored empiric anti-infective plans for elderly SAE patients, considering comorbidities, organ function, infection site, local bacterial spectrum, and resistance. The treatment protocol can be adjusted once the pathogen is identified. Stabilizing hemodynamics and ensuring cerebral perfusion are two fluid resuscitation strategies used in elderly SAE patients. An individualized approach to fluid resuscitation using restrictive fluid volumes should be employed. Supportive treatment for elderly SAE patients focuses on improving tissue perfusion/oxygenation, controlling blood glucose levels, and correcting internal imbalances. Early rehabilitation, nutritional support, cognitive training, and family-based emotional support are important components of comprehensive care.

Amiodarone is one of the most frequently used antiarrhythmic drugs in clinical practice. In patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom rhythm control is judged desirable, amiodarone is the most effective therapy. Amiodarone effectively prevents atrial fibrillation and may improve quality of life, but there is no evidence that it decreases mortality or severe morbidity in atrial fibrillation. In patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone may decrease mortality to a small degree, but the evidence for this benefit is incomplete. Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators frequently require antiarrhythmic drug therapy, especially to treat electrical storm. Amiodarone is useful in these patients; however, it may increase defibrillation thresholds in some patients.

Prompt recognition followed by emergency fasciotomy is required to avoid permanent disability. A better understanding of the different clinical presentations may lead to improved outcomes through more expedient diagnosis and treatment. We describe five new cases of AACS caused by illicit drug abuse within the McGill University Hospitals, with a review of all 102 similar patients previously documented in the literature between January 1970 and May 1997, The average age for all cases was 29 years, with 74% being male. The presence of edema, pain, tension, and skin changes were the most frequent symptoms and signs reported. There appear to be two distinct mechanisms of poisoning-induced AACS: (1) direct vasotoxicity and (2) limb compression caused by prolonged comatose state. Direct vasotoxicity is more likely to lead to eventual amputation, whereas prolonged limb compression is more likely to progress to systemic complications such as azotemia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and renal failure (Crush Syndrome). Long-term sequelae of motor loss, sensory disruption, and development of contracture were common in AACS of both causes. Because Compartment Syndrome is a surgical emergency, primary care and emergency physicians must have a high index of suspicion to promptly recognize and treat this problem.

Historically, mannitol has been the recommended first-line osmotic agent; however, concerns surrounding its use, including hypotension, rebound ICP elevation, and renal toxicity, have prompted a quest for alternative strategies. Hypertonic saline (HS) has emerged as a promising substitute, demonstrating efficacy in reducing ICP without compromising cerebral perfusion. This comprehensive analysis explores the comparative effectiveness of Mannitol and Hypertonic Saline in the context of severe TBIs. While Mannitol has been a longstanding choice, recent attention has shifted towards HS due to its reported superiority in ICP reduction. Concerns associated with mannitol, such as hypotension and rebound ICP, are juxtaposed against the potential advantages offered by HS. The scarcity of clinical studies focusing on TBIrelated outcomes, such as patient survival and long-term benefits, is highlighted, underscoring a critical gap in the current knowledge landscape. The review aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the comparative effectiveness of Mannitol and Hypertonic Saline, considering not only ICP control but also broader patient outcomes.

This study examines the significance of initial vital signs and blood gas analysis (BGA)-derived values as clinically useful early indicators of mortality risk in critically ill patients, both during in the resuscitation room care and within the following 30 days, with a focus on evaluating the individual predictive performance of accessible clinical parameters.MethodsWe pooled data from two consecutive retrospective observational studies in a German university ED to analyze an unselected patient population of non-traumatic critically ill patients. Vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and BGA values (including pH, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate, electrolyte levels) on admission to the ED, were used to estimate the impact on both resuscitation room and 30-day mortality.ResultsIn 1,536 critically ill patients, pH, lactate and bicarbonate were found to be potential predictors of resuscitation room mortality. In contrast, vital signs showed limited reliability in predicting outcomes. Of all tested variables, pH demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) value among the analyzed markers for resuscitation room mortality (AUC 0.81 [95% CI 0.75-0.87]). However, the AUC of pH for 30-day mortality decreased to 0.64 ([0.6 - 0.68], indicating a complex interplay of factors influencing long-term outcome. A subgroup analysis based on pH showed a substantial increase in resuscitation room and 30-day mortality for patients with a pH below 7.2 as well as a second increase below 7.0.ConclusionOur study highlights important parameters for the assessment of critically ill patients at ED admission that are helpful for formulating immediate medical decisions.

For the past 50 years, the recommendation in the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines has been that defibrillation is the only option for shockable cardiac arrest. There is growing evidence to demonstrate that mitochondria play a vital role in the outcome of postresuscitation cardiac function. Although targeting mitochondria to improve resuscitation outcome following cardiac arrest has been proposed for many years, understanding concerning the changes in mitochondria during cardiac arrest, especially in the case of VF, is still limited. In addition, despite new research initiatives and improved medical technology, the overall survival rates of patients with SCA still remain the same. Understanding cardiac mitochondrial alterations during fatal arrhythmias may help to enable the formulation of strategies to improve the outcomes of resuscitation. The attenuation of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction during VF through pharmacological intervention as well as ischaemic postconditioning could also be a promising target for intervention and inform a new paradigm of treatments. In this review, the existing evidence available from in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies regarding the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction during VF is comprehensively summarized and discussed.

PC-ECLS can be a life-saving procedure and is mostly applied in the presence of unexpected, severe cardio-respiratory complication. Despite PC-ECLS being critical in allowing for organ recovery, it is unfortunately closely connected with an unpredictable outcomes, high morbidity, and, even in the case of cardiac function improvement, potential sustained disabilities that have a life-changing impact for the patient and his or her family. Since the decision to start PC-ECLS is made in an acute setting, there is often only limited or no time for self-determined choices. Due to the major impact of the intervention, it would be highly desirable to obtain informed consent before starting PC-ECLS, since the autonomy of the patient and shared-decision making are two of the most important ethical values in modern medicine. Recent developments regarding awareness of the impacts of a prolonged intensive care stay make this a particularly relevant topic. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop a structural strategy that takes into account the likelihood of such an intervention and the wishes and preferences of the patient, and thus the related autonomy of the patient.

In interviews, respondents found KATC personally transformative but not sufficient for facility-wide improvement due to issues with retention, lack of trained peers, and resource shortages. Resource perception surveys similarly demonstrated profound resource shortages and variation across facilities.ConclusionsTrained providers view short-term trauma training interventions positively, but these courses may lack long-term impact due to barriers to adopting best practices. Trauma courses should include more frontline providers, target skill transference and retention, and increase the proportion of trained providers at each facility to promote communities of practice.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,CPAPER,Development of cardiopulmonary - cerebral resuscitation in the twentieth century,"Before the renaissance, death was to be accepted as an act of God. From then on, there was a will to attempt resuscitation. The ability to reverse coma-induced airway obstruction, apnea, and pulselessness began in response to accidents caused by general anesthesia in the late 1800s. Around 1900, knowledge existed about the majority of CPR steps. This knowledge, however, was then not assembled into an effective system because of lack of communication between laboratory researchers, clinicians, and rescuers. Open-chest CPR was effectively practiced in operating rooms during the first half of the 20th century. Anglo-American anesthesiologists co-pioneered trauma resuscitation during World War II. Modem cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation (CPCR), which is now giving every person the ability to challenge death anywhere, has been developed since the 1950s. Through research in Baltimore, the chest-pressure and back-pressure ann-lift methods of artificial ventilation, taught for 100 years, were replaced by backward tilt of the head and direct mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and emergency artificial circulation by sternal compressions was rediscovered. Steps A-B-C of basic life-support were extended-to advanced and prolonged life-support. Anesthesiologists pioneered hospital ICUs almost simultaneously on three continents. In the 1960s and 1970s, several groups initiated CPR education research, the development of training aids, effective resuscitation delivery through emergency medical services (EMS) systems, and the multidisciplinary specialty of critical care medicine (CCM). Since the 1970s and 1980s, cerebral resuscitation potentials after prolonged cardiac arrest have been evaluated with ICU outcome models in large animals and in randomized clinical outcome studies. Pharmacologic strategies have given relatively disappointing results. Mechanism-oriented research escalated. Postarrest CBF promotion improved outcome in animals and patients. A breakthrough came in the 1980s and 1990s with the revival of research into therapeutic hypothermia. Mild resuscitative postarrest hypothermia (which is simple and safe) showed a breakthrough effect, extending the normothermic arrest reversibility limit from 5 to 10 min no-flow. Clinical trials of mild hypothermia are being reported now, with positive results. Animal research has begun into ""suspended animation for delayed resuscitation"" for temporarily unresuscitable cardiac arrest. Education research, delivery programs, and case registries for ongoing outcome evaluation should get higher priority. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Biopsy results were positive for amelanotic melanoma. The patient underwent extensive debridement surgery, and she was started on chemotherapy with a close follow-up with an oncologist. In the setting of an aggressive course of disease, unfortunately, the patient passed away secondary to sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac melanoma, also known as melanoma of the heart, is an extremely rare type of melanoma that originates in the heart. This case attributes to the professional growth and competency of healthcare providers involved in the care of patients with cardiac melanoma, ultimately aiming to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.

Methods and results Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are similar to 30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries.",EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL,2022,"Timmis, A; Vardas, P; Townsend, N; Torbica, A; Katus, H; De Smedt, D; Gale, CP; Maggioni, AP; Petersen, SE; Huculeci, R; Kazakiewicz, D; Rubio, VD; Ignatiuk, B; Raisi-Estabragh, Z; Pawlak, A; Karagiannidis, E; Treskes, R; Gaita, D; Beltrame, JF; McConnachie, A; Bardinet, I; Graham, I; Flather, M; Elliott, P; Mossialos, EA; Weidinger, F; Achenbach, S",10.1093/eurheartj/ehab892,,WOS:000756808400001,A

AH should be suspected in patients also in moderate climates throughout all seasons. Compared with other countries, the mortality rate due to AH in Spain is low, and hypothermia rarely is recognized and treated. The case of a patient who experienced cardiac arrest due to severe AH and was resuscitated for more than six hours using extracorporeal life support recently was published. Herein that case is reviewed, with the anesthetic management during cannulation detailed. In addition, the authors highlight how the application of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines is different in AH patients, how in-hospital (HOPE score) triage criteria should be applied, and how the establishment of clear standard operating procedures and education strategies should be promoted.

Specifically, we measured the effect of (1) administrative prompts to encourage discussions about EOL care and (2) a mandatory educational seminal focusing on EOL issues. Study subjects were patients consecutively admitted to the medicine service who faced an anticipated 3-year mortality rate of at least 50 %. The main study endpoint was the frequency of documented EOL discussions between physicians and patients. In the inception cohort of 184 patients, physicians discussed EOL care with 64 patients (34.8 %), and in the follow-up cohort of 121 patients, 41 individuals (33.9 %) had documented discussions regarding EOL issues (P = 0.90). Actual ""Do Not Resuscitate""(DNR) orders were written for 53 patients (28.8 %) in the inception cohort and for 33 persons (27.3 %) in the follow-up cohort (P = 0.71). We conclude that enhanced, mutually reinforcing regulatory and educational efforts focusing on EOL care proved ineffectual at promoting either discussions about EOL issues or the use of DNR orders.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,CPAPER,Neo-SENSE: a non-invasive smart sensing mattress for cardiac monitoring of babies,"Within the first minute of life a newborn must take its first breath to make the transition from life inside the womb to the outside world. If a baby does not start breathing, its heart rate will drop and the circulation of blood carrying oxygen to the organs will be seriously affected. The damage done to a newborn who is deprived of oxygen happens so quickly that rapid response is imperative. During birth, the attending neonatal staff manually listen to the baby's heart and count the heart rate; however, this has proven inaccurate and inefficient. Nowadays, there is not a reliable method to monitor newborn heart rate promptly throughout birth. In this paper, we report the design and development of a novel smart mattress device to measure the babies' electrocardiogram and respiration non-invasively. The device is based on electrometer-based amplifier sensors combined with novel screen-printing techniques. Proof of concept tests are carried out to demonstrate the suitability of the smart-mattress for new born ECG monitoring. We perform tests with a young infant and demonstrate the potential of this sensing technology to provide a quick and reliable application as ECG readings were displayed within a time < 30 seconds. This will aid the neonatal staff to assess the success of the resuscitation technology aiming to lower the incidence of long-term consequences of poor adaptation to life outside the womb.",2019 IEEE SENSORS APPLICATIONS SYMPOSIUM (SAS),2019,"Aviles-Espinosa, R; Rendon-Morales, E; Luo, ZH; Dore, H; Anton, O; Rabe, H; Prance, RJ",,,WOS:000474727000007,A

Most standards and guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, however, focus on the initial links in the chain. We consider appropriate in-hospital care for the survivors a logical extension of the chain of survival. In recent years extensive research activity has probed the pathophysiology and pharmacology of postischemic reperfusion. The present review discusses the current understanding of mechanisms for cerebral damage following global ischemia. Promising pharmacological principles for protection or resuscitation from cerebral ischemia are reviewed. None of them are considered ready for clinical application. Clinical guidelines are proposed, based on the reviewed data and previously published clinical observations. Cornerstones of the proposed brain-oriented intensive care protocol are: (1) hemodynamic monitoring and meticulous treatment of circulatory disturbances, (2) controlled ventilation providing normoventilation and normoxia to all comatose patients, (3) avoiding hyperglycemia and hyperthermia in comatose patients, (4) adequate analgesia and sedation, tempered by the understanding that oversedation impedes neurological evaluation without promoting recovery.

We isolated similar to 2.0 kb of ginger VDE (GVDE) gene promoter, which contained the circadian box, I-box, G-box and GT-1 motif. Histochemical staining of Arabidopsis indicated the GVDE promoter was active in almost all organs, especially green tissues. beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity driven by GVDE promoter was repressed rather than activated by high light. GUS activity was altered by hormones, growth regulators and abiotic stresses, which increased with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and decreased with abscisic acid, salicylic acid, zeatin, salt (sodium chloride) and polyethylene glycol. Interestingly, GUS activities with gibberellin or indole-3-acetic acid increased in the short-term (24 h) and decreased in the long-term (48 and 72 h). Analysis of 5' flank deletion found two crucial functional regions residing in -679 to -833 and -63 to -210.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Life supporting first aid training of the public - review and recommendations,"Since the introduction around 1960 of external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) basic life support (BLS) without equipment, i.e. steps A (airway control)-B (mouth-to-mouth breathing)-C (chest (cardiac) compressions), training courses by instructors have been provided, first to medical personnel and later to some but not all lay persons. At present, fewer than 30% of out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts are initiated by lay bystanders. The numbers of lives saved have remained suboptimal, in part because of a weak or absent first link in the life support chain. This review concerns education research aimed at helping more lay persons to acquire high life supporting first aid (LSFA) skill levels and to use these skills. In the 1960s, Safar and Laerdal studied and promoted self-training in LSFA, which includes: call for the ambulance (without abandoning the patient) (now also call for an automatic external defibrillator); CPR-BLS steps A-B-C; external hemorrhage control; and positioning for shock and unconsciousness (coma). LSFA steps are psychomotor skills. Organizations like the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association have produced instructor-courses of many more first aid skills, or for cardiac arrest only-not of LSFA skills needed by all suddenly comatose victims. Self-training methods might help all people acquire LSFA skills. Implementation is still lacking. Variable proportions of lay trainees evaluated, ranging from school children to elderly persons, were found capable of performing LSFA skills on manikins. Audio-tape or video-tape coached self-practice on manikins was more effective than instructor-courses. Mere viewing of demonstrations (e.g. televised films) without practice has enabled more persons to perform some skills effectively compared to untrained control groups. The quality of LSFA. performance in the field and its impact on outcome of patients remain to be evaluated. Psychological factors have been associated with skill acquisition and retention, and motivational factors with application. Manikin practice proved necessary far best skill acquisition of steps B and C. Simplicity and repetition proved important. Repetitive television spots and brief internet movies for motivating and demonstrating would reach all people. LSFA should be part of basic health education. LSFA self-learning laboratories should be set up and maintained in schools and drivers' license stations. The trauma-focused steps of LSFA are important for 'buddy help' in military combat casualty care, and natural mass disasters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether early versus delayed management of pediatric femoral shaft fractures would impact outcomes regarding time to union and return to baseline function. Methods: Pediatric patients presenting with femoral shaft fractures, from January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2021, were identified using the Pediatric Trauma Database at a single Level One Trauma Center and retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, surgical details, associated injuries, length of follow-up, time to union, and return to baseline function were collected. Patients were then divided into 2 groups; the early intervention group underwent treatment within 24 hours of admission versus the delayed group, which underwent treatment after 24 hours. Patients with neuromuscular disease, pathologic fracture, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, nonambulatory, younger than 6 months old, or had follow-up of <8 weeks posttreatment were excluded. chi(2) and unpaired Student t tests were used to compare outcomes. A P value <= 0.05 was used as the threshold of statistical significance. Results: Of the 169 cases reviewed, 137 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 8.0 +/- 5.0 (6 mo to 16 y). The average follow-up time was 1.4 +/- 1.4 years. Thirty-two (19%) patients did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the study. One hundred twenty-two (89%) patients were in the early intervention group versus 15 (11%) in the delayed intervention group. There were no statistically significant differences between the early and the delayed arms in regard to time to union, quality of final reduction, and return to baseline function.

Methods: We developed a prediction model using the classical cross -validation method from the Pan -Asia Trauma Outcomes Study (PATOS) database from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020. Eligible patients aged >18 years were transported to the hospital by the EMS. The primary outcome (EMS -witnessed TCA) was defined based on changes in vital signs measured on the scene or en route. We included variables that were immediately measurable as potential predictors when EMTs arrived. An integer point value system was built using multivariable logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test were used to examine discrimination and calibration in the derivation and validation cohorts. Results: In total, 74,844 patients were eligible for database review. The model comprised five prehospital predictors: age <40 years, systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg, respiration rate >20/minute, pulse oximetry <94%, and levels of consciousness to pain or unresponsiveness. The AUROC in the derivation and validation cohorts was 0.767 and 0.782, respectively. The HL test revealed good calibration of the model (p Z 0.906). Conclusion: We established a prediction model using variables from the PATOS database and measured them immediately after EMS personnel arrived to predict EMS -witnessed TCA. The model allows prehospital medical personnel to focus on high -risk patients and promptly administer optimal treatment.

Cerebral blood flow promotion by hypertensive reperfusion and hemodilution has resulted in improved outcome in dogs, and brief hypertension after restoration of spontaneous circulation is associated with improved outcome in patients. Postarrest hypercoagulability of blood seems to yield to therapeutic thrombolysis, which is associated with improved cerebral outcome in animals and patients. In a clinically relevant dog outcome model, mild postarrest cerebral hypothermia (34degreesC), initiated with reperfusion and continued for 12 hrs, combined with cerebral blood-flow promotion increased from 5 to >10 mins the previously longest normothermic no-flow time that could be reversed to complete cerebral recovery. Mild hypothermla by surface cooling after prolonged cardiac arrest in patients has been found effective in recent clinical studies in Australia and Europe. Preliminary data on the recent randomized study in Europe have been reported. For presently unresuscitable cardiac arrests, research since the 1980s in dog outcome models of prolonged exsanguination cardiac arrest has culminated in brain and organism preservation during cardiac arrest (no-flow) durations of up to 90 mins, perhaps 120 mins, at a tympanic temperature of 10degreesC and complete recovery of function and normal histology, This ""suspended animation for delayed resuscitation"" strategy includes use of an aortic flush of cold saline (or preservation solution) within the first 5 mins of no flow. This strategy should also be explored for the larger number of patients with unresuscitable out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Suspended animation for prolonged preservation of viability could buy time for transport and repair during hypothermic no flow followed by resuscitation, or it could serve as a bridge to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass.",CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,2002,"Safar, P; Behringer, W; Böttiger, BW; Sterz, F",10.1097/00003246-200204001-00004,,WOS:000174970400004,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,CORM-3 alleviates the intestinal injury in a rodent model of hemorrhage shock and resuscitation: roles of GFAP-positive glia,"Hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR) can induce severe intestinal damages, thereby leading to sepsis and long-term complications including dysbacteriosis and pulmonary injury. The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome facilitates inflammation-associated cell recruitment in the gastrointestinal tract, and participates in many inflammatory bowel diseases. Previous studies have shown that exogenous carbon monoxide (CO) exerts neuroprotective effects against pyroptosis after HSR. We aimed to investigate whether carbon monoxide-releasing molecules-3 (CORM-3), an exogenous CO compound, could attenuate HSR-induced intestinal injury and the potential underlying mechanism.Rats were subjected to a HSR model by bleeding and re-infusion. Following resuscitation, 4 mg/kg of CORM-3 was administered intravenously into femoral vein. At 24 h and 7 d after HSR modeling, the pathological changes in intestinal tissues were evaluated by H&E staining. The intestinal pyroptosis, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial pyroptosis, DAO (diamine oxidase) content, intestine tight junction proteins including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-1 were further detected by immunofluorescence, western blot and chemical assays at 7 d after HSR. CORM-3 administration led to significantly mitigated HSR-induced intestinal injury, aggravation of intestinal pyroptosis indicated by cleaved caspase-1, IL-1 beta and IL-18, upregulation of GFAP-positive glial pyroptosis, decreased intensity of ZO-1 and claudin-1 in the jejunum, and increased of DAO in the serum. Nigericin, an agonist of NLRP3, significantly reversed the protective effects of CORM-3. CORM-3 alleviates the intestinal barrier dysfunction in a rodent model of HSR, and the potential mechanism may be associated with inhibition of NLRP3-associated pyroptosis. CORM-3 administration could be a promising therapeutic strategy for intestinal injury after hemorrhagic shock.",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR HISTOLOGY,2023,"Zhang, LM; Xin, Y; Song, RX; Zheng, WC; Hu, JS; Wang, JX; Wu, ZY; Zhang, DX",10.1007/s10735-023-10133-w,,WOS:001010711900001,A

It may cause malnutrition in critical care patients, which may manifest as a reduction in respiratory muscle mass, lower ventilatory capacity, and decreased respiratory tolerance. This study aimed to assess that if the patients' nutritional status were improved, it could help RCC patients to wean from respirators. All participants were recruited from the RCC of a medical foundation in the city and Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital. The indicators include serum albumin level, respirator detachment index, maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax), rapid shallow breathing index, and body composition measurements. We recorded the length of hospital stay, mortality, and RCW (respiratory care ward) referral rate for these participants and analyzed the differences in relevant research indicators between those who were and weren't weaned off. 43 of 62 patients were weaned from respirators, while 19 failed. The resuscitation rate was 54.8%. Patients with respirator weaning had a lower number of RCC admission days (23.1 +/- 11.1 days) than respirator-dependent patients (35.6 +/- 7.8 days, P < 0.05). The PImax of successfully weaned patients had a greater reduction (- 27.09 +/- 9.7 cmH(2)O) than unsuccessful ones (- 21.4 +/- 10.2 cmH(2)O, P < 0.05).

The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Our analysis included forty-six relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria. However, we observed that many studies were poorly reported, posing risks of selection and detection biases. Additionally, we identified methodological and study design weaknesses in five studies. Given the critical role of PEC services in saving lives and preventing medical complications, the timely provision of these services is paramount. Bystanders play a central role in activating emergency medical services (EMS) and providing cardiopul-monary resuscitation. Prompt calls to EMS by bystanders resulted in reduced PEC response times, improved survival chances, and better neurological outcomes, particularly among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. There is substantial evidence that prompt bystander activation of EMS significantly reduces PEC response times, thereby saving lives and strengthening existing PEC systems.

Among these mechanisms, activation of the sarcolemmal sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) with subsequent intramyocardial sodium overload has been identified as a prominent mechanism of cell injury. Using isolated heart and intact animal models of ventricular fibrillation, our group has identified various beneficial myocardial effects associated with selective NHE-1 inhibition. During ventricular fibrillation, NHE-1 inhibition attenuates the development of ischemic contracture and preserves the hemodynamic efficacy of chest compression. Immediately after restoration of cardiac activity, NHE-1 inhibition markedly reduces reper-fusion arrhythmias and prevents episodes of recurrent ventricular fibrillation. During the post-resuscitation phase, NHE-1 inhibition ameliorates the severity of myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction and favors hemodynamic stability and improved survival. These studies suggest that NHE-1 inhibition may represent a highly effective new form of treatment for resuscitation from cardiac arrest.",MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND PRECONDITIONING,2003,"Gazmuri, RJ; Ayoub, IM",,,WOS:000183540700026,A

To improve survival, access to AEDs by lay responders is growing, and use is included in basic cardiac life support training. These devices are considered extremely safe, evidenced by the paucity of medical literature on AED misuse and expert opinion. However, it's crucial to point out that even medical personnel can make errors in their use. This case study of AED misuse during a community event and narrative literature review underscores the potential for errors in using an AED, which could cause considerable patient harm. To prevent errors in AED use, it is important to train on (1) equipment in use or likely to be encountered in the field, (2) how to dump an electric charge, especially when using a fully automated machine, (3) the need to follow specific machine instructions, (4) proper application of the defibrillator pads (including one-piece pads with metronome), (5) the need to assess the patient and not rely entirely on the AED prompts, which can contain false alerts and inappropriate instruction, and (6) the need for closed-loop communication, even when participating in a community event.",CRITICAL CARE NURSING QUARTERLY,2025,"Zrelak, PA",10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000546,,WOS:001500929100015,A

In many cases, hypoxia develops as a gradual process due to the inability of the fetus to tolerate the stress of parturition suggesting reduced fetoplacental reserve before labour commences. The fetal cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) is an independent predictor of intrapartum fetal compromise, poor acid base status at birth and of neonatal unit admission at term. Similarly, circulating maternal levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) are lower in pregnancies complicated by placental dysfunction.

This may result in delayed shock delivery and delay in basic life support (BLS) after use of the AED. To study the effect of voice prompts and design solutions we tested the time from the first shock to the initiation of BLS for six defibrillators available in Austria. Methods: Volunteers, who had no AED training, were evaluated to see when they delivered the first shock and how often BLS was started after the voice prompts were given by the defibrillators. Results: Time to first shock delivered ranged from 78 (95% CI: 68-89) to 128 (95% CI: 110-146) s. The defibrillator-type had a significant influence on the time to first shock delivered (P < 0.0001). The proportion of volunteers who started BLS after defibrillation ranged from 93 to 33% and differed significantly between the AEDs used (P < 0.03). Conclusions: We demonstrated that there are significant differences between AEDs, concerning important operational outcomes like time to first shock and the start of BLS.

Little is known about the dynamics of the immune response to these antigens in an endemic community. Thus, the IFN gamma response and cytokine production in response to PPD, Esat6-Cfp10 (E6-C10), DosR and Rpf antigens in healthy HHC of tuberculosis (TB) patients over a 12 (T-12) months period (short-term, stLTBI) was investigated. This response was compared with a group of LTBI, who have remained healthy for 5-7 years (long-term, ItLTBI). According to the IFN gamma response, two groups of HHCs were identified in stLTBI in response to E6-C10. At T-12, E6-C10(+) HHCs displayed a decrease in the IFN gamma levels and a generalized decrease in cytokines production. The E6-C10(-) HHC showed an increase in the IFN gamma response and cytokine levels. In stLTBI, the responses to E6-C10, DosR, and Rpf may be interpreted as a protective immune response controlling Mtb infection and may be leading to a state of latent infection. Comparing the response of stLTBI and ItLTBI, we observed significant changes in the proportions of CD45RO(+)CD27(+) T cells to specific DosR and Rpf, which may indicate a persistent immune response to Mtb antigens in ItLTBI.

Methods: The authors prospectively studied a consecutive series of post-resuscitation comatose patients referred for neurologic prognostication at a single center for 4 years. For most patients, neurologic prognostication was not sought due to early death or rapid return to consciousness. Prognostication was based on Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and Brainstem Reflex Score (BRS), with EEG and cortical evoked potentials (CEP), which were graded as benign, uncertain, and malignant. The outcomes were as follows: survivors (Group S), brain or cardiac death (Group D), and death from withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (Group W). In Group W, the time interval to withdrawal of LST was analyzed by EEG and CEP grades. Results: Of 58 patients studied, 10 were in Group S, 8 in Group D, and 40 in Group W. Initial median GCS and BRS was similar for all groups with significant improvement noted in Group S, but not in Group D or Group W. In Group W, CEP grade correlated with the median duration of continued therapy before a decision to withdraw LST: 7 days for benign CEP, 2 days for uncertain CEP, and 1 day for malignant CEP, p = 0.0004.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Electrographic Seizures in the Critically Ill,"A clinician's goal in treating a critically ill patient is to orchestrate a meaningful and fast recovery with minimal long-term sequelae, thereby improving their quality of life at best or preventing deterioration at worst. The path to achieving this goal becomes increasingly complex and foggy when seizures and IIC patterns are present. The first step is identifying patients at risk for seizures and determining the timing and duration of EEG monitoring. 2HELPS2B or other risk stratification schemes may help, but the ultimate goal should be overcoming the logistical and technical barriers that prevent near-uniform EEG monitoring during critical illness, much in the same way that elec-trocardiogram monitoring is currently used. Status epilepticus can cause secondary neurologic injury but the effects of discrete seizure burden and IIC patterns is still under investigation. The ambiguous nature of these EEG patterns necessitates ancillary testing where possible, such as NSE, neuroimaging with MRI, FDG-PET, or SPECT to better understand their malignant fea-tures. Treating status epilepticus, seizures, and IIC patterns is a delicate balance where the benefits and drawbacks of escalating IV anesthetic agents and ASM must be continually weighed. In addition to treating the EEG pattern, the clinician should focus on reversible causes such as metabolic disarray, offending drugs, infec-tion, or inflammation and surgically remediable causes such as subdural hemorrhage. The optimal order and combination of ASMs and IV anesthetics is still lacking, given the complex dynamic interplay of the forces in neurocritical care. Still, one can advo-cate for rational polypharmacy-that is, using antiseizure medications with different mechanisms of action and compatible pharmacokinetics. Weaning of ASMs in the acute and recovery stage of critical illness is also in need of further clarification.

However, TTM is not used widely after traumatic cardiac arrest because of concerns that it might exacerbate bleeding. We report the use of postarrest TTM after repair of blunt myocardial rupture. A 48-year-old man was admitted after being rescued from a major traffic accident by the local emergency service. Focused sonography showed pericardial fluid without cardiac tamponade. Computed tomography showed a large hematoma in the anterior mediastinum associated with hemopericardium. The patient developed cardiac arrest during the operative preparations.

The patient recovered with no further cardiac events and was discharged 3 weeks after admission, with no other serious complications.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Psychiatric sequelae of cardiac arrest,"This manuscript summarizes the literature on mental health outcomes after cardiac arrest. Survivors of cardiac arrest show high rates of mental illness with more than 40% suffering from anxiety, 30% from depression, and 25% from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health outcomes may differ depending on the setting in which the cardiac arrest occurred. A major problem is reduced neuropsychological functioning. Between 30% and 50% of survivors of cardiac arrest suffer from cognitive deficits. Deficits of attention, declarative memory, executive function, visual-spatial abilities, and verbal fluency have been observed. As a result of numerous psychopathological symptoms (depression in 14% to 45%, anxiety in 13% to 61%, and PTSD in 19% to 27%) and reduced cognitive functioning (about 20% to 60%), relevantly reduced quality of life is observed in about 20% of cardiac arrest survivors.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"An Unusual Presentation of Type B Aortic Dissection as Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Complicated by Spinal and Renal Ischaemia Along With Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Severe Therapeutic Dilemma","Aortic dissection (AD) is a catastrophic cardiovascular problem that can be challenging to diagnose sometimes. Despite diagnostic challenges, it requires a high degree of suspicion and prompt treatment is vital to its successful management. AD can be divided into type A aortic dissection (TAAD) and type B aortic dissection (TBAD). TAAD is characterised by dissection in the ascending aorta whereas TBAD does not have dissection in the ascending aorta. THAD is usually managed conservatively, and patients receive medical therapy such as antihypertensive medications, analgesia, and rehabilitation. This, however, is complicated by malperfusion of certain organs, which can be life-threatening. Patients who have malperfusion of certain organs should be managed aggressively and endovascular aortic repair should be considered in such cases. We present a case of a 63-year-old patient who presented with out-of-hospital pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. An electrocardiogram showed new-onset atrial fibrillation with ST-segment depression and a coronary angiogram showed severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery. A computed tomography scan of the thorax and abdomen showed TBAD with an occluded right renal artery and the patient was conservatively managed. The patient was discharged home after prolonged hospital admission and was conservatively managed for TBAD. This case was complicated by the fact that the patient had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and a coronary angiogram showed severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery. The patient also had new-onset atrial fibrillation, which made his clinical management very challenging. It is important to avoid unnecessary coronary intervention that can create more challenges in managing such patients.",CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,2022,"Khan, Z; Besis, G; Yousif, Y; Gupta, A",10.7759/cureus.26011,,WOS:000815644300019,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Multidisciplinary pediatric trauma simulation curriculum in conjunction with a trauma resuscitation cognitive aid improves resident performance,"Background Trauma is the leading cause of mortality among children and adolescents. While often high acuity, these events are lower frequency compared to adult trauma activations. Therefore, it is critical that trauma teams are prepared for the unique elements of pediatric trauma resuscitation. Though the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires a minimum of 40 non-operative resuscitations and 20 pediatric surgeries prior to completion of surgical residency, no minimum is placed on pediatric trauma resuscitations. Through the implementation of a multidisciplinary pediatric trauma resuscitation simulation curriculum, we aimed to promote Pediatric Readiness at our institution. By increasing trainee exposure to these low-frequency events, we sought to improve their ability to respond to complex and high-acuity pediatric traumas. Methods This pilot curriculum, conducted as monthly one-hour sessions, occurred in the emergency department pediatric resuscitation bays. Clinical scenarios varied each month with increasing complexity throughout the year. The multidisciplinary teams, led by General Surgery and Emergency Medicine residents, were tasked with completing a full assessment during the resuscitation of a pediatric trauma patient, including any indicated bed side procedures. The initial trauma simulation was followed by a debriefing session with supplemental simulation-specific education before roles were redistributed within the teams and the simulation was repeated. During each simulation, Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Emergency Medicine faculty used a structured observation tool to evaluate overall group performance and to assess indicated elements of the resuscitation surveys that were most frequently performed, delayed, or omitted. Results A total of ten simulations were conducted with an average of twelve participants per simulation session. The sessions had an average of four surgical residents, one emergency medicine resident, three emergency room nurses, one respiratory therapist, and two medical students. Between the initial and repeat simulations, teams' overall completion of indicated elements on the trauma resuscitation observational tool improved by 25% (p < 0.01). The most improvement was seen in the implementation of the first pauses (26% to 72%; p < 0.01) and second pause (35% to 61%; p < 0.01). Significant improvement was also seen between initial and repeat simulations in the management of blood products (p = 0.01) and assessment of the patients' height and weight (p = 0.01). Conclusion Implementation of a pediatric trauma simulation curriculum effectively supplements resident exposure to pediatric trauma resuscitations and leads to improvement in trauma survey completion.

We aimed to estimate the global prevalence and distribution of bystander training among laypersons, which are poorly understood, and to identify their determinants.Methods: We searched electronic databases for cross-sectional studies reporting the prevalence of bystander training from representative popu-lation samples. Pooled prevalence was calculated using random-effects models. Key outcome was cardiopulmonary resuscitation training (training within two-years and those who were ever trained). We explored determinants of interest using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.Results: 29 studies were included, representing 53,397 laypersons. Among national studies, the prevalence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation train-ing within two-years and among those who were ever trained, and automated external defibrillator training was 10.02% (95% CI 6.60-14.05), 42.04% (95% CI 30.98-53.28) and 21.08% (95% CI 10.16-34.66) respectively. Subgroup analyses by continent revealed pooled prevalence estimates of 31.58% (95%CI 18.70-46.09), 58.78% (95%CI 42.41-74.21), 18.93 (95% CI 0.00-62.94), 64.97% (95%CI 64.00-65.93), and 50.56% (95%CI 47.57-53.54) in Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, and Oceania respec-tively, with significant subgroup differences (p < 0.01). A country's income and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training (ever trained) (p = 0.033) were positively correlated. Similarly, this prevalence was higher among the highly educated (p<0.00001).Conclusions: Large regional variation exists in data availability and bystander training prevalence. Socioeconomic status correlated with preva-lence of bystander training, and regional disparities were apparent between continents. Bystander training should be promoted, particularly in Asia, Middle East, and low-income regions.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Pharmacological Manipulation of Trk, p75NTR, and NGF Balance Restores Memory Deficit in Global Ischemia/Reperfusion Model in Rats","Long-term memory impairment is reported in more than 50% of cardiac arrest survivors. Monosialoganglioside (GM1) provided neuroprotection in experimental models of stroke but failed to replicate its promise clinically for unknown reasons. GM1 stimulates the release of nerve growth factor (NGF), which is synthesized as a precursor protein (pro-NGF) that either mediates apoptosis through the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) or is cleaved by the protease furin (FUR) to yield mature NGF, the latter supporting survival through tropomyosin kinase receptor (Trk). The flavanol epicatechin (EPI) inhibits p75NTR-mediated signaling and apoptosis by pro-NGF. The aim of the current work is to test whether these two drugs affect, or communicate with, each other in the setting of CNS injuries. Using the two-vessel occlusion model of global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), we tested if pharmacological modulation of Trk, p75NTR, and NGF balance with GM1, EPI, and their combination, can correct the memory deficit that follows this insult. Finally, we tested if FUR insufficiency and/or p75NTR-mediated apoptosis negatively affect the neurotherapeutic effect of GM1. Key proteins for Trk and p75NTR, FUR, and both forms of NGF were assessed. All treatment regiments successfully improved spatial memory retention and acquisition. A week after the insult, most Trk and p75NTR proteins were normal, but pro/mature NGF ratio remained sharply elevated and was associated with the poorest memory performance. Pharmacological correction of this balance was achieved by reinforcing Trk and p75NTR signaling. GM1 increased FUR levels, while concomitant administration of EPI weakened GM1 effect on pro-survival Trk and p75NTR mediators. GM1 neuroprotection is therefore not limited by FUR but could be dependent on p75NTR.",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE,2019,"Choucry, AM; Al-Shorbagy, MY; Attia, AS; El-Abhar, HS",10.1007/s12031-019-01284-1,,WOS:000464208600009,A

It progressed to electromechanical arrest in six patients. In patients with preoperative or postoperative arrest, conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation were unsuccessful and extracorporeal circulation was started 22 to 150 minutes after arrest. The left ventricle was vented, the aorta clamped, and warm (37-degrees-C) aspartate/glutamate blood cardioplegic solution was given at a rate of 150 ml/min for 20 minutes. All bypass grafts were open with good flows in patients who had had coronary bypass, and coronary bypass was done in the three patients who had preoperative arrest Eleven of 14 hearts resumed normal sinus rhythm after aortic unclamping, only two electrocardiographically proved infarctions occurred, and 13 patients had complete hemodynamic recovery with improved ejection fraction. Three patients died: one of progressive cardiogenic shock, another of mediastinitis, and the third of irreversible neurologic damage. Eleven patients were discharged from the hospital and are well after a follow-up period between 3 and 9 months. We conclude that witnessed perioperative arrest with intractable ventricular fibrillation should be treated aggressively by administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation during prompt transfer to the operating room for total vented bypass and delivery of warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution. This treatment may salvage hearts thought to be damaged irreversibly and may be a feasible approach to intractable witnessed cardiac arrest, provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation maintains satisfactory cerebral perfusion pressure.",JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY,1992,"BEYERSDORF, F; KIRSH, M; BUCKBERG, GD; ALLEN, BS; BONCHEK, LI; AROM, KV",,,WOS:A1992JT19800041,A

The aim of this study was to examine the reasons for not using an automated external defibrillator (AED) and predictors of the reasons. The study had a cross-sectional design using an online survey. Data were collected in eighteen districts in Hong Kong to be representative of the city. The questionnaire consisted of questions on demographics, knowledge and attitude towards AED use, reasons for not using AED, and whether the kind of victim could affect the decision of the bystanders. There was a high significant correlation between knowledge and attitude, with r = 0.782 and p < 0.001. Of the respondents, 53.3% agreed that the kind of victim would affect their willingness to operate an AED. A binary logistic regression model revealed that a higher education (OR 6.242, 95% CI: 1.827-21.331), concern about the kind of victim involved (OR 2.822, 95% CI: 1.316-6.052), and a younger age were significant predictors of worrying about taking on responsibility in using AED.

In terms of the need for follow-up investigation, a single episode of haematuria is equally important as recurrent episodes. Baseline investigation in the ED includes full blood count, urea and electrolyte levels, midstream urine dipstick, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin, and formal microscopy, culture and sensitivities. Treatment of macroscopic haematuria aims at RESP - Resuscitation, Ensuring, Safe and Prompt. Indications for admission include clot retention, cardiovascular instability, uncontrolled pain, sepsis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, severe comorbidity, heavy haematuria or social restrictions. Discharged patients should drink plenty of clear fluids and return for further medical attention if the following occur: clot retention, worsening haematuria despite adequate fluid intake, uncontrolled pain or fever, or inability to cope at home.

Aim: To identify barriers and facilitators to delivery of the PARAMEDIC2 (Adrenaline) trial by five UK NHS EMS. Methods: This qualitative study took a grounded theory approach to thematic analysis of workshop data. Members of the trial teams from each service attended a workshop in November 2018 and discussed their experiences in answer to two prompt questions. Data were coded and themes presented. Results: Three main themes were identified: professionalism, organisational investment and unique features of EMS . The study provided an opportunity for recruiting paramedics and research paramedics to demonstrate their professionalism . Research paramedics felt it was part of their professional duty to initiate discussions with the patient/family regarding the trial rather than leave this task to the hospital teams as would usually happen. Organisational investment was reflected by prioritising trial training and further development of research paramedics. By these means, research culture was developed. The unique features of EMS such as geographical challenges were often addressed with technological solutions and through building relationships with internal teams. Conclusion: Barriers to trial delivery included infrequent exposure to the condition of interest and lack of continuity in research paramedic roles. Facilitators identified included flexibility of the research protocol, and organisational investment in the development of research paramedics.

Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 16 male domestic pigs and left untreated for 8 minutes, after which extracorporeal circulation was started and maintained for 10 additional minutes, adjusting the extracorporeal flow to provide a coronary perfusion pressure of 10 mmHg. Defibrillation was accomplished and the extracorporeal flow was adjusted to secure a mean aortic pressure of 40 mmHg or greater during spontaneous circulation for up to 120 minutes. Pigs were randomized 1:1 to receive EPO (1200 U/kg) or 0.9% NaCl before starting extracorporeal circulation. Severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction developed in both groups. However, recovery of myocardial function-comparing baseline with 120 minutes postresuscitation-was better in pigs treated with EPO than NaCl, as shown for left ventricular ejection fraction (from 45 +/- 8% to 36 +/- 9% in EPO, not significant; and from 46 +/- 8% to 26 +/- 8% in NaCl, P < 0.001) and for peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume (from 2.7 +/- 0.8 mmHg/mL to 2.4 +/- 0.7 mmHg/mL in EPO, not significant; and from 3.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg/mL to 1.8 +/- 0.6 mmHg/mL, P < 0.001 in NaCl). The EPO effect was associated with significantly higher myocardial O-2 consumption (12 +/- 6 mL/min/unit of tissue vs 6 +/- 2 mL/min/unit of tissue, P < 0.017) without effects on myocardial lactate consumption. Thus, EPO administered during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation lessened postresuscitation myocardial stunning-an effect that could be useful clinically to help promote postresuscitation hemodynamic stability.

Conclusion: Despite substantial heterogeneity in the methodology of studies and differences in prevalence across studies, this review indicates that subgroups of patients are at risk of PTSD after a cardiac event. Future studies investigating PTSD as a sequel of heart disease should be more systematic, use a prospective study design with multiple assessments, and include sufficiently large samples. PTSD should not be ignored as a sequel of heart disease, given preliminary evidence that PTSD may be associated with nonadherence with medication and an increased risk of clinical adverse events.",PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE,2005,"Spindler, H; Pedersen, SS",10.1097/01.psy.0000174995.96183.9b,,WOS:000232294000007,A

Mannitol, commonly used for renal protection, may inadvertently activate the sympathetic nervous system, potentially leading to CAS in susceptible patients. This rare case highlights the potential cardiac risks of mannitol-induced CAS during robotic-assisted surgery.Patient concerns:A 66-year-old male with no known cardiac history underwent robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy. Approximately 40 minutes after receiving a high-dose mannitol infusion (75 g), he developed frequent ventricular premature contractions followed by sudden ventricular fibrillation.Diagnoses:During the operation, post-resuscitation transthoracic echocardiography showed regional wall motion abnormalities. After the operation, emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis. A coronary spasm provocation test performed 10 days later confirmed the diagnosis of variant angina due to significant CAS.Interventions:In the operating room, prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 3 rounds of defibrillation successfully restored circulation. Following emergent transthoracic echocardiography and coronary angiography, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further evaluation and management.Outcomes:The patient recovered without neurologic sequelae. Calcium channel blocker therapy was initiated, and regular follow-up was arranged at the outpatient department.Lessons:This case underscores the potential cardiac risks associated with high-dose mannitol in patients with coronary hyperreactivity, highlighting the importance of personalized perioperative management and close cardiovascular monitoring.

The well-documented risk of tuberculosis progression associated with anti-TNF-alpha treatment highlighted the central role of TNF-alpha for the maintenance of protective immunity, although the rate of tuberculosis detected among patients varies with the nature of the drug. Using a human, in-vitro granuloma model, we reproduce the increased reactivation rate of tuberculosis following exposure to Adalimumab compared to Etanercept, two TNF-alpha-neutralizing biologics. We show that Adalimumab, because of its bivalence, specifically induces TGF-beta 1-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resuscitation which can be prevented by concomitant TGF-beta 1 neutralization. Moreover, our data suggest an additional role of lymphotoxin-alpha-neutralized by Etanercept but not Adalimumab-in the control of latent tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, we show that, while Secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A antibody, does not revert Mtb dormancy, the anti-IL-12-p40 antibody Ustekinumab and the recombinant IL-1RA Anakinra promote Mtb resuscitation, in line with the importance of these pathways in tuberculosis immunity.",PLOS PATHOGENS,2020,"Arbués, A; Brees, D; Chibout, SD; Fox, T; Kammüller, M; Portevin, D",10.1371/journal.ppat.1008312,,WOS:000518637800034,A

Extrapulmonary osteosarcoma metastases are being observed in increasingly more patients, particularly after pulmonary metastases, and becoming less sensitive to chemotherapy with shorter survival. Surgical resection is advocated for prolonging survival and improving quality of life when the primary tumor is under control. In this article, we present a case of mediastinal osteosarcoma metastasis with left atrium invasion in a 25-year-old female patient. During her seven-year oncologic follow-up, patient was performed two right, two left thoracotomies for pulmonary metastasectomies and one right Dartevelle incision for metastasis located in the right upper lobe extending through the clavicle and the first rib. She was also performed a median sternotomy for resection of a mediastinal metastasis adjacent to both atria. Patient received radiotherapy and several courses of adjuvant chemotherapy throughout her therapy. On patient's final computed tomography scan, mediastinal tumor recurrence was detected which was invading the left atrium. Considering that surgical resection would be the most appropriate therapeutic approach to prolong survival, patient was performed metastasectomy under cardiopulmonary bypass support and cardiac arrest with partial left atrial resection and bovine pericardial patch.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Outcome and prognostication after cardiac arrest,"The outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has historically been grim at best. The current overall survival rate of patients admitted to a hospital is approximately 10%, making cardiac arrest one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The situation is improving with the incorporation of therapeutic temperature modulation, aggressive prevention of secondary brain injury, and improved access to advanced cardiovascular support, all of which have decreased mortality and allowed for better outcomes. Mortality after cardiac arrest is often the direct result of active withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy based on the perception that neurological recovery is not possible. This reality highlights the importance of providing accurate estimates of neurological prognosis to decision makers when discussing goals of care. The current standard of care for assessing neurological status in patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy emphasizes a multimodal approach that includes five elements: (1) neurological examination off sedation, (2) continuous electroencephalography, (3) serum neuron-specific enolase levels, (4) magnetic resonance brain imaging, and (5) somatosensory-evoked potential testing.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Structural Insight on GPR119 Agonist as Potential Therapy for Type II Diabetes: A Comprehensive Review,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a long-term metabolic condition that is characterized by excessive blood glucose. DM is the third most death-causing disease, leading to retinopathy, nephropathy, loss of vision, stroke, and cardiac arrest. Around 90% of the total cases of diabetic patients have Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Among various approaches for the treatment of T2DM. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 119 have been identified as a new pharmacological target. GPR119 is distributed preferentially in the pancreas beta-cells and gastrointestinal tract (enteroendocrine cells) in humans. GPR119 receptor activation elevates the release of incretin hormones such as Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP1) and Glucose Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) from intestinal K and L cells. GPR119 receptor agonists stimulate intracellular cAMP production via G alpha s coupling to adenylate cyclase. GPR119 has been linked to the control of insulin release by pancreatic beta-cells, as well as the generation of GLP-1 by enteroendocrine cells in the gut, as per in vitro assays. The dual role of the GPR119 receptor agonist in the treatment of T2DM leads to the development of a novel prospective anti-diabetic drug and is thought to have decreased the probability of inducing hypoglycemia. GPR119 receptor agonists exert their effects in one of two ways: either by promoting glucose absorption by beta-cells, or by inhibiting alpha-cells' ability to produce glucose. In this review, we summarized potential targets for the treatment of T2DM with special reference to GPR119 along with its pharmacological effects, several endogenous as well as exogenous agonists, and its pyrimidine nucleus containing synthetic ligands.",MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,2023,"Nema, P; Asati, V; Kendya, P; Gupta, T; Agarwal, S; Kori, S; Kashaw, V; Iyer, AK; Kashaw, SK",10.2174/1389557523666230302140658,,WOS:001096277200001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Integration of cardiovascular regulation by the blood/endothelium cell-free layer,"The cell-free layer (CFL) width separating red blood cells in flowing blood from the endothelial cell membrane is shown to be a regulator of the balance between nitric oxide (NO) production by the endothelium and NO scavenging by blood hemoglobin. The CFL width is determined by hematocrit (Hct) and the vessel wall flow velocity gradient. These factors and blood and plasma viscosity determine vessel wall shear stress which regulates the production of NO in the vascular wall. Mathematical modeling and experimental findings show that vessel wall NO concentration is a strong nonlinear function of Hct and that small Hct variations have comparatively large effects on blood pressure regulation. Furthermore, NO concentration is a regulator of inflammation and oxygen metabolism. Therefore, small, sustained perturbations of Hct may have long-term effects that can promote pro-hypertensive and pro-inflammatory conditions. In this context, Hct and its variability are directly related to vascular tone, peripheral vascular resistance, oxygen transport and delivery, and inflammation. These effects are relevant to the analysis and understanding of blood pressure regulation, as NO bioavailability regulates the contractile state of blood vessels. Furthermore, regulation of the CFL is a direct function of blood composition therefore understanding of its physiology relates to the design and management of fluid resuscitation fluids. From a medical perspective, these studies propose that it should be of clinical interest to note small variations in patient's Hct levels given their importance in modulating the CFL width and therefore NO bioavailability.

Family members often witness the event and attempt resuscitation. The physiological and psychological impact of a loved one's death, witnessed or unwitnessed, can be significant and long-lasting. However, little is known about the care needs of families during the cardiac arrest care of a loved one. This scoping review protocol was designed with, and will be performed in partnership with, persons with lived experience of sudden cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and nonsurvivors alike). Methods: The review will be performed in accordance with accepted methods such as the Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework and the Levac extension. We will search multiple databases, and Google Scholar for both qualitative and quantitative scientific literature. Articles will be screened, extracted, and analyzed by a team with lived experience of cardiac arrest. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data extraction independently. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data. Discussion: This protocol outlines a planned literature review to systematically examine the nature of existing evidence to describe what the care needs of families experiencing the cardiac arrest of a loved one are. Such evi-dence will contribute to the development of strategies to meet identified care needs.

OBJECTIVES: to analyse the main adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with maternal excess weight and obesity. DESIGN: retrospective epidemiological study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data extrapolated from the Birth Attendance Certificate information flow of the Autonomous Province of Trento (Northern Italy) between 2015 and 2019. A total of 20,756 women with data regarding maternal height and weight at the start of pregnancy were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: gestational outcome variables studied were gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, premature birth, and still births. Outcomes considered during labour and delivery were type of delivery, induction, episiotomy and post-partum haemorrhage. Neonatal outcomes were birth weight, Apgar score, need for resuscitation, and hospitalisation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Lastly, exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was analysed. RESULTS: considering the population of pregnant women, 68.3% of women were classified as normal-weight, 9.5% as underweight, 16.0% as overweight, and 6.3% as obese. Maternal excess weight and obesity were seen to be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, caesarean section, induction, post-partum bleeding, foetal macrosomia, and the need for neonatal resuscitation and hospitalisation in the NICU. Infants born to overweight and obese mothers were also less likely to be breastfed.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Video case review for quality improvement during cardiac arrest resuscitation in the emergency department,"Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are a leading global cause of mortality. The American Heart Association (AHA) promotes several important strategies associated with improved cardiac arrest (CA) outcomes, including decreasing pulse check time and maintaining a chest compression fraction (CCF) > 0.80. Video review is a potential tool to improve skills and analyse deficiencies in various situations; however, its use in improving medical resuscitation remains poorly studied in the emergency department (ED). We implemented a quality improvement initiative, which utilised video review of CA resuscitations in an effort to improve compliance with such AHA quality metrics. Methods A cardiopulmonary resuscitation video review team of emergency medicine residents were assembled to analyse CA resuscitations in our urban academic ED. Videos were reviewed by two residents, one of whom was a senior resident (Postgraduate Year 3 or 4), and analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for numerous quality improvement metrics, including pulse check time, CCF, time to intravenous access and time to patient attached to monitor. Results We collected data on 94 CA resuscitations between July 2017 and June 2020. Average pulse check time was 13.09 (SD +/- 5.97) seconds, and 38% of pulse checks were <10 seconds. After the implementation of the video review process, there was a significant decrease in average pulse check time (P = .01) and a significant increase in CCF (P = .01) throughout the study period.

Only two pediatric cases of hydrocephalus-induced NSM have been reported. Here the authors report a third case in a 14-year-old boy who presented with severe headache, decreased level of consciousness, and shock in the context of acute hydrocephalus secondary to fourth ventricular outlet obstruction 3 years after standard-risk medulloblastoma treatment. He was initially stabilized with the insertion of an external ventricular drain and vasopressor treatment. He had a profoundly reduced cardiac contractility and became asystolic for 1 minute, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation when vasopressors were inadvertently discontinued. Over 1 week, his ventricles decreased in size and his cardiac function returned to normal. All other causes of heart failure were ruled out, and his impressive response to CSF diversion clarified the diagnosis of NSM secondary to hydrocephalus. He was unable to be weaned from his drain during his time in the hospital, so he underwent an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and has remained well with normal cardiac function at more than 6 months' follow-up.

Methods: Prospectively, we reviewed data from children presenting after CA and monitored by continuous electroencephalography (cEEG). Patients aged 1 month to 21 years were included. The SR, a quantitative measure of low-voltage cEEG (<= 3 mu V) content, was dichotomized as present or absent if there was > 0% suppression for one continuous hour. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed including age, sex, type of CA (i.e., in-hospital or out-of-hospital), and the presence of SR as a predictor of global anoxic cerebral injury as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: We included 84 patients with a median age of 4 years (interquartile range 0.9-13), 64% were male, and 49% (41/84) had in-hospital CA. Cerebral injury was seen in 50% of patients, of whom 65% had global injury. One-hour SR presence, independent of amount, predicted cerebral injury with 81% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) (66-91%) and 98% specificity (95% CI 88-100%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that SR was a significant predictor of both cerebral injury (beta = 6.28, p < 0.001) and mortality (beta = 3.56, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The SR a sensitive and specific marker of anoxic brain injury and post-CA mortality in the pediatric population.

Evidence for the optimal support of children with septic shock refractory to the initial sepsis management bundle remains minimal. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions. Administration of hydrocortisone in children with septic shock might fasten shock resolution, and has been shown to dampen the systemic host immune response, augment adrenergic effects, and support the stress response. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is one of the most powerful naturally occurring antioxidants and has beneficial effects on multiple pathways which are severely deranged during septic shock. A regimen combining hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine termed ""metabolic resuscitation"" or ""HAT therapy"" has been tested in large trials in critically ill adults with sepsis with conflicting results. Available information on intravenous ascorbic acid indicates an excellent safety profile even at very high doses both in adults and children. Given the pharmacological properties and beneficial effects shown both in vitro and in animal studies, and its safety profile, ascorbic acid either as a single therapy or as part of HAT treatment represents a promising candidate for future pediatric sepsis treatments. While pediatric age groups may be more susceptible to ascorbic acid deficiency during sepsis, there is a lack of high-quality trial data on HAT therapy in this age group. A single centre retrospective study identified potential for mortality benefit in children with septic shock, and the results from a randomized controlled pilot trial are being awaited.

Echocardiography was compatible with unrestrictive patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with continuous left-to-right shunting and concomitant iso-systemic pulmonary hypertension (PH) (case 1) and restrictive PDA with mild PH (case 2). Radiography showed cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings and diffuse interstitial-alveolar pattern consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF) in both cats. After testing for pulmonary vascular reactivity (case 1) and treatment for acute CHF (case 2), surgical ligation of the PDA was attempted. In case 1, PDA ligation led to severe hypotension and asystole, prompting loosening of the ligature because of suspected intolerance to PDA closure.

Observed quality parameters were chest compression depth and chest compression rate.RESULTSWith real-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance, there were improved mean (SD) chest compression rates (1058 vs. 121 +/- 12bpm; P<0.005), fewer inappropriate shock intervals [median (interquartile range) 0 (1 to 5) vs. 4 (1 to 7); P<0.005], a smaller fraction of time without chest compression (18.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 22.5 +/- 7.0%; P<0.005) and shorter postshock pauses (2.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2s; P<0.005).CONCLUSIONReal-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance significantly increased adherence to the guidelines by medical students treating simulated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Conventional rapid response systems (RRS) using track-and-trigger protocols have not consistently demonstrated improved outcomes. This study evaluated the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based cardiac arrest prediction model. Methods: This 1-year, prospective, non-randomized interventional trial assigned hospitalized patients with AI-based software as a medical device (AI-SaMD) high-risk alerts to groups based on their subsequent clinical response; those reassessed or treated within 24 h comprised the AI-SaMD-guided cohort, while the remainder formed the usual care cohort. Alerts prompted an optional but not mandatory treatment review. The primary outcome was ward-based cardiac arrest; the secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders. Results: Of 35,627 general ward admissions, 2906 triggered an AI-SaMD alert. Among these, 1409 (48.4%) were allocated to the AI-SaMD-guided cohort. The incidence of cardiac arrest significantly decreased from 2.07% to 1.06% (adjusted risk ratio (RR), 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.88; p < 0.01). In-hospital mortality also significantly declined (adjusted RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; p < 0.05). Conclusions: AI-SaMD-guided alerts were associated with reductions in cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality without requiring additional resources, supporting their integration into current clinical workflows to improve patient safety and optimize RRS performance.",DIAGNOSTICS,2026,"Park, MH; Kim, M; Lee, MJ; Kim, AJ; Cho, KJ; Jang, J; Jung, J; Chang, M; Yoo, D; Kim, JS",10.3390/diagnostics16020335,,WOS:001672806700001,A

However, it is neither reliably recorded nor routinely implemented in Australia. The Wait a Minute or More (WAMM) study aims to reduce this gap between the evidence and practice by integrating timely sharing of cord clamping data with Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality methods to increase the proportion of preterm infants receiving DCC for 60 s or longer (DCC60). Methods The WAMM study is a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT), informed by the Integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. Up to 20 Australian maternity hospitals will participate in this pragmatic SW-CRT to evaluate if in (Population) infants <37 weeks' gestation who do not need resuscitation, does (Intervention) the WAMM intervention (sharing of anonymised data on DCC60, together with a locally adapted quality improvement (QI) programme), compared with (Control) sharing of anonymised data on DCC60 alone, increase (primary Outcome) the proportion of infants receiving DCC60? At the end of 72 weeks, all sites will complete an 8-week period without the WAMM intervention to evaluate if implementation of DCC is sustained. Alongside the SW-CRT, an embedded process evaluation will assess the fidelity, acceptability, mechanisms of action and contextual barriers and enablers of the WAMM intervention. Discussion Using the stepped wedged design and guided by an explicit implementation framework (i-PARIHS), WAMM will provide information on the effectiveness and transferability of a locally adapted QI method to improve DCC60. If proven effective, ultimately scaling up the WAMM intervention globally will greatly improve childhood anaemia, death, disability and long-term costs.Trial registration number ACTRN12624000035527.",BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN,2025,"Popat, H; Robledo, KP; Finlayson, S; Cruz, M; Cavallaro, A; Ghadge, A; Spotswood, N; Keir, AK; Lehner, C; Kumar, S; Polglase, GR; Bonney, D; Battin, M; Strunk, T; Gordon, A; Aziz, K; Harvey, G; Lui, K; Tarnow-Mordi, WO",10.1136/bmjpo-2025-003660,,WOS:001637938200001,A

Areas covered A recently published post hoc analysis of the DAPA-HF trial evaluated the effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) dapagliflozin versus placebo on the incidence of VA, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death among people with HFrEF. During a median follow-up of 18.2 months, the composite primary outcome occurred in 140 (5.9%) people who received dapagliflozin compared to 175 (7.4%) participants in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.79; 95 confidence interval 0.63-0.99, P = 0.037). Animal studies suggest that SGLT2i could ameliorate the deleterious effects of myocardial injury, through various mechanisms, including reduced sympathetic activity, improved oxidative stress, tissue oxygenation, autophagy, heart energy metabolism, and promotion of cardiac remodeling. Expert opinion Taken together, the above findings indicate a place for SGLT2i in future trials investigating novel treatments to improve survival in patients with acute cardiovascular episodes. This is primarily applicable for acute decompensated HF; however, their use could also be evaluated in other conditions that induce VA, such as acute coronary syndromes.",EXPERT OPINION ON PHARMACOTHERAPY,2022,"Koufakis, T; Giannakoulas, G; Zebekakis, P; Kotsa, K",10.1080/14656566.2021.2003329,,WOS:000719206700001,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Emerging applications of nanotechnology for the diagnosis and management of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques,"An estimated 16 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease (CAD), and approximately 325,000 people die annually from cardiac arrest. About two-thirds of unexpected cardiac deaths occur without prior recognition of cardiac disease. A vast majority of these deaths are attributable to the rupture of 'vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques'. Clinically, plaque vulnerability is typically assessed through imaging techniques, and ruptured plaques leading to acute myocardial infarction are treated through angioplasty or stenting. Despite significant advances, it is clear that current imaging methods are insufficiently capable for elucidating plaque composition-which is a key determinant of vulnerability. Further, the exciting improvement in the treatment of CAD afforded by stenting procedures has been buffered by significant undesirable host-implant effects, including restenosis and late thrombosis. Nanotechnology has led to some potential solutions to these problems by yielding constructs that interface with plaque cellular components at an unprecedented size scale. By leveraging the innate ability of macrophages to phagocytose nanoparticles, contrast agents can now be targeted to plaque inflammatory activity. Improvements in nano-patterning procedures have now led to increased ability to regenerate tissue isotropy directly on stents, enabling gradual regeneration of normal, physiologic vascular structures. Advancements in immunoassay technologies promise lower costs for biomarker measurements, and in the near future, may enable the addition of routine blood testing to the clinician's toolbox-decreasing the costs of atherosclerosis-related medical care. These are merely three examples among many stories of how nanotechnology continues to promise advances in the diagnosis and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,"Developments in cardioprotection: ""Polarized"" arrest as an alternative to ""depolarized"" arrest","During cardiac surgery or cardiac transplantation, the heart is subjected to varying periods of global ischemia. The heart must be protected during this ischemic period to avoid additional injury, and techniques have been developed that delay ischemic injury and minimize reperfusion injury. Almost universally, this involves using a hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution and these solutions have become the gold standard for myocardial protection for more than 20 years. Despite the extensive and continued research aimed at improving these basic hyperkalemic cardioplegic solutions, patients undergoing surgery almost invariably experience some degree of postoperative dysfunction. It is likely that this relates to the depolarizing nature of hyperkalemic solutions, which results in ionic imbalance caused by continuing transmembrane fluxes and the consequent maintenance of high energy phosphate metabolism, even during hypothermic ischemia. A potentially beneficial alternative to hyperkalemic cardioplegia is to arrest the heart in a ""hyperpolarized"" or ""polarized"" state, which maintains the membrane potential of the arrested myocardium at or near to the resting membrane potential. At these potentials, transmembrane fluxes will be minimized and there should be little metabolic demand, resulting in improved myocardial protection. Recent studies have explored these alternative concepts for myocardial protection. The use of compounds such as adenosine or potassium channel openers, which are thought to induce hyperpolarized arrest, have demonstrated improved protection after normothermis or short periods of hypothermic ischemia when compared to hyperkalemic (depolarized) arrest. Similarly, studies from our own laboratory, in which the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, was used to induce polarized arrest (demonstrated by direct measurement of membrane potential during ischemia) was also shown to provide better recovery of function after 5 hours of long-term hypothermic (7.5 degrees C) storage. These promising initial studies need to be consolidated before experimental promise becomes clinical reality.

The Holter monitor tracings of 13 patients were reviewed after they sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. All had a prior cardiac arrest or cardiac syncope. Twelve patients had ventricular tachycardia (VT) as their initial arrest arrhythmia and 1 patient had bradycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation (VF). VT degenerated to VF in 10 to 12  patients after a mean interval of 96 .+-. 31 seconds (.+-. standard error of the mean). The number of VT runs increased significantly during the hour immediately preceding arrest (p = 0.004). Despite prompt resuscitation efforts in 12 patients, only 6 survived. The 6 survivors and 6 nonsurvivors were not different with regard to age, ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery narrowing and time to first defibrillation. However, degeneration to VF within 30 seconds of arrest (5 of 6 nonsurvivors  and 1 of 6 survivors, p = 0.04) and a slower rate of VT at the onset of arrest (166 beats/min in nonsurvivors and 227 beats/min in survivors, p = 0.02) were associated with unsuccessful resuscitation.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,1985,"MILNER, PG; PLATIA, EV; REID, PR; GRIFFITH, LSC",10.1016/0002-9149(85)91016-1,,WOS:A1985ASE2000005,A
wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,Pharmaco-proteomics opportunities for individualizing neurovascular treatment,"Neurovascular disease often involves multi-organ system injury. For example, patent foramen ovale (PFO) related ischemic strokes involve not just the brain, but also the heart, the lung, and the peripheral vascular circulation. For higher-risk but high-reward systemic therapy (e.g., thrombolytics, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), PFO closure) to be implemented safely, very careful patient selection and close monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy are imperative. For example, more than a decade after the approval of therapeutic hypothermic and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, they both remain extremely underutilized, in part due to lack of clinical tools for patient selection or to follow therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, in understanding the complexity of the global effects of clinical neurovascular diseases and their therapies, a systemic approach may offer a unique perspective and provide tools with clinical utility. Clinical proteomic approaches may be promising to monitor systemic changes in complex multi-organ diseases - especially where the disease process can be 'sampled' in clinically accessible fluids such as blood, urine, and CSF. Here, we describe a 'pharmaco-proteomic' approach to three major challenges in translational neurovascular research directly at bedside - in order to better stratify risk, widen therapeutic windows, and explore novel targets to be validated at the bench - (i) thrombolytic treatment for ischemic stroke, (ii) therapeutic hypothermia for post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and (iii) treatment for PFO related paradoxical embolic stroke. In the future, this clinical proteomics approach may help to improve patient selection, ensure more precise clinical phenotyping for clinical trials, and individualize patient treatment.",NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH,2013,"Ning, MM; Lopez, M; Sarracino, D; Cao, J; Karchin, M; McMullin, D; Wang, X; Buonanno, FS; Lo, EH",10.1179/1743132813Y.0000000213,,WOS:000319816500003,A

No specific treatment is available to reduce neuronal death and improve functional outcome. The brain's inflammatory response to ischemia can exacerbate injury and provides a potential treatment target. We hypothesized that microglia are activated by CA and contribute to neuronal loss. We used a mouse model to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of the proinflammatory microglial enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) after CA alters microglial activation and neuronal death. The sEH inhibitor 4-phenylchalcone oxide (4-PCO) was administered after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The 4-PCO treatment significantly reduced neuronal death and improved memory function after CA/CPR. We found early activation of microglia and increased expression of inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta in the hippocampus after CA/CPR, which was unchanged after 4-PCO treatment, while expression of antiinflammatory IL-10 increased significantly. We conclude that sEH inhibition after CA/CPR can alter the transcription profile in activated microglia to selectively induce antiinflammatory and neuroprotective IL-10 and reduce subsequent neuronal death.

Despite conferring favorable long-term effects on well-being and survival, exercise can be associated with risk of adverse events in the short term. Complex individual cardiovascular (CV) demands and adaptations imposed by exercise present distinct challenges to the cardiologist asked to evaluate athletes. Here, we describe the evolution of sports and exercise cardiology as a unique discipline within the continuum of CV specialties, provide the rationale for tailoring of CV care to athletes and exercising individuals, define the role of the CV specialist within the athlete care team, and lay the foundation for the development of Sports and Exercise Cardiology in the United States. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology launched the Section of Sports and Exercise Cardiology. Membership has grown from 150 to over 4,000 members in just 2 short years, indicating marked interest from the CV community to advance the integration of sports and exercise cardiology into mainstream CV care. Although the current athlete CV care model has distinct limitations, here, we have outlined a new paradigm of care for the American athlete and exercising individual. By practicing and promoting this new paradigm, we believe we will enhance the CV care of athletes of all ages, and serve the greater athletic community and our nation as a whole, by allowing safest participation in sports and physical activity for all individuals who seek this lifestyle.

wos,WoS-queryA2.ris,JOUR,A Systematic Review on Outcomes of Patients with Heatstroke and Heat Exhaustion,"Introduction: Heatstroke (HS) is a severe form of heat-related illness (HRI) associated with high morbidity and mortality, representing a condition that includes long-term multiorgan dysfunction and susceptibility to further heat illness. Methods: In a systematic review searching Medline PubMed from the studies conducted between 2009 and 2020, 16 papers were identified. Results: A hallmark symptom of heat stroke is CNS dysfunction (a hallmark sign of HS) which manifests as mental status changes, including agitation, delirium, epilepsy, or coma at the time of the collapse. Acute kidney injury (AKI), gut ischemia, blood clots in the stomach and small intestine, cytoplasmic protein clumps in the spleen, and injury of skeletal muscle (rhabdomyolysis) are all characteristics of peripheral tissue damage. Severe heat stroke tends to be complicated by rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients with exertional heat stroke. Rhabdomyolysis may lead to systemic effects, including the local occurrence of compartment syndrome, hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, and/or lethal disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Untreated heat stroke might exacerbate psychosis, lactic acidosis, consumptive coagulopathy, hematuria, pulmonary edema, renal failure, and other metabolic abnormalities. Core body temperature and level of consciousness are the most significant indicators to diagnose the severity of heat stroke and prevent unfavorable consequences. Heatstroke is a life-threatening illness if not promptly recognized and effectively treated. Discussion: This review highlighted that core body temperature and white blood cell count are significant contributing factors affecting heat stroke outcomes. Other factors contributing to the poor outcome include old age, low GCS, and prolonged hospital stay. The prevalence of both classic and exertional heatstroke can be reduced by certain simple preventive measures, such as avoiding strenuous activity in hot environments and reducing exposure to heat stress.",OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2023,"Bukhari, HA",10.2147/OAEM.S419028,,WOS:001075351900001,A
