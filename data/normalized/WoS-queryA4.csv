wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,End-of-life care in German and Dutch nursing homes: a cross-sectional study on nursing home staff's perspective in 2022,"Background As society ages, the need for nursing home care is steadily increasing and end-of-life care of nursing home residents has become increasingly more important. End-of-life care differs between Germany and the neighbouring Netherlands. For example, a much higher proportion of German compared to Dutch nursing home residents is hospitalized at the end of life. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate end-of-life care in German and Dutch nursing homes.Methods In this cross-sectional study, a postal survey was sent to 600 randomly selected German and Dutch nursing homes each and addressed to the nursing staff management. Participants were asked to estimate the percentage of nursing home residents whose wishes for emergency situations (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation) are known and to indicate whether facilities offer advanced care planning (ACP). They were also asked to estimate whether general practitioners (GPs)/elder care physicians (ECPs) and nursing home staff are usually well trained for end-of-life care. Finally, participants were asked to estimate the proportion of nursing home residents who die in hospital rather than in the nursing home and to rate overall end-of-life care provision.Results A total of 301 questionnaires were included in the analysis; 199 from German and 102 from Dutch nursing homes (response 33.2% and 17.0%). German participants estimated that 20.5% of residents die in the hospital in contrast to the Dutch estimation of 5.9%. In German nursing homes, ACP is offered less often (39.2% in Germany, 75.0% in the Netherlands) and significantly fewer wishes for emergency situations of residents were known than in Dutch nursing homes. GPs were considered less well-trained for end-of-life care in Germany. The most important measures to improve end-of-life care were comparable in both countries.Conclusion Differences in (the delivery and knowledge of) end-of-life care between Germany and the Netherlands could be observed in this study. These could be due to structural differences (ECPs available 24/7 in the majority of Dutch nursing homes) and cultural differences (more discussion on quality of life versus life-sustaining treatments in the Netherlands). Due to these differences, a country-specific approach is necessary to improve end-of-life care.",ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH,2024,"Bauer, AK; Fassmer, AM; Zuidema, SU; Janus, SIM; Hoffmann, F",10.1186/s13690-024-01316-2,,WOS:001248038400002,A

In this study, the TAVRs performed for CS between June 2015 and September 2022 using SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra bioprosthesis from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry were analysed. Methods and results CS was defined as: (i) coding of CS within 24 h on Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry form; and/or (ii) pre-procedural use of inotropes or mechanical circulatory support devices and/or (iii) cardiac arrest within 24 h prior to TAVR. The control group was comprised of all the other patients undergoing TAVR. Baseline characteristics, all-cause mortality, and major complications at 30-day and 1-year outcomes were reported. Landmark analysis was performed at 30 days post-TAVR. Cox-proportional multivariable analysis was performed to determine the predictors of all-cause mortality at 1 year. A total of 309 505 patients underwent TAVR with balloon-expandable valves during the study period. Of these, 5006 patients presented with CS prior to TAVR (1.6%). The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 10.76 & PLUSMN; 10.4. The valve was successfully implanted in 97.9% of patients. Technical success according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria was 94.5%. In a propensity-matched analysis, CS was associated with higher in-hospital (9.9% vs. 2.7%), 30-day (12.9% vs. 4.9%), and 1-year (29.7% vs. 22.6%) mortality compared to the patients undergoing TAVR without CS. In the landmark analysis after 30 days, the risk of 1-year mortality was similar between the two groups [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.21]. Patients who were alive at 1 year noted significant improvements in functional class (Class I/II 89%) and quality of life (& UDelta;KCCQ score +50). In the multivariable analysis, older age (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.03), peripheral artery disease (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.47), prior implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07-1.77), patients on dialysis (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.69-2.53), immunocompromised status (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.69), New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.06-2.12), lower aortic valve mean gradient, lower albumin levels, lower haemoglobin levels, and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores were independently associated with 1-year mortality.

Preclinical work shows that augmented passive immunotherapy with P4 peptide increases phagocytic activity and shows promise as a novel therapeutic strategy. Our aim was to determine ex vivo P4 activity in a target population of patients admitted to critical care with severe infection. Methods: We prospectively recruited UK critical care unit patients with severe sepsis and observed clinical course (>= 3 months postdischarge). Blood samples were taken in early (<= 48 h postdiagnosis, n = 54), latent (7 days postdiagnosis, n = 39), and convalescent (3-6 months postdiagnosis, n = 18) phases of disease. The primary outcome measure was killing of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae by neutrophils with and without P4 peptide stimulation. We also used a flow cytometric whole blood phagocytosis assay to determine phagocyte association and oxidation of intraphagosomal reporter beads. Results: P4 peptide increased neutrophil killing of opsonized pneumococci by 8.6% (confidence interval 6.35-10.76, P< 0.001) in all phases of sepsis, independent of infection source and microbiological status. This represented a 54.9% increase in bacterial killing compared with unstimulated neutrophils (15.6%) in early phase samples. Similarly, P4 peptide treatment significantly increased neutrophil and monocyte intraphagosomal reporter bead association and oxidation, independent of infection source. Conclusions: We have extended preclinical work to demonstrate that P4 peptide significantly increases phagocytosis and bacterial killing in samples from a target patient population with severe sepsis. This study supports the rationale for augmented passive immunotherapy as a therapeutic strategy in severe sepsis.",SHOCK,2016,"Morton, B; Mitsi, E; Pennington, SH; Reine, J; Wright, AD; Parker, R; Welters, ID; Blakey, JD; Rajam, G; Ades, EW; Ferreira, DM; Wang, D; Kadioglu, A; Gordon, SB",10.1097/SHK.0000000000000715,,WOS:000388497900006,A

DESIGN: A pragmatic pre- and post-intervention study conducted over the same 10-month period in 2 consecutive years. SETTING: Four-hospital community-academic health system. PATIENTS: All adult patients admitted to a medical-surgical ward. INTERVENTIONS: During the baseline period, clinicians were blinded to eCART scores. During the intervention period, scores were presented to providers. Scores greater than or equal to 95th percentile were designated high risk prompting a physician assessment for ICU admission. Scores between the 89th and 95th percentiles were designated intermediate risk, triggering a nurse-directed workflow that included measuring vital signs every 2 hours and contacting a physician to review the treatment plan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was all-cause inhospital mortality. Secondary measures included vital sign assessment within 2 hours, ICU transfer rate, and time to ICU transfer. A total of 60,261 patients were admitted during the study period, of which 6,681 (11.1%) met inclusion criteria (baseline period n = 3,191, intervention period n = 3,490). The intervention period was associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality for the main cohort (8.8% vs 13.9%; p < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.52-0.71]). A significant decrease in mortality was also seen for the average-risk cohort not subject to the intervention (0.49% vs 0.26%; p < 0.05; adjusted OR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41-0.74]). In subgroup analysis, the benefit was seen in both high- (17.9% vs 23.9%; p = 0.001) and intermediate-risk (2.0% vs 4.0 %; p = 0.005) patients. The intervention period was also associated with a significant increase in ICU transfers, decrease in time to ICU transfer, and increase in vital sign reassessment within 2 hours.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Improving prediction accuracy of hospital arrival vital signs using a multi-output machine learning model: a retrospective study of JSAS-registry data,"BackgroundCritically ill patients can deteriorate rapidly; therefore, prompt prehospital interventions and seamless transition to in-hospital care upon arrival are crucial for improving survival. In Japan, helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) complement general emergency medical services (GEMS) by providing on-site care, reducing transport times, and aiding facility selection. Vital signs at hospital arrival determine initial management, but existing models are poor at predicting them, especially in patients receiving continuous interventions from both GEMS and HEMS. Therefore, we developed a machine-learning model to accurately predict the actual values of vital signs at hospital arrival using limited patient characteristic data and prehospital vital signs.MethodsUsing data from the Japanese Society for Aeromedical Services registry, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients aged >= 18 years transported by HEMS between April 2020 and March 2022. Patients with cardiac arrest during transport, missing vital signs, and data inconsistencies were excluded. The predictive model used prehospital vital signs from GEMS and HEMS contact times, demographic characteristics, and intervention information. The primary outcome was the actual values of vital signs measured at hospital arrival. After data preprocessing, we constructed a deep neural network multi-output regression model using Bayesian optimization. Model performance was assessed by comparing the predicted values with the actual hospital arrival measurements using mean absolute error, R-2 score, residual standard deviation, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Additionally, the NN model's performance was compared with alternative methods, namely HEMS contact values and change-based predictions derived solely from prehospital data.ResultsThe study included 10,478 patients (median age 70 years; 69% male). The model achieved mean absolute errors of 7.1 bpm for heart rate, 15.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure, 10.8 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, 2.9 breaths/min for respiratory rate, and 0.62 points for Glasgow Coma Scale score. The Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.54 to 0.86. The model outperformed other methods, especially for R-2 scores and residual standard deviations, demonstrating its superior ability to predict actual vital signs values.ConclusionThe multi-output regression model accurately predicted the actual values of vital signs measured at hospital arrival using limited prehospital information, demonstrating the effectiveness of advanced modeling techniques.",BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2025,"Kawai, Y; Yamamoto, K; Tsuruta, K; Miyazaki, K; Asai, H; Fukushima, H",10.1186/s12873-025-01233-9,,WOS:001487365700002,A

We show that this initial growth senescence is characterized by abnormally large, defectively dividing cells and is delayed when cells initially contain elongated telomeres. However, cells that survive the initial catastrophic senescence emerge relatively frequently, and their subsequent growth without telomerase is surprisingly efficient. Survivors have lengthened telomeres, often much longer than wild type, but that are still subject to gradual shortening. Production of these postsenescence survivors is strongly dependent on the RAD52 gene. We propose that shortened, terminal telomeric repeat tracts become uncapped, promoting recombinational repair between them to regenerate lengthened telomeres in survivors. This process, which we term telomere cap-prevented recombination (CPR) may be a general alternative telomere maintenance pathway in eukaryotes.",GENES & DEVELOPMENT,1996,"McEachern, MJ; Blackburn, EH",10.1101/gad.10.14.1822,,WOS:A1996UZ51500010,A
wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Family-authored ICU diaries to reduce fear in patients experiencing a cardiac arrest (FAID fear): A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) and their family members often experience significant fear-based distress (cardiac fear; i.e., fear about the CA survivor's heart). Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White). Recruitment (16/25 referred; 64.0%), retention (14/16 enrolled; 87.5%), and intervention adherence (7/10 completed; 70%) were promising. Most agreed that the ICU diary intervention was appropriate (7/10 completed; 70.0%), feasible (9/10 completed; 90.0%]), and acceptable (8/10 completed; 80.0%). Fear was nonsignificantly lower in intervention participants (v. control) at end of hospital care and 30 days later.

This study presents a 5-year retrospective analysis of patients injured due to train-associated events, managed at a level-1 trauma center in India. Materials and methods Hospital-based trauma registry data of train-associated injuries presenting between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Data from 726 patients were analyzed for demographics, injury events, injury regions, their management and outcomes. ISS and NISS were used to quantify the injury severity. Results Mean age was 33 years, with male-to-female ratio 86 to 14%. The majority of patients (62%) were between 20-40 years. The median ISS was 9 (IQR 4-16), median hospital stays 11 days (IQR6-23), with in-hospital mortality of 17.4%. Presence of head injury; ISS > 9 and CPR in ED were independent risk factors of mortality. Trespassers on the rail track had significantly more severe injuries compared to passengers (Median ISS 13 vs. 9, p = 0.012; Median NISS 22 vs.17, p = 0.015); however, mortality and hospital length of stay were not significantly different. Location of injury event (on platform or tracks) showed no difference between the severity of injuries, mortality and hospital length of stay. Conclusions Current study reports comprehensive injury patterns and outcomes of train-associated injuries from a low- and middle-income country (LMIC).

Limited data exist supporting the use of a 2-bag DKA protocol in adult patients across all levels of care. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 2-bag DKA protocol in comparison with a traditional DKA management strategy. Methods: Retrospective review of patients admitted with DKA between January 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022, at a single center. Patients were separated into 2 cohorts, traditional or 2-bag. The primary outcome was time to anion gap closure and/or beta-hydroxybutyrate normalization. Secondary outcomes include length of hospitalization, insulin infusion time, and hypoglycemic events. Results: One hundred forty-three patients had a DKA order set initiated during their admission, 59 in the traditional cohort and 84 in the 2-bag cohort. Mean time to anion gap closure was shorter in the 2-bag cohort (12.7 vs 16.9 hours; P = 0.005) and beta-hydroxybutyrate normalization (15.6 vs 25.6 hours; P = 0.026).

Advances in understanding sepsis pathophysiology highlight a need to update the definition and diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock, whereas new data support an increasing role for automated screening algorithms and biomarker combinations to assist earlier recognition. Once sepsis or septic shock is suspected, attention to prompt initiation of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation, and vasoactive medications remain key components to initial management with several new and ongoing studies offering new insights into how to optimize this approach. Ultimately, a key goal is for screening to encompass as many children as possible at risk for sepsis and trigger early treatment without increasing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics and preventable hospitalizations. Although the role for adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids and other metabolic therapies remains incompletely defined, ongoing studies will soon offer updated guidance for optimal use.

The management of these patients relies on blood transfusion and surgery. Time is a key factor, related to survival. Recent events highlight the need to be more efficient in the transfusion supply during terror attacks or mass casualties in civilian settings. Blood components therapy with a 1:1:1 ratio is associated with a decrease of mortality but encounters many logistic issues in those circumstances. Whole blood provides in one bag all the blood components in physiologic proportions with minimal amount of additive solution.

This review aims to update physicians with regard to the main pillars of treatment for this insidious condition. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched from inception with special attention paid to November 2021-January 2023. Results: The management of sepsis/septic shock is challenging and involves different pathophysiological aspects, encompassing empirical antimicrobial treatment (which is promptly administered after microbial tests), fluid (crystalloids) replacement (to be established according to fluid tolerance and fluid responsiveness), and vasoactive agents (e.g., norepinephrine (NE)), which are employed to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg and reduce the risk of fluid overload. In cases of refractory shock, vasopressin (rather than epinephrine) should be combined with NE to reach an acceptable level of pressure control. If mechanical ventilation is indicated, the tidal volume should be reduced from 10 to 6 mL/kg. Heparin is administered to prevent venous thromboembolism, and glycemic control is recommended. The efficacy of other treatments (e.g., proton-pump inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, etc.) is largely debated, and such treatments might be used on a case-to-case basis. Conclusions: The management of sepsis/septic shock has significantly progressed in the last few years.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,TiME OUT: Time-specific machine-learning evaluation to optimize ultramassive transfusion,"BACKGROUND Ultramassive transfusion (UMT) is a resource-demanding intervention for trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock, and associated mortality rates remains high. Current research has been unable to identify a transfusion ceiling or point where UMT transitions from lifesaving to futility. Furthermore, little consideration has been given to how time-specific patient data points impact decisions with ongoing high-volume resuscitation. Therefore, this study sought to use time-specific machine learning modeling to predict mortality and identify parameters associated with survivability in trauma patients undergoing UMT. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted at a Level I trauma (2018-2021) and included trauma patients meeting criteria for UMT, defined as >= 20 red blood cell products within 24 hours of admission. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the blood bank and trauma registries, and time-specific data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Time-specific decision-tree models predicating mortality were generated and evaluated using area under the curve. RESULTS In the 180 patients included, mortality rate was 40.5% at 48 hours and 52.2% overall. The deceased received significantly more blood products with a median of 71.5 total units compared with 55.5 in the survivors (p < 0.001) and significantly greater rates of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma at each time interval. Time-specific decision-tree models predicted mortality with an accuracy as high as 81%. In the early time intervals, hemodynamic stability, undergoing an emergency department thoracotomy, and injury severity were most predictive of survival, while, in the later intervals, markers of adequate resuscitation such as arterial pH and lactate level became more prominent. CONCLUSION This study supports that the decision of ""when to stop"" in UMT resuscitation is not based exclusively on the number of units transfused but rather the complex integration of patient and time-specific data. Machine learning is an effective tool to investigate this concept, and further research is needed to refine and validate these time-specific decision-tree models.

Psychiatric disorders such as delirium and confusion (hallucinations, agitation, stupor) occur in almost half of all ICU patients. Simple measures can reduce the risk of such disorders, including noise reduction, less intense lighting (especially at night), individual rooms, visible clocks to reduce confusion, frequent family visits, verbal contact, reassurance, and anxiolytics. Anxiety and depression are frequent after ICU stays, and may be mixed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can include fear, feelings of horror, helplessness, avoidance, neurovegetative symptoms, and intrusive thoughts.

As soon as the patient is medically stable, a thorough suicide risk assessment, which evaluates suicidal ideation/intent, preceding circumstances, predisposing and protective factors, should be conducted. An assessment of current and ongoing suicide risk will assist in determining the safest place to manage the patient. For those with a low level of suicide risk, outpatient management may be considered in the presence of a good social support system at home and a well-documented safety plan. Measures should be put in place to address the modifiable psychosocial risk factors for suicide, whilst appropriate pharmacotherapy is instituted for co-existing mental illness.

One potential contributing factor to this trend could be the lack of agreement regarding the chosen definitions across different trials. The primary objective was to identify the terminology and definitions utilized for the characterization of multiple trauma patients within randomized controlled trials (RCTs).MethodsA systematic review of the literature was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov between January 1, 2002, and July 31, 2022. RCTs or RTCs protocols were eligible if they included multiple trauma patients. The terms employed to characterize patient populations were identified, and the corresponding definitions for these terms were extracted. The subsequent impact on the population recruited was then documented to expose clinical heterogeneity.ResultsFifty RCTs were included, and 12 different terms identified. Among these terms, the most frequently used were ""multiple trauma"" (n = 21, 42%), ""severe trauma"" (n = 8, 16%), ""major trauma"" (n = 4, 8%), and trauma with hemorrhagic shock"" (n = 4, 8%). Only 62% of RCTs (n = 31) provided a definition for the terms used, resulting a total of 21 different definitions. These definitions primarily relied on the injury severity score (ISS) (n = 15, 30%), displaying an important underlying heterogeneity. The choice of the terms had an impact on the study population, affecting both the ISS and in-hospital mortality.

Little is known about the quality of care received by dying patients in hospitals. The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) provides a framework of providing good end-of-life care for dying patients and has been used with success in the United Kingdom (UK). In this study, we investigate whether adoption of a modified LCP in a Singapore hospital translated to better end-of-life care for cancer patients. Materials and Methods: The LCP was adapted and implemented as a pilot project on an oncology ward in Singapore General Hospital. A baseline review of 30 consecutive death records was performed, followed by a 4-month pilot and post-implementation audit of 30 consecutive patients on the adapted LCP. Results: Five types of end-of-life symptoms were analysed. There was only 1 uncontrolled symptom at death in the post-implementation group compared to 24 uncontrolled symptoms in the retrospective audit group. The prescription of breakthrough medications for symptom control increased from 21% in the retrospective audit group to 79% in the post-implementation group. Inappropriate monitoring was discontinued in 25 patients in the post-implementation group compared to none in the retrospective audit group. The documentation of resuscitation status and religion of the patient was improved, achieving full documentation in the post-implementation group. Conclusion: This study shows promising results for improving end-of-life care in cancer patients with a protocol-based pathway in a Singapore hospital. Extension of this care pathway to other settings should be explored to maximise its benefits to patients dying from all causes in hospital.

Thus, prompt prediction of patients at risk of massive transfusion (MT) is crucial. We investigated the ability of the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6 to forecast MT in severely injured trauma patients. IL-6 plasma levels were measured upon admission. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were calculated, and sensitivity and specificity were determined. In this retrospective study, a total of 468 predominantly male (77.8%) patients, with a median injury severity score (ISS) of 25 (17-34), were included. The Youden index for the prediction of MT within 6 and 24 h was 351 pg/mL. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: (i) low-IL-6 < 350 pg/mL and (ii) high-IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL. IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL was associated with a lower prothrombin time index, a higher activated partial thromboplastin time, and a lower fibrinogen concentration compared with IL-6 < 350 pg/mL (p <0.0001 for all). Thromboelastometric parameters were significantly different between groups (p <0.03 in all). More patients in the high-IL-6 group received MT (p <0.0001). The ROCs revealed an area under the curve of 0.76 vs. 0.82 for the high-IL-6 group for receiving MT in the first 6 and 24 h. IL-6 >= 350 pg/mL predicted MT within 6 and 24 h with a sensitivity of 45% and 58%, respectively, and a specificity of 89%.

Severe deviations from normothermia (36.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) are life threatening and even a moderate perioperative reduction of the CBT is coupled with an increased morbidity and mortality especially in high-risk patients. The relevant factors are coagulation disturbances, increased infection rate and increased cardiac risk. Normothermia should be achieved by the consistent use of warmth-conserving measures. On the other hand, a deliberate reduction in temperature or induced hypothermia is a neuroprotective procedure, which offers a therapeutic option to minimize neuronal secondary damage after primary hypoxic-ischemic events as well as extending the neuronal tolerance to ischemia. Management includes the practice of cooling down to a defined temperature, rewarming as well as a differentiated control of various parameters.

In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) for neurological outcomes in coma patients. From January 2013 to January 2016, 128 coma patients after acute brain injury were prospectively enrolled and monitored with aEEG. The 6-month neurological outcome was evaluated using the Cerebral Performance Category Scale. aEEG monitoring commenced at a median of 7.5 days after coma onset. Continuous normal voltage predicted a good 6-month neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 93.6% and specificity of 85.2%. In contrast, continuous extremely low voltage, burst-suppression, or a flat tracing was correlated with poor 6-month neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 76.5% and specificity of 100%.

In addition to conventional hemodynamic monitoring, the blood loss was calculated as the difference in blood flow rates between flow probes placed proximal and distal to the injury. The results show that the bleeding stopped between 3 and 4 min after the injury and amounted to 338 +/- 92 mL (mean +/- SEM), which corresponds to 28.5% +/- 6.6% of the estimated blood volume. After treatment with HSD was started, six rebleeding events occurred in the 1-mL group, 11 in the 2-mL group, and 16 in the 4-mL group. The amount of blood lost due to rebleeding increased significantly with the dose of HSD and was also associated with a fatal outcome. The total blood loss was 408 mL in the survivors and 630 mL in the nonsurvivors (median, P < 0.007). The mortality in the three groups was 20%, 50%, and 50%, respectively.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use,"Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings, particularly if poorly managed. The cornerstones of effective IAIs management include early diagnosis, adequate source control, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiologic stabilization using intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents in critically ill patients. Adequate empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients with IAIs is of paramount importance because inappropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with poor outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial prescriptions improves treatment effectiveness, increases patients' safety, and minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections (such as Clostridioides difficile) and antimicrobial resistance selection. The growing emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, especially regarding Gram-negative bacteria. The Multidisciplinary and Intersociety Italian Council for the Optimization of Antimicrobial Use promoted a consensus conference on the antimicrobial management of IAIs, including emergency medicine specialists, radiologists, surgeons, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, clinical pharmacologists, hospital pharmacists, microbiologists and public health specialists. Relevant clinical questions were constructed by the Organizational Committee in order to investigate the topic. The expert panel produced recommendation statements based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE Library and experts' opinions. The statements were planned and graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence. On November 10, 2023, the experts met in Mestre (Italy) to debate the statements. After the approval of the statements, the expert panel met via email and virtual meetings to prepare and revise the definitive document. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference and comprises three sections. The first section focuses on the general principles of diagnosis and treatment of IAIs.

The growing insight into the underlying pathophysiology of apoptosis and destructive processes at the cellular level, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of hypothermia, have led to improved application and to a widening of the range of potential indications. In many centres hypothermia has now become part of the standard therapy for post-anoxic coma in certain patients, but for other indications its use still remains controversial. The negative findings of some studies may be partly explained by inadequate protocols for the application of hypothermia and insufficient attention to the prevention of potential side effects.

However, the effectiveness of REBOA is still debated because of inconsistent indications across centers and the lack of medical records. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of REBOA by analyzing clinical results from a single center. Methods: This study included 96 patients who underwent REBOA between August 2016 and September 2021 at a regional trauma center according to the center's treatment algorithm for traumatic shock. Medical records, including the time of the decision to conduct the REBOA procedure, time of operation, type of aortic occlusion, and clinical outcomes, were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified by RE- BOA protocol (group 1, 2, or 3) and survival status (survivor or non-survivor) for analysis. Results: The overall success rate of the procedure was 97.9%, and the survival rate was 32.6%. In survivors, blood pressure was higher than in non-survivors both before the RE- BOA procedure (p=0.002) and after aortic occlusion (p=0.03). The total aortic occlusion time was significantly shorter (p=0.001) and the proportion of partial aortic occlusion was significantly higher (p=0.014) among the survivors. The non-survivors had more acidosis (p<0.001) and higher lactate concentrations (p<0.001) than the survivors. Conclusion: REBOA may be a feasible bridge therapy for resuscitation of patients with traumatic shock.

The aim of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) is to develop and promote a coordinated interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary European network of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (AICM) societies for improvement of patient safety and outcome, and to enhance political and public awareness of the role of anaesthesiologists all over Europe. The ESAIC promotes coordinated interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary care for severely compromised patients, based on the European training requirements (ETR) within the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). METHODS To define the current situation of AICM in Europe, a survey was sent in April 2019 to the ESAIC Council and the ESAIC National Anaesthesiologists Societies Committee (NASC) members. The survey posed questions regarding the year of foundation, the inclusion of ICM in the society name, and if, and to what extent, various kinds (postoperative, general, specific, mixed) of national ICUs are being run by differing medical specialties. The study data were compiled and analysed by the ESAIC Board, Council and NASC in December 2019. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Amongst the 42 European national societies surveyed (41 members of ESAIC-NASC plus Luxembourg), nineteen (45%) also include terms related to critical care medicine or ICM in their names, seven (17%) include terms related to reanimation and three (7%) to resuscitation. In recent years, several national societies revised their names to better reflect their gradual embrace of peri-operative medicine, ICM, CREM and pain management. Approximately 70% of ICU beds in Europe, and 100% in Scandinavia, are being run by anaesthesiologists, the remaining 30% being managed by physicians from other surgical or medical specialties. To emphasise future needs and resources of European AICM, the ESAIC drafted an ICM roadmap in terms of clinical practice, organisation of healthcare, interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration, patient safety, outcome and empowerment, professional working conditions, and changes in research, teaching and training required to meet future challenges and expectations.",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY,2022,"Zacharowski, K; Filipescu, D; Pelosi, P; Åkeson, J; Bubenek, S; Gregoretti, C; Sander, M; de Robertis, E",10.1097/EJA.0000000000001706,,WOS:000853253200003,A

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle 2018 Update suggests premeasurement of lactate within 2-4 h so that physicians perform, assist, administer, and introduce lactate-guided resuscitation to reduce mortality due to sepsis. Methods: A total of 108 patients with septic shock who underwent continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney injury were enrolled in this observational study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, and patients were divided into two groups: survivors and non-survivors. Results: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that lactate levels at 24 h after initiation of CRRT treatment, but not lactate levels at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, were associated with mortality. Lactate clearance was associated with lower mortality among the survivors (OR = 0.140) at 6 h after ICU admission and late mortality (OR = 0.260) after 24 h. The area under the ROC curves for mortality was 0.682 for initial lactate; 0.797 for lactate at 24 h; and 0.816 for lactate clearance at 24 h. Conclusions: Our result reinforces that the determination of lactate dynamics represents a good predictor for mortality, and serial lactate measurements may be more useful prognostic markers than initial lactate in patients with septic shock.",CLINICS AND PRACTICE,2024,"Trebuian, CI; Marza, AM; Chioibas, R; Sutoi, D; Petrica, A; Crintea-Najette, I; Popa, D; Borcan, F; Flondor, D; Mederle, OA",10.3390/clinpract14030078,,WOS:001254417900001,A

Although US hospitals differ in the design of code status options, this variation and its impacts have not been empirically studied. Design and methods Multi-institutional qualitative study at 7 US hospitals selected for variability in geographical location, type of institution and design of code status options. We triangulated across three data sources (policy documents, code status ordering menus and in-depth physician interviews) to characterise the code status options available at each hospital. Using inductive qualitative methods, we investigated design differences in hospital code status options and the perceived impacts of these differences. Results The code status options at each hospital varied widely with regard to the number of code status options, the names and definitions of code status options, and the formatting and capabilities of code status ordering menus. DNR orders were named and defined differently at each hospital studied. We identified five key design characteristics that impact the function of a code status order. Each hospital's code status options were unique with respect to these characteristics, indicating that code status plays differing roles in each hospital. Physician participants perceived that the design of code status options shapes communication and decision-making practices about resuscitation and life-sustaining treatments, especially at the end of life. We identified four potential mechanisms through which this may occur: framing conversations, prompting decisions, shaping inferences and creating categories. Conclusions There are substantive differences in the design of hospital code status options that may contribute to known variability in end-of-life care and treatment intensity among US hospitals.

This prospective study was conducted over 1 year (September 2007-August 2008), all consecutive patients aged 80 and older managed by a medical team during the study period were included. Characteristics of patients, including previous health status and functional dependence, were recorded on-the scene by the attending physician. Three-month mortality was recorded, as well as ADL score. Data are expressed as mean values +/- standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and percentages and compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. P < 0.05 was considered the threshold for significance. Five hundred twenty-three patients were included. Mean age was 86 +/- 5. Median ADL index was 2 (IQR 0-9), and 63% of patients were living at home. At 3 months, the survival rate was 66% (n = 273) and the proportion of patients living at home was 64% (P = 0.9), the median ADL index of survivors was 2 (IQR 0-8) vs 1 (IQR 0-6) initially for this subpopulation, P = 0.01. Our study confirms utility and efficacy of full access of elderly persons to advanced life support especially for self-patients and not restricted based on aging per se.

It can manifest over a spectrum from minimal palpitation symptoms to sudden cardiac death. This makes large-scale trials on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia difficult to perform. The mechanism of ventricular tachycardia must also be understood before embarking on treatment. Patients with or without structural heart disease will have different mechanisms for the onset and propagation of these arrhythmias. Catheter ablation is an established management option for ventricular tachycardia; however, it is not always successful and anti-arrhythmic medications are often necessary to control these life-threatening arrhythmias. Although anti-arrhythmics can suppress ventricular tachycardias they also carry side effects. In certain substrates, some of these medications can exacerbate arrhythmias or heart failure. For these reasons, a multifaceted approach to treating ventricular tachycardia is necessary. This paper is a comprehensive review of the comprehensive management strategies for ventricular tachycardia.

Little research has evaluated physiologic effects of maintenance-only fluid strategy. DESIGN: We describe the efficacy of fluid-conservative resuscitation of septic shock using case-fatality, hemodynamic, and myocardial function endpoints. SETTING: Pediatric wards of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda, and Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, conducted between October 2013 and July 2015. Data were analysed from August 2016 to July 2019. PATIENTS: Children (>= 60 d to <= 12 yr) with severe febrile illness and clinical signs of impaired perfusion. INTERVENTIONS: IV maintenance fluid (4 mL/kg/hr) unless children had World Health Organization (WHO) defined shock (>= 3 signs) where they received two fluid boluses (20 mL/kg) and transfusion if shock persisted. Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data were collected at presentation, during resuscitation and on day 28. Outcome measures were 48-hour mortality, normalization of hemodynamics, and cardiac biomarkers. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty children (70% males) were recruited, six had WHO shock, all of whom died (6/6) versus three of 24 deaths in the non-WHO shock. Median fluid volume received by survivors and nonsurvivors were similar (13 [interquartile range (IQR), 9-32] vs 30 mL/kg [28-61 mL/kg], z = 1.62, p = 0.23). By 24 hours, we observed increases in median (IQR) stroke volume index (39 mL/m(2) [32-42 mL/m(2)] to 47 mL/m(2) [41-49 mL/m(2)]) and a measure of systolic function: fractional shortening from 30 (27-33) to 34 (31-38) from baseline including children managed with no-bolus. Children with WHO shock had a higher mean level of cardiac troponin (t = 3.58; 95% CI, 1.24-1.43; p = 0.02) and alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (t = 16.5; 95% CI, 2.80-67.5; p < 0.01) at admission compared with non-WHO shock. Elevated troponin (> 0.1 mu g/mL) and hyperlactatemia (> 4 mmol/L) were putative makers predicting outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance-only fluid therapy normalized clinical and myocardial perturbations in shock without compromising cardiac or hemodynamic function whereas fluid-bolus management of WHO shock resulted in high fatality.

Despite a sharp reduction in incidence and rates of hospital admission and mortality over the past 30 years, complications are still encountered in 10-20% of these patients. Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem, which can consume considerable financial resources. Management may involve various subspecialties including surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. Successful management of patients with complicated peptic ulcer (CPU) involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and timely surgical/radiological treatment. Methods The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5th WSES Congress, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached. Conclusions The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into the two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.",WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY,2020,"Tarasconi, A; Coccolini, F; Biffl, WL; Tomasoni, M; Ansaloni, L; Picetti, E; Molfino, S; Shelat, V; Cimbanassi, S; Weber, DG; Abu-Zidan, FM; Campanile, FC; Di Saverio, S; Baiocchi, GL; Casella, C; Kelly, MD; Kirkpatrick, AW; Leppaniemi, A; Moore, EE; Peitzman, A; Fraga, GP; Ceresoli, M; Maier, RV; Wani, I; Pattonieri, V; Perrone, G; Velmahos, G; Sugrue, M; Sartelli, M; Kluger, Y; Catena, F",10.1186/s13017-019-0283-9,,WOS:000513614400001,A
wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Indications for the Appropriate Use of Damage Control Surgery and Damage Control Interventions in Civilian Trauma Patients,"In patients undergoing emergent operation for trauma, surgeons must decide whether to perform a definitive or damage control (DC) procedure. DC surgery (abbreviated initial surgery followed by planned reoperation after a period of resuscitation in the intensive care unit) has been suggested to most benefit those injured patients more likely to succumb to the ""vicious cycle"" of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy, and/or postoperative abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) than the failure to complete all organ repairs. However, currently there exists no unbiased evidence to support that DC surgery benefits injured patients. Further, the procedure is associated with substantial morbidity, long durations of intensive care unit and hospital stay, increased healthcare resource utilization, and possibly a reduced quality of life among survivors. Therefore, it is important to ensure that DC laparotomy is only utilized in situations where the expected procedural benefits are predicted to outweigh the expected procedural harms. In this manuscript, we review the comparative effectiveness and safety of DC surgery when used for different procedural indications.

HYPOTHESIS: Indicators of microvascular dysfunction and markers of endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation would be associated with sepsis. METHODS AND MODELS: Prospective, observational case-control study. SETTING: Denver Health Medical Center, a safety-net hospital in Denver, CO. SUBJECTS: Forty-four adult patients with sepsis or septic shock and 24 healthy control patients undergoing elective orthopedic procedures. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and incarceration. RESULTS: Sublingual microvascular parameters (De Backer Density, proportion of perfused vessels) were measured using darkfield sidestream microscopy, and urinary GAGs were measured via DMMB colorimetric assay and LC-MS/MS targeting heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Validation of HS quantification was performed on a subset using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). LC-MS/MS HS was significantly higher in sepsis vs. controls (Area under the curve 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95), demonstrating higher diagnostic performance than SLM (De Backer Density AUC 0.71) and DMMB GAGs (AUC 0.62). LC-MS/MS and HILIC-MS HS levels were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.001). DMMB GAGs were associated with HS subtypes (p = 0.05) and SLM density (p = 0.03). No significant associations with in-hospital mortality or acute kidney injury were observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated modalities, LC-MS/MS quantification of HS showed the greatest discriminative ability for identifying sepsis and correlated strongly with established mass spectrometric methods. SLM exhibited moderate diagnostic utility and significant associations with GAG levels, reinforcing its biologic relevance. However, its bedside application may be limited by challenges in image acquisition and analysis. The concordance across SLM, DMMB, and LC-MS/MS supports eGC degradation as a key feature of sepsis pathophysiology. These findings highlight the promise of LC-MS/MS as a scalable, rapid, and mechanistically informed platform for biomarker-driven enrichment in future sepsis trials and clinical care.",CRITICAL CARE EXPLORATIONS,2025,"Longino, A; Martin, K; Bourland, S; Phinney, W; Wood, T; Camargo, E; Garcia, A; Oakes, J; Hiller, T; Weiss, R; Basu, A; Douglas, I; Hippensteel, J",10.1097/CCE.0000000000001324,,WOS:001591022100001,A

However, over the last several decades increasing numbers of AOD survivors have been identified.  Although many of these patients initially demonstrate profound neurologic deficits, a number who survive have regained most or all neurologic functions, indicating that they did not suffer mechanical disruption of the spinal cord at the time of AOD.  In the survivors, a growing body of evidence indicates that many of the initial neurologic deficits are related to vascular injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries and their branches.  We recently encountered three AOD survivors with no evidence of mechanical injury to the spinal cord in which angiography demonstrated vascular injury to the internal carotid artery in the form of vasospasm in one case and to the vertebral arteries in the forms of focal stenosis at the site of dural penetration, focal stenosis and distal vasospasm, and focal stenosis with distal intimal flap and dissection in one case each.  Autopsy after one of three died after cardiac arrest demonstrated diffuse infarction of the cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, brainstem, and upper cervical spinal cord without evidence of mechanical laceration or transection of the spinal cord.

Victims less than 20 years old were identified from hospital admissions and paramedic and medical examiners'' reports. The proportion of fatal or severe outcomes in patients were compared with various risk factors. Of 135 patients, 45 died and 5 had severe neurologic impairment. A subset of 38 victims found in cardiopulmonary arrest had a 32% survival rate, with  67% of survivors unimpaired or only mildly impaired. The two risk factors that occurred most commonly in victims who died or were severely impaired were submersion duration greater than 9 minutes (28 patients) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration longer than 25 minutes (20 patients). Both factors were ascertained in the prehospital phase of care. Submersion duration was associated with a steadily increasing risk of severe or fatal outcomes: 10% risk (7/67) for 0 to 5 minutes, 56% risk  (5/9) for 6 to 9 minutes, 88% risk (21/25) for 10 to 25 minutes, 100% risk (4/4) for >25 minutes. None of 20 children receiving >25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation escaped death or severe neurologic impairment.

A national shortage of hydrocortisone in 2023 prompted a change in institutional practice for hydrocortisone administration from 50 mg every 6 hours to 100 mg every 12 hours in an effort to reduce waste and conserve vials, creating an opportunity to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these two regimens. The primary efficacy outcome was time to shock resolution, and secondary outcomes evaluated in this study were mortality, renal replacement therapy (RRT), medication costs, and maximum vasopressor dose attained.DESIGN:Single-center, retrospective cohort study.SETTING:ICUs in a quaternary academic medical center.PATIENTS:Adult patients admitted to an ICU with septic shock, defined by mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg despite adequate fluid resuscitation and need for vasopressor infusion, who were treated with hydrocortisone for shock between October 24, 2022, and October 12, 2023.INTERVENTIONS:Treatment with hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours or 100 mg every 12 hours.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:One hundred thirty-eight patients were included in this retrospective chart review from October 24, 2022, to October 12, 2023. Data for 61 patients in the 50 mg every 6 hours group and 77 patients in the 100 mg every 12 hours group were collected and analyzed. In adjusted competing risk models, hydrocortisone regimen was not associated with differences in time to shock resolution (sub-hazard ratio [sub-HR] 0.95 [95% CI, 0.59-1.54]), ICU mortality (sub-HR 1.59; 95% CI, 0.89-2.84), in-hospital mortality (1.35; 95% CI, 0.81-2.26), or time to RRT (sub-HR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.45-2.31). In addition, the hydrocortisone dose regimen was not associated with differences in maximum vasopressor dose attained (mean difference in norepinephrine equivalent, 0.16 mu g/kg/min; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.58 mu g/kg/min). The less frequent dosing resulted in cost savings of $446.10 (95% CI, 253.95-638.25) per patient treated with the more intensive but less frequent hydrocortisone dosing regimen.CONCLUSIONS:A less frequent hydrocortisone dosing regimen was not associated with differences in time to shock resolution.

This joint IDSA/ACEP/PIDS/SHEA/SHM/SIPD position paper highlights concerns with this change. Multiple studies indicate that SEP-1 implementation was associated with increased broad-spectrum antibiotic use, lactate measurements, and aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients with suspected sepsis but not with decreased mortality rates. Increased focus on SEP-1 risks further diverting attention and resources from more effective measures and comprehensive sepsis care. We recommend retiring SEP-1 rather than using it in a payment model and shifting instead to new sepsis metrics that focus on patient outcomes. CMS is developing a community-onset sepsis 30-day mortality electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) that is an important step in this direction. The eCQM preliminarily identifies sepsis using systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, antibiotic administrations or diagnosis codes for infection or sepsis, and clinical indicators of acute organ dysfunction. We support the eCQM but recommend removing SIRS criteria and diagnosis codes to streamline implementation, decrease variability between hospitals, maintain vigilance for patients with sepsis but without SIRS, and avoid promoting antibiotic use in uninfected patients with SIRS. We further advocate for CMS to harmonize the eCQM with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Adult Sepsis Event surveillance metric to promote unity in federal measures, decrease reporting burden for hospitals, and facilitate shared prevention initiatives. These steps will result in a more robust measure that will encourage hospitals to pay more attention to the full breadth of sepsis care, stimulate new innovations in diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately bring us closer to our shared goal of improving outcomes for patients.",CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES,2024,"Rhee, C; Strich, JR; Chiotos, K; Classen, DC; Cosgrove, SE; Greeno, R; Heil, EL; Kadri, SS; Kalil, AC; Gilbert, DN; Masur, H; Septimus, EJ; Sweeney, DA; Terry, A; Winslow, DL; Yealy, DM; Klompas, M",10.1093/cid/ciad447,,WOS:001083114400001,A

Using a newly validated measure (the Sudden Bereavement Needs Inventory) and an online survey design, the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of adults (N = 403) who have experienced the suicide or fatal overdose of a close other within the past five years, to compare these needs with those of individuals bereaved by a sudden natural death, and to explore how the importance of specific need categories relates to psychiatric symptomatology. Results showed great overlap between adults bereaved by suicide and fatal overdose across all bereavement need categories, with notable differences between these two groups and those bereaved by a sudden-natural loss (e.g., cardiac arrest). Further, among the suicide and overdose bereaved, the self-rated importance of specific need categories accounted for much of the variation in symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression, with relational needs and meaning-based needs emerging as most strongly related to psychiatric symptoms.

The pathogenesis of I/R injury is highly complex, involving intricate interactions among oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and multiple cell death pathways. Once the mitochondrial respiratory chain is impaired, it triggers oxidative stress responses, leading to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS not only directly damage cells but also activate inflammatory responses and initiate multiple cell death signalling pathways, such as necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, thereby exacerbating tissue damage. Moreover, the clinical manifestations of I/R injury vary significantly across different organs, such as the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and lungs, and are further influenced by patients' underlying conditions, posing challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, constructing a comprehensive assessment system based on individual patient characteristics (such as genetic polymorphisms and comorbidities) to accurately predict the risk of I/R injury is particularly important. Currently, there are diverse strategies for the prevention and treatment of I/R injury, but translating basic research into clinical application remains challenging. Developing personalized treatment plans tailored to different cell types holds promise for overcoming existing therapeutic bottlenecks, significantly improving patient outcomes, and providing new directions for addressing the challenges of I/R injury.",MOLECULAR ASPECTS OF MEDICINE,2025,"Li, W; Liao, Y; Chen, J; Kang, WC; Wang, XT; Zhai, XZ; Xue, Y; Zhang, WZQ; Xia, YY; Cui, DR",10.1016/j.mam.2025.101382,,WOS:001530371400001,A

These recommendations come after multiple prospective, randomized trials demonstrated the benefits of CRT in advanced HF that included > 6000 subjects.

From cell to bedside,"The J wave, a deflection that follows the QRS complex of the surface electrocardiogram, is usually partially buried in the R wave in humans, appearing as a J-point elevation. An early repolarization (ER) pattern characterized by J-point elevation, slurring of the terminal part of the QRS, and ST-segment elevation has long been recognized and considered to be totally benign. Recent studies have presented evidence demonstrating that an ER pattern in inferior leads or inferolateral leads is associated with increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias, named early repolarization syndrome. Early repolarization syndrome and Brugada syndrome share similar electrocardiographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, risk factors, as well as a common arrhythmic platform related to amplification of I-to-mediated J waves. Although Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome differ with respect to the magnitude and lead location of abnormal J wave manifestation, they can be considered to represent a continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression, termed J-wave syndromes. Early repolarization syndrome has been proposed to be divided into 3 subtypes: type 1, displaying an ER pattern predominantly in the lateral precordial leads, is prevalent among healthy male athletes and rarely seen in ventricular fibrillation survivors; type 2, displaying an ER pattern predominantly in the inferior or inferolateral leads, is associated with a higher level of risk; whereas type 3, displaying an ER pattern globally in the inferior, lateral, and right precordial leads, is associated with the highest level of risk for development of malignant arrhythmias and is often associated with ventricular fibrillation storms.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,"Multimodal approaches supporting the diagnosis, prognosis and investigation of neural correlates of disorders of consciousness: A systematic review","The limits of the standard, behaviour-based clinical assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) prompted the employment of functional neuroimaging, neurometabolic, neurophysiological and neurostimulation techniques, to detect brain-based covert markers of awareness. However, uni-modal approaches, consisting in employing just one of those techniques, are usually not sufficient to provide an exhaustive exploration of the neural underpinnings of residual awareness. This systematic review aimed at collecting the evidence from studies employing a multimodal approach, that is, combining more instruments to complement DoC diagnosis, prognosis and better investigating their neural correlates. Following the PRISMA guidelines, records from PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus were screened to select peer-review original articles in which a multi-modal approach was used for the assessment of adult patients with a diagnosis of DoC. Ninety-two observational studies and 32 case reports or case series met the inclusion criteria. Results highlighted a diagnostic and prognostic advantage of multi-modal approaches that involve electroencephalography-based (EEG-based) measurements together with neuroimaging or neurometabolic data or with neurostimulation.

A retrospective review revealed that 180 patients underwent EDT after traumatic arrest for penetrating injury between 2000 and 2005. All were deemed nonsalvageable by other resuscitation methods. Injury mechanism and location, signs of life (SOLs), initial cardiac rhythm, and presence of vital signs were analyzed. In total, 23 patients survived hospitalization neurologically intact. Compared to nonsurvivors, survivors more often suffered multiple stab wounds (21.7% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.001), presented with field (95.7% vs. 72.6%, p = 0.016) and ED (87.0% vs. 60.5%, p = 0.014) SOLs, had sustainable cardiac rhythms (sinus tachycardia, 43.5% vs. 10.2%, p = 0.001; normal sinus rhythm, 17.4% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.037), and had measurable vital signs (65.2% vs. 25.5%; p = 0.001). However, only 3 of 23 (13.0%) survivors had all survival predictors, and one survivor had none. Frequent predictors in survivors were field SOLs (95.7%), ED SOLs (87.0%), salvageable initial cardiac rhythms (78.3%), and obtainable vital signs (65.2%). Stabbing mechanism (30.4%) and cardiac injury location (30.4%) were least common. Had a strict policy of EDT performance based solely on the presence of survival predictors been followed and EDT withheld, several patients who ultimately survived would have died.

Key treatment measures, including injury assessments, early triage, timing of surgeries, hospital stay duration, and complications, were systematically collected and analyzed.Results The explosion resulted in 16 fatalities at the scene and 10 survivors, all of whom received prompt triage, classification, transportation, and effective treatment. Among the survivors, two were male and eight were female, aged 26-50 years, with an average age of 39 years. The on-site mortality rate was 61.5%. Among the survivors, one patient with severe traumatic brain injury died 11 days post-incident despite medical intervention, while another was rehospitalized due to the recurrence of a pre-existing chronic condition. Three patients experienced varying degrees of hearing loss upon discharge, with one also reporting intermittent tinnitus. Four patients showed improvement and were discharged.Conclusion The on-site mortality rate in mass casualties from major explosions is extremely high, and the injuries are often complex. Current early triage methods are limited and overly simplistic. The incidence of pulmonary injuries is high in explosive accidents, with rapid disease progression and elevated mortality.

This first in-human study evaluated the safety and tolerability of an intranasal TMD, which delivers thermoelectrically temperature-regulated air via a nasal cannula to affect the core temperature. Five healthy, awake adult volunteers (median age 34 years old, 57.1% men) underwent intranasal cooling with 5 degrees C cooled air delivered at flow rates between 15 and 58 liters per minute. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The reduction in core body temperature was recorded using an esophageal temperature probe. No pharmacological agents or sedatives were administered to the patient. All participants exhibited a consistent downward trend in core body temperature, with an average reduction of 0.7 degrees C at 30 minutes and 1.2 degrees C at 60 minutes. Notably, no shivering or adverse events related to the intranasal TMD were reported. Cooling was well-tolerated, with esophageal probe placement being the only limiting factor for full protocol completion in some subjects. Participants remained fully conscious and communicative throughout the therapy. This intranasal TMD achieved clinically relevant core cooling without triggering shivering or requiring sedation, thereby addressing the key barriers associated with traditional TMDs. These promising early results support further investigation of this intranasal TMD in patients with acute neurological injury.

We analysed the available data of 272 patients extracted from the 153 included studies to summarize the natural history of Lance-Adams syndrome, outline the full spectrum of this disorder and deepen our understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Two-thirds of patients suffered from a respiratory hypoxic leading event. The main causes of anoxia were peri-surgery and anaesthetic accidents, asthma attacks/bronchospasm, cardiac disorders and intoxications/drug overdoses. Many patients exhibited a 'pure' Lance-Adams syndrome, characterized by multi-focal action-induced myoclonic jerks predominant to distal limbs. Morphologic brain imaging did not show any specific abnormalities. Neurophysiological evaluations, including EEG recordings, polymyography of myoclonus and jerk-locked back averaging of myoclonus, revealed features of cortical myoclonus in the majority of patients. Both EEG, showing epileptiform discharges on the frontal and central median regions, and brain metabolism imaging, showing hypometabolism on the pericentral regions, indicated that myoclonus in Lance-Adams syndrome originates within the motor cortex.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,DAMAGE CONTROL - AN APPROACH FOR IMPROVED SURVIVAL IN EXSANGUINATING PENETRATING ABDOMINAL INJURY,"Definitive laparotomy (DL) for penetrating abdominal wounding with combined vascular and visceral injury is a difficult surgical challenge. Physiologic derangements such as dilutional coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis often preclude completion of the procedure. ''Damage control'' (DC), defined as initial control of hemorrhage and contamination followed by intraperitoneal packing and rapid closure, allows for resuscitation to normal physiology in the intensive care unit and subsequent definitive re-exploration. The purpose of the study was to compare the damage control technique with definitive laparotomy. Over a 3 1/2-year period, 46 patients with penetrating abdominal injuries required laparotomy and urgent transfusion of greater than 10 units packed red blood cells for exsanguination. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for degree and pattern of injury, probability of survival, actual survival, transfusion requirements for the preoperative and postoperative phases, resuscitation and operative times, lowest perioperative temperature, pH, and HCO3. No significant differences were identified between 22 DL and 24 DC patients and actual survival rates were similar (55% DC vs. 58% DL). However, in a subset of 22 patients with major vascular injury and two or more visceral injuries (maximum injury subset), otherwise similar to the overall group, survival was markedly improved in patients treated with damage control (10 of 13, 77%*) vs. DLM (1 of 9, 11%) (Fisher's exact test, * p < 0.02). In preparation for return to the operating room, DC survivors averaged 8.4 units of packed red blood cells transfused and 10.3 units fresh frozen plasma over a mean ICU stay of 31.7 hours. Resolution of coagulopathy (mean prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time 19.5/, 70.4 to 13.3/34.9), normalization of acid-base balance (mean pH/HCO3 7.37/20.6 to 7.42/24.2), and core rewarming (mean 33.2-degrees-C to 37.7-degrees-C) were achieved. All patients had gastrointestinal procedures at reoperation (mean operative time, 4.3 hours).

Relapse post-HCT is associated with poor prognosis; however, inpatient healthcare utilization of this population is unknown. Here we describe survival, intensity of healthcare utilization, and characteristics associated with high resource use at the end of life (EOL). Adult patients with AL/MDS who underwent HCT at a large regional referral center with subsequent relapse between 2005 and 2015 were included in this retrospective study. We compared the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients as well as healthcare utilization over 2 years postrelapse and at EOL by postrelapse disease-directed therapeutic interventions. We created a composite score for EOL healthcare utilization intensity by summing the presence of any of the following criteria: death in the hospital, use of chemotherapy, emergency department, hospitalization, intensive care unit, intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or hemodialysis in the last month of life. Higher scores indicate more intense healthcare use at EOL. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine variables (demographic characteristics, postrelapse treatment group, advance directives documentation, palliative care referral, time to relapse) associated with EOL healthcare utilization intensity. One hundred fifty-four patients were included; median age at relapse was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 to 63), 55% were men, 79% had AL, and median time from HCT to relapse was 6 months (IQR, 3 to 10). After relapse, 28% received supportive care only, 50% received chemotherapy only, and 22% received chemotherapy plus cell therapy (either donor lymphocyte infusion, second HCT, or donor lymphocyte infusion plus second HCT). With the exception of time until relapse and Karnofsky Performance Status, baseline characteristics (gender, age, race, graft-versus-host disease, year of treatment) did not significantly differ by postrelapse treatment group. One hundred thirty-six patients (88%) died within 2 years of relapse; survival differed significantly by postrelapse treatment group, with those receiving disease-directed treatment showing lower risk of death. Healthcare use in AL/MDS patients after post-HCT relapse was high overall, with 44% visiting the emergency department at least once (22% at least 2 times), 93% hospitalized (55% at least 2 times, 16% at least 5 times), and 38% using the intensive care unit (median length of stay 5, days; IQR, 3 to 10). Use was high even among those receiving only supportive care. For those patients who died, the mean intensity score for EOL healthcare use was 1.8 (standard deviation, 1.8). Most patients (70%) had a marker of high-intensity healthcare utilization at the EOL or died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, an increase in age (estimate -.03 (95% CI, -.06 to -.003) and having AL versus MDS were significantly associated with a decreased EOL healthcare intensity score; no other variables were associated with intensity of EOL healthcare use. Healthcare utilization after post-HCT relapse is associated with receipt of disease-directed therapy but remains high across all groups despite known poor prognosis. Interventions are needed to minimize nonbeneficial treatments and promote goal-concordant EOL care in this seriously ill patient population.

Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammation of the arterial wall with coronary artery disease (CAD) that may lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which remains the main cause of death in developed countries. We believe that due to CAD development factors affecting the vessel wall, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may precipitate further advancement of future thromboembolic events by a plaque erosion or rupture. Therefore, this metanalysis aims to unambiguously establish the role of the history of CAD in mortality and severity of COVID-19 disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients with pre-existing CAD were shown to have a more severe course of COVID-19, but this association has not been clarified. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the association between CAD and COVID-19 outcomes. We searched Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to 2 November 2021. There were 62 studies with a total population of 49,286 patients included in the meta-analysis. CAD occurrence in survivor vs. non-survivor groups varied and amounted to 9.2% vs. 22.9%, respectively (OR = 0.33; 95%CI: 0.29 to 0.39; I-2 = 70%; p < 0.001). CAD was also associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease and was (10.8% vs. 5.6%, respectively, for severe vs. non-severe groups (OR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.59 to 3.27; I-2 = 72%; p < 0.001). The role of history of CAD in mortality and severe condition in COVID-19 presents itself as prominent-although a risk of bias in retrospective trials needs to be assessed, in case of our meta-analysis the statistically significant results when it comes to higher mortality among patients with CAD compared to non-CAD patients, a more severe condition observed in patients with CAD, and a visibly more frequent admission to intensive care unit in patients with CAD, it seems that an incidence of cardiovascular events plays a role in COVID-19 prognosis.",BIOLOGY-BASEL,2022,"Szarpak, L; Mierzejewska, M; Jurek, J; Kochanowska, A; Gasecka, A; Truszewski, Z; Pruc, M; Blek, N; Rafique, Z; Filipiak, KJ; Denegri, A; Jaguszewski, MJ",10.3390/biology11020221,,WOS:000762191300001,A

Illustrative case,"BACKGROUND Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) is a highly unstable injury of the osseoligamentous complex at the craniocervical junction that is more common in children. Its diagnosis remains a challenging process that must integrate clinical presentation and radiological criteria. OBSERVATIONS A 9-year-old child presented with severe craniocervical trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale score 6) and cardiorespiratory arrest on-site. Prompt resuscitation on-site and transfer to the university hospital were performed, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage around the brainstem and a retroclival hematoma. Most of the radiological criteria on CT scans for AOD were negative, except for the occipital condyle-C1 interval, and further imaging with magnetic resonance imaging permitted the diagnosis of AOD with rupture of both the tectorial membrane and the transverse ligament. Occipital-cervical Oc-C1-2 fixation was performed. The neurological outcome was excellent, with full recovery 6 months after the trauma. LESSONS AOD should be suspected in all high-intensity trauma in children, especially if the clinical presentation includes cardiorespiratory arrest and other brainstem and/or upper cervical cord symptoms along with premedullary subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In this study, the time of warm reversible ischemia in the canine intestine was explored. After this time was established, fluids and antibiotics were administered to note change in survival times. Massive intestinal ischemia (superior mesenteric artery was clamped) was tolerated without death for five hours (20 dogs in each group). With six hours of ischemia, a 10 per cent mortality rate occurred; with seven hours of ischemia, a 90% mortality rate occurred. These dogs had a maintenance of 75 milliliters of fluid administered per hour. Using this group of dogs as the control (that is, the group with seven hour clamping time of the superior mesenteric artery with maintenance intravenously administered replacement), fluids were given to dogs in the experimental group to keep the pulmonary artery wedge pressure at a normal value (average of 300 milliliters per hour).

In the second paper in this Series, we focus on the unique susceptibility of paediatric patients to sepsis and how the underlying dysregulated host response relates to developmental aspects of children's immune system, genetic, perinatal, and environmental factors, and comorbidities and socioeconomic determinants of health, which often differ between children and adults. State-of-the-art clinical management of paediatric sepsis is organised around three treatment pillars-diagnosis, early resuscitation, and titration of advanced care-and we examine available treatment guidelines and the limitations of their supporting evidence. Serious evidence gaps remain in key areas of paediatric sepsis care, especially surrounding recognition, common interventions, and survivor support, and to this end we offer a research roadmap for the next decade that could accelerate targeted diagnostics and personalised use of immunomodulation. However, improving outcomes for children with sepsis relies fundamentally on systematic quality improvement in both recognition and treatment, which is the theme of the third paper in this Series.

It has been reported that carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3) administration immediately after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR) ameliorated the HSR-induced cardiac dysfunctions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the application of CORM-3 on TBI exerted therapeutic effects against TBI-induced cardiac dysfunctions. Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12) including Sham, TBI, TBI/CORM-3 and TBI/inactive CORM-3 (iCORM-3) groups. TBI was established by a weight-drop model. The rats in the TBI/CORM-3 group and TBI/iCORM-3 group were intravenously injected with CORM-3 and iCORM-3 (4 mg/kg) following TBI, respectively. The time of death in the rats that did not survive within 24 h was recorded. 24 h post-trauma, the cardiac function, pathological change, serum troponin T and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels, pyroptosis, apoptosis and expressions of TUNEL staining, Gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-1 beta, IL-18, ratio Bax/Bcl-2 were assessed by echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, chemiluminescence, immunofluorescence, and western blot assays, respectively. TBI-treated rats exhibited dramatically decreased ejection fraction and aggravated myocardial injury, increased mortality rate, elevated levels of serum troponin T and CK-MB, promoted cardiac pyroptosis and apoptosis, and upregulated expressions of cleaved caspase-3, GSDMD N-terminal fragments, IL-1 beta, IL-18, and ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, whereas CORM-3 partially reversed these changes.

Nurses are central to many aspects of a burn survivor's care, including physiologic monitoring, fluid resuscitation, pain management, infection prevention, complex wound care, and rehabilitation. Research suggests that in general, hospital nursing resources, defined as nurse staffing and the quality of the work environment, relate to patient mortality. Still, the relationship between those resources and burn mortality has not been previously examined. This study used a multivariable risk-adjusted regression model and a linked, cross-sectional claims database of more than 14,000 adults (=18 years) thermal burn patients admitted to 653 hospitals to evaluate these relationships. Hospital nursing resources were independently reported by more than 29,000 bedside nurses working in the study hospitals. In the high burn patient-volume hospitals (=100/y) that care for the most severe burn injuries, each additional patient added to a nurse's workload is associated with 30% higher odds of mortality (P <.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.94), and improving the work environment is associated with 28% lower odds of death (P <.05, 95% CI: 0.07-0.99). Nursing resources are vital in the care of burn patients and are a critical, yet previously omitted, variable in the evaluation of burn outcomes. Attention to nurse staffing and improvement to the nurse work environment is warranted to promote optimal recovery for burn survivors.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,"Oxidized High-Density Lipoprotein Induces Endothelial Fibrosis Promoting Hyperpermeability, Hypotension, and Increased Mortality","During systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the bloodstream, producing large amounts of oxidized HDL (oxHDL). OxHDL loses the vascular protective features of native HDL, acquiring detrimental actions. Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial fibrosis, characterized by adhesion protein downregulation and fibrotic-specific gene upregulation, disrupting endothelial monolayer integrity. Severe systemic inflammatory conditions, as found in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), exhibit endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and organ hypoperfusion, promoting organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Because endothelial fibrosis disturbs the endothelium, it is proposed that it is the cellular and molecular origin of endothelial hyperpermeability and the subsequent deleterious consequences. However, whether oxHDL is involved in this process is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the fibrotic effect of oxHDL on the endothelium, to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism, and to determine its effects on vascular permeability, blood pressure, and mortality. The results showed that oxHDL induces endothelial fibrosis through the LOX-1/NOX-2/ROS/NF-kappa B pathway, TGF-beta secretion, and ALK-5/Smad activation. OxHDL-treated rats showed endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and an enhanced risk of death and mortality, which was prevented using an ALK-5 inhibitor and antioxidant diet consumption. Additionally, the ICU patients showed fibrotic endothelial cells, and the resuscitation fluid volume administered correlated with the plasma oxHDL levels associated with an elevated risk of death and mortality.

Our main objective was to investigate if the ability to achieve a negative fluid balance during the first 3 continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) days was associated with mortality in children with MOF. Methods Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary multidisciplinary academic paediatric hospital. The study included 63 patients (age 0-18 years) with 3 or more failing organs receiving CRRT due to acute kidney injury and/or fluid overload. Results The median age was 4 months, and PICU mortality was 29%. Survivors had significantly lower degree of FO at CRRT initiation, (median 15% (Interquartile range 9-22)) than non-survivors (24% (17%-37%), P = 0.002). On PICU admission, PIM-3 score was significantly higher in non-survivors (P = 0.01), but at CRRT initiation there was no difference in PELOD-2 score (P = 0.98). Mortality in patients achieving a cumulative net negative fluid balance during the first 3 days after CRRT initiation was 12%, compared to 86% in those not achieving this (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the inability to achieve a net negative fluid balance during 3 days after CRRT initiation (P < 0.0001) and FO >20% at CRRT initiation (P = 0.0019) remained associated with mortality.

We aimed to investigate the utility of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) for the early detection of septic shock and to evaluate its accuracy in predicting mortality. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED), enrolling patients diagnosed with the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. In addition to assessing infection biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, suPAR levels were quantified upon admission using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Results: Overall 72 patients and 80 healthy children included. Plasma suPAR levels demonstrated a statistically significant elevation in the sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups compared with the control group (p < 0.001 for all). The septic shock group exhibited the highest suPAR levels upon admission, surpassing both the sepsis and severe sepsis groups (p = 0.009 and 0.042). ROC analysis underscored the promising potential of suPAR with an AUC of 0.832 for septic shock. Analysis of mortality prediction revealed significantly higher suPAR levels in nonsurvivors than survivors (9.7 ng/mL vs. 4.2 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Employing plasma suPAR levels to discriminate between mortality and survival, a threshold of >= 7.0 ng/mL demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 71.0%.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from the Israel Defense Forces Trauma Registry. The cohort included 3253 urgent battlefield casualties who sustained limb injuries and were treated by IDF medical forces between October 27th, 2023 and October 31st, 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were anatomical distribution of amputations, mechanism of injury, application of life-saving interventions (tourniquet, whole blood, freeze-dried plasma), and survival on the way to hospital admission and during hospitalization. Results: Of 3253 casualties, 135 (4.2 %) were initially recorded as having amputations. After review, 112 cases were confirmed to involve at least one amputated limb. Explosive devices were the leading cause of injury among amputees (88.9 %). Among the 112 confirmed cases, 50 (44.6 %) survived until hospital admission, and 62 (55.4 %) were pronounced dead prior to hospital arrival; 4 of the survivors died during hospitalization. Tourniquets were applied in 90 % of survivors compared to 24.2 % of deceased (p < 0.001).

The most severe presentation, called purpura fulminans, has a death rate of 20-25%; 5 to 20% of the survivors need skin grafts and/or amputations. Diagnosis of invasive meningococcal infection is very difficult when purpura and ""toxic"" appearance are absent. one should take into account parents' impression of their ill child. This diagnosis must be evoked in any child presenting with febrile purpura (like in the United Kingdom, parents should be encouraged to use the ""tumbler test"" to identify a vasculitic rash); a fulminant form is to be suspected in the presence of only one ecchymosis and signs of infection, remembering that recognition of shock is difficult in children. Recently, the Health Authority has recommended to administer a third generation cephalosporin promptly (before biological investigations) for any child with signs of infection and a necrotic or ecchymotic purpura (> 3 mm of diameter), and then to refer the patient to the hospital. By grouping the patients from 7 studies, it can be observed that preadmission antibiotic administration has a protective effect on mortality (odds ratio: 0.36; 95% confidence interval. 0.23-0.56); a negative effect was observed in only one of these series. Children with purpura fulminans should be referred to a paediatric intensive care unit. Management includes antibiotics, steroids, fluid resuscitation and catecholamines (be aware of hypoglycaemia, particularly in infants, and hypocalcaemia). Treatment of cutaneous necrosis and distal ischemia is difficult and still controversial: antithrombin, protein C, tissue plasminogen activator and vasodilator infusion have no proven efficacy. Cases must be rapidly notified to the Public Health Service who will institute chemoprophylaxis for close contacts. Given the predominance of serogroup B in France, we hope that an efficient vaccine will soon become available.

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Experiences of Alaska Native people living with burn injury and opportunities for health system strengthening,"BackgroundInjuries are a leading cause of death and disability for Alaska Native (AN) people. Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) is supporting the development of a burn care system that includes a partnership between Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) in Anchorage, AK and UW Medicine Regional Burn Center at Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in Seattle, WA. We aimed to better understand the experiences of AN people with burn injuries across the care continuum to aid development of culturally appropriate care regionalization.MethodsWe performed focus groups with twelve AN people with burn injury and their caregivers. A multidisciplinary team of burn care providers, qualitative research experts, AN care coordinator, and AN cultural liaison led focus groups to elicit experiences across the burn care continuum. Transcripts were analyzed using a phenomenological approach and inductive coding to understand how AN people and families navigated the medical and community systems for burn care and areas for improvement.ResultsThree themes were identified: 1-Challenges with local burn care in remote communities including limited first aid, triage, pain management, and wound care, as well as long-distance transport to definitive care; 2-Divergence between cultural values and medical practices that generated mistrust in the medical system, isolation from their support systems, and recovery goals that were not aligned with their needs; 3-Difficulty accessing emotional health support and a survivor community that could empower their resilience.ConclusionParticipants reported modifiable barriers to culturally competent treatment for burn injuries among AN people. The findings can inform initiatives that leverage existing resources, including expansion of the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) telementoring program, promulgation of the Phoenix Society Survivors Offering Assistance in Recovery (SOAR) to AK, coordination of regionalized care to reduce time away from AK and provide more comfortable community reintegration, and define rehabilitation goals in terms that align with personal goals and subsistence lifestyle skills. Long-distance transport times are non-modifiable, but better pre-hospital care could be achieved by harnessing existing telehealth services and adapting principles of prolonged field care to allow for triage, initial care, and resuscitation in remote environments.",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2023,"Smith, MB; Brownson, E; Newman, AK; Madison, C; Fuentes, M; Amtmann, D; Carrougher, GJ; Gibran, NS; Stewart, BT",10.1186/s12913-023-10243-x,,WOS:001102634200006,A
wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Emergency thoracotomy: Appropriate use in the resuscitation of trauma patients,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of emergency thoracotomy in our institution in an effort to determine whether this procedure is both beneficial and cost effective in blunt and/or penetrating trauma. We conducted a retrospective review of charts and coroner's reports. Our setting was a Level I trauma center in a tertiary-care facility. We examined the cases of trauma patients presenting to the trauma center over a 2-year period. Of 2490 patients who presented to the emergency department over the study period 41 underwent early thoracotomy. Twelve of these were excluded from the study because their cases were not truly emergent. Of the remaining 29 ten were admitted for penetrating injuries and 19 for blunt injuries. The average Injury Severity Scores for penetrating and blunt injuries were 30 and 40 respectively. There were four blunt trauma patients who died in the emergency department, 15 went to the operating room, and five who survived to go to the intensive care unit. All blunt trauma patients requiring emergency thoracotomy died within 9 days of presentation. Of the ten penetrating wound patients two died in the emergency department, four died in the operating room, and four went to the intensive care unit after surgery. One of the four patients who went to the intensive care unit died approximately 6 days after injury. The other three patients survived and are now living normal productive lives. All survivors of penetrating trauma who required emergency thoracotomy had their procedure performed in the operating room. Overall survival rates for penetrating and blunt trauma were 30 and 0 per cent respectively. Pericardial tamponade was found in 50 per cent of the penetrating trauma patients (two of the three survivors) and four of 19 of the blunt trauma patients. This reinforces the importance of a prompt pericardiotomy upon opening the chest. At our institution the algorithm for emergency thoracotomy is liberal and is not cost effective for blunt trauma. We need to re-evaluate our decision-making process concerning the use of emergency thoracotomy especially in the blunt trauma patient. The review also shows the importance of pericardiotomy when performing an emergency thoracotomy.",AMERICAN SURGEON,2002,"Grove, CA; Lemmon, G; Anderson, G; McCarthy, M",,,WOS:000174684800001,A
wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Prospective evaluation of regional oxygen saturation to estimate central venous saturation in sepsis,"Current treatment guidelines for sepsis claim an early goal-directed hemodynamic optimization including fluid resuscitation, use of vasopressors and inotropic agents. We investigated the correlation between the prominent treatment goal central venous saturation (ScvO(2)) and the frontal and the thenar regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Secondary, we examined the value of ScvO(2), lactate levels and rSO(2) as surrogate markers of an impaired tissue oxygenation for outcome prediction in sepsis. This prospective, observational study was performed at the surgical intensive care unit of the University Hospital Giessen. A total of 50 patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock were included. ScvO(2), rSO(2) and lactate were measured at sepsis diagnosis (baseline), 24 and 48 h, thereafter. We investigated the predictive value of frontal and thenar rSO(2) for a decreased SvcO(2) under 70 %. For survivor and non-survivors ScvO(2), rSO(2) and lactate were analysed. Patients with ScvO(2) > 70 % showed a trend to higher levels of fontal rSO(2) (62.81 +/- A 8.06 vs. 53.54 +/- A 15.48; p = 0.058). ROC-analysis revealed a minor prediction of a decreased ScvO(2) by frontal rSO(2) levels at baseline (AUC = 0.687; 95 % CI 0.511-0.863; p = 0.047). Combined measurements of lactate and ScvO2 showed significantly elevated mortality for patients with ScvO2 a parts per thousand yen70 % and lactate levels a parts per thousand yen2.5 mmol/l (log rank test p = 0.004). In the group with ScvO(2) < 70 % and lactate levels < 2.5 mmol/l no patients died during the observation period. Frontal rSO(2) correlates with ScvO(2) but both frontal and thenar rSO2 do not exactly discriminate between patients with high or low ScvO2 in sepsis. The combination of elevated lactate > 2.5 mmol/l and ScvO(2) > 70 % is highly associated with poor outcome in ICU patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock.",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING,2015,"Koch, C; Röhrig, R; Monz, T; Hecker, A; Uhle, F; Schneck, E; Weigand, MA; Lichtenstern, C",10.1007/s10877-015-9683-x,,WOS:000357127800005,A

wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Evaluating the clinical impact of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta in patients with blunt trauma with hemorrhagic shock and coexisting traumatic brain injuries: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: The impact of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) on traumatic brain injuries remains uncertain, with potential outcomes ranging from neuroprotection to exacerbation of the injury. The study aimed to evaluate consciousness recovery in patients with blunt trauma, shock, and traumatic brain injuries. Material and methods: Data were obtained from the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program from 2017 to 2019. During the study period, 3 138 896 trauma registries were examined, and 16 016 adult patients with blunt trauma, shock, and traumatic brain injuries were included. Among these, 176 (1.1%) underwent REBOA. Comparisons were conducted between patients with and without REBOA after implementing 1:3 propensity score matching to mitigate disparities. The primary outcome was the highest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score during admission. The secondary outcomes encompassed the volume of blood transfusion, the necessity for hemostatic interventions and therapeutic neurosurgery, and the mortality rate. Results: Through well-balanced propensity score matching, a notable difference in mortality rate was observed, with 59.7% in the REBOA group and 48.7% in the non-REBOA group (P=0.015). In the REBOA group, the median 4 h red blood cell transfusion was significantly higher (2800 ml [1500-4908] vs. 1300 ml [600-2500], P<0.001). The REBOA group required lesser hemorrhagic control surgeries (31.8 vs. 47.7%, P<0.001). The incidence of therapeutic neurosurgery was 5.1% in the REBOA group and 8.7% in the non-REBOA group (P=0.168). Among survivors in the REBOA group, the median highest GCS score during admission was significantly greater for both total (11 [8-14] vs. 9 [6-14], P=0.036) and motor components (6 [4-6] vs. 5 [4-6], P=0.037). The highest GCS score among the survivors with predominant pelvic injuries was not different between the two groups (11 [8-13] vs. 11 [7-14], P=0.750). Conclusions: Patients experiencing shock and traumatic brain injury have high mortality rates, necessitating swift resuscitation and prompt hemorrhagic control. The use of REBOA as an adjunct for bridging definitive hemorrhagic control may correlate with enhanced consciousness recovery.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY,2024,"Hsu, CP; Liao, CA; Wang, CC; Huang, JF; Cheng, CT; Chen, SA; Tee, YS; Kuo, LW; Yang, CHO; Liao, CH; Fu, CY",10.1097/JS9.0000000000001823,,WOS:001339288600035,A
wos,WoS-queryA4.ris,JOUR,Coagulation dysfunction of severe burn patients: A potential cause of death,"Background: Research on coagulation dysfunction following burns is controversial. This study aimed to describe the coagulation changes in severe burn patients by examining coagulation parameters.Methods: Patients with third-degree total body surface area (TBSA) burns of >= 30% were enrolled between 2017 and 2020. Platelet (PLT) count and coagulation indexes (including APTT, INR, FIB, DD, and AT III) were measured at admission and once weekly for 8 weeks, and statistical analysis was performed. The patient medical profiles were reviewed to ex-tract demographic and clinical data, including TBSA, third-degree TBSA, and inhalation injury. The total intravenous fluids and transfusions of crystalloids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and red blood cells (RBC) were calculated during the forty-eight-hour period. The number of sepsis cases was recorded.Results: We enrolled 104 patients , and while the overall coagulation trend fluctuated, in-flection points appeared around one week and demonstrated hypercoagulability. INR was significantly higher in the non-survival group than in the survivors' group from admission to three weeks after burn (all p < 0.01). From post-injury week 1 to post-injury week 3, the APTT in the non-survival group was greater than in the survival group, but the non-survival group's PLT count was lower than that in the survival group (all p < 0.05). At two and three weeks after burns, the FIB levels in the non-survival group were significantly lower than those of the survival group (both p < 0.01). The prevalence of inhalation injury and the proportion of sepsis cases were significantly higher in the non-survival group than in the survival group ( p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). At the time of death, APTT, INR, and FDP levels were significantly higher in the non-survival group in the survivor group, and FIB, ATIII, and PLT were significantly lower than in the survivor group (all p < 0.01). On the day of death, nine of the 12 dead patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).Conclusions: Coagulation dysfunction was most prominent in severe burn patients 1 week after injury and presented as hypercoagulability. Large-area burn injury, large amounts of fluid resuscitation, inhalation injury, and sepsis may all contribute to coagulation dys-function, which can further develop into DIC and even death in severe burns patients.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.
